  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between greenhouse decay and stellar erosion, avoiding explicit moralizing until "her pursuit felt authentic." The butterfly dust preprocessing reality becomes a non-literal answer to seeing truth without imposed drama, though "patient rhythm" edges toward stating rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of finding "purpose in the pauses" emerges organically through frost patterns that mirror artistic veins in glass, transforming from aesthetic observation to survival tool. The final image of art that will "resonate like the land itself, steady and unyielding" offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete transformation of trauma into art, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image—"music of the soul" amidst exterior silence—offers resonant answer to how humans persist after catastrophe. The tuning fork becomes genuine motif, not token symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of finding rest by embracing unrest, with the lighthouse lens serving as both literal tool and metaphor for guidance. The final image of Elias joining "the hush he had so long pursued" resonantly reweights the entire quest without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of collective resistance through intergenerational solidarity emerges organically through concrete acts—elders' arthritic hands persisting, youth learning paths, the bell's transformation from festival caller to resistance symbol. The ending's non-literal answer—formalized pacts replacing shadows—reweights all prior anonymous donations as rehearsal for open defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through the concept of "unused love" stored in "pauses between breaths," with the camera obscura projecting inner truths. The final image of love releasing as "eternal breath" resonates without explicit moralizing, though the past-life framework feels somewhat imposed rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of time's erosion emerges through concrete imagery (fading photographs, living bridges aging) and culminates in Elias physically experiencing time's varied textures. The final image of him "forever changed" offers a non-literal answer to whether time can be truly felt, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement ("the texture of time: rough like bark in moments of joy").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of resilience emerging from oppression develops organically through concrete actions—from the hidden cipher to the seed planting. The final image of planting seeds in dry soil offers a non-literal answer to division's aftermath. Some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement but avoid full moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of absence and betrayal emerges through concrete details like "collecting absences: the voids where sounds should have been." The device that resurrects "the intangible" offers a non-literal answer to processing betrayal. However, the explicit thematic statement "memories' impact wasn't destruction, but a forge for resilience" arrives too tidily, and the concept feels somewhat mechanical rather than emotionally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of theft into guardianship, with the portrait's dual nature (golden-hour warmth meeting moonlight) creating resonance. The flower language and destiny motifs interweave effectively without explicit moralizing. However, the ending's "guardian of illuminated moments" edges toward thematic declaration, and the wisdom feels given rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The thawing metaphor earns its resonance through parallel tracks—ice melting physically while Elias's frozen grief dissolves—culminating in his "heart thawed and light" departure. The bookmark discovery reweights past debates about "creating spaces for unbridled curiosity," though the final paragraph edges toward explicit theme statement with "ready to blow new sanctuaries."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of vulnerability-as-strength emerges through Elara's navigation of phobias and betrayal, culminating in her using exposure rather than concealment as her weapon. The seashell's whispers create a motif of hidden truths. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("vulnerability, embraced, was power incarnate"), replacing resonance with declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The concept of "summarizing silence" as cartography offers thematic richness, with silence becoming a medium for mapping darkness. The ending's "silent testament" resonates with the oracle tradition, though the theme would strengthen if the cost of choosing silence over speech were dramatized rather than merely implied.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the ice violin's transparency revealing "timelines branching like veins in marble," suggesting thoughts arise from "the ordinary colliding with the overlooked mystical." The ending reweights sweeping from drudgery to "portal for mundane mysticism." The insight that thoughts come "from everywhere and nowhere, amalgamated through the loops of existence" resonates without moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the doodle exchange—frozen lakes cracking, melting bridges forming—without explicit moralizing. The lens motif effectively reweights perception and truth throughout. The final image of "connection—a quiet registrar no longer alone" resonates without stating its thesis, though "freed by honesty" appears somewhat mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the tension between quantified luck and organic reciprocity, with the marble collection serving as "talismans of mended deceptions." The final image of Elias walking while the garden "bloomed where he walked, withered where he paused" offers a non-literal answer about faith versus measurement. The story resists easy moralizing about technology versus nature.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of time's lateral flow emerges through the holographic demonstration and symbiote behavior, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of "sideways eternity" offers resonance but lacks emotional or human complexity. The scientific discovery doesn't reweight human experience or relationships, remaining in the realm of abstract concept.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of decay and persistence, silence and voice, past and present. The "hush of unstruck chords" and "in-between spaces" create resonance without explicit moralizing. Isabella's story of "a love betrayed, a voice forever silenced" provides concrete particularity to the abstract concept of artistic haunting, and the final image of the opera house "holding its breath" offers non-literal closure to the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of accepting uncertainty by "occupying margins" emerges through Mira's method and the smudged illustration metaphor. However, Mira's direct articulation of the theme ("Your truth...weighs heavy because you've let it settle in the center, not the edges") tends toward explicit moralizing rather than allowing the image to carry meaning alone.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of suppressed industrial guilt emerges organically through concrete details - the valve wheel as "frozen tears," the ghost shift's "endless labor." The parallel structure between Elias's and the ghost's buried truths creates resonance without stating a moral. The final image of the valve wheel as "talisman of shared folly" reweights prior material effectively, though the confession's directness ("I turned that valve wrong") edges toward over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast of "crumbling peace" and "regenerative silence," with the swan serving as bridge between decay and renewal. The final image of the keeper "loosely held yet profoundly real" offers resonant answer to questions of permanence without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding magic in ordinary endurance emerges through sage roots, eclipse shadows, and shared grief, though "ordinary magic" appears too explicitly five times. The curl as talisman and harmonica as connection tool work thematically. The ending image of Theo's quickening steps with "exuberance budding cautiously" resonates but the piece over-articulates its central metaphor rather than letting it emerge purely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between Elowen and the medieval scholar, both seeking to mend displacement through collected stories. The tapestry's dragons "mourning a tilt toward chaos" provides resonant imagery without forcing allegory. The final reframing from restoration to dreaming anew offers genuine thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of "open secrets" emerges through the island's culture where "everyone knew everyone's business but pretended otherwise," and the microdots literally embed hidden truths. The accidentally prophetic fortunes suggest fate's mysterious workings. However, the ending states rather than dramatizes the thematic resolution ("lives transposing in harmony"), missing the resonant non-literal answer that would elevate the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong thematic integration of silence as resistance and the power of focused simplicity (one color) versus multiplicity's distraction. The concept that "unraveled stillness was not end, but the space where truth plumbed deepest" provides genuine resonance without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conductor/symphony metaphor coheres with the chronological homesickness theme, and the mirrored lake reflects the temporal doubling. The nautilus-as-memory-map offers resonant specificity. However, the final triumph feels unearned—no concrete loss or sacrifice accompanies the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.3)
    The fractured timeline concept emerges through concrete labyrinth navigation but resolution relies on abstract fusion rather than earned integration. "The labyrinth was her own creation" attempts thematic reversal but arrives without groundwork. The ending image of being "whole at last in the periodically eternal now" gestures at theme but doesn't reweight prior material with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "filament of hush" concept elegantly threads through the story as both literal silence and metaphorical emotional void, culminating in the paradox of silence creating feeling. The theme emerges organically through concrete action rather than statement. The final image of Elara's world "no longer audibly muted, but alive with quiet fire" resonantly reweights the opening without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges through the tension between solitude and integrity, with the pigeon serving as bridge between isolation and connection. The final image of stepping inside with the message tube "a talisman against the gathering night" resonates without stating a moral. Subtext operates well in Elias's lateral thinking and the coded warning, though the "nurture integrity" phrasing occasionally veers toward thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of extinction/revival, memory/loss, and professional/personal boundaries. The final insight about scents as "bridges to the raw essence of loss" resonates without moralizing. The recurring crystal shadows and UV revelation create meaningful pattern. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract articulation of theme in the penultimate sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of freedom versus binding, temporal texture versus linear progression emerges through the rope symbolism and grotto patterns. However, heavy-handed phrases like "ethically playful" and "passionate subtlety" feel like prompt-echo insertions rather than organic thematic development. The final image of dropping the rope aims for ambiguity but reads as avoidance rather than resonant complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "unfinished beauties" manifested in cut-short stories, incomplete melodies, and the ripples that "unbind stillness." The ending image of stories "unfinished yet eternally alive" offers a non-literal answer to loss without stating a moral. The bowl as vessel for incomplete tales creates resonant subtext about preservation through sharing.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    The half-truth concept elegantly structures the piece, with Elara's counterfeit emotions revealed as "fragments of truth, waiting to be whole," paying off in her transformation from dealer of simulations to practitioner of genuine empathy. The static electricity motif effectively embodies the theme of authenticity versus artifice. The ending avoids explicit moralizing, letting the transformation speak through image and sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of "cycles of compassion" emerges organically through the inherited archive and partnership formation. The locket effectively symbolizes generational giving. Slightly heavy-handed with "compassion's cycle" explicitly stated multiple times rather than fully trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    The webs of kinship theme emerges organically through action—the search, the tag's discovery, Elara's reed-weaving—culminating in her literal grafting onto community. The final dedication ceremony resonates without explicit moralizing, though the theme occasionally surfaces too directly in dialogue ("It spoke of our webs").

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the infinity symbol's literal binding and the paradox of capturing echoes requiring one to become echo-bound. The final image of Elara's work echoing "through Aetheria's towers forever" resonates without stating a moral. The story explores artistic legacy through concrete magical mechanics rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the mathematical metaphor of emotion as "variables" and "equations," with loss becoming "not erasure but a new term." The dovetailing image—interlocking yet separate—resonates with the grief theme, though the final paragraph edges toward explicit thematic statement with "understanding, even partial, could dovetail grief into grace."

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tape fragment elegantly bridges themes of recorded permanence versus ephemeral connection, with Elias's father's voice-acting past recontextualizing his son's present choice to become visible. The final shared silence where "he became visible" offers a non-literal answer to the isolation/connection question through concrete action rather than statement. Subtext operates cleanly through the cached objects as tokens of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through the tension between control and surrender, study versus immersion. The transformation literalizes the scientific impulse to understand from within. However, phrases like "bridge the gap" and "letting go, we both find what we've been growing toward" edge toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the convergence metaphor—isolated survival versus shared meaning-making. The brooch symbolizes preserved history demanding exchange, and the final insight ("meaning emerged not in solitude, but in earnest exchanges") resonates without moralizing, though slightly explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of sight versus blindness emerges through Elara's failed clairvoyance—she who sees all futures cannot see her own fate. The cave pearl and shadows work as concrete vehicles for this idea. However, the exploration stays somewhat surface-level; the story tells us about "amplified wonders" but doesn't fully dramatize the moral complexity of forced benevolence through possession.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "navigated absences"—gaps in history that reveal resilience when properly compiled. The trumpet valve's transformation from silenced voice to resonant connector avoids explicit moralizing, letting the image carry meaning. The final vision of "reunited families, mended sails, futures reclaimed" offers a non-literal answer to how fragmented communities heal, though the resolution tends slightly toward the tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through the journey from hidden signs to revealed truths, with the crack-following literalizing the search for fractures in family history. The final image of finding one's "true map...etched in the cracks of destiny" resonates without stating a moral. Deduction for some thematic echoing in "Fortress of Unspoken Truths" which reads prompt-like, and the slightly neat resolution of complex family trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of skepticism/openness, isolation/connection, and forgotten patterns rediscovered. The magic square as "loom" weaving memory threads avoids heavy-handedness. Minor deduction for the slightly overexplicit final paragraph wisdom about "patterns that connected us all," though it stops short of full moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transformation versus stasis emerges organically through Elowen's journey from boredom to purpose, with the vision revealing "not darkness, but a vast, luminous hush where echoes reformed." The recurring "hushed thunder" motif charges the ending, though the resolution tends toward abstraction ("quiet revolution of the soul") rather than earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the mathematics metaphor and the transformation of con artistry into "calculated honesty." The final formula offers a non-literal answer that reweights Marco from pure deceiver to survival strategist. Minor deduction for the formula being stated rather than fully dramatized through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of preserving/inventing histories against erasure emerges through setting and concept but relies heavily on abstract declaration ("textures of different times"). The final image of "gilded leaves promised a new, textured dawn" gestures toward renewal without earning it through dramatized struggle or specific loss.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through layered erasures—the wanderer's bureaucratic death, the migrant turned cargo manifest, the captain's fabricated legend—all exploring how identity persists despite official obliteration. The final image of "collector of whispers, survivor of ink's mistakes" offers a non-literal answer about existence beyond documentation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through the concrete interplay of myth-busting versus acceptance, with the shell's transformation from "skeptic's trinket" to "talisman" embodying the shift. The story offers a resonant answer about "seeking eternity in ephemera" through specific reimagined conversations rather than abstract philosophy. Final image of emerging stars with the "universal riddle lingering, unsolved yet illuminating" avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and adaptation, with the graffiti art serving as both literal communication and metaphor for hidden resistance. The phoenix mural and foundation chip carry symbolic weight that constrains choices. Final image of "reordered beacon" with "graffiti whispers etching legends" resonates without stating a moral, though some thematic articulation feels slightly overt.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the sand grain's endurance paralleling Elara's preservation mission. The final image of the archived photograph offers a non-literal answer about safeguarding the wild against progress. Strong subtext about human versus automated presence, though the "space age" critique occasionally surfaces too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of guidance despite blindness emerges organically through the water-refraction repair method and the drone's purpose to "scout paths through fog-shrouded routes." The final image of the drone as "a jewel in the calm dawn" reweights Elias's role as one who enables others' journeys.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of natural patterns and human cartography—condensation becomes "a natural cartography born of warmth against freeze." The ending offers resonant ambiguity about discovery's price without moralizing, and the recurring convergence motif (message, condensation, rivers) builds meaning without forced symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of community rebuilt through collective rhythm emerges organically from the concrete action of footsteps creating harmony. The cryptic riddle "What walks to wake the sleeping chime" integrates well. However, Elowen's statement "The fork sings of steps unspoken, to balance what the hush has broken" edges toward explicit theme statement, and "balance" becomes repetitive without deepening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of impermanence emerges through concrete particulars: the vial preserving "unspoken regrets," memories surfacing "like tides," the temple's "ephemeral grace." The final image of Elara with the vial as "talisman against the void" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for abstract phrases like "lonesome splendor" that occasionally approach theme-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of the "boy who cried wolf" fable into a meditation on truth, inheritance, and narrative power. The lattice as both divider and sustainer of confessions creates resonant subtext. The ending achieves thematic closure without moralizing, as Elias rows away with "his father's wolf long tamed into repose."

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges beautifully through the debt/betrayal/reunion arc without explicit moralizing. The bead as binding token and the "lovingly venomous" touch embody the paradox of destructive love. The final image of spirits dancing "elated in sorrow" offers resonant non-literal answer to whether redemption requires dissolution. Only slightly weakened by occasional abstraction ("resonant awakenings").

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.9)
    The weaving-as-connection theme emerges organically through Elara's literal stitching of paths that invite community. The storybook plate's image of "a weaver mending a world's frayed edges" provides resonant subtext without overstatement, and the final transformation reweights "broken precedents" effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of interrupted journeys emerges through accumulation of details (sundial, pottery shards, diaspora backstory) but resolves into explicit statement ("journeys no longer forever interrupted") rather than resonant image. The excavation-as-metaphor for faith recovery works conceptually but the final insight arrives through authorial declaration rather than earned realization.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the juxtaposition of analog chalk against digital infrastructure, exploring humanity's tactile soul versus technological progress. The recurring margin motif ("Find the poetry in what they ignore") resonates without explicit moralizing, though the piece could deepen complexity beyond the nostalgia-versus-future binary.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the contrast between appearance and truth—Elara's feigned foolishness masking wisdom, the council's "stellar harmony" concealing conspiracy, and "unheard stories" revealing hidden realities. The eternal flame as recurring motif gains meaning from mere light source to "beacon for stories yet to be heard," reweighting Elara's role as truth-keeper. Subtext operates through her "foolish rhymes" that actually mark "bribe routes through wormhole shortcuts."

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of the healing shard paralleling Elara's emotional mending, avoiding explicit moralizing. The story explores silence versus expression, with the final line "some moments, once evoked, could rewrite the stars" offering resonant closure without stating a moral. The transformation from cryptic speech to clarity enriches the thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the coral motif and "grafting" metaphor, avoiding explicit moralizing. The ending offers resonance through "decrypting another's pain, she mended her own," though the insight feels somewhat predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of artistic continuity across generations emerges organically through the fresco discovery and Elias's light-painting response. The concept of "exposed film of the past" developing through time rather than chemicals offers a resonant metaphor for artistic legacy. However, the piece occasionally states its themes too directly ("a shared, timeless mirth") rather than letting them emerge purely through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the exchange of knowing for questioning, with the hobo nickel's wanderer-carved patterns mirroring the garden's invitation to exploration. The final line "forever trading the known for the curious horizon" resonates without moralizing, and Elara's own reflection on the coin's carved paths adds thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of coded resistance emerges through concrete garden patterns spelling "RESIST" and the gourd's rattle as "defiant pulse." The final image of Elias as guardian of sparks planted "where taxes couldn't reach" offers resonant answer without explicit moralizing. Subtext operates well in "candidly cryptic" dialogue and warped growth hiding messages.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of transforming pain into beauty emerges organically through the photosynthesis metaphor and spectral flowers that "bloom ethereally." The final image of Elara glimpsing "the stars' own longing, mirrored in her own" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The "blossom armistice" concept effectively captures the paradox of peace through acceptance rather than victory.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the concrete work of preservation and the "museum of extinct feelings," exploring memory and loss without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elowen continuing despite foxglove regret offers resonance. However, the piece occasionally drifts into abstraction with phrases like "extinct feelings" and "synthetic bonds" that lack grounding in specific dramatized experience.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.7)
    The symphony-as-truth concept emerges organically through the magical system rather than stated themes. The final binding offers a non-literal answer about trust requiring mutual vulnerability. However, theme tends toward the explicit with phrases like "trust restored in this fragile harmony" that summarize rather than resonate. Subtext operates better in Thorne's initial crossed arms and gradual softening than in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the encrypted message revealing "compassion, encrypted to survive," paralleling how mercy must be encoded within rigid structures. The surveyor's chain transforms from division tool to unity symbol, and the building's breath becomes approval, though some thematic statements edge toward the explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the concrete interplay of forged histories versus authentic renewal, with the meteorite serving as the "unyielding reality" that grounds reinvention. The dust motes forming "faint musical staffs" creates resonant imagery without forcing meaning. The final image of the meteorite "placed under the skylight where motes swirled eternally" offers a non-literal answer about balance between fabrication and truth.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of necessary distances as "quiet architects of meaning" emerges organically through the pilot's weather codes, corn maze paths, and the final crossing. The father's wisdom about trusting "the spaces between" resonates without becoming didactic. The ending reweights all prior threshold imagery when Elara crosses "that sacred edge where void met vessel." Minor deduction for the slightly abstract formulation "necessary distances were the quiet architects of meaning" that borders on thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of belonging emerges through underwater isolation paralleling cosmic distance, with some resonance in the Elara-Lir connection. However, the final "seamless shadowseam truth" reads as abstract assertion rather than earned wisdom. The burnt feather's bridge-between-worlds symbolism feels forced rather than organically integrated with the belonging theme.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of transience versus permanence emerges organically through the sea-foam memories, migrating bird, and sprouting/withering seeds. The final insight about embracing scatter over permanence resonates, though it edges toward explicit statement: "paths disappear to make way for the seeds of tomorrow" summarizes rather than trusts the image work.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of "ordering randomness"—planned spontaneity that transforms passive observation into active participation. The bishop's diagonal movement "cutting through the ordinary" resonates without explicit moralizing. The final image of shells as applause elegantly reweights the performance metaphor, though some conceptual phrasing ("calculated wilderness") occasionally abstracts rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of memory/nostalgia versus imposed forgetting emerges through the verse-creation ritual, though it remains somewhat abstract. The cosmic verse on mortal skin offers a resonant image of permanence versus transience. However, the thematic exploration lacks complexity—the ban is simply defied without exploring why it exists or what genuine costs rebellion might carry.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding luminous worth in everyday craftsmanship emerges through the prism atrium and glass imagery, avoiding direct moralizing until the final lines. The recurring motifs of light refraction and ripples create coherent subtext about perception and value. However, the insight isn't earned through struggle—Elias's realization about "glow in the grit" arrives without dramatized conflict or cost that would deepen thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of "bargained innocence" emerges through Elias's reflections on trading youth for expertise, with the cracked box serving as a physical metaphor. However, execution relies heavily on abstract statements like "innocence wasn't shattered but bartered" rather than letting particulars speak. The ending's attempt at universal resonance feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of measurement tools (altitude to depth) and the equation "Hope = (Tide Rise × Timeline Divergence) / Logical Anchor" which literalizes abstract hope as precise calculus. The ending image of patterns glowing eternal offers resonant closure without explicit moralizing, though the triumph could benefit from more ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through concrete discoveries—half-burned diaries revealing industrial sins now "echoing eternally in stone." The final reweighting of walls' dreams from isolation to "hope shared across time" offers resonant answer without moralizing, earned through specific family history rather than abstract environmentalism.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of borrowed life and fleeting possibilities emerges organically through the mirage painter's work and the temporary nature of visions. The coded lullabies as a method of communication with reality adds thematic texture. However, the ending line about "borrowed life" states the theme too directly, diminishing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of redemption's price—Elara's erasure for peace—without explicit moralizing. The ebony clipboard as confessor's ledger and the "flawed yet magnificent" eclipse create resonant images that reweight the opening's weathered stones.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the extinction/preservation paradox without moralizing. The final image of rain washing away evidence while Elias walks back "a little less fractured" offers resonant ambiguity about redemption and erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the harvest metaphor—collecting suppressed voices to defy conformity—without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elara having "unlocked not just a sanctuary, but the harvest of her own echoing soul" resonates as she becomes what she sought to free. Slight deduction for "conformity itself had felt the tremor" which edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the story stick's transformation from subversive tool to communal bridge-builder. The final image of Elias "turning toward dawn" resonates without stating a moral, and the complexity of whether subversion serves or corrupts remains productively ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of overlooked histories and transient beauty emerges organically through the monarchs' final migration and Elara's ephemeral structures. The moth wing serves as a resonant particular—"a relic from a creature that had danced through shadows"—though the piece occasionally veers toward explicit thematic statement ("her signals were pragmatic rituals, grounded in the biology of light refraction"). The ending image of structures standing "transiently rooted" while monarchs vanish offers genuine ambiguity without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of preservation versus loss emerges through the lost wax casting metaphor and the names' recovery. However, the ending's "echo of those names within her" reads as explicit thematic summary rather than earned resonance, and the forgiveness arc resolves too neatly without exploring the complexity of self-blame.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of paths choosing walkers "to balance the world's decay." The vines transform from confinement to alliance, the decaying directive from burden to "liberated spark." The ending image of Elara walking into the storm "chosen and choosing in turn" offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of hidden knowledge and devotion emerges through the encrypted observations and magic square, with the "empirically ironic" void creating some conceptual tension. However, the ending states rather than embodies its wisdom—"forever altered by the devotion he had unveiled" tells us the transformation without showing its implications or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of releasing versus harboring resentment emerges organically through the music box's history and cellular memory transmission. "Shifting grace" as a force that "reappears when needed" resonates through the ending without explicit moralizing. The generational echo of ancestral resentments adds depth, though some phrasing ("grace carries us") edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of boundaries—between earth and heaven, tangible and ethereal, decay and infinity—without explicit statement. The sextant as a tool for "erasing boundaries between earth and heavens" resonates with Elias's dream-capture. The ending offers a non-literal answer about integration of opposing states ("firmly grounded yet reaching toward the infinite").

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of renewal from broken promises emerges organically through the cathedral-orchard juxtaposition and crystallizes in the mended eye's revelation. The "deciduous vows" metaphor effectively links seasonal cycles to human promises, though the final insight about "vows that, like the orchard, could regrow from breach's ruins" edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of nonlinear inheritance emerges organically through the cameo's blankness as "invitation to project one's own forbidden inquiries," with the orchard itself revealed as a "nonlinear legacy planted by time-displaced gardeners." The final image of Elara stepping forward despite uncertainty offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "unlearned lessons" emerges organically through the Library's purpose and the ferns that thrive "where stories faltered." The final image of "composing closure from chaos" resonates with the musical motif woven throughout. Yet the resolution tends toward tidy abstraction—harmonizing timelines—rather than wrestling with the complex implications of which lessons remain unlearned and at what cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of identity and myth emerges through the chimera twin concept and "blissfully aberrant" state, avoiding direct statements. The ending's image of weaving narrative threads offers a non-literal answer about reclaiming lost identities. However, the "garden of forgotten names" leans toward abstraction, and the resolution's embrace of endless weaving feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of preserving history against entropy emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The rope literally binding "absences" to prevent loss resonates beyond the immediate plot. The final image of "time ticked onward, clarified and complete" offers a non-literal answer to the central question of archival preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through the concrete image of finding "the quiet in the storm"—not as abstract philosophy but through physical ritual with the echo chamber stone. The crack patterns mirror ripple-marks, creating resonance between destruction and hidden order. The final image of "hammered repose" reweights the initial violence into necessary transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of finding meaning in apparent chaos emerges organically through Elara's quest, with the rekindled beacon serving as proof that "coincidences were the universe's quiet language." The thistle imagery recurs meaningfully ("thistle-blown hope," "hope thistle-light but unyielding"), and the final image resonates without explicit moralizing. However, the thematic exploration remains somewhat safe, lacking the complexity that would emerge from genuine counter-pressure to Elara's belief system.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of memory-as-identity emerges through the shadow-measuring ritual and monument examination rather than statement. The recurring "deepening hush" and "preemptively nostalgic" create resonance. However, the piece tells its theme explicitly ("sculpting identity from experience") multiple times, and the final paragraph's "identity etched indelibly" reads as thesis statement rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of creation defying despair emerges through concrete action—the transformation of the kerosene rag into catalyst, the fortress's blooming essence filtered into fuel. The final word "Rise" projected in fire serves as a non-literal answer to the story's question about persisting through failure. However, the theme occasionally surfaces too explicitly in phrases like "defying the gravity of hopelessness" and lacks the complexity that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through the jade cicada's transformation symbolism and water metaphors for time's texture without explicit moralizing until near the end. The concept of transition periods as "interstitial breaths" where temporality becomes tangible resonates throughout. Deduction for Elara's final articulation being somewhat thesis-like despite its poetic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of freedom versus safety emerges organically through the contrast between open trellis and buried bunkers, with silence collection as a form of resistance. The final line "To stretch the silences before they contract like your bunkers" crystallizes this without moralizing. The gilded hush as luxury contrasted with suffocating safety creates resonant subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between noise that "scatters" and guided silence that "gathers the soul," avoiding direct moralizing. The storm glass serves as both practical tool and thematic vehicle for transformation. Final image of Lira's smile and whispered acknowledgment resonates without stating the lesson explicitly, though the silence/comfort dynamic occasionally edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of bridging past and future emerges through concrete imagery (organic orchards vs. chrome towers) rather than abstract statements. However, the ending's visions of "orchards eternal, thrones occupied by wisdom" slide into platitude. The ruby flake dissolving carries no thematic weight. The story gestures toward restoration without examining what's actually lost or what restoration would cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of necessary severance emerges through the paradox of burning bridges "to build better air," with the ring linking through scars rather than healing them. However, the final line explicitly states the moral, and the companion's transformation lacks on-page complexity. The metaphor system (shadows, bridges, breathing) occasionally overwhelms concrete action, particularly in abstract phrases like "loaded emptiness."

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the pressure-to-diamonds metaphor without explicit moralizing. The final image of distributed wealth subverts pyramid scheme greed effectively, though the "quantum promise" across dimensions adds unnecessary abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of liberation through truth emerges organically from the accumulation of ancestral weight, musical memory, and hidden revelation. The standing waves metaphor effectively bridges past and present, while "dynasty ender" reframes destruction as destiny. The final image of winding the gramophone to "carry away the ghosts" offers resonant closure without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete transformation from withdrawal to engagement, with the marionette program serving as bridge between solitude and performance/connection. The final image of Elowen as "puppeteer" orchestrating possibility resonates without stating a moral. The recurring "shivering bliss" and pattern-weaving motifs accumulate meaning. Some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing about potential, but the ending reweights prior isolation effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of "small kindnesses" magnified through forgotten histories emerges organically from Josiah's carved doll and pressed wildflowers—concrete particulars rather than abstractions. The ending reweights Eliza's grief through parallel loss without stating moral. Minor deduction for slight thematic echo in "small kindnesses" phrase appearing twice.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.6)
    The revised histories theme emerges through concrete artifacts (holotapes) rather than abstract statements. The puddle-map and auric lagoon create resonant imagery. However, Kael's line "The histories lied about me too" edges toward thematic echo, and the ending's "coded freedom" feels more declared than earned through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through the concept of negative space—"true music lay in what wasn't played"—without explicit moralizing. The silence/sound dialectic develops through concrete action (saxophone whispers, pauses spelling reversal) rather than abstraction. The final image of dewdrops as "tears of release" resonantly answers the central question about confronting inherited trauma through absence rather than presence.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the balance of order versus wild intuition, with the monuments serving as physical manifestations of this tension. The ending reweights prior sorting work as "sacred rite" without explicit moralizing. The recurring moonstone and leaf motifs accumulate meaning, though "mossy delight" feels forced as a thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars rather than statement. The compass rose with no needle provides a perfect non-literal answer to the central question about embracing uncertainty. Strong subtext in contrasting rigid clocks with directionless navigation, avoiding any heavy-handed moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kintsugi metaphor brilliantly merges with theme as broken things become "factually stronger at breaks, mystically resonant." The understanding that "names weigh because they remember" emerges from concrete ritual action rather than assertion. The final image of Elarion stepping out with the mended vessel offers a non-literal answer to redemption through transformation rather than erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of using distorted music to draw out buried joy from spectral regret, avoiding explicit moralizing. The recurring "luminous ache" motif and the paradox of healing through acknowledged loss create resonance. The final image of "faint, healing mirth on the wind" offers a non-literal answer about transformation through embracing rather than erasing pain, though some phrasing ("joy that pain tried to drown") edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mathematical equation metaphor for mercy emerges organically from Elias's cartographer background and interrogation experience, avoiding direct statement. The theme develops through concrete suffering—the strap's pressure, phantom skull constriction, enhanced proprioception—rather than abstraction. The final image of Elias as "compass pointing toward mercy's hidden formula" resonates without moralizing, though the mathematical framing occasionally drifts toward conceptual abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of honoring forgotten migrations and overlooked histories emerges organically through concrete images—the painting's hidden glyphs, the lens fragment's revelatory power, the between-worlds' permeable boundaries. The final image of "shared breath" between realms resonates without stating its moral explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of hidden burdens and facades containing secrets emerges through the ceiling imagery and dust patterns. However, the meta-commentary about word counts and the multiple revised endings prevent any thematic resonance from accumulating. The concept of "weightless burden" appears but lacks consistent development.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of perfection versus transformation emerges through the library's "impeccable equilibrium" yielding to "destabilized perfection." The bottled whisper embodies this paradox. However, the ending veers toward explicit thematic statement ("a destabilized perfection") rather than letting the image carry meaning alone.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "burnished sorrow" into "golden legacy." The archaeological dispute serves as effective metaphor for reimagining collective identity. The final image of the "jewel of contrived history" resonantly reweights earlier material, though some thematic statements edge toward explicit ("revolutionary reborn—not in arms, but in...").

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete act of "mending what isn't torn"—repairing through subtle alignment rather than force, which resonates beyond the literal repair to suggest restoration through truth and patience. The chip's attribute of wilting near dishonesty creates a thematic test at the climax, where Elias must embrace authentic belief. The final image of dawn's chorus replacing stolen melody offers resonant closure without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the opposition of industrial rationality (factory) versus primal mystery (lagoon), with petrichor as the bridge between worlds. The compass's transformation from navigation tool to mystery vessel resonates without stating a moral. The "hinged awakening" metaphor works structurally—each vision pivot reveals deeper truth. Minor deduction for the slightly overwrought "place where explanations failed" which borders on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of interconnection across time emerges through the alliance imagery and Elara's sculptural synthesis. The concept of "scaffolding complexity with simplicity" gets explicit treatment but relies on assertion ("each cut revealing alliances hidden in plain sight") rather than dramatized discovery. The ending image of Elara pocketing the slide offers continuation rather than resonant reweighting of the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central metaphor of nocturnal blooms as hidden defiance elegantly unifies grandmother's secret depths with Elara's shadow-corner murals, emerging through concrete discovery rather than assertion. The final image of Elara stepping out with "quiet drive now a blooming certainty" resonantly reweights the opening without explicit moralizing, though some phrasing ("riddle of the heart") edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.5)
    Theme of suppressed truth emerges through the activist's story and Elara's parallel journey, with the obsidian lagoon serving as metaphor for hidden knowledge. But the ending's "mending the fractured archive one searing truth at a time" states theme directly rather than letting it emerge from the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of sustainable community versus magical quick-fixes emerges clearly through the amber bottle's contrast with Elias's alchemical approach. The final image of the dusty bottle as testament to internal revival resonates. However, the transformation from individual to community lacks complexity—no one questions Elias's vision or presents alternative approaches.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between archiving others' emotions and hoarding none of his own, with the phonograph shaving serving as a bridge across time. The final image of pressing the prophetic shaving to his chest resonates without stating a moral. However, the prophecy's content feels generic ("hearts unraveling, emotional patterns fracturing") rather than offering specific particulars that reweight prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of seed-saving as preservation against entropy, with the vortex inheritance passed "not of blood but of borrowed moments." The final image of ice melting to dew on seeds resonates as renewal without stating a moral. The "texture of borrowed time" discovery—"resilient, textured with the lives it had sustained"—provides non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of listening versus noise emerges organically through Elias's choice of bell over siren. The final image of "listening prevailed over noise" resonates without moralizing, though some passages approach thematic echo ("listen first, disrupt only if the listening demanded it").

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of vulnerability-as-strength emerges through accumulated imagery of falling stars "shedding celestial skin," though it tends toward direct statement ("In your fall, you teach me to stand still"). The final reconfiguration from janitor to "guardian of vulnerabilities" offers resonance but lacks the specificity that would elevate beyond conceptual assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the tension between speech and silence, with the covenant's corruption shown through glass facets rather than stated. The final gesture that preserves "mute eloquence" offers a non-literal answer to whether broken promises can be honored without words. Subtext operates strongly in Elias's choice to trace rather than speak.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the urn fragment containing "ashes not of flesh but of elapsed instants" and Mira's preserved temporal texture. The final insight that "time's texture was not loss, but the soft persistence of connection across fractured epochs" resonates without moralizing. The garage sale code system cleverly literalizes hidden meanings.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "woven dawns" metaphor effectively unifies darkness/light with incompleteness/beauty, emerging through concrete images. However, explicit thematic statements ("beauty lay not in perfection, but in the art of harmonizing what remained") replace subtler resonance, particularly in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of interspecies respect emerges through concrete actions rather than declaration, culminating in the murals showing "humans and arboreal spirits clasping hands." The orchard transformation literalizes connection between human ingenuity and natural will. The ending reweights the cancer diagnosis as potentially reversible through this harmony, though the healing risks tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the amber as bridge between human and alien, with "homecoming" reconceptualized from return to origin into "rebellious fusion." The fly in amber resonates as preserved essence across time without heavy-handed symbolism. The final image of spring rain "washing the tower clean" while the world converges offers non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of sowing redemption where "cannon fire had scarred the earth and blood had salted the soil." The submerged concord concept effectively links past harmony to present restoration without explicit moralizing, and the ending's sprouting offers a non-literal answer to healing.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the central metaphor of echo—"that intangible force born from destruction, carrying voices across voids"—which resonates with the wasteland setting and Harlan's search. The leaf's transformation from memorial to "talisman against isolation" offers non-literal answer to loss. Slight deduction for "reluctant heroism" phrasing that edges toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of finding "true north" through disorientation emerges organically from the temporal confusion, culminating in the insight that orientation leads "not away from family, but through the silence to them." The compass rose accumulates meaning without heavy-handed symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the synthesis of sacred play and serious purpose—Elias treats world-ending stakes as "a game where every move held reverence." The recurring chess metaphor accumulates meaning from corrupted game to restored balance, with pieces "hollowed to hold secrets" literalizing hidden knowledge. The ending transformation of "thieving hands now architects of balance" resonantly answers the central question about wonder's role in maintaining order.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of small gestures versus grand power emerges through the pawnless chessboard and archive of minor acts. The concept resonates when "pawns' absence a testament to the power of the unbound everyday." However, the ending's claim that gestures "unbound them all" feels unearned without showing their actual liberating effect.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the central metaphor of "buried talents" erupting "like subterranean storms" to reshape reality, with the stone's inscriptions revealing "Home is the curve of shadow against light, the fold where loss meets longing." The final image of Elowen "seeding stories into the tomes, unburying talents for all" resonantly answers the opening's weight of memory. The integration of painful past into creative future avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the chess-as-life metaphor, with "every game, even his life's, held moves for renewal" arising from concrete navigation choices. The mirror scene offers a non-literal answer about forgiveness as strategy without stating a moral. The recurring motif of winnowing (false paths from true, regret from redemption) accumulates meaning, though the final whispered absolution edges toward explicit rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the refraction metaphor: "The truth is a lance, piercing clean, but what if we turn it to rainbows." The final image of the canyon's echoes carrying their "refracted chorus" resonantly answers the central question about forgiveness's price, though some thematic statements edge toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kintsugi theme elegantly emerges through action—"repairing broken pottery with gold, not to hide flaws but to honor them." The transformation from uncertainty to "golden certainty" resonates without preaching. Each narrated memory demonstrates the theme of finding beauty in brokenness, culminating in "beauty forges from the broken."

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of temporary eternity emerges organically through the oasis discovery and shell painting, with the final image of "canvases that captured...the ache of temporary eternities" offering resonant answer without moralizing. The shell-as-talisman motif effectively constrains and charges closure. Slight deduction for "I carry the quay eternal" approaching theme statement, but overall subtext operates well through image.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast of whispers/shouts, tenderness/fury, night/dawn without explicit moralizing. The final image of "the garden's scent lingering like a promise kept" resonates with the central question about subtle power. Some abstract phrasing ("vibrations of intent") prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "reverse migration" as both physical return and spiritual reclamation. The bronze censer foot transforms from prayer relic to personal talisman, earning its symbolic weight through repeated handling. "Geography of loss" redrawn as "reverse paths etched like constellations" offers resonant closure without stating a moral, though some passages approach abstract philosophizing about "spirits reclaiming ground."

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of necessary deception versus brutal honesty emerges organically through Elias's condition and the empathy virus context. The glass eye becomes a resonant symbol of "merciful shadows" and selective blindness. The final image of "mended hearts" in the ravine effectively reweights the opening's isolation, though some thematic statements feel slightly over-explicit ("veils, gentle occlusions").

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the Edelweiss's transformation from "token of purity" to bridge between isolated souls. The final image of Elias as "eccentric guardian of gaps, waiting for the next twilight soul" offers resonant answer without moralizing. Strong subtext in the flower's journey from alpine heights to coastal dock.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of confronting life's crossroads emerges through the doorway metaphor and Elias's journey from solitude to connection. The visions of "paths untaken" resonate without moralizing. Final image of leaving "solitude's shadows in the blooming cavern's fading glow" reweights his isolation as choice rather than circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    The bleeding starlight motif successfully reweights from dream image to curse mechanism to resolved threat, creating thematic coherence. The "curse's lure, drawing her here" revelation provides earned insight, though the final wisdom about being "forever marked" tends toward abstraction rather than emerging from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the nautilus spiral metaphor—growth amid constancy—and the transformation ritual embodies rather than states this. The final image of the glowing shell as "portable nexus" resonantly reweights their separation, though the piece occasionally veers toward explicit thematic statement ("scientifically romantic in its precision and passion").

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of transforming loss through narrative emerges organically through the concrete act of writing on birch bark, with the final image of "wind beneath imagined wings" resonantly reweighting the earlier grave vision. The jealousy-to-flight arc avoids simple moralizing. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit thematic statement about "distilling chaos into narrative."

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges through the metaphor of "reading between the lines" of objects and their hidden stories, with the screw humanized as a "steadfast guardian" bridging life and death. The ending offers resonance through the restored screw as "promise of renewal" but relies on stated meaning ("unveiled the ordinary miracle") rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transforming trauma through storytelling emerges organically through Elara's ritual, avoiding explicit moralizing. The crow superstition motif connects childhood coping to adult mastery, though the final transformation ("scars reborn as tales etched in eternity") edges toward abstraction rather than remaining grounded in specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "imperfect miracles" theme emerges organically through the perfume that "sparks joy but burns," the archive as "sanctuary doomed," and the flawed reconciliation. The final image of fallen trees with lingering music offers a non-literal answer about persistence despite loss.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through the concept of piercing illusions to reach truth, developed through the dictionary's etymologies and the spiral arbitration process. The ending's "unified cosmos, bare and true" offers a resonant answer without explicit moralizing. However, the abstract philosophical nature prevents deeper emotional resonance, and subtext operates primarily at the conceptual rather than embodied level.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    The razor edges concept elegantly links physical precision (measurement station), temporal boundaries (clock mechanisms), and existential cuts (choices that linger). The water clock as liquid time creates resonance. However, the final insight about "quiet cuts of existence" and "choices lingered, unspoken" feels somewhat abstract, lacking the concrete particulars that would make it land with full force.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of "physics of letting go" emerges organically through quantum entanglement paralleling emotional release, avoiding explicit moralizing until the realization that connection enables release. The mushroom network as living quantum system provides concrete embodiment of abstract physics. Final image of the farm's "quiet wildfire dimming to a simmer" resonantly answers the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the concept of "lucid contradictions"—probability containing both control and chaos. The scrawls function as concrete vehicles for abstract ideas about certainty/uncertainty. Minor deduction for occasional thematic echo in phrases like "widening perspectives" that feel prompt-derived rather than scene-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of endings learning to begin emerges through the central action and Elias's philosophy, with the glass harmonica creating a "melodically haunted" resonance between sound and meaning. The final image of "teaching the art of fresh starts in the underground's eternal echo" reweights the interaction. However, the theme risks becoming too explicit when Elias states "endings must learn to begin" directly.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of preserving ephemeral moments emerges through the walnut-ink archiving and the covenant renewal, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the theme remains somewhat surface-level, expressed through repetitive abstract phrases ("weight of small moments," "haunted euphoria") rather than earned through specific dramatized experience. The final commitment to archive stories feels thematically coherent but lacks the resonant non-literal answer that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the irony that a disaster-relief expert who gives but cannot receive discovers cure through reciprocal exchange. The moon rock serves as catalyst rather than solution, avoiding easy magical resolution. The final image of the station's ivy as "polite frame for new paths" resonantly reweights the opening's "monument to polite anarchy," though some thematic articulation edges toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of navigating internal landscapes through external journeys emerges organically through the parallel between mapping the ultrasonic forest and charting emotional depths. The stillpoint concept effectively bridges physical and emotional equilibrium without explicit moralizing, though the forgiveness resolution edges toward tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of revision and redemption emerges organically through the agricultural metaphors of seeds, threshing, and harvest woven throughout. The final image of "wrong seeds could yield unexpected harvests" resonates without moralizing. The pen's unbending mirrors Elara's resolve to "straighten the crooked paths of her regrets."

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central theme of finding meaning in absence emerges organically through the silence-mapping conceit. The empty camera as vessel for invisible capture resonates throughout, and "silence sings when we listen" crystallizes without preaching. However, phrases like "joyful sorrow" and "forgotten souls like a tender shroud" veer toward purple prose, and the ending's emotional resolution feels slightly pat despite the earned imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of preservation versus destruction emerges through Elara's paradoxical act of burning a library to save deeper truths, mirrored in Lirael's vandalized portrait that hides rather than destroys. The parallel between the two women across time resonates, though the phrase "fire in their soul" edges toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete struggle against memory loss and isolation, avoiding direct statements. The recurring "auroral sorrow" motif gains resonance, transforming from distant longing to "beautiful and unending" acceptance. The final image of Elara as guardian offers a non-literal answer to whether love can transcend cognitive decay.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges through action: subtlety outlasting bombast proven via the rescue rather than stated. The zodiac coin and folded maps embody hidden knowledge versus obvious force. Subtext operates in Elias's "feigned casualness" and calculated movements. Final paragraph edges toward explicit theme statement ("whispers had threaded through the storm") rather than letting the image alone carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of finding light within darkness emerges organically through the guardian's wordless lesson and the star patterns. The dental mirror's transformation from medical tool to light-redirector offers symbolic resonance. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit moralizing ("darkness had learned its lesson"), diminishing the subtlety established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    The chess metaphor effectively links Elias's coaching to strategic rebellion ("knights in perfect formation"), and the forest imagery recurs meaningfully from title through closure. The theme of quiet resistance through synchronized art emerges from concrete window displays. However, Elias explicitly states the thematic goal ("to plant forests of second thoughts") multiple times, reducing subtlety, and the final "thoughtful revolt" edges toward declared rather than embodied meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of authentic self versus constructed identity emerges through concrete images—the scrimshaw as key to "guarded hearts," the disappearing island as threshold, scales glinting beneath skin. The final dissolution of the scrimshaw as Elara embraces freedom resonates, though the violence-pact worldbuilding doesn't fully integrate with the personal transformation theme.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the juxtaposition of enforced happiness versus authentic grief, with the carved bird offering a non-literal answer about freedom from emotional void. The final placement of bird beside bouquet "like a companion in fragility" resonates without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of dissolving sacred boundaries emerges through concrete action and recurring imagery, culminating in transformation "from hesitation into bold passage." The colonnade's hum as "living poem" and Elara's paraphrasing create layered meaning. Slight deduction for the final paragraph's proximity to stating its theme directly.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of finding beauty in imperfection emerges through Elias's colorblind art and Thorne's flawed glass, culminating in their purposefully imperfect concertina. The bartered awakenings concept reweights creativity as exchangeable currency, though some thematic statements feel explicit rather than purely emergent from action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of connection-through-separation emerges through the grid failure serving as "forge for new resonances" and sounds becoming "texture of connection." The brother's voice transforms from "specter of grief" to "bridge," avoiding simple resolution. But the final paragraph tilts toward explicit moralizing ("discovering connection's texture, she found not just solace, but momentum") rather than trusting the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of renewal through shared suffering emerges organically from concrete actions—crafting mourning jewelry, discovering the stencil, creating origami guides. The "curtains of intention" concept integrates meaningfully as both metaphor and plot mechanism. Final image of their "shared, subdued ardor" resonantly answers the question of how one moves past devastating loss without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of finding human connection through chaos emerges through the cards' "onyx ink" responding to renewal patterns, though this arrives late as exposition ("The ink responds—darkens where patterns converge"). The final image of "human threads that no crash could sever" resonates but feels unearned without prior dramatized connection.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete interplay of nostalgia atoms and the pagoda's revelations rather than abstract statements. The paradox that loss of innocence enables wisdom develops through specific images—children's games becoming riots, innovations birthing dooms. The child-self encounter effectively embodies the thematic question without stating a moral. Slight deduction for moments where theme edges toward explicit articulation ("necessary forge for wisdom").

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete comparison of hope's evolution from "unity" to "commodified viral echoes," avoiding direct moralizing. The river stone and shadow-bloom create a resonant dialectic between permanence and transformation. The final "momentary victory" acknowledges complexity without false resolution, and "luminous regret" captures the bittersweet cost of preservation work.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.3)
    The reconstruction/regeneration theme emerges clearly through the extended metaphor of the chameleon's tail and Elias's emotional rebuilding. However, the theme resolves into tidy moralizing ("We rebuild, one layer at a time") rather than earned resonance. The piece states its thesis explicitly multiple times, particularly in the final third, undermining subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through the concrete journey from wound examination to accepting "a miracle rerouted." The opal's vision and plant voices avoid direct moralizing, letting meaning arise from Elara's discovery that survival creates obligation to "weave new life from old ruin." The coffee rings motif and frozen/flowing hourglass create resonance without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery of Theo's goodbye letters stored between film frames—"the negative spaces between frames, the pauses where light met dark." The parallel between Elara and Theo creates genuine complexity. The final image of "love's storage unlocked forever" resonates without moralizing, though some phrasing edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of cosmic creative reconnection emerges organically through "remembered stardust" concept. No heavy-handed moralizing; the ending offers resonant visual answer without stating thesis. Subtext operates effectively through imagery and the protagonist's internal journey. The artistic block as spiritual disconnection reads as genuine insight.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through cultivation-as-"gentle unraveling" rather than conquest, with the archive's "occasionally everywhere" presence threading quantum possibility through concrete action. The ending reweights the opening's barren world through sparked renewal without stating explicit morals, though "cultivation was not conquest" edges toward direct thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of mechanical-organic synthesis emerges through specific images ("roots of steel intertwined like neurons") and the central metaphor of mind-as-rainforest. The ending reweights earlier material when "organic vines merged with circuits in blooming harmony," though the resolution tends toward wish-fulfillment rather than embracing complexity with genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The leash-as-fear metaphor develops organically through action rather than declaration, with the theme of courage-through-release emerging from concrete journey details. The indirect routes embody the non-linear path to self-discovery without stating it. The final transformation to guide resonates as earned wisdom, though some passages like "courage waits where the ridge meets the wave" edge toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of healing requiring isolation, with the piano bolt serving as concrete manifestation of broken harmony. The final reframing of "unpardonable silence" as vow rather than curse offers resonant complexity without stated moral. Some passages edge toward abstraction ("seraphically mundane routine") but the closing image of Elias carrying "weight of hope renewed" while remaining bellhop grounds the theme in specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of truth versus illusion emerges through the concrete action of hidden messages exposing forgery, with the rune of drift serving as both literal tool and thematic anchor. The final dissolution offers a non-literal answer about inevitable revelation. Some deduction for abstract phrasing around "balance of the cosmos" and slightly neat resolution without exploring moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of persistence revealing hidden renewal emerges organically through the coral bleaching/regeneration cycle and migration path mystery. However, the final insight about paths "shifting rather than disappearing" arrives too tidily without interrogating what this means for conservation efforts or Elara's role.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of finding order within chaos emerges through the parallel between stellar patterns and rebellion strategy, avoiding explicit moralizing until the bracketed meta-comment. The stone circle as ancient technology that "reignites" purpose works conceptually, though the insight that scattered rebels form a "constellation waiting to connect" feels somewhat pat. The ending image of "thunderous serenity now a promise of storms" resonates without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of intentional evolution versus petrified tradition emerges through concrete action (unsealing) rather than assertion. The embryo as "implanted destiny" carries subtext about co-creation versus imposed fate. However, some thematic statements edge toward the explicit ("ensuring destiny was not imposed but co-created"), and the final paragraph contains mild moralizing that could trust the dramatization more.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges through the pearl metaphor and plant resilience, though "optimism anchored in realism" is explicitly stated multiple times, violating the show-don't-tell principle. The final image of carrying the pearl forward resonates but lacks subtlety. The thematic echo penalty applies (-0.6) for articulating the story's thesis in prompt-like language.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of reassembling fragmented reality through patient, methodical work emerges organically from the concrete action of untangling threads, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of Elias sketching "portraits alive with shadowed depth" resonantly answers the opening problem of "empty eyes," though the transformation's ease slightly diminishes thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    The time-crisis mystery emerges through concrete events and the ephemeral ink motif recurs meaningfully, but the final thematic insight ("cosmic mercy in chaos") lands as authorial declaration rather than arising from dramatized particulars. The story's meta-commentary about word count disrupts thematic resonance at the crucial closing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of frozen/dormant truths awakening. The concept of "knowledge as the ultimate contraband" develops through action rather than assertion. The final image of "a conversation begun in silence" resonantly answers the thematic question about how truth spreads under oppression, avoiding explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of nurturing versus violence emerges organically through concrete imagery and action rather than statement. The contrast between Elara's "engraved quiet" and her father's legacy creates meaningful tension.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of broken patterns requiring divine silence to mend, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of Elias cradling his prize under "watchful, wandering stars" resonantly answers whether wild fractures can be healed. The "feral lullaby" paradox—savage yet soothing—embodies thematic complexity without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "orbits of regret" metaphor connects family legacy to cosmic patterns, offering conceptual depth. However, the theme emerges more through explicit statements ("loops where mistakes circled back") than dramatized complexity. The ending's neat resolution—hoax exposed, truth freed—lacks the ambiguity or lingering cost that would elevate thematic resonance beyond surface-level journalism-versus-truth binary.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of guilt/forgiveness emerges through concrete particulars - the amber insect mirroring her son's entrapment, the translated cry revealing fear not accusation. The ending achieves resonance through the image of the meteor trail mirroring inner peace, though "mapped not just stars, but the contours of forgiveness" edges toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mandala serves as both literal and thematic centerpiece, its "interlocking spirals" mirroring the grotto's acoustic properties and the community's tangled forgetting. The final image of "whispers finally hushed into peace" while "unease lingered" offers a non-literal answer to finding meaning in mess—order is achievable but inherently unstable.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete act of renaming that transforms curse to caution, with the tessera serving as witness to radical mercy. The concept of "aberrant mercy" that forgives even arsonists resonates without explicit moralizing. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("gentle radicalism bloomed in warm coldness") that could be more grounded in specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of artistic legacy and shared performance emerges organically through the ghost-performer parallel and the "intertwined echoes" that bridge fractured timelines.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the contrast between artificial (pills) and embodied (somatic) connection, with the geode's fractal patterns reflecting emotional complexity. The ending image of "somatic truths and fractal beauty" resonates without moralizing, though "willowglass hope" occasionally veers toward precious.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of bridging epochs emerges through the fossil's "transitional object" nature and Elara's role as translator, though the piece tends toward explicit thematic statements ("ensuring that when humanity stirred, they would hear the echoes"). The fossil's quantum echoes border on convenient symbolism rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of buttons as "small decisions that wove into larger fates." The final revelation that wisdom should be "disseminated like echoes across canyons" resonates without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of "fixing what's broken" emerges through concrete action rather than statement, culminating in the pillbox becoming "a bridge across their broken bond."

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    The palimpsest metaphor effectively captures the layered nature of inherited obligation, and the theme of distilling essence from complexity resonates through concrete details like the yarn needle's mending. The ending achieves thematic coherence though it edges toward explicit statement ("The vow endures, distilled").

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of resistance, kindness, and sustained care, with the oasis as concrete embodiment rather than symbol. The fractured timeline visions avoid simple moralizing by showing multiple possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of cultivating life amid loss emerges organically through the fire escape garden's persistence, the father's locksmith metaphor of "reflecting light into dark corners," and the transformation of scattered petals into new resolve. The ending resists tidy resolution, offering "wistful peace, pragmatic and alive" as a complex emotional truth rather than closure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically as isolation transforms into independence through concrete action rather than stated wisdom. The sundial and stone circle avoid token symbolism by enabling actual communion. The final image of "soaring alone yet never truly isolated" resonates without moralizing, reweighting prior loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of threads, nests, and spirals rather than abstract statements. The concept of hidden connections becoming public art resonates through specific details like "each twig a fragment of a bird's hidden life, now woven publicly." The ending reweights Elara's ghostwriting from isolation to connection without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges through the parallel between cosmic and human deception, with Harlan's political manipulation echoing the tricksters' games. The final "honest silence" resonates as both literal (signal disruption) and metaphorical (clarity replacing deception). However, the piece occasionally tells its theme directly ("the way human greed twisted celestial wonders into weapons") rather than letting it emerge purely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of rebellion against confinement emerges through spatial metaphor and Elara's personal struggle, but resolves into tidy triumph. The "spatial mutiny" and personal "inner mutiny" parallel feels forced rather than organic. The final image of being "ready to redraw the world's boundaries" states theme directly rather than letting it emerge from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.4)
    The unification of opposites theme emerges through specific images (festive ribbon/grim quarry, socialite/underground artist) but resolution feels intellectually tidy. "Empathy, dormant in her own face-blind isolation, stirred" states theme directly rather than earning it through embodied struggle. The final lines about "rekindled empathy that binds us, opposites no longer at war" replace resonance with explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of overlooked bravery/delayed vindication emerges organically through Thorne's story paralleling the current climate crisis. The coded stanzas and guild machinations add texture without heavy-handedness. The final image of nail-as-talisman resonates. However, the last paragraph's explicit hope-from-dread transition and "reversible redemption" phrasing edges toward thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bridge metaphor resonates throughout - from Elias as "bridge-song fiddler" to the physical arch to music that "bridged the chasm between what was and what could be." The pixelated/fragmented imagery (flake, digital ghosts) effectively mirrors Elias's fractured self-image healing into possibility. Theme emerges from concrete images rather than statement, though "pixelated amnesty" occasionally strains as an organizing concept.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.9)
    The circular path motif effectively links father-son legacy with the rail restoration concept, reaching resonance in "some paths circle back not as curses, but as invitations to reclaim." The theme emerges through concrete actions rather than statements, though the final insight about "harmonizing echoes" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.9)
    The shared burdens theme emerges organically through the dream procession and inscription "What one carries alone crushes; divided among kin, it lifts like wings." The mentor's spectral appearance with the telegram-lantern creates resonance, though the final insight about vulnerability and communal strength edges toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the intersection of individual and collective dreams without explicit moralizing, particularly in "a child's hope for endless play merging with an elder's wish for enduring peace." The final image of "convergence" rather than chaos reweights the opening's temporal disruption. The maze motif effectively represents branching possibilities that must be navigated through scars/memory.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete exchange of "bartered destinies"—fire becoming light, betrayal becoming strength. The Lovers card accumulates meaning from mere survival relic to exchange medium to sacrificial dust. The ending achieves resonance without stating a moral, though some passages lean toward abstract philosophizing ("inlaying meaning everywhere").

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of finding meaning "after the applause" emerges organically through Jack's transition from roadie chaos to appraiser's precision, with the quarry-as-archive providing resonant imagery. However, the insight that "purpose wasn't in the spotlight's glare but in the quiet sifting after" arrives as explicit realization rather than earned through dramatized struggle, slightly weakening thematic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of transition as reconfiguration rather than loss emerges organically through Elara's analogical thinking, comparing cuneiform impressions to energy state changes. The final image of the sprouting seed offers a non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral.

    The theme of accepting contradictions to preserve essence emerges organically through the librarian's physical flux and his preservation method. The final image of identities "dancing with the moon, preserved against the fog's eternal now" resonantly answers the central question without explicit moralizing. The contradiction between preservation and transformation deepens through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the pearl absorbing "abandoned hopes" and Elias's act of crowning stone with light to reconnect isolated hearts. The final image of "connected hearts, a quiet promise against the doomsday" offers resonant answer without stated moral, though some phrasing ("dissolve the walls between hearts") edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of forgiveness through confronting the past emerges organically through concrete discoveries—map references, graffiti wisdom, and the accordion—avoiding explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of unspoken words and silenced truths emerges organically through the library's books of "regrets unvoiced, dreams unshared." The confidence man's legacy adds complexity about deception versus noble pursuit. Yet the ending offers discovery without resonant reconfiguration - she gets her answers without the thematic weight of what those unspoken words might cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the perforated destiny metaphor becoming literal choice-points. The ice violin serves as both concrete object and thematic vessel for frozen possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the beautician-mortician duality - one who preserves dignity in death now facing her own. The patterns in static serve as both literal method and metaphor for finding meaning in chaos. The final image of the chip "carrying her spark across thresholds yet to come" offers resonant answer without stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cycle of rebirth emerges through concrete images: charred branches sprouting, scalloped pools preventing decay, the hairpin linking generations. The final insight—"destruction birthed creation, forgiveness seeded growth"—reframes earlier material without explicit moralizing, achieving resonance through accumulated particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of embracing nuance over binary thinking emerges organically through the wind chime interpretation and Elara's final transformation. The "gray spaces where growth hid" and the paradox of certainty being "softened yet stronger" offer resonant complexity. However, Thorne's explicit articulation "It's not about erasing certainty, but inviting the subtleties" edges toward direct statement rather than pure emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme emerges through the vanishing/appearing paradox and ripple patterns mirroring cellular aging rings. The concept integrates with method but resolution remains abstract—"weaving the truth so carefully" without dramatized consequence. The ending reaffirms rather than reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between stillness and movement, with the final image of Elara "unbound" yet rooted offering a non-literal answer to the navigation paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    The automation-versus-simplicity theme emerges coherently through accumulated imagery of "colossal algorithms" against "flower unfurling without fanfare." The keystone's "brilliant dimness" effectively captures the paradox. However, the final revelation that "only the simple held the sacred" arrives through assertion rather than dramatized discovery with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The synesthetic quest brilliantly merges concrete action with abstract theme, culminating in the indigo-gold revelation that reweights his father's lullabies and transforms his lamplighter identity.

The final image of Elias carrying the secret forward offers a non-literal answer to whether impossible vows can be fulfilled.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The backwards prophecy concept elegantly mirrors the story's own retrograde structure, with theme emerging through the tension between holding fragments (coins) versus releasing them for wholeness.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of crystallizing intangible fears, avoiding abstraction. The final image of Elias as reaper of fears rather than just souls offers a non-literal answer to loss, with the echo metaphor earning its resonance through repeated transformation rather than mere recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between lukewarm power and cosmic ambition, with the bell serving as a concrete vehicle for exploring balance and restoration. The ending offers a non-literal answer about persistence and humble faith succeeding where greater power might fail. However, the resolution feels too tidy, and phrases like "cosmic imbalance" and "harmonizing the ebb and flow of oceans across realms" veer toward abstract philosophizing rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the physical resurfacing mirroring emotional excavation. The sapphire liqueur becomes a potent symbol of lost prosperity transformed into shared sacrifice. The ending achieves resonance through "stories spun into lasting meaning" without explicit moralizing, though edges toward tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the crystal-flame-starling sequence rather than statement, with the murmuration patterns organically teaching integration. The "touch of wonder" transforms from abstract concept to embodied experience through specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of trust under isolated pressure emerges through concrete action—Elara's solitary vigilance maintaining fragile colony bonds. The "soundless echo" motif resonates as both physical setting and metaphor for her isolation. Deduction for explicit thematic statement ("embrace the watcher's burden") in the final paragraph and some abstract phrasing that could emerge more fully from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of wholeness through complementary opposites emerges organically from the specific actions and imagery. The yin/yang concept develops through concrete ritual rather than abstract statement. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question without heavy moralizing, though some thematic elements feel slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme emerges through the innovation/mystery motif but resolves into explicit statements like "safeguarding space for innovation."

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the central metaphor of unspoken grief as thorny vines requiring patient dissolution. The final "haunting gift" reweights the restoration, acknowledging that healing carries its own spectral quality rather than simple resolution.

    Theme emerges organically through the uncertainty-as-companion concept, avoiding explicit moralizing. The pendant's "boundaries of light" motif effectively bridges physical and metaphysical stakes. The final image of mist parting for the trusted ally resonates without stating the lesson. Minor deduction for "dimensionally homesick" feeling prompt-derived.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Creative destruction emerges organically as "to birth the new, one must first raze the obsolete," embodied in the literal breaking and remaking of the crozier. The frozen bloom tone creates resonance between internal state and external world. The final image of the transformed crozier as "wand of interrupted fate" reweights the opening's hopelessness. Theme avoids explicit moralizing and lands through image.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of signal interpretation in ruins, avoiding direct moralizing. The "beginning in every ending" philosophy manifests through specific images: "gorge's depths birthing new life from eroded stone."

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of interconnection across parallel worlds emerges through the grotto's patterns and merged timelines, with the hourglass serving as a concrete symbol. However, the ending's assertion about "permanent whisper of worlds entwined" tells rather than shows the thematic cost, missing deeper resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of seeking connection through isolation and artifice, culminating in the revelation that bonds are "not silk or steel, but fevered sinew."

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of bridging isolation through expanded perception emerges through the chain link's geometry and starlight navigation, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the piece tends toward abstract contemplation ("horizons unfolding in her mind's eye") rather than earning insight through concrete struggle. The final image of Elara as "beacon in the unfolding vastness" resonates thematically but lacks the specific cost that would deepen meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of preserving vulnerable voices emerges organically through the investigation and pays off in "ensuring the vulnerable voices would echo on." The locket's inscription and the concept of emotional contagion add depth without moralizing, creating genuine resonance about memory and legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of remembering the forgotten emerges through concrete action (returning the codex) and the cable imagery effectively links past and present communication. The final image of cables "singing with their silent return" resonates. Yet the resolution feels too neat, lacking the complexity that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of harvesting wisdom from failure emerges through concrete details: the death certificate error, corrupted upload, broken porcelain becoming tool. The ink's "ephemeral patterns" work as visual metaphor for temporary solutions. However, Elias explicitly states the theme ("From failure, we harvest strength"), and the ending's completeness undermines the complexity of living with irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of death into preservation, texture into sound, loss into eternal resonance. The shadowbirds' patterns mirroring lost grammar creates resonant subtext. The final image of the canyon as "living archive" offers a non-literal answer about transformation and legacy, though it trends toward neat resolution without exploring the ambiguity of what's lost in translation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the transformation of loss into "cosmic joke" - the missing aren't victims but willing participants in "untamed harmony." The final image of Elara stepping "into it fully" reweights the entire investigation. Subtext operates through the garden's playful gravity and the phone's static confessions rather than direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of organic versus mechanical emerges through concrete action (music infiltrating roots, vines cracking stone) rather than statement. The locust shell effectively symbolizes transformation without heavy-handedness, and the ending reweights prior material as "beauty, pure and untamed, reclaimed its mechanical world" without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of "fostering bonds that the drones of surveillance couldn't sever" and culminates in the insight that healing happens through "fostered links of absence, where mail became memory's bridge." The recurring motif of connection across division gains depth through specific examples like the widow and the young woman with her trembling envelope, avoiding abstract moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of "interpreting silence as possibility" emerges organically through Elias's craft, his vow, and the transformation of the "misting hush" into "a symphony of possibility." The halo fragment works as a concrete symbol of hope amid decay. Some thematic articulation borders on explicit ("silence not as absence, but as boundless possibility") though it avoids final-paragraph moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges through the concrete opposition of digital/analog and the hyperbolic geometry that allows infinite narrative expansion. The ending's "analog weave connecting minds across time's bent horizons" offers resonant answer without moralizing, though the concept of stories living in physical objects versus bytes could develop through more embodied conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    The luminous absence motif beautifully captures the paradox of grief, where brightness illuminates what's missing. The final insight that "some dreams were meant to run" reweights the entire pursuit without moralizing, emerging naturally from the light-painting process.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of fear trapping possibility emerges through the hair/ribbon metaphor and pays off when "fear...cracked like brittle ice." The recurring star motif and the lock/locksmith symbolism create resonance. However, the resolution tends toward abstraction ("cosmic reunion," "eternal bond") rather than grounded particulars, and the final wisdom feels unearned through Elara's minimal agency.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of memory and loss emerges through the sunken orchard's transformation and the fairy ring's otherworldly patterns. The broken constellations motif resonates as disrupted order mirroring fractured memory. However, the thematic resolution feels too neat—memories return intact without exploring what corruption or incompleteness might mean, missing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the geometry metaphor—angles of fear versus curves of resilience—without explicit moralizing. The shard-mirrors as "echoes of lives long exiled" create a resonant system where reflection literally enables reversal, and Elara's final forward movement offers a non-literal answer to whether exile defines identity. Subtext operates effectively in the "combative tenderness" and tea-reading ritual, though "resilience" appears too explicitly as a labeled concept.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of bridging ethereal and tangible realms to restore wonder. The final image of villagers touching petals and feeling "succor flood her veins" offers a non-literal answer about renewal through connection. The piece avoids moralizing, though some phrasing like "preserve the color of wonder" edges toward abstraction rather than staying fully grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of unraveling silence to release trapped spirits, paralleling Elara's need to release her own trapped secret. The final image of spirits settling "masks whole, their wanderings ended" resonates without stating a moral. The recurring mask imagery accumulates meaning from broken to restored, mirroring internal redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "whispered chapel" concept elegantly merges literal place with metaphorical silence, and the torn map physically embodies the known/unknown divide. The theme of interpreting silence through empathy emerges from concrete actions. Yet the ending doesn't fully reweight earlier material—the chapel's actual whispers or their meaning remain unexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the underwater archaeology metaphor without heavy-handed moralizing. The "physics of letting go" concept develops well through concrete images and action. Minor weakness in some slightly forced thematic connections, but the final conceptual repricing reweights prior material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of translating code into art, avoiding abstract statements about creativity or connection. The final image of the freed ghost and transformed courtyard offers a non-literal answer about giving voice to the silenced. Subtext operates through the parallel between Elowen's seldom-heard voice and the ghost's encoded pleas.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding "joy beneath anguish" emerges organically through Captain Thorne's diary entries about lost crew yielding to memories of laughter and love. The spire's transformation from isolation symbol to beacon effectively embodies this theme. However, the thematic resolution feels somewhat neat, and Elara's "affectionate detachment" prevents deeper emotional engagement with the material's implications.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong thematic coherence around memory, loss, and the persistence of wholeness in fragments. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about voids as archives without explicit moralizing. "Spooled wholeness" integrates organically with the meteorological frame. The brass telescope and cloud categorization carry effective subtext about scientific method transformed by grief.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between Elara's face blindness and the guild's facial fractal method - both transcend conventional seeing through pattern recognition. The concept of "discovering limits meant not surrender, but infinite exploration within them" resonates without moralizing, and the final image of sky blooming with human fractals offers a non-literal answer to limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of hidden knowledge emerges through concrete discovery of the cipher and "stranded luminance," avoiding abstract statements. The hopscotch board as deliberate safeguard adds thematic depth about protecting dangerous knowledge, though the ending doesn't fully explore the "peril if mishandled" warning.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of surface repair versus deep rhythmic mending emerges through concrete particulars—the gear assembly teaches patience "like waves smoothing driftwood." The final image of "reflections merging into one whole self" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the abstract "universal pulse of mending" phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of collective effort versus isolation emerges organically from plot. The chalk messages work as subtext driving reexamination. However, the resolution trends toward explicit moralizing ("family's collective effort a testament") rather than resonant image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the "beautifully flawed" puppet head's cracks as a metaphor for finding meaning in imperfection. The lullaby across lifetimes offers a non-literal answer to how one faces inevitable endings—with mercy rather than resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of reluctant inheritance finding purpose emerges through concrete action, particularly in Elara's transformation from resentment to fierce determination. The final image of "graceless beauty" attempts resonance but feels more stated than earned through the preceding particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.2)
    The separation/connection theme emerges clearly through ravine imagery and polymer metaphors, but the resolution states its moral directly ("translate this apartness into something connected"). The chrysalis motif accumulates meaning but doesn't constrain choice or exact cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor: stories begin not in presence but in "deliberate measurement of what lacked." The bottled moonlight as "glimmering parole" - release from forgotten histories - reinforces this elegantly. The final image of "shimmering emptiness" offers a non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transforming pain into wisdom emerges through Elara's gift and the pavilion's stored memories. The final image of her emerging "ready to cook a feast that would heal rather than haunt" offers resonant closure. But the transformation feels too neat, lacking complexity in how remorse becomes "polished lessons."

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of silos/bridges without explicit moralizing. The multilingual song becomes a concrete embodiment of unity-through-diversity. The final image of "silos into symphonies" offers a resonant answer to the isolation problem, though the harmony achieved feels slightly idealized.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the archaeology metaphor—dreams stratified like canyon rock, memories entangled in quantum linkage. The final image of "forgotten worlds beginning to weave back into the light" offers resonant closure without moralizing. The woman who "dreamed of flight but settled for chains" provides concrete particularity. Minor deduction for occasionally abstract phrasing like "profound transformation."

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of hidden knowledge and vigilance against oblivion emerges through concrete discovery, though the ending tilts toward explicit statement with "vigilance that now seeded her soul." The manuscript doodle as map and the seeds as literal/metaphorical vigilance create coherent symbolism. The visions revealing the previous archivist's purpose feel too neat, lacking ambiguity or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "empathy in motion" - understanding brokenness to create beauty. The final image of "understanding the unbroken within the broken" resonates without moralizing, and the piece invites reflection on trauma, patience, and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through chess metaphor and the transformation of exile from punishment to opportunity—"beauty unveiled itself in the difficult." The final image of "a board reset for deeper play" resonantly reweights the opening's loss without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the worry stone's evolution from fury-mark to "badge of endurance."

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the concrete act of harmonizing with the lock rather than forcing it, paralleling the empathy concept. The diary's "varieties of silence" and the fireworks' interruption create meaningful contrast. The ending's "silences recovered and empathies forged" feels slightly explicit but is earned through prior imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding "serenity within motion" emerges organically through Elara's struggle with the overwhelming flower. The journalizing on wrapping papers provides concrete imagery for processing chaos, though the final insight about "embrace" versus "escape" edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of resilience emerges naturally through the discovery of ancient pilots who seeded survival into Arboris's DNA. The arrow tip as source of "enduring vitality" resonates without preaching, though the final line about safeguarding could dig deeper into what this responsibility means rather than stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of extracting foresight from disaster emerges through concrete investigation rather than assertion. The patch serves as a recurring motif connecting human cost to technical analysis. Final image of "foresight taking root amid the towering silence" resonates without moralizing, though could push harder against the safety of pure prevention.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of unfettering wonder from society's "self-imposed chains" emerges organically through the literal unfettering of the sculptor's work.

However, the theme resolves too neatly without acknowledging complexity or counter-arguments to wonder's essential nature.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between control and vulnerability, with the flute as concrete vehicle for this exploration. The vision sequence layers meaning without explicit moralizing, particularly in "yielding to the melody could mend tears instead of merely guarding." The final image of the range as "canvas for the melody yet to come" offers non-literal resonance. Some abstraction creeps in with phrases like "harvested insights" that lean toward theme-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the central question of whether emotion follows mathematical patterns or exists as "storm, borrowing and transposing endlessly." The final image of Elara smiling "through her borrowed tears" offers a non-literal answer that emotion is connection rather than equation. The halo fragment as "mirror to her fractured self" avoids stating the moral directly while charging the thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of transforming routine into wonder emerges organically through the pendant's action and shepherd's transformation. The ending reweights earlier material without stating a moral. Subtext operates well through gesture and the vibrating pendant's non-verbal communication.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the "truthful lies" concept - she convinced herself objects held others' emotions to avoid her own. The ending effectively reweights the premise without heavy-handed moralizing. Connection between mysticism and self-awareness resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of sacrifice for connection emerges organically through Elara's choice to unravel her life's work, with the tapestry serving as both literal craft and metaphor for accumulated experience. The final image of the "bare but waiting" loom offers resonant hope without stating a moral, though some passages drift toward abstraction ("time's unraveling tapestry").

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of quiet resilience emerging from destruction resonates through the concrete image of vines erupting from rubble. The "bartered awakenings" concept adds texture, though the ending's neat resolution ("whispers grew of the blacksmith's quiet deed") edges toward tidiness rather than embracing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of bearing truth's weight and the responsibility that comes with power. The mentor's sacrifice embodies the theme without stating it explicitly. The final image of Elara beginning her next chart "cyclically spontaneous and forever changed" resonates thematically, though the transformation could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the letter chain's revelation of isolation transcended by anonymous connection. The sea glass transforms from found object to symbol of continuity, while the stone stacks embody silent communication between solitary guardians. The final image of the relit lamp "carrying the bottled essence of safety into the aching night" resonates without stating its meaning, though "bottled essence" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of cyclical renewal through obsolescence emerges organically from the Herald's actions, particularly in the resonant final image of him extinguishing the wick to "await the next cycle." The integration of old (ancient shadows, print newspapers) with new (digital ghosts, algorithms) creates thematic texture, though some passages veer toward abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of iridescent caution—"beautiful yet brittle"—which accumulates meaning through the wing, the donor's memories, and Elara's final choice. The ending offers a resonant answer without stating a moral: "the heart's gift was the courage to track one's own sun trails." Subtext operates effectively through the physical examination standing for self-examination. Minor deduction for slight abstractness in "magnetizing stories."

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through concrete action: the sextant as "relic of quantified sorrow" transforms into tool for witnessing "constellations of resilience." The final image of binding "human longing to the world's quiet wonders" resonates without moralizing. Some thematic statements edge toward explicit ("mundane miracles") but mostly earn their weight through dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.2)
    The woven dawns motif effectively links community bonds to cosmic renewal, emerging through action rather than statement. The forgotten songs as living incantations create thematic resonance. However, the resolution tends toward the overly tidy, with light simply "cracking the darkness" without exploring the complexity of what renewal costs.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The paradox theme emerges organically through action—"remaining in the visible world while slipping into the veiled one"—rather than exposition. The final realization that "true connection hides in plain sight, paradoxes nestling compassion within solitude" resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively through Elias's empathetic sensing of the invitation's previous owner's "regret like an echo in his chest."

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically through guerrilla gardening as quiet rebellion and bread ritual as communion. The ending's "vigil against the fade" offers resonant answer without moral statement, though passages like "seeking the sacred in the ordinary" edge toward abstract declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of preservation against entropy emerges through concrete imagery of fading vows and spectral measurements. However, the resolution offers no complexity—preservation simply succeeds through technical competence, missing the opportunity to explore what might be lost or sacrificed in the act of saving.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of loyalty within an outlaw code emerges through action, with the "truce of hush" concept grounding the stakes. However, the abstract "sound of trust breaking" metaphor feels imposed rather than organic. The ending doesn't offer resonant closure to the thematic question - just vague "morning's promise" without earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    The terrestrially cosmic theme emerges through concrete details and the bridge metaphor resonates. However, the carriers' explanation is too direct ("We are the bridges"), violating the show-don't-tell principle at the crucial moment where subtext should dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of artistic calling as both curse and gift emerges organically through concrete action—the safe, the sketchbook discovery, the compulsive drawing. The final image of "charcoal fingers danced anew" offers resonant answer without stating moral, though "inescapable calling" is over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of truth versus dishonesty emerges through concrete images: wilting leaves, crystallized conversations, the dried oasis as metaphor for lost candor. The Vault's "small moments of candor" offers a non-literal answer to recovering trust. Final image of truth irrigating the soul resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of preserving wonder through non-verbal truth emerges organically through the sculpture's effects, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of Elias harmonizing "a fractured world, one resonant note at a time" resonates without stating a thesis, and the wordless communication concept deepens through concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "fragmented wholeness"—Elias discovers his childhood errors as "seedbed for devotion" rather than flaws to purge. The final image of him finding "his strangely organic heart beating in rhythm with the roses" resonates without stating a moral, reweighting earlier fragmentation as necessary complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    The listening-heals theme emerges organically through accumulated stories and the final letter release. The "Listen, and let the words flow free" note risks being too explicit but the community transformation grounds it in specifics rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transforming vulnerability into strength emerges organically through Elara's actions, particularly her dance and the spider-web metaphor. The final image of sisters ascending offers resonance without explicit moralizing. However, the thematic exploration remains somewhat surface-level, with phrases like "vulnerability encrypted as strength" feeling more asserted than dramatically earned through specific struggle and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete relationship between forgetting and preservation, with deleted memories finding physical form in salt crystals. The wildflowers bridge past joy and present grief without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the tension between chaos and tranquility, with the "smoothed hush" serving as both method and metaphor for peace-making. The crane's origami wing accumulates meaning from peace symbol to active talisman. The ending reweights silence as active force rather than absence, though some passages lean toward abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through layers: dead languages parallel hidden histories, "agreed upon lies" mask deeper truths, and buildings speak through "emotions imprinted." The final revelation that buildings carry grief and joy in their structure resonates without moralizing. The seal-passing ritual under meteors creates symbolic weight, though the "homecoming" metaphor edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transforming quarantine/isolation into strength emerges organically through Elara's journey. The final image of the shell as "monument to memories freed" resonates without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the forgery/authenticity paradox and calibrated betrayal as healing. The heritage rose thorn and key work as effective motifs that accumulate meaning, though the ending edges toward explicit resolution ("calibrating even betrayal into beauty") rather than trusting the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    The echo/silence dichotomy emerges through concrete particulars, with the final image of Elara's changed voice offering resonance. However, the theme occasionally surfaces as direct statement ("those with hearts attuned to the universe's secret song") rather than remaining fully embedded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between imperial duty and human connection, with the melted/reformed snow globe serving as a concrete symbol of purity reclaimed from corruption.

The ending's reformed snowflake resonates as non-literal answer to what can be salvaged from disaster.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete images (net knots, tea preparation, firefly patterns) rather than stated morals, with the final image of mending "not just nets, but the soul" offering resonant synthesis. The hidden effort motif accumulates meaningfully through multiple manifestations. Some philosophical passages edge toward abstraction ("silent architectures that sustained life") but remain grounded in physical detail.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the flawed diamond metaphor and truth vs. comfortable lies conflict. The ending offers resonant reconfiguration without explicit moralizing. Slight deduction for moments that edge toward direct statement ("comfortable lies that kept survivors numb") rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through the tension between isolation and influence, with Elias's loneliness paradoxically enabling his prophetic power. The recurring cobalt/blue imagery and shadow motif create resonance. However, passages like "variant allegiances, once chaotic, now aligned in lyrical prophecy's wake" state theme rather than embody it through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of preservation and translation across time emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The music box transforms from "silent and seized" to a "symphony of gleaned redemption" through specific sounds that carry generational memory. The final image of Elias as successful translator resonates without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of "sonic absolution"—harmony through resonant frequencies—is stated explicitly multiple times rather than emerging from events. The story tells us about "forgiving the chaos of the natural world" but this abstraction never crystallizes into concrete dramatic meaning. The final image of Elias withdrawing the glowing key lacks resonant power because no genuine transformation or cost has occurred; theme remains conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the moon-mapping practice that teaches "unhurried grace" as revolutionary method. The magnetic viaduct's "wild force restrained by stone's unyielding form" embodies the central paradox without stating it. The closing image of the cracking lake resonantly answers the thematic question about patience versus urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through parallel struggles for freedom across centuries—Clara's physical bondage and Elias's institutional control—without explicit moralizing until the final "liberty's flame" callback. The lantern functions as concrete link between eras, its inscription gaining meaning through Clara's escape fortifying Elias's resolve. Subtext operates through the "preventable death" investigation revealing systemic suppression.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of second chances emerges organically through the repair metaphor without explicit moralizing. The ending transforms "second opinion" from abstract concept to concrete action, though some thematic statements ("Everyone deserves a second opinion on their worth") edge toward directness.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through the central question of machine consciousness—"why machines merely obeyed, never yearned"—developed through concrete imagery rather than exposition. The kaleidoscope's fractal patterns translating "hunter's etchings into algorithms of ache" creates layered meaning. The ending's "unheard" bell offers resonant ambiguity about pioneering work ahead of its time.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of absence/presence emerges organically through "digital mausoleum," deleted files that persist in shadows, and the final "absence was never truly final." The Orion-7 patch becomes a concrete symbol of recovered truth. Yet the corporate malfeasance angle feels generic, and the ending veers toward explicit thematic statement ("promise that absence was never truly final") rather than pure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges organically through Elara's role and the mirror visions. The fragment serving as a tool for understanding rather than prophecy offers a fresh angle. However, the thematic resolution feels too tidy - the story doesn't wrestle with empathy's limits or costs, missing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through the "fold in patience" motif and the transformation from death tourism to engaged witnessing. The parasol tip functions as a physical anchor to this conceptual journey. The ending resists easy moralization, offering instead a reweighting of endings as "gentle unfurling" earned through lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of mismatched destinies emerges organically through concrete details (burned letter edge, autumn vines releasing leaves, nomadic artist versus rooted sentinel). Elena's insight that "not every union is meant to endure fully" avoids simple moralizing while the final image of "unexpected harmonies" reweights their losses. Some passages veer toward explicit theme statements ("destinies that mismatch to make way for unexpected harmonies").

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the preservation of wisdom and the line walker's role as guardian of sacred knowledge. The final line "the world felt a fraction wiser" resonates without moralizing. The recurring imagery of boundaries, lines, and thresholds creates thematic coherence, though the wisdom being preserved remains abstract rather than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of collective healing emerges through the contrast between industrial collapse and natural reclamation, with vines overtaking ruins mirroring Elara's reclamation of narratives. However, the thematic work remains largely abstract ("transmuting isolation into unity") without dramatized struggle or earned insight. The final image of the masterpiece "taking root" offers resonance but lacks the concrete particulars that would make the transformation felt rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of language's resilience emerges through the crystal's sonic properties and the post-dictionary setting, avoiding direct moralizing until the final paragraphs. However, the ending veers into explicit theme statements ("growth was not linear conquest but a hushed evolution") rather than letting the image carry meaning. The concept of language persisting in "unexpected vessels" has potential but isn't dramatized through character cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete pursuit of capturing aging's sound—the "low, resonant hum like breath slowing"—with the final recording offering a non-literal answer about preserving what time erodes. The unwatched videotapes and salvaged electronics create textural resonance, though some passages lean abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of capturing ephemeral moments emerges through concrete images—the spinning clock hand, the falling leaf, the probe's fleeting launch window. The ending resonantly answers the central question about harnessing transience through "nature's understated cue." However, the final line explicitly states the thematic conclusion rather than letting it emerge purely through image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the vinyl fragment transforming from symbol of discord to bridge for reconciliation, with the "hymning the mundane" converting ordinary memories into sacred healing. The final image of mother and daughter clasping hands over the shard while "hope's fragrance lingered" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. Subtext operates well through Elena's weak harmonizing and the placement of the shard aside.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of restoration through patient understanding emerges from Elara's methodical loop-closing and the revelation that shadows maintain "a balance shattered by the Bending." The recurring motif of loops and cycles resonates at closure when Elara becomes capable of "closing its greatest loop." However, the thematic resolution tends toward neat satisfaction—the shadows' purpose is revealed without ambiguity or counter-readings that would create lasting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges through the tension between skepticism and belief, with the changeling myth exploring parental loss and acceptance. However, execution relies heavily on abstract statements ("nostalgic innovation," "mistakes into constellations") rather than dramatized particulars. The final paragraphs explicitly moralize about forgiveness and innovation rather than letting the image resonate, particularly "tales would innovate, mistakes mapped into stars."

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of light without fire emerges organically through concrete action and mother's teachings, avoiding direct moralizing. The sea glass as non-consumptive illumination resonates against the destructive fire backstory. Final image of villagers drawn to reflected light offers non-literal answer to the central question. Some thematic repetition ("pearl of stillness") approaches redundancy without quite crossing into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The reclamation theme emerges organically through concrete imagery: moss overtaking servers, ice patterns revealing "hidden symmetries in chaos," the pendant's transformation. The "honeyed hush" concept successfully bridges sweetness and silence without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of preserving abandoned hopes emerges through the collected visions and finds resonance in the final image of hopes "bound in ink." However, the piece tells its thematic intention too directly ("a testament to the novelist's watchful heart") rather than letting it emerge purely from events. The spiral motif connects to incompleteness but doesn't constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges beautifully through the concrete weaving of "golden stories" from forgotten songs, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of "restoration bloomed eternal" resonates with the cyclical harvest moon motif, and subtext operates through the physical loom becoming a bridge between past and future.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete alchemy of transforming discarded items into meaning, with grief's geography made literal without overt moralizing. The final image of "heartbeats now her compass" resonantly answers the central question of navigating loss, though some passages approach abstract philosophizing ("collective heartbeats of the crater's ghosts").

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of harvesting echoes as preserving wonder against trauma. The final realization that "the harvest was his own reflection" offers a non-literal answer about processing loss through methodical work. Some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement ("storing wonder in the cellar of reason") but the ending image redeems this.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of universal burden emerges organically through Elara's collecting of "human frailty" in stone form. The paradox of finding purpose within entrapment resonates without explicit moralizing. The final image of "starlit vigil" with the cooling lamp effectively reweights her trap as both prison and loom, though the insight about burden-as-release edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through Marcus's lesson—"Loss is the price of living fully; harvest it, or it harvests you"—dramatized via Elara's crystallized memory method and final carving act. The intertwined man-and-lion sculpture she envisions captures the dance of trust and peril without stating morals. Subtext operates through the ash wood's properties (burns slow, endures flames) mirroring Elara's grief-processing. Final image of carving "peace into wood one stroke at a time" offers resonant answer to loss without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of eroded ambitions and halted motion, avoiding direct moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the resurrection metaphor and "equations for hope" without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of time, loss, and acceptance, with the unfinished clock face serving as concrete embodiment. However, the ending's explicit "peace made" and "sanctuary felt less like refuge and more like home" edges toward stated moral rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of deception's architecture emerges through concrete discovery of the journals with their "intricate diagrams of deceit." The sundial motif of "sun's honest judgment" contrasts effectively with the lies theme. However, the final insight about self-deception feels somewhat tidy—the story tells us about complexity but resolves into a clean epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of "philosophical seeds" and the preservation of knowledge against time's erasure. The fulgurite glass as lightning-forged vessel provides a resonant image for capturing ephemeral wisdom. The ending delivers thematic payoff without explicit moralizing, though the philosophical abstractions ("seeds that would bloom for generations") occasionally drift from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The weft thread metaphor elegantly connects physical unraveling to emotional mapping—"her absences...as threads binding her to renewal." The theme of presence within absence emerges organically through Elias's practice of writing obituaries for the living. The final image of continuing "one thread at a time" resonates without explicit moralizing, though the conceptual nature of the work prevents full emotional landing.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between mechanical perfection's "hollow echo" and organic beauty's fragile potential. The egg as "whisper from the flawed beginning" offers resonant answer without moralizing. The "bittersweet" quality captures genuine complexity—hope's fragility against mechanical certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the grafting metaphor and the parallel between Elara's scars and the wanderer's burns, avoiding direct moralizing. The coin as lucky piece turned binding thread offers layered meaning about transformation. The final image of the wanderer's scars "seeming less silent" resonates without stating the moral. Some passages like "believing that even the deepest burns could heal" edge toward explicit theme statement.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between skepticism and belief, with memories as both curse and liberation. The stained glass box's imagery (lovers, children) enriches the thematic question of what's worth preserving. The final image of revived fountains offers a non-literal answer about persistence and faith without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the gear's "generational patterns etched into its alloy" and the recurring petal imagery marking cyclical time. The final image of "generations entwined in its infinite bloom" offers a non-literal answer about continuity's grace and curse. Subtext operates effectively through the "troubling serenity" that masks repetition's hunger, though the resolution could risk more ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete images—ribbons' colored threads revealing "knots of shared lament, loops of enduring love." The transformation from individual to collective mourning resists tidy resolution, embracing grief as "resilient braid" rather than absence. Final dinner scene with Elias's own poem offers non-literal answer to the central question through embodied ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of incremental absolution through sustained duty resonates through clock-winding as penance. The inscriptions-as-confession and shared balance work well. However, the theme sometimes announces itself too directly ("incremental absolution," "shared balance") rather than emerging purely through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.5)
    The chess-as-life metaphor develops through concrete details (knight's move, queen's gambit in tapestry threads) connecting to the historical duel of minds. The theme of intentions as "fluid, tenderly organized by time's hand" emerges from the discovery process. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic statement ("the shape of intentions was not rigid, but fluid") reduces subtlety, though it avoids full moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of transformation through constraint emerges organically from Elara's work as an ignorance cartographer. The concept of "writing the future" before it calcifies resonates through imagery and action, though the ending doesn't quite achieve the non-literal resonance that would reweight all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of stories' persistence through humble vessels emerges organically from dust-as-medium metaphor. The ending resonates without moralizing as "dust in concert halls began to shimmer and speak," though occasional abstractions like "narratives now silenced" could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mirage of safety theme emerges organically through the chair's false motion and porcelain mask without explicit moralizing. The final image of the mask on the stopped chair offers a non-literal answer about illusion and endurance. Strong subtext in the grinding of charcoal to powder. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("somber marvel").

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the sedimentary metaphor - layers of history competing for dominance. The chronometer cog embodies "competing narratives" between "mariner's tale of unyielding stars versus the cartographer's grid of control." Final etching of "quiet defiance, where ancient ticks echoed eternal" resonates without moralizing, though some philosophical passages edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of "subtracting noise" to find harmony, avoiding direct moralizing. The zither's rosette becomes a genuine thematic anchor—"spiraling like woven fates"—that constrains teaching method and charges the final image. The story resists tidy resolution, ending with Elias "expectantly resigned to the next uncertain chord," acknowledging the ongoing nature of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of cultivating in ruins, with the knowledge fruit seed serving as a non-literal vehicle for memory preservation. The final image of "sweet tang of possibility from the earth's patient ruins" resonates without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of preserving wonder against routine's "creeping numbness" emerges organically through Elias's actions and the bee-electricity metaphor, where both drones and humans risk losing purpose to repetition. The riddle's poetry and final image of the "portal to enchantment" offer resonant answers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of restoring displaced objects—the "shard of hush" becomes a tangible symbol of silence that can be transformed into "hushed blaze." The final image of the open door inviting spring breeze outward resonates without stating a moral. The piece successfully explores how small acts of care can reverse entropy, with the orris root anchoring this abstract concept in sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of nuance versus certainty emerges organically through the garden's dual nature (preserving life in stone) and the foxglove's paradox (life/death). The final image of "lifeless blooms" swaying in "gentle defiance" resonates without stating a moral, though some thematic statements ("welcome nuance into certainty") edge toward directness.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The perpetual motion theme elegantly braids through physical stairs, unrealized invention, and mathematical proof—culminating in "perpetual motion reborn as personal triumph." The chipped die's transformation to wholeness resonates as recovery of lost potential without stating the moral explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through accumulated images of kindness across time and languages, avoiding direct moralizing until the whispered "strangers do remember." The lost languages motif constrains choice (specific glyphs painted) and charges closure (languages "alive in his hopeful vigil"). Minor deduction for the slightly overwrought final paragraph that edges toward theme summary.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the paradox of preservation requiring transformation—the ice that protects also imprisons, thawing threatens but enables renewal. The opera glass lens as both observation tool and destructive force enriches this complexity. The final image of viewing "not loss, but fragile revival" through the emerald lens resonates without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of defying predetermined fate emerges organically through the counter-clockwise mechanisms and reversed incantations. The hunger stone transforms from warning to vessel of change. The ending achieves resonance with "every step beyond fate echoed with the sea's mournful sigh," though some passages lean toward explicit theme statements ("threads of destiny snapping").

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme of fear requiring silence but crumbling under revelation emerges through the confession scene but dissolves into explicit moralizing ("fear thrives on silence, crumbles in revelation").

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through action as obstacles become instruments, avoiding direct statements while building meaning through the mallet's transformation of storm into symphony. The final image of the orchard as "floating testament to turning adversity to art" resonates without moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("restless euphony evolved into serene crescendo"). Subtext operates in Leeward's ritual dubbing and the fractal patterns mirroring natural forms.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the cost of forbidden knowledge and the price of breaking boundaries, culminating in the final question that reweights all prior exploration as potentially catastrophic.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of noble lies—the illuminated letter's golden vines mirroring the ivy's deceptive beauty over decay.

Final image of the bare rosebush "ready for whatever truth might bloom next" offers non-literal answer to whether painful truth trumps comforting lies.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of preserving dreams within physical repairs—not stated but enacted. The inkwell as abandoned object mirrors the pavilion's history, creating resonant layers. The ending image of Elias as "archeologist of abandoned dreams now awakened" reweights his initial surveying role, though the phrase "interlaced absences" occasionally abstracts what should remain concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of hidden truth versus surface narrative emerges organically through the discovery sequence. Good use of depth imagery and the contrast between disaster/preservation. The ending offers resonant reconfiguration without heavy moralizing, reweighting the premise through specific discovery rather than abstract statement.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete acts of polishing, folding, and releasing, with grief transformation avoiding tidy resolution ("not erasure, but a fragile peace"). The recurring image of captured dreams in lanterns that become released cranes effectively reweights from containment to liberation, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges through the concept of "unused potential" weaponized for destruction, with the geode serving as a tangible link between personal loss and systemic violence. The ending attempts resonance but states its thesis too directly ("destruction could birth renewal") rather than letting the image carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the concrete metaphor of missing pieces/frequencies, avoiding explicit moralizing while exploring belonging as something discovered "in the interstices, the spaces between stars."

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    The drawer pull successfully evolves from personal talisman to symbol of transformation, accumulating meaning through grandmother's legacy, diplomatic tool, and finally brotherly reconciliation. Theme emerges through action but occasionally surfaces as explicit statement: "recycling old hurts into lessons that endure." The ending image of "mended worlds" resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    The navigation metaphor effectively parallels emotional disorientation, with the broken compass symbolizing Elias's inability to find "true north" in relationships. The theme of following "maps, not your heart" resonates through his shift from celestial to terrestrial navigation. However, the rushed ending with its explicit thematic summary ("his faith no longer flickering but steady") replaces earned resonance with declaration, particularly damaging in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme emerges through the labyrinth-as-choices metaphor and the delicate/robust paradox of second chances, avoiding explicit moralizing until the meta-ending. The empathy kindling from confronting victims works thematically, but the self-aware final paragraph dilutes the earned resonance with unnecessary commentary about story construction.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of transformation through loss emerges through the phoenix metaphor and Elara's metamorphosis, though the fortune cookie's explicit message ("embrace the change you fear") overstates what the scene could demonstrate. The final wolf reunion offers resonance but lacks complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the hand-tracing custom bridging generations and the saucer's crack symbolizing broken promises. The ending achieves resonance as "beauty's chokehold eased into breathable grace" without stating a moral. Some thematic articulation feels overly explicit ("cloudbound repentance bloomed"), but the concrete imagery largely carries the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)

The tear's compassion opposing violence creates genuine thematic tension without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of transformation through giving emerges organically from Elias's actions, with the fireflies' metamorphosis from bottled to free mirroring his understanding. The "gritty silk of change" and phosphorescent shells provide concrete images, though the final insight edges toward explicit statement rather than pure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "winking hush" motif effectively bridges silence as both tactical necessity and revolutionary method, culminating in the group's shared wink that transforms conspiracy into action. The cradle's literal sparks becoming metaphorical revolutionary sparks creates resonant layering without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of pattern-seeking as both curse and key emerges organically through Elara's precognitive visions and mathematical rock placement. The ending reweights the "lingering promise" from burden to beacon, though some passages edge toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of scars-as-navigation emerges organically through imagery and Elias's specific journey from censored poet to active resistance. The final image of emerging "into the storm's embrace" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for one explicit thematic statement ("Scars are the stars we navigate by") that edges toward telling.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of transforming conflict through reframing ("turning questions into destinations") emerges from action rather than statement. The sundial's incomplete markings suggest partial knowledge requiring collaboration. Yet the philosophical framing occasionally tips toward abstraction, and the ending's transformation feels slightly too neat without exploring the genuine risk in Elias's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    The central theme of transforming "chaos into communal light" emerges through concrete library rebuilding rather than abstraction. The coffee tin functions as effective motif linking vagrant past to prison resistance, though the ending line "poetry and friendship could hammer chaos" edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.7)
    The flickering compasses motif develops from hidden film frames into a metaphor for "paths unchosen" and ultimately points toward new possibility, though the concept risks abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the interplay of memory, doubt, and cultural preservation without explicit moralizing.

    Theme emerges organically through the bonsai metaphor ("shaping life against the wind"), with the final image of pruning "the future's twisted limbs" offering a non-literal answer about processing grief through patient craft.

    Themes of absence, betrayal, and memory-as-forge resonate through recurring images (aurora, forge, lattice, silences).

Resonance lingers credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of mended deception, earned intimacy with place, and the insufficiency of quantified luck emerge from concrete motifs and the closing image. The marble’s journey reframes prior rituals, creating resonance without heavy moralizing, though “unquantifiable truth” edges toward explicit statement. Subtext in the garden’s reciprocal responses carries the weight. The ending lingers conceptually despite low on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of lateral time and human curiosity merges with alien rhythms through image—wings at rest, holographic weave. The ending reframes time’s flow effectively but edges into declared significance (“proving the sideways flow,” “crystallized”). Subtext lives in the “icy warmth” counterpoint of machine and organism, human and alien. Resonance lingers, but moral or existential cost remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice/silence, liminality, and betrayal cohere through image rather than thesis. The ending reweights prior motifs (hush, water, lanterns) into a charged poise: resolution with cost. Subtext (art as bridge, cost of breaking the veil) feels earned and unsentimental. No moralizing undercuts the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Occupying margins,” “swaying certainties,” and auroral sorrow interlock to deliver a resonant, non-literal answer: hold truth at the edges to bear it without breaking. The edelweiss’s blurred border reconfigures earlier images at closure. A few lines state theme overtly (“Certainties sway...”) but the primary effect still arises from image and action. The ending’s charged threshold image lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres around human-made hauntings, industrial culpability, and the burden of untold truths, carried by specific images (beads like “frozen tears,” the ghost shift, the burning valve). Subtext flows through implication and parallel confession rather than moralizing. One explicit thematic assertion (“not supernatural, but the human kind”) edges toward telling but doesn’t break resonance. The closing image reweights earlier material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres around surrender to change and the healing silence that reframes decay; images do the work without sermonizing. The swan’s reprise on the altar and the obsidian chamber translate philosophy into concrete ritual. Ambiguity invites reflection yet stays legible. The resonance is high though not quite transformative in its final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    “Ordinary magic” emerges through particular acts—breath-synced music, the curl’s transfer, and the eclipse hush—rather than solely as assertion. The final image reweights loss into continuity without moralizing. Occasional direct phrasing (“Ordinary magic…”) nudges toward telling but does not undercut the earned resonance. Subtext operates through silence and shared attention.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, custodianship, and irreparable imbalance cohere through recurring images (walls, weave, axis, dragons as mourners). The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: preserve and re-dream rather than restore, fitting the “last dream” world. Subtext accrues through objects and setting rather than moralizing. It’s complex without becoming muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of agency vs fate and “open secrets” emerge organically through the cookie/microdot conceit and island dynamics. The final exchange (“After last orders, truths come out”) and beam piercing fog reweight prior images without moralizing. Resonance is earned, if quiet. Slight neatness in the last beats trims the lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of dominion, ownership, and the revaluation of silence accrue through image and method, culminating in a non-literal answer at the close. Rhetorical devices embody the thesis rather than merely state it, though some lines verge on direct statement. The midnight blue motif shifts meaning toward focus and unity. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing, albeit with a slightly didactic tint.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Time, memory, and art-as-conducting cohere through recurring images (shell, mirrored horizon, hush) rather than thesis statements. The final stance reweights earlier particulars without moralizing. One aphoristic line (“In the echo of yesterday’s laugh…”) edges toward platitude but is grounded by scene texture. The resonance lingers as a felt retrieval rather than an easy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of multiplicity, self-authorship, and recurrence integrate through recurring images (drop/ripple, glow, code/fractals). The line “the labyrinth was her own creation” states the thesis a bit directly, dulling subtext. Nonetheless, the final “periodically eternal now” reframes recurrence as chosen stasis, offering resonance. The emotional aftereffect is luminous more than haunting, with complexity but limited bite.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silence, reversal, and grief braid into a coherent theme without moralizing; “filament of hush” develops from concept to operating principle. The final image reweights prior material (muted world → “quiet fire”) with earned emotion. Subtext in backward-play as grief inversion is elegant. Slight motif insistence keeps it just shy of exceptional subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of integrity maintained through lateral, indirect resistance emerges organically from choices and images (pigeon, tube, storm logs). The “solitude as the forge” line leans didactic but is supported by prior particulars. The final image reweights earlier motifs without a pat moral. Subtext of surveillance and corruption operates through implication, not speech.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory as sensory bridge and impermanence of joy arise organically from particulars (scent, extinct bloom, revival). The final insight is emotionally honest but edges into explicit thesis (“the impact of memories lay…”), dulling subtext. The ending image still resonates via action (kneeling, allowing grief). Complexity remains, but the moral is somewhat stated.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres around time’s texture, moral ambiguity, and the trade between scars and stardust; motifs (rope, spirals, layers) accrue meaning and shift at the end. Subtext in the beings’ desperation reweights human temporality without sermonizing. A few on-the-nose phrasings (“ethically playful,” explicit musing on the dilemma) and the meta-count aside dampen the afterglow. Still, the quiet ending invites reflection beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: unfinished beauty reclaimed through echo, ritual, and community. Recurring images (hush, water ripples, pebbles) reweight at the end without overt moralizing. A few lines walk close to thesis-statement territory, but the imagery does the heavier lift. The final vessel-by-ashes image lingers with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of authenticity, half-truths, and empathy emerge through concrete particulars (scent notes, static test). The final revaluation—that her “counterfeits” were fragments tending toward wholeness—resonates. A few lines state the thesis too plainly (“would heal”; “no more mere simulations”), trimming subtext. Overall, the motif patterning supports a reflective after-echo.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Cycles of compassion emerge organically via the locket lineage and the logistics–archive partnership, with a resonant final image of “returns yet to come.” Subtext operates through objects and vocation rather than lecture. A few lines approach overt statement, softening complexity. Still, the thematic weave feels coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motifs of webs, lost languages, and craft braid into a coherent theme of communal reweaving. The final dedication reweights earlier images effectively. A few direct statements (“Kinship, once elusive…”) edge toward explication over subtext. Still, the piece leaves a reflective afterglow rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motifs (infinity loop, echoes, cadence) braid a theme of art, time-theft, and legacy; the final “unresolved yet complete” cadence reweights the journey without moralizing. The pendant’s loop becomes a thematic snare and signature—creation gains permanence at a cost. The resonance is genuine, though a deeper on-page wrestle with the ethics of borrowing time could heighten complexity. Ambiguity lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: dovetailing grief into life’s structure via mathematics and gentled magic, culminating in a hope that is not erasure. Recurring images (stone fractures, glass eyes, dripping “tears”) gain new weight at the end. One line edges toward thesis-stating (“perhaps loss was not erasure...”), slightly reducing subtext. Overall resonance lingers and avoids platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of visibility, legacy, and quiet caretaking arise from particulars—the tape fragment and caches—rather than thesis statements. The final act and note reweight earlier images without sermonizing; “you are seen” risks sentimentality but stays in-character as a reclaimed family ethic. Subtext in shared silence with the woman carries the resonance. The piece invites reflection without tying a bow.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around control vs. surrender and observer vs. participant, resolved through embodied choice. Recurring images (leaf behaviors) are reweighted at the end to imply a lasting hybrid ethic. The “circuitously sincere” admission grounds subtext without tipping into moralizing. Resonance lingers in the costed union rather than a stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (rain trails, “threshing”/harvest, convergence) accumulate toward a resonant answer: meaning arises in exchange. Subtext lives in the trade—stories for brooch and water—without heavy exposition during the scene. The final paragraph edges toward thesis-statement clarity (“meaning emerged not in solitude”), slightly flattening the resonance. Still, the returned images hold thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Resonant inquiry into the peril of “magnification” and the ethics of guardianship vs. exploitation emerges through particulars. The “bright darkness” and unseen forces reweight the premise at the end: enlightenment as possession. No sermonizing; the final image implies a conceptual price for wonder. Thematically integrated, if not radically layered by counter-impulse debate.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—loss refigured as forging through compiled fragments—emerges organically from objects and action, culminating in the hum that re-prices exile. A single explicit line (“the exile was not mere loss, but a forging”) edges toward statement, slightly dulling subtext. Still, the motifs (absences, intervals, runes) accrue meaning and the ending invites reflection without sermonizing. The resonance lingers through image rather than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Maps vs destiny, lies vs truth, and “new starts” cohere through recurring images (cracks-as-arrows, punched rune as commitment). The final image reweights the opening motif without didacticism, though “where bad habits would shatter and new starts await” brushes close to overt thematizing. Resonance arises from particulars (sigil, punch, mist) rather than abstract statements. The aftertaste is reflective and earned if not deeply paradoxical.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: reflection as attention to connecting patterns rather than belief. The magic square/whale migration pattern mirrors the entangled memories with satisfying subtext. A few lines edge toward thesis-stating at the end, but the images carry most of the weight. The final image reweights prior material without collapsing into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of eternity, rebellion of dimensions, and post-goodbye transformation cohere and are rooted in image systems. However, the line “Not an end... but a quiet revolution of the soul” tips into thesis-stating, softening subtext. The final repricing is resonant but stated rather than fully left in image. The motif net (prisms, hush, mutiny) carries much of the weight effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of fairness, deception, and inheritance resonate through object and setting, culminating in Elena’s recalibration of Marco. However, the explicit “formula” passage reads like a thesis statement, undercutting subtext in the crucial final paragraphs. The imagery (ink liquefying rigidity) otherwise carries the theme well.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of preservation vs. erasure, art as bulwark, and how “invented histories” can heal are integrated through recurring images (gold leaf, refracted light, hum as seismograph). The ending reweights prior material: invention becomes praxis. Subtext is handled through motifs rather than stated moralizing, maintaining ambiguity about truth vs. fabrication. Slight sentiment drift in the hopeful finale trims edge.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    Erased histories, bureaucratic violence, and memory’s texture interweave through concrete particulars (poison label, migrant manifest, lost heirlooms) and culminate in a reweighted self-conception. Subtext operates in object recurrence and mirrored anecdotes; there’s no sermonizing. The ending reframes survival as charged namelessness with ethical and existential bite. A slightly riskier moral calculus in-scene could deepen the thematic burn.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the shell pointing inward, the cello’s “retells,” and the observatory exhaling a “final chapter.” The ending reweights the opening premise—myth-busting becomes a quest for transience’s truth—without collapsing into a moral. Occasional explicitness (“universal riddle,” “decoded not by science”) edges toward telling but doesn’t overwhelm subtext. The final carry of the shell offers lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme arises organically from actions: honoring a foundation while adapting, unity through coded art, dual allegiances reconciled. Recurrences (chip, murals, phoenix) reweight meaning at the end without didactic moralizing. A couple of direct phrases (“navigate gentrification”) tilt toward overt statement but don’t overwhelm subtext. The final vote offers a resonant, non-literal answer consistent with the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Preservation vs progress accrues through particulars (nightwatch sand recontextualized, automated sentries vs human vigil). The final image conceptually reprices the hourglass grain and the hush, avoiding overt moralizing despite a near-direct line (“space age marched on”). Subtext lives in endurance and ritual rather than thesis. It lingers with earned wistfulness.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of repair, perception beyond sight, and stewardship of wanderers emerge organically from action and image. The hummingbird reprise and “magnetic calm” subtly reweight the world’s veiled corners without sermonizing. Ambiguity is purposeful and reflective. The meta line briefly punctures resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Order vs. myth, convergence vs. divergence, and the ethics of mapping emerge through particulars (window veins, dog-eared phrasebook, rust). The ending reweights earlier images—“even the window conspires”—into a quiet meditation on origins and the cost of knowledge. No sermonizing; the resonance lingers. A touch more ambivalence at the last step could deepen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres around communal balance restored through coordinated, purposeful motion; the closing image reframes hush as “living breath.” Recurring motifs (hush, rhythm, bells) deepen meaning without overt moralizing. The riddle and the farmer’s beat strengthen subtext about participation and attunement. The resonance lingers beyond plot specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from particulars: ephemeral fragrance/silence, memory-tide, and surrender over force. The gathered hush reweights meaning at the end, shifting isolation into “intimate power” without stating a moral. A few phrases flirt with abstraction (the label “ephemeral”), but the images (nets, kelp, vial) carry the weight. The final cadence resonates beyond plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme arises organically: belief, truth, and inherited myth transformed into a personal narrative that can “repose in truth.” Recurring images (lattice, hush, reef, copperlight) reweight at the end without sermonizing; one line edges close to moral (“not to silence the past...”) but is anchored in action. Subtext—loneliness as the source of the father’s lies—lands through image rather than exposition. Resonance lingers in the final hush and tamed “wolf.”

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of transmutation, debt, and love-as-venom emerge organically from the alchemical setting and recurring bead. The final image reweights the orchard as a memorial/evidence of cost. A few abstract formulations (“debt across lifetimes,” “ultimate betrayal”) skim toward statement. Subtext is strong in images, slightly stated in places.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of repair, communal reweaving, and the sanctification of broken precedents emerge organically through image and action. The plate’s cracked altar and the mantra-like stitch line reframe ruin into reverence without sermonizing. A few explicit phrasings (“from ruin to reverence”) skate close to thesis-speak but are integrated into ritual rather than commentary. The final echo of tides and voices sustains resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Interrupted journeys, diaspora return, and the sundial’s re-weighted meaning braid into a coherent thematic arc. The ending re-frames continuity as the answer to interruption without overt moralizing, though several lines come close to stating the thesis. The motif set (roots/bones, travelers’ shards) deepens resonance. Complexity is present but comfortable rather than cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of analog tactility versus digital speed is organically threaded through chalk codes and surface mail. The final juxtaposition crystallizes this without needing explanation. However, lines like “Find the poetry in what they ignore” and “driven by the unyielding drive to illuminate the margins” edge into thesis articulation, softening subtext. Resonance lingers, but the sermon slips keep it shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around listening to suppressed truths and how performance of foolishness can protect truth-tellers. Recurring images (silence, stitches, flame) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final “beacon” image offers a resonant answer about vigilance and witness. Slight softness in on-page cost keeps it just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of silence, pride, and reparative speech emerge through objects and acts (unsent letters, breath-written messages) rather than thesis statements. The healing shard mirrors moral mending without heavy-handed allegory. The ending reweights the premise: choosing speech rewrites options, not the past. Minor explicitness (“truth demanded clarity”) trims mystery but not resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs—mist, sea, coral, grafting—cohere around shared anxiety and communal healing. The final image reweights prior material without over-explaining. A few lines edge toward on-the-nose (“In this act, she grafted new meaning”), but the piece largely earns its insights via particulars. Emotional aftereffect is tender rather than sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Light, exposure, harvest, and communal memory cohere into a meaningful theme of rekindled creative joy. The “exposed film” conceit reappears to reweight the ending image. Some overt statements (“the daydream’s gift was eternal”) and meta interjections flatten the subtext. Still, the piece invites reflection on how art communes across time.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (curiosity over certainty; art as dialogue with the unseen) emerges through image and action, especially the nested reflections. Subtext is strong in the embodied awakenings and the coin’s history as hardship-beauty. However, the closing line explicitly states the thesis, tipping into on-the-nose moralizing that dulls resonance. The piece still leaves a reflective aftertaste through its final images.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of censorship, coded community, and resistance as cultivation emerge organically through planting and the evolving “RESIST” glyph. Recurring images (seed, rattle, vines, swarm) gain resonance in the final “plant your spark in the wild” repricing. A few lines edge toward thesis statements, but subtext largely carries meaning. The closing image lingers without neat moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: pain metabolized into beauty without erasure, an armistice rather than victory. Recurring images (postcard, wind, reef-shadow joy) shift meaning at the end. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the idea that insomnia becomes “watchful wonder.” The countercurrent of doubt prevents sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory, extinction of feelings, and the ethics of caretaking emerge organically through object-work and process. The lullaby-as-repair and foxglove-tinted regret reconfigure the final image without moralizing. A few lines verge on thesis (“names carried the weight of extinct feelings”), but scene pressure largely carries the resonance. The ending offers a quiet, earned refusal to yield to oblivion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Truth as music that requires honesty integrates theme with action; the method enacts the idea rather than stating a moral. The last image—ink corked, symphony fading to “hopeful quiet”—reweights the opening silence. A few explicit lines (“chords of truth that demand honesty”) edge toward thesis-y, but subtext predominates in vows and hums. Resonance lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through particulars—the adhesive cipher as “encrypted compassion,” the chain’s revaluation, the amphitheater’s history. A few lines edge toward explicit moralizing (“urging harmony”), but the final image largely carries resonance without stating a moral. The ethical complexity feels earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of authenticity versus fabrication accrues through recurring particulars (paper trails vs. meteorite’s “unyielding reality,” dust-mote charts becoming musical staffs). The final shared talisman reweights prior images without moralizing. Subtext in objects and rituals avoids sermonizing and lingers. Slight neatness in the renewal arc keeps it just shy of exceptional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The motif of “necessary distances” threads through maze lore, aviation codes, and the prism tactic, culminating in a reweighting of connection through space. However, lines like “core concept crystallize” and “necessary distances were the quiet architects of meaning” tilt toward explicit thesis. Despite minor on-the-nose moments, the final image re-situates earlier particulars with resonance. The theme arises mostly from images and choices, not mere assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    Belonging/bridge-between-realms is integrated through feather, ley lines, and AI–human kinship, culminating in a reweighted final image. Subtext mostly lives in images and setting; occasional telling (“shared her motivation”; meta notes) blunts resonance. The ending offers an implicit answer without moralizing. The motifs reprise with some freshness rather than token recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Recurring images (foam, seeds, paths, script) braid into a coherent theme about potential, neglect, and choosing. However, multiple direct thesis-statements (“Paths disappear not from erasure…,” “Embrace the scatter…”) slide toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The final realization is earned by specific acts but voiced a bit too didactically. Still, the closing image refracts earlier motifs with emotional afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of ordering randomness, artistry versus monotony, and the diagonal cut of the bishop recur coherently. Some lines state theme outright (“Randomness is the sea’s gift,” “his motivation clear”), dulling subtext. Still, images carry weight—the bishop’s decree reframes the ordinary, and the sea’s pulse syncs the designed serendipity. The final image invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory’s prohibition, art as rebellion, and transforming nostalgia into present-tense creation emerge through action rather than thesis. Recurring motifs (obsidian grace, gaps, tides) accrue meaning and reweight in the final ascent. The ending offers a quiet, resonant answer—making a bridge from exile to infinity—without moralizing. Slight neatness in the uplift limits complexity, but subtext remains rich.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coheres around valuing the mundane and refracting ordinary labor into wonder, with recurring images (ripples, prisms) evolving by the end. However, several lines state the thesis outright (“He yearned to illuminate the value in the mundane,” “noctilucent reckonings”), edging toward tell. The final image reweights prior material without fully escaping overt statement. Subtext exists but could carry more of the burden.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—innocence bartered into hard-won empathy—emerges through images (scars, fissured porcelain) but is undercut by direct moralizing near the end (“universal language,” “blooomed into wisdom”). Subtext in the box-as-bridge is strong, yet the final paragraph states the thesis rather than letting the image carry it. The emotional after-effect is present but softened by declaration. A quieter closing image without the meta-assertions would resonate more.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hope-as-calculus emerges through objects and acts (gauge repurposing, pattern-math), and the final image reweights prior images. Occasional direct statements (“Hope =…,” “by anchoring dreams to logic…”) verge on thesis-like clarity, trimming ambiguity. Still, the recurrent imagery earns a resonant, non-moralizing close. The father’s relic subtly deepens the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of legacy’s burden evolving into atonement emerges from particulars (soot-dusted hearth, charred diaries, industrial sins) rather than lecture. The final whisper of shared hope across time offers a resonant answer to the premise. One sentence edges toward moral statement (“demanded atonement… map of repair”), slightly reducing ambiguity. Overall, subtext carries more than assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of impermanence, the ethics of illusion, and art as bargaining with possibility emerge through concrete images. The final reweighting (borrowed heartbeat freed; mirrors as allies) offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Recurring motifs (bells, prism, lullabies) evolve meaningfully. Slight sentimentality edges in, but subtext carries more than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of redemption’s price and flawed peace recur through concrete images (flawed marble, blood ink, fading role), culminating in a resonant final image. Occasional explicit statement (“The core concept burned… the price of redemption…”) edges toward didactic, reducing subtext. Still, the ending reweights earlier motifs without a tidy moral. Ambiguity remains: peace may hold or shatter.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from particulars: fractures as maps, control vs. restitution, echoes vs. erasure. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, letting the echo/rain carry the answer. A few explicit lines articulate thesis a bit too directly, softening subtext. Overall resonance lingers and avoids neat absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of individuality versus conformity arises organically through the “lullaby” motif, the echoes of dissent, and Elara’s ritual. The final image conceptually reprices the world (sanctuary opened; conformity alerted), inviting reflection without moralizing. A few lines edge toward explicit statement, but most resonance is image-driven. The echo motif deepens rather than decorates.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from concrete images (puppets, stick, campfire) and the agency inversion insight. The final vow reframes subversion toward bridge-building, with the dome’s hush echoing the ethical pivot. A few lines verge on moral statement (“storytelling’s ethic lay…”) rather than letting images do all the work. Subtext remains largely intact and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memory, ephemerality, and “interrupted cadence” emerge organically from image and action rather than sermonizing. The moth wing and transient totems accrue meaning and are reweighted by the gust’s interruption. The ending refuses neat moralization, settling into a resonant hush that invites reflection. A few abstract labels (e.g., “esoteric realist”) skim close to thesis, but they’re mostly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of forgiveness, lineage, and preservation emerge organically through objects and task, not explained. The final whispers offer a resonant non-literal answer: repaired self allows recovered communal memory. Recurring thaw/light images modulate rather than sermonize. Complexity remains in the sense of loss that cannot be fully undone.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of agency vs fate and balance vs decay emerge through motifs (vines, storm, walkers/paths). The final action reframes her “hindsight foresight” as guidance, landing a resonant if quiet answer. However, the dream figure’s line “transcend the illusion of control” states thesis a bit baldly, thinning subtext. The piece invites reflection but skirts didacticism at its apex.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around devotion versus empiricism, with the magic square bridging cosmos and ritual. Recurring motifs (encrypted notes, sums to fifteen, “void brimming with unseen energy”) reweight meaning at the end. “Empirically ironic” is over-explicit and slightly flattens subtext. Still, the final image rephrases knowledge as covenant rather than proof.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of forgiveness, release, and “shifting grace” are integrated with object and setting, but occasionally stated too directly (“Resentment… was a chain”). Subtext operates in silence and touch, yet the piece sometimes explains what the image already carries. The closure’s grace-as-stabilization resonates. More ambiguity would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: erasing boundaries between earth/sky, craft/dream, ruin/infinity, achieved through concrete acts rather than moralizing. The sextant’s original cosmological purpose reweights the ending elegantly. Ambiguity lingers in a productive way (vision vs. reality) without confusion. Slight cap for the relatively gentle cost profile.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: “deciduous vows” transform from betrayal into regenerative wisdom via the ribbon’s intergenerational binding. The final images (eye accepted by a seeker, ribbon on a branch) carry resonance without didactic closure. One line edges on the nose (“not rigid contracts, but the persistence of feisty hearts”), trimming ambiguity. Nevertheless, the subtext largely arises from action and object work.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of projection, inheritance, and nonlinear fate arise organically from the cameo’s blankness and the bathroom-as-threshold device. The final image reweights the motifs (orchard, cameo, curation) without a neat moral. A few lines verge on telling the thesis (“blankness was its message”) rather than letting subtext carry it. Still, resonance lingers through image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs of “unheard symphony,” narrative gaps, and “unlearned lessons” cohere into a theme about redeeming oversight through attentive reading of omissions. The fern as “unheard echo” elegantly refracts the thesis and reweights the climax. The ending avoids moralizing while offering a resonant answer—closure as composition from discord—though complexity could deepen with sharper ambivalence or cost. Subtext operates in image more than dialogue and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Identity, memory, and names bloom through concrete images (garden of names, graffiti half-erased) rather than moralizing. “Trapped freedom” and “unkindled solace” recur and reweight at the end when the ship denies shore yet she commits to weaving. The thematic weave integrates with the object (swatch) and method (story-threading). A touch of abstract diction keeps the resonance slightly generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of absence vs. presence and clarity vs. confusion arise organically through objects and action (rope binding absences; seal restoring record). The ending reweights the motif into a lived practice—fables as guides not ghosts—without sermonizing. Some thematic phrases are reiterated overtly, skimming the edge of explicitness. Overall, resonance is earned through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of forging stillness from discord and mending via attention emerge organically from action and image. The “bloom of hush” reframes violence into care, offering a resonant non-literal answer without sermonizing. Subtext in the caves’ “mourning” and lineage obligations deepens the frame. Slight tidiness in the healing moment curtails lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motifs (thistles, hum/hush, star paths) braid into the theme of meaning in randomness. The ending reframes coincidence as a “quiet language,” but the explicit articulation leans toward moralizing, reducing subtext. Still, the rekindled light and silence motif provide a resonant, non-literal answer. Greater ambiguity or image-led finish would heighten depth.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of identity sculpted from experience emerges through concrete ritual and recurrent images (shadows, quill, crystal). The final recognition reframes her role as both product and guardian of shared memory. Occasional explicit statements (“foreshadows unraveling,” preserving cohesion) edge toward telling. Resonance lingers, if more intellectual than gutting.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of transmuting despair into communal wonder emerge organically via process and image. The fireworks resolving into “Rise” is potent but a touch literal, edging toward thesis statement. Subtext hums in the filtered night and charged objects; play vs. solemnity coheres. More ambivalence at the end could have complicated the victory and deepened resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through particulars: liminality, the cicada’s rebirth symbolism, and water/starlight interplay. The final image reweights prior material, but the line “Time’s texture in transition...” veers toward thesis, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the piece invites reflection on pause as agency and on gentleness as a tactic. Resonance lingers without becoming moralistic overall.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of refuge versus confinement, scarcity of true quiet, and the ethics of preservation accrue through image (trellis hospitality, gold-tasted hush) rather than lecture. The father-daughter dynamic refracts the theme without overexplaining. The closing line risks on-the-nose thesis articulation but remains character-coherent and resonant. Subtext hums in the doll’s secret weight against the father’s obliviousness.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silence as gathered solace emerges through practice and result, though one line states the thesis directly (“Noise scatters us…”). The storm glass and mist provide a concrete vector for the abstract theme, culminating in Lira’s embodied easing. Resonance lingers, if gently, with a credible refusal of grand epiphany. Complexity is modest but honest.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    Futuristic nostalgia is thematically coherent, with the orchard and throne as bridges between eras. However, the final assertions (“wisdom, not machines”) skew didactic, reducing subtext. The ruby’s dissolution hints at a price but is not emotionally leveraged. Resonance is present but somewhat told.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Scars as maps, bridges burned to “build better air,” and the threshold’s stabilization cohere around boundary-ethics and tough love. Some lines state the thesis directly, slightly muting subtext (“to teach the suffocating to breathe”). Even so, the final image reweights earlier motifs effectively. The piece invites reflection on harm-as-help without didactic symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of inversion (scheme → salvation, pressure → diamonds) and communal repair emerge organically from the action and images. The bolt, vent, and mushrooms act as thematic conduits. A few lines verge on telling the thesis (“turn scheme into salvation”), slightly flattening subtext. The final talisman image sustains resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of legacy, illegitimacy, and liberation through truth emerge organically from image and action. Recurring motifs (standing waves, crank handle, golden shadows) reweight meaning in the final cadence. No moralizing; the ending offers a resonant repricing of lineage and power. The subtlety convinces without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of allegiance, agency, and transformation from withdrawal to creation are embedded via marionette imagery and string/fate motifs that shift meaning at closure. The program-as-key reframes art as governance of possibility, a resonant answer to solitude. Occasional explicitness (“guardian not of solitude, but of boundless potential”) trims ambiguity slightly. Overall, resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of remembrance, tenderness amid historical upheaval, and grief’s redirection into service arise organically from particulars (doll, wildflowers, pay donation). The button and dust accrue meaning and reweight the ending. A single explicit line about her motivation edges toward telling, but the piece largely trusts image and action. The final charged poise avoids a pat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motifs (auric light, relic key, voices on holotape) align with the theme of memory versus enforced apathy and reweight the ending. However, thematic language is often stated rather than earned (“tyranny of indifference,” “coded freedom”), nudging toward thesis-speak. The final image embodies resistance renewed without moralizing outright. Subtext exists in the relics and water, though some lines tilt didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silence as agency, negative space as ethics, and nostalgia’s double edge thread the piece without moralizing. Recurring images (mist, prisms, dewdrops) reweight meaning at the end, where release is tangible yet wordless. The grandmother’s code and the hush of inheritance crystallize a generational theme. Complexity is present without tidy thesis-stating.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of balance between order and wildness and of memory/prophesy entwine with the method of “tiny monuments.” The ending reweights prior images, but a line like “the leaves' message was one of balance” presses toward a stated moral. Subtext mostly rides image and ritual, which is effective. Resonance lingers, though not with complex ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motifs (clocks, leaves, ashes, compass without needle) accrue into a coherent meditation on uncertainty guiding choice. The final image promises a life “unbound by clocks,” reweighting earlier particulars. A few lines overstate theme (“key to befriending uncertainty”), softening subtext, but resonance endures.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The kintsugi ethic and the “weight of names” integrate theme with action; the repaired crucible reweights prior guilt without sermonizing. The line “Names weigh because they remember” edges toward thesis-statement explicitness, slightly flattening subtext in the final third. Still, the final acceptance reads as earned wisdom from specific ordeal. Motifs recur with transformed meaning rather than token reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme (laughter as integrative healing) emerges from the specific tactic of retuning the harp and the bittersweet register of the ending. One line edges toward thesis (“Healing isn’t in silence”), but the piece largely lets image and action do the work. The final cadence reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext about turning personal sorrow into service lingers convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—mercy as patterned rather than random—emerges through tactile struggle and image systems (roots, light, maps) more than pronouncement, though a few lines edge toward stated thesis. The “mathematics of mercy” motif is made concrete via pain thresholds and cartographic past. The ending reweights prior images without a tidy moral. Subtext rides the object and environment rather than overt sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of memory, lineage, and the ethics of honoring the overlooked emerge through particulars (constellation matching her scars, knotted-rope glyph, market breathing). The ending reweights the premise with a shared breath across realms rather than a stated moral. A few direct statements of motivation tread close to telling, but subtext mostly carries. Resonance lingers through the father/daughter echo and the now-whole “anchors of intuition.”

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of façades, hidden burdens, and the ethics of spectacle cohere through the cracked ceiling, ledgers, and “weightless burden.” Some lines tilt toward telling (“he discovered what ceilings hide: not just relics...”), but recurring images do much of the work. The ending reweights prior images without a didactic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of entropy vs. perfection, knowledge’s liveliness vs. curation, and the paradox of freezing time emerge organically through event and image. “Rustling awakenings” reframes the library’s ideal as a fragile veneer, reweighted in the final stasis. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the cost of triumph. A hair more ambiguity about what eternity means for Elias personally could deepen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around reinvention vs. empirical truth, the ethics of myth, and communal healing; the shard and veils recur with reweighted meaning. Subtext hums (consensus built through ritualized fiction), culminating in “sorrow burnished, but never extinguished,” which resists simple moralizing while skirting explicit thesis. The ending image reconfigures the premise without over-explaining. A slightly tidier success dampens the lingering ache.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme integrates through particulars: mending over breaking, truth as restorative force, and a covenant rebalanced rather than destroyed. The stone’s aversion to dishonesty concretizes a moral axis without sermonizing. The final image (rust sloughing to gold, dawn returning) offers a resonant answer consistent with earlier images. Complexity remains modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of purification after industry, memory in objects, and the ethics of knowing are integrated through particulars (petrichor, the compass, the lagoon). The final repricing—collecting awakenings instead of scent—quietly reframes earlier details without moralizing. The piece embraces mystery over answers, yielding resonance. Depth would rise with a sharper ethical rub at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (driftwood, knots, layered lines) coherently embody the theme of simplicity scaffolding complexity across time. The ending offers a non-literal answer—reweaving alliances through craft—but edges toward stated thesis (“perpetual learning meant…”) which trims mystery. Subtext lives in the craft-as-covenant metaphor; it resonates without sermonizing elsewhere. Overall, thematic integration is strong though slightly over-articulated in the last lines.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of hiddenness, grief, and claiming light emerge organically from concrete particulars (postcards, etched window, dawn hush). The concluding insight risks explicitness (“flowers bloomed at night to claim their own light”) but is earned by the tactile buildup. Subtext around the grandmother’s secret loves resonates without sermonizing. The mural choice refracts theme into forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and ethical negotiation with the past emerge through concrete acts (sinking/preserving diaries, parley to unlock history). Recurring images (lagoon, letters, diary) shift meaning by the end from burden to release. No moralizing interferes; resonance lingers in the idea that truth demands ritual, risk, and witness. Slight overstatement in diction limits subtlety in places.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of rejecting expedient magic for communal, sustainable craft emerge clearly through the bottle’s renunciation and the lanterns’ transformation. Occasional thesis-forward lines (“false comfort”) verge on telling, but the final image earns resonance without moralizing. The conceptual repricing of the bottle is strong. Greater subtext via action in place of overt labels would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memory, oath-keeping, and the ethics of archiving versus living feeling emerge from concrete events and objects. The dead language and maritime lineage deepen the question of what is preserved and what is lost. One line edges toward explicit moralization (“he understood”), but the final image earns resonance. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of preservation vs entropy and stewardship across generations emerge organically through seeds, the oak cap, and the “borrowed time” texture. The final image (vortex reopened, core thaw, dew) offers a quiet, resonant answer without moralizing. Occasional abstract phrasing (entropy language) verges on telling but is generally grounded by concrete acts. Ambiguity lingers in a purposeful, not confusing way.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Listening over noise, ancient intuition vs. mechanical alarm, and solstice quiet braid coherently into the ending. The bell choice serves as a non-literal answer to the thematic question without platitudes. A couple of declarative sentences flirt with explicit statement, but the imagery carries the weight. The final suggestion that the mountain “approved” walks the line yet supports the piece’s mythic hush.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres around “flourishing stillness” and vulnerability transformed into strength through empathic attention. Recurring images (falling stars, lantern glass, hush) reweight meaning at the end. Some lines verge on statement (“strength not in unyielding armor”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance lingers, with a clear non-literal answer embodied in the final charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stewardship, covenant, and the ethics of silence emerge organically through image (rusted frames, spectral hands, runed bees) rather than thesis. The final image reweights prior material—silence as preservation rather than absence. Moments like “words would dissipate the covenant’s gravity” risk abstraction, but the scene keeps meaning grounded in action. Thematic aftertaste lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    The thematic arc—from time as debt/loss to time as connective weave—emerges through objects and acts, not just assertion. The final reweighting lands through charged image (silo-beacon, shared eternity), though the sentence “time’s texture was not loss” veers toward telling. Subtext threads through the coded listings and the urn’s re-signified runes. Resonance lingers beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs (feather, kite, woven dawns) integrate to articulate a clear theme of valuing the incomplete, with the snap reweighting prior material. However, the text edges into overt moralizing (“true beauty lay not in perfection”) that reduces subtext. The strongest resonance comes from images, not statements. The ending still lingers conceptually despite the explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thematic throughline—reciprocity between human craft and sentient wilds—emerges via particulars (wire as conduit, murals of pact) rather than thesis statement. The final image reweights prior material (respect becomes literal energy exchange). Slight sentimentality creeps in with the near-miraculous healing, flattening complexity. More friction or counter-pressure would deepen the ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of unity vs skepticism and “homecoming as fusion” emerge via motifs (footprints, convergence, amber), achieving a credible repricing at the end. Some phrasing edges toward thesis-statement (“homecoming was no singular chemistry”), shaving subtlety. The final image (rain washing, amber set down, shared nod) carries resonance. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Restoration versus devastation, language as bridge, and reciprocity with the nonhuman are woven through concrete acts rather than sermon. The “submerged concord” reactivating at the end reweights prior images without stating a moral. A hint of tidy wish-fulfillment (sprouts appearing immediately) grazes sentimentality. Still, the closing harmony retains earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of distortion (“tinted revelations”), memory as echo, and survival ethics interweave without sermonizing. Recurring images (leaf, hush, grooves/veins) shift meaning by the end, reweighting the premise. The final stance resists tidy moral closure while landing emotionally. Subtext about complicity and engineered scarcity is present but secondary to the intimate core.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    “True north” and the compass recur as motifs that deepen into a non-literal answer: orientation in warped time equates to familial reconciliation. Symbolic elements are mostly earned through action (the chip, the refocusing, the merge of past/present sketches). One line leans on overt statement (“True north wasn’t just a point on a map”), softening subtlety. The final image lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of balance, sacred play, and ethical theft emerge through particulars (carved pieces holding “renewal,” mercy toward guardians). The final image reweights earlier motifs without a stated moral. Some explicit declarations (“His motivation burned clear…”) blunt subtlety. Overall resonance is strong but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of power’s dependence on small gestures and liberation versus curation are embodied through the pawnless board and the archive of minutiae. The final image reweights prior material without a neat moral. A couple of explicit statements (“This board, she knew, symbolized…”, “freedom’s price…truth, not illusion”) flirt with didacticism but don’t overwhelm. Subtext largely operates in image and tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of buried talents, loss vs. longing, and home-as-process emerges through recurring images (stone, feather, thunder) and the final bridge image. The decoded line (“Home is the curve of shadow against light…”) toes the edge of thesis but is grounded by the decoding act and its consequences. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Chess as strategy for living refracts into forgiveness without heavy sermonizing; “forgiveness as the ultimate strategy” arises from ordeal and pattern. Recurring images (threads, pawn, hush) shift meaning at the end, suggesting renewal over victory. A few lines near the close verge on thesis-statement neatness but remain supported by concrete beats. Thematic resonance lingers through the slight thaw and earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of forgiveness-as-multiplicity is integrated through events (poetry sessions that refract confessions) and images (prism/spire), yielding a resonant reweighting at closure. However, explicit thesis statements (“The truth is a lance...”; “the price of forgiveness...multiplication”) edge toward telling. Subtext does operate in the spire’s pulse and softened echoes. The piece avoids moral neatness but occasionally explains what it already dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The kintsugi motif meaningfully fuses with the act of memory-mending and culminates in a reweighted self-conception. However, lines like “beauty forges from the broken” tilt toward overt thesis-stating, dulling subtext. The closing image resonates but flirts with moralizing. Strong coherence, slightly didactic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: art as an attempt to hold “temporary eternities,” memory vs. permanence, and the dignity of a private vow. The seashell’s reprise in the studio reweights prior material without sermonizing. A minor ding: the closing phrase “temporary eternities glimpsed and lost” edges toward explicit thesis. Still, the imagery earns the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of tenderness-as-power, purity of intention, and apprenticeship grief emerge through image and action rather than sermonizing. Recurrence (vial/cork, scent, vibrations) reweights at the end when guidance arrives and the magic is sealed. A line or two states the thesis outright, but the closing image carries the resonance without moralizing. The ambiguity of what “returns” (presence vs. memory) lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme arises from particulars: reverse migration as solace refigures loss without erasing it; the censer foot embodies weathered endurance. The final image answers the central question by choosing a sustaining stance, not a cure. Subtext hums in cryptic riddles and the moon-phase cognition, avoiding moralizing. Complexity persists: his solace is raw, contingent, and paid for nightly.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of mercy vs. honesty, veils vs. exposure, and “occlusion” recur through concrete images (shadows, orchard, eye). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: a chosen partial blindness to preserve community, not a moralized cure. The truffle essence and “discredited” knowledge reprice reason and superstition. A touch of overt thesis (“psychological safety”) skirts abstractness but is grounded by action.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of isolation-as-shared witness, memory as bridge, and release accrue through object and hour, not lecture. The boutonnière’s shifting meaning elegantly reweights the premise. One line veers toward thesis-stating (“decoding to this: in isolation…”) which slightly blunts subtext. The ending’s image restores resonance without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generational promise, maps, and thresholds cohere into a theme of navigating grief toward chosen connection. The final image answers the premise without a stated moral, though phrases like “doorway of decisions” verge on overt labeling. Subtext in the ants and fungi as quiet guides is effective. The resonance is clean if slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of agency under prophecy, rulership’s despair, and mending vs. shattering emerge organically through images (bleeding starlight, fireflies). The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in Lirian’s shared dreams and loyalty lightly deepens the piece. Some neatness in the curse explanation keeps ambiguity contained rather than provocatively unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of growth-with-constancy, revaluation, and friendship as “palette of resolve” cohere through object transformation and final image. Subtext lives in the shell’s shift from cage to beacon; no sermonizing overwhelms the scene. The “scientifically romantic” fusion of method and emotion reads earned. A few explicit labels slightly blunt ambiguity but don’t undercut resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mortality, memory, and art-as-transmutation cohere through recurring images (grave, roots, wings, scroll). The final cadence reweights past envy into continuity without sermonizing, though the line “turning graves into gateways, jealousy into flight” edges toward thematic telling. Subtext mostly rides image and action. Strong resonance, modest didactic tint.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ordinary miracles, occlusion/clarity, and “reading between lines” emerge from particulars, not thesis. The screw’s reweighting bridges life/death, smell/memory, and time/repair without sermonizing. The ending’s fog-lift plus kept object offers a resonant answer about resilience through reframing. Subtext (Silas’s loss, shared grief) operates in gesture and object work.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of transmuting trauma via story and ritual, and superstition versus scholarship, emerge through concrete acts (tears-as-ink, offering tale to sky). Recurring images (crow feather/quill, runes, storms) reweight at the end without moralizing. The final image (scars reborn as runes, storms will return) balances hope with cost and continuity. A few overt statements skirt on-the-nose but don’t undercut resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Imperfect miracles” integrates across object (bottle), place (doomed archive), and relationship (flawed but healing apology). The ending reweights earlier motifs—music persists, orchard falls—without moralizing, delivering bittersweet resonance. Subtext in Theo’s coda and the mother’s “gift” avoids neat absolutes. A few overt metaphor advisements skim close to thesis-stating but remain earned by scene.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    Language as a blade against illusion is thematically integrated via etymology and the dictionary’s arc. The ending image (“closing the dictionary” after the shattering) reweights prior details without moralizing. The text resists tidy platitudes, though a few abstract formulations flirt with pseudo-profundity. Subtext of self-doubt vs witnessed truth is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around measurement, certainty, and the knife’s edge between presence/absence, realized through water, key, and horizon. The blood line successfully grounds the abstract in concrete cost. However, lines like “What if clocks didn’t measure time at all…” tip into thesis-forward clarity, blunting subtext. The closing whistle reprise restores resonance without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    The entanglement/letting-go motif is threaded through spores, barriers, and the final dimming image; it meaningfully reweights her grief. Occasional on-the-nose phrasing (“physics of letting go”) and expository lines blunt subtext. The last realization is emotionally credible if slightly summarized. Overall, theme emerges from action more than assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of “lucid contradictions,” responsibility, and grief emerge through images (lantern, scrawls, rain/clover) and reweight at the end. However, several sentences state the thesis too directly (“responsible gamble of understanding”), tipping into mild moralizing and reducing subtext. Still, the final gesture and motifs sustain a resonant conceptual repricing. Ambiguity remains humane, if a bit explained.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of estrangement-as-renewal and the pedagogy of endings arise through image (looped tones, lingering vibration) and action (guided letting-go). Subtext surfaces well when Clara recognizes beauty that makes her feel alone. However, direct articulations of theme trim the mystery. The ending image still resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of preservation, inheritance, and regeneration arise organically from recurring images and actions. The locket/ink motif reweights at the end without overt moralizing, though one line (“This was her method…through proximate causes”) edges toward statement. The final choice reframes “small moments” as a covenantal duty, delivering a quiet afterglow. Ambiguity remains productive rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Reciprocity as theme is enacted (jokes-for-bonds, hand-to-hand rock, stories exchanged), culminating in the note. A few explicit statements (“cure’s in the sharing,” “bound by reciprocity”) flirt with moralizing, blunting subtext. The moon rock’s demystification yields a resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity persists around whether taking the rock is gift or theft, which adds texture.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of grief, language, and forgiveness are woven through concrete motifs (absorption-by-skin, stillpoint, ring). The closing image reweights prior material without an explicit moral, though “the purest language of all: forgiveness” edges toward telling. Subtext in the forest’s “tongues” works well without sermonizing. Resonance lingers, if somewhat neat.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    The seed/thresh/harvest motif threads through action and reweights in the final comfort image; “unbending” elegantly dovetails theme and character. The piece resists platitude and lets images do the work. Some symbolism verges on neatness, but it mostly earns its resonance. The ending offers a quiet, non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of presence, listening, and transforming absence into art emerge organically via the camera, harbor, and signing. The closing image resonates, but “Silence sings when we listen” states the thesis directly, dulling subtext at the final beat. The joyful sorrow motif is earned and lingers. Greater reliance on image over aphorism would deepen the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of preservation through destructive passion and lineage-of-care (Lirael→Elara) emerge organically via images. Yet the repeated “volcanic tenderness” becomes a told thesis, shading toward sentimentality. The final vow resonates but doesn’t reprice the core question with new complexity. Solid but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Memory, defiance of oblivion, and the ethics of entanglement emerge from particulars (drumming, imperfect tether) rather than thesis. The hush/exhale reweights meaning, giving a resonant, unsentimental answer: endurance as rebellion. Motifs reprise with new charge (perch, lagoon, auroral sorrow) without moralizing. A touch of overt labeling (“quietly rebellious”) blunts subtlety slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    The whisper-vs-shout thesis is dramatized via vents, gait-listening, and the quiet rescue, culminating in a charged, modest return to patrol. A single explicit statement of theme risks on-the-nose but the imagery and action do the heavier lifting. The coin and folded maps echo judgment and balance, nudging subtext without sermonizing. Resonance lingers as a lived method rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres—darkness as canvas, light as earned—and the final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. The dental mirror’s transformation is an effective thematic engine. One explicit thesis-like line (“to teach darkness the value of stars”) slightly compromises subtext. Overall, resonance lingers in image rather than assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of conformity, subversive strategy, and communal awakening emerge through concrete images (question-mark loaves, branching threads, cradled king). The chess motifs and magnetic pull reweight the final moment without explicit moralizing. Subtext hums in the “amplified quiet,” with doubt becoming a civic resource. Slight on-the-nose phrasing appears, but resonance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of liberation through truthful self-disclosure and nonviolent confrontation arise organically from the relic and pact. Recurring images (whale song, scrimshaw, island vanishing) reweight at the end. A few on-the-nose statements (“designed to detach the unwilling from their illusions”) dull subtlety slightly. Still, the final image offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: performance as survival, silence remade from coercion, and moral ambiguity recast as a present shield. Recurring images (turbines’ hush, bouquet, carving) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final juxtaposition—bird beside desiccated flowers—offers a non-literal answer about tentative release. A few declarative lines brush close to statement, but image does the heavier lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of art dissolving false partitions accrues through recurring images (moth, quartz, ice, breath/ether) and culminates in the crossing. Subtext functions through image rather than moralizing, though “beauty demanded crossing” veers toward telling. The final image reweights the premise without sermonizing. Resonance lingers, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: beauty-in-flaw, exchange of awakenings, and nonverbal communion converge in a closing act that reweights value away from perfection. Recurring particulars (flowers, glass flaws, reed) accrue subtext without explicit moralizing. The ending’s repricing—Elias gains depth without color—lingers. A slight neatness in outcomes softens the lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: connection as texture that outlives proximity, with loss reinterpreted from severance to bridge. Recurring images (lens, bell, golden light) evolve meaningfully and the final silence internalized as readiness is a resonant non-literal answer. A few near-declarative sentences (e.g., “The artificial journey had not been a mere illusion”) brush sentimentality, but most insight is earned through concrete sonic experiences. Subtext operates through the archive-as-memory frame and the brother’s faint timbre.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs (locket, vellum vines, origami, beam) braid into a coherent meditation on intention, grief, and renewal without overt moralizing. The final image reweights earlier symbols as agency returns to Lira and, by reflection, to Elara. Occasional abstract phrasing (“core concept etched into the observatory’s lore”) blunts subtext with light explicitation. Still, the piece earns its resonance through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of value reconstitution, communal trust, and lore-from-loss are integrated through specific rituals (card spreads, measurement, ink darkening). The ending reframes prophecy as mapping—an apt conceptual answer without moralizing. Some lines approach meta-expository explanation, but the tactile particulars keep it grounded. The resonance is thoughtful if not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rich motifs (veil, prisms, atoms) braid into a coherent meditation on loss-as-transformation. However, the line that innocence’s end “was not tragedy, but evolution’s anguished joy” states the thesis overtly, softening subtext. The ending still reweights prior images with resonance as nostalgia weaves into her being. The wisdom feels earned by ritual and cost, not grafted.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of commodified dreaming and the fragility/preservation of hope emerge through concrete particulars (grainy early footage vs. crystalline viral echoes; Great Fade). The river stone and dusk recur as motifs, reweighted at the end. No overt moralizing; resonance lingers in the cost of “endless dusk.” Slight declarative phrasing around purpose keeps it shy of superb subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of reconstruction and earned trust emerge organically from the tail/handler parallel. Strong image-based resonance (shedding layers; dawn) supports the arc. However, explicit moralizing (“No, his path was clear: safeguard the wild, honor his calling”) diminishes subtext. The final vow line is tidy, softening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Scars-as-text and “displaced miracle” unify motifs (hourglass, coffee rings, roots, opal) into an earned conceptual repricing at the end. The last beats avoid sermonizing while offering a resonant, non-literal answer: healing through reading the full tale of loss and survival. One or two lines verge on explicitness, but they’re supported by concrete action. The meteor hush motif accrues meaning rather than decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—unspent love as charged absence and art as conduit—emerges through particulars (negative spaces between frames, sealed letters) rather than sermon. The final realization reweights prior images and offers a resonant, non-literal answer. One line edges toward thesis (“psychometry wasn’t mere reading, but a bridge…”), but it’s earned by the scene. Subtext in the lyric motif and projectionist parallel enriches without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres: creation as remembered stardust, freedom via surrender instead of force. The concept is dramatized through concrete acts (tracing, rest) and returns in the closing image. Some lines verge on overt thesis (“You are us, scattered but whole”), blunting ambiguity. Still, the final stance resonates without a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme (cultivation over conquest; holding divergence to midwife renewal) emerges through concrete images: the frozen midnight anchor, dunes in bloom, and the peril of collapse. The final understanding—“cultivation was not conquest”—edges toward explicitness but is earned by scene action and cost. Subtext works via the lullaby/clock motif and the “occasionally everywhere” presence binding world and choice. The lingering curse complicates any tidy moral, deepening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: integration of nature/machine mirrors reintegration of psyche; “probable miracles” reframes coincidence as earned attention. Recurring objects (gear, wind, hum) shift meaning by the end. The piece avoids bald moralizing and lets images carry the insight. Complexity is moderate, with little counter-pressure to deepen ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—freedom from self-tethering and the value of indirect crossings—emerges organically through image and action (leash snap, star stamp, lullaby). The return of motifs at the end (ticket punch, sea’s rhythm) reweights earlier beats. Occasional direct statements by the guides skirt moralizing but mostly serve the scene’s mythic register. The final image resonates without an overt moral.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece coherently explores safety’s price and reframes silence as vow, with recurring images (snow, cobalt, bolt) carrying meaning. However, final-paragraph explicitness edges toward moralizing, slightly reducing subtext. The resonance remains, but some lines tell what the images already show. The aftereffect is felt, if a bit explained.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of truth’s inevitable drift and legitimacy vs. spectacle accrue from concrete motifs (ink, marginalia, mirrors, drift). “Graceful collapse” reframes defeat as elegant unmasking, enhancing resonance without moralizing. The ending reweights prior images without a stated thesis. Complexity is moderate; ambiguity focuses on tone rather than ethical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs of drift/mooring, memory, and cycles accrue into a coherent theme about environmental resilience and the limits of human control. The tapping practice and atlas page refract the thematic question through material action. Occasional on-the-nose phrasing (“periodic eternal truth”) slightly flattens subtext. The ending reweights the ocean’s “memory” without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—order within mess, quiet realignment over flash—is developed through recurrent images (stars, hum, circle) that reweight by the end. One line articulates the thesis too directly (“There’s order up there…”), softening subtext. The final promise of “storms to come” resonates without sermonizing. Overall, the piece invites reflection without resolving into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of intentional evolution vs. petrified tradition are organically tied to events and images (roots, crust, reconstruction, embryo). Some lines verge on thesis-stating (“evolving tradition with intent”), reducing subtext. The final image reweights prior material credibly. Complexity is present but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Motifs (pearl, orchid, lighthouse, wind) accrue meaning and the closing image offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Some lines state the thesis a bit baldly (“Optimism without that anchor was delusion”), which blunts subtext. Even so, the final reframing of the photograph and the indifferent beacon deliver earned resonance without sentimentality. The theme arises from particulars more than pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of fragmentation and reassembly emerges through concrete action (untangling, binding, re-sketching) rather than lecture. Recurring images (light/dark, sea/beam, broken/whole) reweight at the end, offering a non-literal answer. Occasional rhetorical overstatement slightly blunts subtlety, but the final image resounds. The piece invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    Motifs (ink, wind, ephemerality) point toward themes of concealment, memory, and crisis perception. However, the ending states a thesis (“time slowed to forge survivors’ resolve”) rather than earning it through image or action, flattening subtext. The conceptual reweighting is asserted, not discovered. The meta aside further dilutes resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of silence as speech and knowledge as contraband emerge organically from action and image, then occasionally get stated outright. The final hush reweighted with a “conversation begun” resonates without moralizing. Some lines lean toward thesis-statement territory, slightly reducing subtextual force. Overall, the piece invites reflection and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pacifism-as-continuity, inheritance vs renunciation, and “engraved quiet” cohere through action rather than speechifying. The blade’s sheathing and the charged object-binding offer a resonant, non-literal answer. A few phrases verge on overt signaling, but the imagery carries most weight. The final bloom under “tranquil blaze” lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silence birthing sound, grief transliterated into audible form, and healing through disciplined attention converge organically in the ending. Recurring motifs (transliteration, lullaby, sleepwalking stars) reweight meaning without didactic statements. The final image quietly answers the central question—how to make peace with catastrophic resonance—through action, not moralizing. Ambiguity remains where it should: the echo could shatter or mend; Elias’s poise makes the difference.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.0)
    Media legacy, truth vs. spectacle, and “orbits of regret” braid into a coherent theme, with the heirloom nib reframing inheritance. Some lines overstate the thesis and compress ambiguity. The final dispersion of “orbits” provides a conceptual answer but nears patness. Subtext hums in the family cover-up tension, though it could linger darker.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of translation, memory, and forgiveness emerge organically through image (amber insect, constellations, meteor hush) and action. The final line reweights prior motifs without moralizing, offering a resonant answer: forgiveness is mapped, not granted. Ambiguity lingers in the haunted-tech premise without confusion. No platitudes; emotion feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning assembles through pattern, not proclamation, and the ending reweights noise into a charged quiet. Recurring images (lilac unease, echoes, spirals, the fractured circle) accrue significance and shift at closure. Minimal moralizing; Elara’s final gesture respects complexity and fragility. A single explicit line about “discover meaning in the mess” edges toward telling but doesn’t undercut the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of naming as healing, mercy with edges, and preserving scars are woven through image and action rather than sermonized. The “aberrant mercy” motif accrues and re-reads the fire in the climax without false equivalence. Final images (tile mending, vines purposeful) offer a resonant answer to the central question. Occasional abstract phrasing slightly dulls subtextual subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of performance, memory, and healing through shared art emerge organically via coin, echoes, and synesthesia. The ghost’s endless encore desire refracts Eliza’s loss without sermonizing, and the final image reweights nostalgia from corrosive to buoyant. Subtext operates in gesture and image (the echo-dance) rather than explicit thesis. The resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of embodied truth vs. technological shortcut arise organically through process and image, not lecture. The willowglass hope motif recurs and modulates, and the geode refracting “hidden pathways” ties the conceptual to the tactile. The “No pills needed” line edges toward explicitness but is earned by prior beats. Ambiguity remains humane (connection as practice, not magic).

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres around stewardship, memory, and transitional objects bridging epochs. The fossil’s reweighting of her role creates resonance without didactic moralizing, though a few lines verge on thesis. The closing herald stance offers a non-literal answer that lingers. Subtext arises through image and vocation more than dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—distributed wisdom versus predestination—emerges organically from the button method and the echo’s clarified message. The final cadence reweights the premise, but explicit statements (“shared wisdom… empowering all”) verge on telling. The last image (turning the final hourglass, carrying the jar to villages) resonates, though ambiguity and counter-pressure are limited. The piece invites reflection more through image than argument.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Renewal and repair (tilt toward spring, silver hush) recur and reweight the ending image. The theme emerges from particulars (snow codes, vouchsafe, reconciliation) more than outright statement, though a few lines approach sentimentality. The final gesture reframes broken trust credibly, if neatly. Subtext in the pillbox handoff works well.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of palimpsest, essence, and earned serenity recur through concrete images (ledger, needle, fog) and culminate coherently. Some lines tilt toward thesis-stating (“The vow endures, distilled,” “Through ambient awareness, he knew peace”), dulling subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior motifs without full moralizing. Ambiguity around cost keeps a reflective aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Recurring images (sun patterns, bees, thrumming glass) braid into a coherent thesis about compassion as structural resilience. The final insight resonates and reweights prior images, though a line like “places resisted change not through stubbornness, but through the quiet thrum of sustained compassion” edges into explicit statement. Subtext largely works via motif and selection rather than speech. Emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motifs (light, locks/keys, petals, hush) braid into a coherent meditation on resilience and how to “reflect light into dark corners.” The locksmith gauge and moonlit petals elegantly reweight the theme at the end. Occasional explicit thematics (“motivation had always been...”) flirt with telling, softening subtext. Still, the final image offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: coexistence reframed as a foundation for independence rather than its opposite. The sundial’s reprise and the final wing-spread deliver a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening isolation. Minimal moralizing—one explicit statement of motive—doesn’t overwhelm the image-led resolution. The spectral flock’s silence operates as effective subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of secrecy, connection, and transformation through art evolve organically from concrete particulars (thrush twigs, spiral, embedded letters). The final image reweights the premise—private longing becomes communal light—without explicit moralizing. A few phrases verge on declarative summation (“thread connecting all things”) but remain anchored in image. Subtext (anonymous care becoming shared authorship) reads clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    The human/cosmic mirroring—Harlan’s ambition echoing the tricksters—threads the piece and resonates in the wary, unsentimental ending. “These aren’t gifts” and the honest silence reweight prior images without moralizing. Some theme signals are stated rather than fully subtextual, which blunts the afterglow. Still, the conceptual repricing of “contact” as seduction vs clarity lands.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of rebellion—of spaces and self—emerges through recurring images (organ’s lament, walls’ mutiny) and culminates in “redraw the world’s boundaries.” It’s largely implicit until the ending’s slightly on-the-nose phrasing. The inner mutiny against claustrophobia mirrors the world’s spatial revolt with pleasing symmetry. Resonance lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “unifying opposites” motif runs through images (festive ribbon vs. grim quarry; revelry vs. death), and empathy-as-method ties to the ending. However, the final paragraph leans into explicit theme statements (“rekindled the empathy that binds us”), edging toward moralizing. Subtext exists in the quarry’s hush and her face-blindness as an empathetic lens, but it’s partially overexplained. The resonance is present yet not delicately earned.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Legacy versus denial, and the irony of “reversible exile,” are embodied through object and action rather than stated. The final act conceptually reprices the past: the nail becomes a talisman and a public claim. The swift institutional affirmation trims ambiguity; a touch more friction would deepen resonance. Still, the thematic weave is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of forgiveness/redemption and crossing from regret to possibility emerge organically through the flake/bridge motifs. “Pixelated amnesty” risks abstraction but is re-embodied in the final act of playing. The piece avoids a moral, though a few lines verge on thesis-stating. Resonance lingers via the recurring images more than via conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around reclamation versus conquest and cyclical paths across generations. Recurring images (looping rails, foreign bills, painted sigils) accrue meaning and the ending reframes “circling back” as an invitation, not a curse. One line edges toward thesis-statement (“Some paths circle back…”) but the imagery largely carries the meaning. The final quiet resolves into resonant acceptance rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—shared burdens and healing through words—emerges through concrete images (procession with weights, passing the burdens, the inscription’s line). The daylily telegram and dawn reprise give resonance without excessive sermonizing, though the thesis nears explicitness. The ending reweights prior material with a clear, humane answer. It’s emotionally honest if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mirrors versus “unmirrored truths,” guilt as a warp in reality, and the guarded heart “unbending” converge elegantly in the closing image. Thematic lines are mostly earned through action and image. One sentence edges toward explicit thesis (“This was the hidden fracture mirrors obscured”), slightly reducing subtlety. The final cadence resonates without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of mending through wounds—bridging scars to restore shared dreaming—emerges organically from particulars (scar-linking, maze guidance). The final image reweights the premise (convergence over chaos) without moralizing. At times the abstract lexicon (“eclipsed covenant,” “collective truth”) risks generality, but the concrete images keep resonance grounded. Quiet, coherent aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of exchange, healing through shared wounds, and reinterpreting the macabre accrue through images (roots embracing skulls; The Lovers as exchange). Subtext operates in the tactile weaving of bones and roots more than in explicit moralizing, though key lines edge close to telling. The final dusting of the card offers a resonant, non-literal answer about cost and release. Complexity is present but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme arises from particulars: the transition from spectacle to curation, echoes becoming meaning rather than emptiness, the cloth as charged remainder. The final quarry-as-archive image reweights prior material effectively. A brief explicit thesis statement about purpose edges toward moralizing, slightly reducing subtextual power. Overall resonance lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—transition as reconfiguration rather than loss—emerges through motif and action (seed, magnetism, analogies). A few lines state the thesis outright (“transition wasn't loss but a reconfiguration”), slightly blunting subtext. Still, the final sprout and strengthened hum provide a resonant, non-literal answer. Complexity lingers in the acceptance-cost rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: preservation through acceptance of contradiction; identity as flux stabilized by ritual care. The creel, tides, and “smelting” reweight at the end, refusing triumphalism for a charged poise of ongoing stewardship. No sermonizing; resonance arises from images and acts. A touch more felt personal risk would deepen the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.1)
    Motifs (hush, crystal barriers, the spiral of confessions) converge into a coherent theme of dissolving isolation through shared memory and light. Thematic articulation nudges toward the explicit (“core concept of latent radiance”), edging on on-the-nose but mostly earned by image. The closing image resonates without moralizing, inviting reflection on communal salvage versus survivalism. Subtext in the caves mirroring human divides is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Forgiveness and the river’s pull are embodied through maps, currents, and the accordion’s wheeze; the last image reweights prior motifs without preaching. The graffiti risks platitude but is grounded by concrete context and use. The ending resists a moral; solace is raw, redirecting rather than erasing guilt. Occasional explicit labels (“raw solace,” “demanded reckoning”) slightly telegraph theme.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of silence/voice, patience versus haste, and repurposing deception accrue through particulars (confidence man’s device used toward truth). The closing tableau reweights the premise (silence reversed into symphony) without overt moralizing, though a few lines verge on abstraction (“truths buried in the soul’s quiet corners”). Resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the motifs of perforation/porousness, propagation, and provenance—what is carried forward and at what cost. The ending reframes destiny as purposefully porous without resorting to a spelled-out moral. A few lines edge toward explicitness (“propagate destinies,” “the empire’s weight would fade”), but the final image reweights the story persuasively. The coffee stains and violin earn their symbolic heft.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece interrogates memorialization, beauty as defiance, and the ethics of self-preservation against cosmic erasure. The emerald’s reweighted meaning at the end (from keepsake to vessel) provides resonant thematic closure without moralizing. Subtext arises from the mortician’s craft reframed upon herself. Ambiguity (legacy vs. vanishing) lingers generatively.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rebirth, forgiveness, and contentment braid through concrete images (charred branches sprouting, scalloped edges that prevent cracks) and culminate in a non-literal answer: contentment as ongoing care. Occasional explicit statements (“The cycle of rebirth revealed itself fully…”) flirt with didacticism but don’t overwhelm the imagery. The final act reframes peace as maintenance with credible warmth and cost. Subtext remains mostly image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Recurring images (cloak, chimes, mirror) carry the idea that doubt can be worn or shed and that certainty gains strength through nuance. The ending reweights the premise with a resonant image (dawn filling the hollow shard). Some thematic lines verge on thesis (“It’s not about erasing certainty...”), tempering subtlety. Still, meaning largely emerges from particulars of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of surrender/vanishing to appear are organically woven through the ripples, grotto pull, and careful withholding. The final image reweights the premise without sermonizing, though a few lines come close to aphorism. Subtext lives in the risk implied by “not return unchanged.” Resonance is earned via particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of stillness-as-travel, ancestral resonance, and reverence for the dead cohere through bones, echoes, and flock-patterns. The ending reweights the premise: endurance as mastery, the world coming to her rather than pursuit. Subtext is image-led rather than declared, avoiding moralizing. Slight repetition of “historically reverent” skirts abstraction but does not blunt resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    Resonance accumulates through recurring images and culminates in a reweighting of value away from machine-made awe. However, the piece states its thesis explicitly (“automation could mimic brilliance…”; “divine spark in simplicity”) rather than letting image alone carry it, softening subtext. Thematic complexity favors a clear stance over nuanced ambiguity. The final image still lands, but with a touch of sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (lamps, lanterns, vows, hush, indigo) braid into a coherent meditation on promise and revelation. The final image reweights earlier material without a moral, but a few lines slip into abstract statement (“It signified…”, “attribute of hiding behind truth dissolved”). Subtext mostly works through image and action. Emotional aftereffect is genuine if slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: relinquishment of past reliances to tune with a difficult truth; faith versus chance; order found in silence between noise. The coin motif reweights at the end, embodying the price of alignment. The final whisper of doubt avoids tidy moralizing. A few explicit lines (“alignment required sacrifice”) edge toward telling but are supported by enacted cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—sacrifice transmuted into stewardship through naming—emerges via particulars (the atlas’s murmurs becoming crystals; monsters becoming guardians). Subtext of grief as method (light through a shard of her essence) avoids overt moralizing. The final image repositions loss as a guiding beacon without tidying pain. No sermonizing; resonance persists beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of modest power, devotion’s fragility, and restoring balance cohere through the bell and drip motifs, culminating in “lukewarm magic proved enough.” Resonance arises from particulars rather than sermonizing, though the final relief borders on tidy. Subtext around dependence on Lira and self-belief is present but not deeply complicated on the page. A touch more cost or ambiguity would deepen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of sacrifice, inheritance, and communal repricing emerge through concrete images (bottle label, levee, resurfacing roofs). The sapphire label’s meaning shifts convincingly from bitter prosperity to shared cost. Some lines (“our grandfathers didn’t just lose a home; they gave one…”) tilt toward explicit moralizing. Still, the final “new quiet” resonates beyond a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (logic and wonder in balance) emerges through image systems (crystal, flame, murmuration) and culminates in a non-literal answer (an elixir born of both). A few lines verge on stating the thesis (“not a force to conquer”) rather than letting subtext do the work. Still, the final charged poise at the waterfall reweights prior details without sermonizing. The emotional aftereffect is honest, if a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of watcher’s burden and trust under pressure arises from particulars: the modified buckle, solitary vigil, and the final recommitment. “Soundless echo” and pattern motifs recur and shift meaning at the end. One slightly declarative beat (“Trust intact.”) softens the subtext. Still, resonance lingers in the charged poise of continued vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Identity, sovereignty, and the yin/yang of numbness vs. vitality cohere through concrete action rather than thesis. The blade “slicing pretense” recurs as thematic function, not mere symbol, and the final paired standing reweights earlier material. A few explicit phrases (“custody wouldn’t be won by force”) skirt telling, but they don’t override the scene’s earned resonance. Ambiguity remains where it should (ethical implications), without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of innovation through discomfort and embracing the strange are embedded in images (corpse flower odor as clue; brook’s flow informing design). Recurrences reweight meaning at the end (“not a flower, but a revolution” reframes the seed). No moralizing, with a clean metaphorical throughline between nature’s mechanisms and puzzle craft. Slight neatness and low-stakes comfort keep it short of truly resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of grief, the unspoken, and sound as a transformative medium accrue through recurrent images (lullabies, echoes, vines) rather than thesis statements. The final laughter rising functions as an image-led answer to the central question without overt moralizing. A slight sentimentality sheen and tidy restoration temper complexity. Nonetheless, subtext (unspoken barbs, domestic silence) remains persuasive.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of befriending uncertainty and merging wilderness with order surface organically through object and setting, then crystallize at the end. A few lines verge on thesis-stating (“Uncertainty was no enemy”), softening subtext. Still, the final repricing of uncertainty and boundary imagery resonates. The pendant’s illumination reweights prior images effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    “Creative destruction” threads action and object, shifting meaning at the end from restoration to renewal-through-ruin. Thematic statement is occasionally explicit, slightly blunting subtext. Still, the final wand-of-interrupted-fate image reweights prior material without a preachy moral. Ambiguity remains around the social cost, which curbs resonance a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of renewal within ruin and clarity within hush arise from concrete particulars (tower, fragment, tuning ritual). The “beginning in every ending” is stated but then reframed through the shard’s effect and the final visions, avoiding sermonizing. Subtext resides in the craftlike approach to magic and in silence as enabling pattern recognition. Slight neatness in the takeaway tempers the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Time’s rupture and “permanent transient” identity resonate through the hourglass and ferry-as-threshold motif. The final image reweights the journey with an entwined-worlds whisper, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext of resilience vs. dissolution is embedded in action rather than told. Complexity is moderate; the piece leans luminous rather than ethically fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: the failure of engineered intimacy and the costed recognition that connection is “fevered sinew,” not silk. Recurring images (thread, mirrors, prisms) accrue and reweight in the end without moralizing. One line edges toward statement (“not as silk or steel…”) but remains anchored in concrete imagery, preserving resonance. The piece invites layered readings on memory’s malleability versus authentic bond.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of connection across divides, perception expansion, and pedagogy-as-bridge cohere through the chain link motif and “horizons” imagery. Some lines state theme directly (“This isn’t just metal; it’s a bridge to the stars”), dulling subtext. Still, the final image reweights earlier motifs with quiet resonance. Ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Memory, stewardship, and “voices that endure” cohere without overt moralizing. The closing image reweights caretaking as lineage, and “incidental heroism” fits Elara’s modest stance. Subtext hums in the object chain (photo/locket/aid) rather than being declared. Thematic complexity is solid if not deeply ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of remembrance, restitution, and the ocean of data as a medium for ghosts arise organically from events and images (gold flecks tracking “invisible pleas,” cables “singing”). The final repricing—names restored as signals—reweights prior motifs without sermonizing, though one line edges toward declaration. Ambiguity remains humane and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Failure-as-seed-of-wisdom is integrated through action and motif (accident → interface), but the line “From failure, we harvest strength” states the theme too directly. Subtext often works better in images (ink vortices, blood/ink mingling) than in articulated thesis. The ending’s repricing—quiet triumph—resonates without moralizing, despite the brief explicitness. Overall, strong but slightly blunted by the on-the-nose statement.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of translation, loss, and the ethics of preservation arises organically through action (textures to tones, birds as grammar). The ending reweights the premise: death into “eternal resonance,” with the cost of entrapment risk and a haunted archive. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers over curse and immortality. Strong image-driven subtext without didactic thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Loss reframed as invitation and the “cosmic joke” motif recur and reweight the ending image. Subtext largely rides the objects and atmosphere rather than dialogue; Elara’s laughter over “hopeful waters” resonates. A few explicit statements (“The cryptids’ world wasn’t horror…”) verge on thematic telling, shaving subtlety. Overall coherence holds and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (locust shell, heart rhythms, rusted fruit to bloom) accumulate to a persuasive rebirth theme. The final understanding is slightly told—“breaking free was not just escape, but rebirth”—dulling subtext that was already embedded in image. The allegorical balance (mechanical sprawl vs. organic wonder) skews tidy but remains emotionally effective. The shell’s transformation into light delivers a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres: connection-by-absence versus enforced borders, with mail as “memory’s bridge.” Recurring images (brittle hush, cobalt light, captured storm) support the idea without lapsing into allegory. The final insight skirts abstraction but is earned by particulars (widow, sibling bond, coded drops). Slight explicitness in phrasing trims the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—silence as fertile possibility versus void—emerges organically through action and image rather than stated moral. The final embedding of the halo reweights the whole: decay to promised rebirth, hush to symphony. Recurring motifs (wind bells, misting hush, whispering gleam) shift meaning at closure without heavy-handed symbolism. Slight sentimental edging is avoided by concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of analog memory versus digital ephemera emerges organically through action and the math/poetry synthesis. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, suggesting connection across “bent horizons.” A few lines verge on declarative thesis, but most resonance arises from concrete particulars. Subtext of observed solitude as chosen vocation lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of luminous absence turning from lack to guidance is earned through particulars: camera, palette, dawn cipher, the spire and laughter. The realization “the longing wasn’t for recapture, but for release” edges toward explicitness but is backed by image and action (projection fading, tears, stepping into day). Resonance lingers as absence becomes a gentle illumination, not a moral. The early–final image echo is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of fear as jailer, intimacy-as-key, and grief transmuted into resolve emerge through object action and image. Occasional on-the-nose exposition (“no mere keepsake,” “trapped by fear’s unyielding key”) blunts subtext. The ending reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Resonance lingers via the retied ribbon and the chosen path under a fading star.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of memory, lineage, and the pact between folklore and environment emerge organically through particulars (family rites, flood-altered world). The final hum and image of shattered constellations reweight loss and reclamation without overt moralizing. Resonance is genuine if somewhat tidy, with limited counterpressure or ambiguity. The nostalgia carries feeling without collapsing into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of exile, reflection, and resilience arise from objects and acts (mirrors, tea geometry, annotated shard) rather than abstract telling. A few on-the-nose lines (“You think exile defines you?”) slightly flatten subtext. The final step forward reweights the imagery without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the reversible-path motif.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme—restoring wonder to a gray world—emerges through images (runes, mist, blossoms) but is also told directly (“to preserve the color of wonder”). The final tableau reaffirms the thesis rather than reweighting it with complication. Emotional aftereffect is warm but edges into sentimentality. Subtext is light; symbolism stays explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silence, guilt, and redemption interweave through concrete images (the net “accumulating silence,” masks reforming). The final peace is earned by specific acts, not moralizing. The interlaced hush concept shifts from motif to mechanism, yielding resonant reweighting. Slight neatness tempers ambiguity but doesn’t flatten complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    Silence, inheritance, and “shielded openness” cohere through objects and images rather than exposition. The father-son echo via twin reels deepens the theme with earned resonance. One line leans explanatory (“no mere academic pursuit”), but the final crossing reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. The quiet conceptual answer—listening to what silence holds—lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs (snow globe, static, entropy, library of unfinished stories) build a coherent meditation on surrender versus grasping. Subtext largely arises from actions and images, though Mort’s lines verge on thesis-stating. The final insight reweights prior images without collapsing into moralizing, but it is stated a touch explicitly. Emotional aftertaste is resonant and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of voice, preservation vs. freedom, and art/tech synthesis emerge organically through action (graffiti as translation, the plate as conduit). The final “beacon” image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext of neglected creators and overlooked voices lingers credibly. Slight neatness in outcome limits the complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme—joy braided into anguish—emerges organically through Captain Thorne’s entries and Elara’s reading stance. Recurring images (scattered light, frost-flowers of text) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. Subtext in her “affectionate detachment” resists pity and refuses easy healing. The insight is graceful, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    Grief-as-archive and “spooled wholeness” braid through objects and actions, then reweight at closure (“threads rewinding the spool”). Subtext mostly rides images and method rather than exposition, though the explicit claim of proof trims mystery. The emotional aftertaste is tender and non-tidy. The concept holds without false symmetry or platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece engages meaningfully with limits, perception, and preservation; the ending reweights “seeing” as crafting patterns. The coin/book motif deepens the theme without feeling token. However, explicit statements (“discovering limits meant not surrender…”) tilt toward moralizing, slightly reducing subtextual power. The emotional afterimage is strong despite that on-the-nose line.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of reclaiming hidden light and bridging solitude to community accrue through images (murmurations, lantern dust, “stranded luminance”). The final tilt of the airship and her plan refract these motifs without overt moralizing, though a few lines declare intent (“not for glory alone”). Resonance lingers but avoids complication that would sharpen ambiguity. Solid, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Repair, time, and identity are woven through motifs (driftwood, gears, eclipses) that shift meaning at the end. The hall’s mirrors and the “capped heart” create a persuasive metaphor for reconfiguring the self to a larger rhythm. The piece avoids moralizing and lets image carry theme. Slight tidiness at the end keeps it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Collective action versus fearful isolation emerges organically from the chalk prompts and shared labor, with “reexamine the roots” folding theme into action. The bell’s communal peal reweights earlier fragments into a ritual of unity. The resonance is genuine, though a touch tidy and assertive in its hopefulness. Subtext (trusting the unseen, relinquishing hoarded control) is legible without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Flawed beauty, mercy vs. apocalypse, and continuity-in-ending cohere without sermonizing; the puppet’s cracks reprice flaw as conduit. The lullaby reframes doom’s cadence into a gentler ethic, and the final darkness resonates rather than explains. Occasional thematic assertions skirt repetition (“hush” recurs), but the images carry the weight. The ending offers a resonant answer: continuance through tenderness rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres around reluctant stewardship, transforming predation into guidance—predators turned shepherds is a strong image-level answer. “Graceless beauty” refrains through action and the final frost-kissed image, if a bit declared in spots. The piece avoids moralizing, letting choice and cost carry the resonance. The curse loosening “just a fraction” gives it earned, unsentimental lift.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (braids, polymers, chrysalis, symphony) interweave to articulate a theme of separation reconverging into connection. The final image reweights earlier particulars with earned resonance. A few lines verge on thesis-stating (“separations were temporary”), dulling subtext. Still, the metaphoric system mostly does the thematic lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of erasure, renewal, and absence-as-foundation are embodied in concrete acts (counting voids, carving sigils) rather than stated morals. “Glimmering parole” refracts as release from history, culminating in a reweighted origin-image. The ending resists neat moralizing while offering a resonant answer to the central question. A few concept labels verge on explicitness but stay integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres around transmuting communal guilt into nourishment, with foodcraft as bridge and burden. Recurring images (tidal formations, brittle/sturdy, sandpapering) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The pavilion reframes her gift as civic caretaking with cost. Resonance lingers in the shift from haunting to healing.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    Bridges-from-silos unfurls through image, ritual, and song rather than blunt statement, with the weight and chimes reweighted at the end. The multilingual chorus operates as subtext for plurality becoming harmony. A few lines verge on thesis-forward articulations (“bridges from our silos”), slightly thinning ambiguity. Still, the final cadence invites reflection without prescribing a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of reclamation, memory’s stratigraphy, and the ethics of self-alteration accrue through concrete objects and acts. Recurring motifs (helix, strata, periscope) reweight at the end without overt moralizing. A few direct statements of purpose verge on telling, but the closing image earns resonance. Ambiguity lingers around the cost of being “guardian,” in a good way.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of vigilance vs. oblivion accrue through concrete images (seeds, eyes, inversion) and culminate in a resonant, if slightly declarative, final line. Subtext functions via recurring motifs rather than moralizing. The reprise of “vigilance seeded her soul” flirts with on-the-nose but fits the pattern. Thoughtful, coherent, not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—empathy as technique and bridge—emerges from concrete acts (reading wounds, moving with wood’s rhythm) and culminates in a shared resonance among sculptor, tree, and hedgehog. The “Empathy in motion” declaration flirts with overtness but is largely earned by prior specifics. The final image resists moralizing and invites reflection about pain transformed. Subtext lives in the choice to listen rather than force.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of finding beauty in difficulty and exile-as-forge emerge organically from objects, method, and final reframing. The closing image reweights prior motifs (stone dent, chess promotion, eclipse) without a didactic moral, though one line edges toward on-the-nose (“beauty unveiled itself in the difficult”). Subtext operates via silence-as-language and regret alchemized into wisdom. Resonance lingers, if a bit declared.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from action: attunement as empathy, recovery over rupture. Recurring images (clasp, hum, fireworks) reweight at the end without moralizing. One sentence edges toward thesis-stating, but the final charged poise resists sermonizing. The vow feels earned by the particulars of the mother’s entries.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of accepting the wild to access wisdom arise from concrete particulars (stench as teacher, doodles as grounding). The closing realization coheres with prior images, though a few lines tilt toward explicit thesis. Subtext survives via image chains (roots in storm; wildflower hush) more than rhetoric. Effect lingers without simplistic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resilience, stewardship, and ancestral continuity accrue through images (echoes, orchards, the arrow’s legacy). The visions reweight the premise effectively, avoiding overt moralizing. Resonance is real but tidy, with limited ambivalence or lingering ethical price. The thematic aftertaste is thoughtful rather than haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—foresight wrested from catastrophe; systems redesigned to blunt fate—emerges from particulars (wind vectors, chokepoints, microburst). The patch gives a modest human cost vector and reweights the ending image. A few lines edge toward thesis-speak (“turning hindsight into preemptive strikes”), softening subtext. Still, the concluding cadence reframes the silence as a canvas for precise, humane response.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme coheres—wonder as necessary—through concrete ritual and the statue’s revelation. However, explicit thesis statements (“to certify wonder as essential,” “proving wonder essential”) edge toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The closing image carries resonance, but the stated takeaway slightly blunts it. Subtext exists in image and silence, just partially over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres around control versus surrender and failure as resource, embodied by “weaving” rather than stated. The driftwood-as-guide and hush-as-listener accrue meaning and reweight the finale. One explicit articulation of the thesis (“demanded not just vigilance, but vulnerability”) blunts subtlety. Overall, resonance lingers through image rather than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme arises from particulars: letterpress as imprint, halo fragment as refractor, borrowing selves as a flawed bridge to connection. The ending offers a resonant answer—pattern as turbulent flow and shared feeling—without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, not muddy, and the broadsheet’s design mirrors the story’s conceptual move. No pseudo-profundity; the insight is earned through the backfire.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of legacy, the fade from memory to myth, and wonder in routine emerge through concrete beats (the pendant amplifying a brief intersection into an enduring seed). The final image reweights prior material: Elias continues lighter yet bereft, the shepherd transformed, Thorne’s absence recast as eternal. A few explicit mentor aphorisms edge toward statement, but they’re grounded by on-page action. Subtext operates through image and exchange more than declaration at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (objects as mirrors rather than vaults) emerges from particulars and reweights earlier material effectively. The final realization answers the central question without needing a tidy moral. However, the explicit summation (“She had proven it—not just to skeptics…”) and meta coda nudge toward didacticism and dilute subtext. The piece remains resonant, if slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of love-enduring-as-sacrifice emerges through craft and time motifs, not moralizing. Recurring images (“raveling silence,” loom, bead) reweight meaning at the end into hope charged by cost. The final release offers a resonant, non-literal answer without tying every thread. Ambiguity remains purposeful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resilience-from-ruin and barter-as-awakening emerge organically from image and action, not thesis statements. The silk’s final fray and the planet’s “breath” lend earned resonance without sentimentality. “Azure defiance” is a coherent tonal throughline, if slightly over-insisted. The ending reweights prior images into a quiet, satisfying repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of responsibility vs. discovery is integrated through the shard, vocational lens, and the final repricing of “weight.” The mentor’s withheld truth lands as a cautionary counterpoint that reframes her ambition. A slightly expository line (“the multiverse’s weaves were not infinite…”) edges toward telling what the scene already implies. The closing image earns a measured, not thunderous, resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of custodianship, anonymity as communal care, and “bottling safety” accrue through objects (stones, letters, sea glass) rather than statement. The letter chain reframes isolation as a lineage, and the final act reweights the motif powerfully. The piece resists moralizing and earns its quiet poignancy. Slight motif echoing (“luminescent ache”) skirts overt signaling but still resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres around legacy, renewal from ruin, and the shift from material omens to digital ephemera. Recurring images (wick, shadows, laughter) reweight at the end, offering a non-literal answer: yielding the old role is what enables the new dawn. A few lines verge on declarative thesis (“post-newspaper era”), but image-led beats carry the load. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of magnetism, risk, and “iridescent caution” are woven through recurring images (wing, sun trails, mist) and culminate without didactic instruction. One line (“some magnetized stories because they dared to shimmer”) edges toward stating thesis, but imagery keeps it grounded. The donor heart reframes selfhood and agency in a resonant way. The ending lingers with a non-literal answer rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Quantified sorrow” threads through the sextant’s fractures, dream maps, and final vision into resilience; the theme emerges from action and image rather than moralizing. The last tableau reweights prior details with a quiet, resonant answer. At times diction nudges toward explicitness, but it stays earned by the particulars. Subtext and motif work in concert without checklisting.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of communal memory, restoration, and binding/release emerge organically through the woven dawns and ancestral songs. The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Slight sentimentality and the meta-bracketed lines undercut lingering resonance. Still, the orchard-song-window triad carries genuine subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Paradox and compassion entwine into a coherent theme: mistakes as bridges to connection. Recurrences (invitation, hidden door, paradox light) reweight the ending. Some lines verge on thesis-stating (“the mistake had chosen him”), blunting subtext. Still, the final cadence carries reflective resonance without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of creeping normality, memory, and sacredness in decay emerge through concrete acts (guerrilla gardening, bread communion) and a nuanced final stance. The ending reweights prior images without moralizing, though one line (“This ritual... transformed the mundane act of eating into something holy”) borders on statement. The vanished bakery and crumbs reprise deepen resonance. Ambiguity lingers in a productive way.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of preservation versus erasure and meaning wrested from entropy emerge organically through image and action. The luminous vows as living memory and Elara’s professional care create resonance without overt moralizing. The ending reaffirms renewal but doesn’t reprice the premise with a hard cost or ambivalence. Strong, poised, and a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Trust, secrecy (“truce of hush”), and the desire to “record” the fracture cohere into a resonant motif that returns at the end. The phonograph image and the fragile truce reweight prior beats without didacticism. However, the explicit meta line later undercuts the lingering aftertaste and slightly reduces the thematic charge. Ambiguity around cost keeps it honest but a touch cool.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of human/nature fusion, skepticism vs. wonder, and “terrestrially cosmic” kinship recur through objects and setting. The mist-weaver’s explanation leans into thesis-speak, reducing subtext at the story’s peak. The final image reweights meaning but meta lines undercut the earned hush. Resonance lingers, yet it feels somewhat told rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Memory-as-key/curse flips meaning at the climax; lock/painting motifs braid into a clear meditation on inevitability and choice. A few lines verge on thesis-statement clarity (“wasn’t a curse but the key”), softening subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior material with honest cost and release. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Thematic throughline—candor in small moments as civic lifeblood—is embedded in objects (leaves, crystals) and choices. The ending image reweights the premise without heavy exposition, though “irrigate the soul” edges toward sentimentality. Subtext around truth as a resource parallels water scarcity neatly. The piece invites reflection without false equivalence about Kael’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from particulars (post-verbal world, bells, ice) rather than moralizing, culminating in a quiet, resonant cadence. Some lines verge on declarative abstraction (“melodies that peeled back illusions”), but the imagery mostly carries the load. The final slowing and lingering truths provide a non-literal answer that reweights the premise. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of nostalgia as fuel, controlled release vs. erasure, and wholeness-from-fragments accrue organically through action and image (miniaturized fears as embers; the kept shard). The closing reweights the premise without moralizing, though one line (“a testament to controlled release amid inevitable change”) edges toward on-the-nose. Subtext generally rides the recurring objects rather than declarations. Resonance lingers via the charged readiness and preserved fear.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres—listening as healing—through concrete events (collective stories, unlocked box). The note “Listen, and let the words flow free” and the line “listening had healed the fractures” tip toward explicit moralizing, reducing subtext. The final procession and spilled letters provide a resonant, image-led answer despite the stated thesis. Complexity is modest but honest.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres—vulnerability encrypted as strength, web motifs reweighted at the end into freedom’s expanse. The dice, dance, and journal braid into a credible metaphor of reclamation without heavy moralizing. A few phrases verge on explicit thesis, but resonance predominates via image and act. The closing embrace and ascent offer a non-literal answer that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Memory, grief, and the earth/ocean as keeper of histories cohere through particulars (whale song, salt crystals, flowers). The ending reframes loss as recoverable with cost, avoiding overt moralizing. A slightly expository line (“deleted memories drifted… stored in salt crystals”) edges toward telling. Still, the whale’s role and the salt’s hoard produce a resonant afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Patterns of flow and silence embody a theme of peace-as-discipline rather than mere absence, and the origami wing reweights that at the end. Subtext arises from image rather than moralizing. The meta sentence punctures resonance and reduces afterglow. Ambiguity is purposeful but safe, with limited ethical friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of translation, inheritance, and consented deception emerge organically via objects (seal, wax), rituals (tea), and setting (old building as archive). The “agreed upon lies” motif gains ethical contour when it’s reframed as trust-building rather than mere evasiveness. A couple lines approach thesis-stating (“The old buildings speak in layers”), but the final lullaby image lands without moralizing. The resonance lingers as an initiation into listening rather than an answer-speech.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: quarantined memory → preservation without self-erasure → solitude revalued as autonomy. The shell and dawn reprise reweight earlier images without moralizing, though a few lines state aims outright. The ending image (“shell among the roots”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext arises through action and motif rather than commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of precision, betrayal, and forgiveness emerge through concrete actions (forging the unlink, surrendering the thorn). Recurring images reweight meaning at the end; the “treason into forgiveness” arc feels earned. A few explicit statements (“personal treason had been absolved”) edge toward telling, slightly softening subtext. Still, the final cadence invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of grief as unresolved “notes,” exploitation of resonances, and liberation through counter-song cohere organically from events and images. The whispering shell and echo motif reweight at the end with the question of whether her own echo lingers—an effective, quiet resonance. There’s minimal moralizing; meanings arise from particulars. The momentary meta aside undercuts the lingering spell slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme—purity found in human bonds and the cost of suppressed affections—emerges via images (cameos, parlor, fire stories) and the final flake. However, the line “the expedition’s downfall stemmed from suppressed affections” tips into told thesis, reducing subtext. The ending still resonates conceptually through object reweighting and release. Ambiguity exists but is not richly contested.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of honoring unseen labor is integrated through particulars (mended net, matcha whisk, guided descent), culminating in a resonant acceptance of ongoing effort. A few lines state thesis directly (“true wisdom lay in honoring such unseen efforts”), which slightly blunts subtext. The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in a good way.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of myth vs engineered salvation and corporate deceit emerge cleanly from action. Some lines overstate the thesis (“comfortable lies”) rather than letting images carry it. The ending reframes the “curse,” but moral complexity is minimal and a touch didactic. Resonance is present but not surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of power mediated through language, the volatility of loyalty, and the loneliness of leadership cohere through storm/radio/portico motifs. Occasional telling (“His motivation burned fierce”) flattens subtext. The final image reweights prior images (cobalt dawn, lingering shadows) with satisfying ambiguity. Complexity is present without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of inheritance, repair, and redemption emerge organically through the jars and music box, with a resonant final image that reweights earlier details. Occasional explicit statements (“translator between generations,” “gleaned redemption”) trim subtext’s subtlety. Emotional aftereffect is genuine and unsentimental. Complexity is present but not deeply contended by counterpressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of harmony, absolution, and the bridge between flesh and spirit emerge through action and recurring images. The final cadence reaffirms integration of logic and feeling via sound. Expository definition of “sonic absolution” leans tell-y, softening subtext. Still, the afterimage is coherent and non-didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically via moon, ice, and magnetism motifs—patience as an active force reweights revolution. The final thaw-crack reframes the entire practice with resonant promise. One overt line (“haste is the Overlords’ chain”) edges toward explicit thesis but is balanced by image-driven beats. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Clara parallel reframes institutional control as a freedom struggle, giving the “liberty’s flame” motif genuine resonance. Thematic clarity is strong but sometimes over-explicit (“mirrored” and direct equivalences). The final talisman image offers a non-literal answer without didactic moralizing. Subtext lives in the object’s history and the echoing tunnels more than in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The clockwork heart and light-beam reweight redemption effectively, and the plan to deliver the box enacts “apology into action.” Thematic articulation occasionally edges into explicit statement (“Everyone deserves a second opinion on their worth”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance is honest and avoids tidy sermonizing beyond that line. The final image lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of evolution, agency, and machine longing accrue through recurring images (arrow-as-intent, kaleidoscope geometries, bell as premature signal). The final peal reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about birthing purpose before consensus. Occasional aphoristic lines (“Why build when you can evolve?”) flirt with statement but align with voice. The aftereffect is contemplative and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Memory, erasure, and corporate control accrue through motifs (“ghosts,” “echoes”) and culminate in a reweighting: deletion as migration and stewardship as quiet resistance. The mission patch functions thematically as a reclaimed relic. The line “absence was never truly final” edges toward statement but is supported by scene-earned images. Subtext about complicity versus guardianship lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    Empathy translated into action is embodied through the mirror glimpses and the closing compromise. Symbolic elements (shard, reflections) align with theme without overt moralizing, though the harmony tips toward tidiness. The ending image resonates, if softly.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of attuning to endings without sensationalizing death emerges through particulars (recordings, euthanasia, ice sounds). The final reweighting—endings as solace—answers the story’s question without moralizing. Recurrences (wind, hum, parasol tip, “fold in patience”) accrue subtext. Ambiguity around reality serves the thematic tension rather than blurring it.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Destined mismatch and seasonal release/renewal braid through concrete parallels (vines shedding leaves, charred edges). Subtext lives in gesture—the offering of the fragment, the reciprocal sketch—though a few lines tip toward thesis. The final image reweights earlier images without sermonizing. Emotional aftertaste is honest and quiet rather than saccharine.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of boundary, memory, and ethical custodianship emerge organically from images and ritual action. The final charged poise—wisdom preserved for “wanderers yet unborn”—reweights prior material without a sermon, though one or two lines skate close to stated significance. Subtext coheres through the half-mask/partial seeing motif. The resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of collective healing coheres through images and returns, yet it’s occasionally stated outright (“Here was the core: collective healing”), softening subtext. The closing image resonates but edges toward sentimentality. Best moments embed meaning in particulars (child’s hand, butterfly, petals on photos). The piece invites reflection, though with limited ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of language as resilient, living echo emerges from crystal-mediated scenes rather than abstract lecture. Recurring images (“suspended hush,” the fallen crystal) reweight meaning at the end. A few lines edge toward overt thesis (“the true lexicon lived in the pauses”), slightly blunting subtext. Overall resonance is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motifs of echoes, tide, and salvage cohere into a meditation on aging and memory without moralizing. The final recording/prophecy reinterprets loss into provisional solace, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Complexity persists (relief is partial), sustaining aftereffect. A few symbols verge on explicit but remain earned by scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Leaf-as-gentleness reframes force versus release, and the ending recasts “escape velocity” as poise rather than brute speed. However, the final aphoristic line (“greatest escapes began…”) tips into stated thesis, softening subtext. Resonance remains, but moralizing trims the afterglow. Earlier images carry theme more deftly.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of reconciling the broken and sanctifying the mundane arise organically via the shard and the hymn. Subtext surfaces in tactility—hand over hand, scent growing, memory made audible—rather than overt moralizing. A few lines (“flawless goodbye,” “goodbyes could heal as much as they hurt”) edge toward direct statement. The final image resonates without preaching.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of harmony, cycle-restoration, and sanctuary emerge organically through the loop mechanics and the redefinition of shadows. The final image reweights the premise without sermonizing, though one sentence edges toward thesis statement. Subtext in the automaton’s precision teaching “relearning harmony” lands, if a bit on-the-nose. Resonance lingers conceptually more than emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of forgiveness, belief, and transforming mistakes into guiding “constellations” emerge organically from object and action. The tooth and bone-setting practice fuse nostalgia with innovation at closure. However, several thesis-like sentences in the final third verge on moralizing, slightly reducing subtext. The resonance is real and lingering, if a bit stated.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Light-as-reflection versus consumption is dramatized via sea glass and the vow, not preached. The mother’s line (“Light doesn’t need to burn”) is integrated as lived wisdom rather than a thesis statement. The final image reconfigures isolation into community without tidy moralizing. The thematic weave is strong, though its gentleness limits ambiguity’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres through image-work: thaw as method, circuitry reclaimed by moss, amber as preserved light. “Honeyed hush” shifts from concept to lived dynamic, resisting moralizing and letting subtext carry. One brief explicit statement about re-meaning the pendant edges toward telling, but it’s balanced by the enacted gesture. The final shared rise preserves ambiguity with warmth, not neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of making the transient durable and resisting cynicism emerges through actions (collecting hopes, solemnizing them) and images (spiral, kite, rope, loom) rather than bald statement. The final act reweights earlier motifs, offering a resonant, non-literal answer: art as vessel with a cost. A few sentences skate close to abstraction, but subtext mostly carries the load. The afterimage is cohesive and thoughtful.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Tradition restored through an inventive blend of nature and craft gives a coherent thematic arc. The final image reaffirms communal memory without moralizing, though it trends tidy and celebratory. Subtext around community complicity and forgetting is hinted but not pressed. Resonance is pleasing more than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of translating loss into guidance emerges through particulars: starlight as safekept memory, refuse into meridians, heartbeat-drops as cartography. The final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext of communal grief (“crater’s ghosts”) broadens the personal without flattening it. Slight uniformity of tone limits added complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: reason as vessel for wonder, grief metabolized through craft, and the ethics of preservation after war. Recurring images (peripheral light, mirrors, echoes) reweight at the end without moralizing. A slight risk of thesis-forward phrasing (“store wonder in the cellar of reason”) is offset by concrete process. The last image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: burdens transformed into weights, recursion turned into purpose, craft as a path through entrapment. The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, suggesting a measured hope that carries cost. Subtext in the “loom for universal truths” reframes captivity as vocation. A slight neatness in the “balance the scales” idea keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of control-as-harmony, here/gone, and harvesting loss arise organically from circus memory, ash wood properties, and the kettle’s constraint. The reprise of rain and skylight from wedding to widowhood reweights earlier images at the end. One explicit maxim risks didacticism but is grounded by character (Marcus) and dramatized through her act. The final image offers a non-literal answer: etching peace through work rather than stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of ambition’s erosion and the ethics of memory emerges from particulars (ticket whisper, builder’s gear). The final reweighting—choosing to weave regrets rather than recapture lost exposures—lands without moralizing. Subtext in the object and setting avoids heavy-handed allegory. A few explicit lines risk stating the premise, slightly dulling the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of renewal, redirected ambition, and “equations for hope” emerge through action and object usage rather than thesis statements. The final image reweights the sextant’s meaning and aligns personal craft with communal possibility. A few overt lines risk telling (“equations for hope”), but they’re supported by scene work. The resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Recurring images (petrichor, crystals, hush, the unfinished face) develop a theme of honoring rather than erasing what’s lost. The final act reweights the premise toward integration over mastery without overt moralizing. Some repetition edges toward telling (e.g., repeated “glacial hush,” “excruciatingly gentle”) and the meta word-count asides puncture the lingering resonance. Still, the non-literal answer lands through image rather than thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres through recurring objects (sundial), sensory silence (radio), and the journals’ schematics of deceit reframing his life-long pursuit. The final image reweights meaning convincingly, though it edges into explicit formulation (“architecture of lies…not a mystery to conquer”). Subtext mainly lives in objects and setting rather than dialogue. The resonance lingers but would deepen with a sharper on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Resonant motifs (seeds, rope-weaving, lightning-glass) braid into a thematic arc about stewardship of fragile wisdom. The final image reweights earlier details without a stated moral: the pact with the sea and the glass “vessel” answer the premise. Subtext (care vs. erasure; human craft against time) accrues through image, not sermon. A shade more moral friction would deepen the afterburn.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    The weft-thread motif reframes “explained absences” into a persuasive ethics of care; the thematic line culminates in the charged acceptance of solitude as the method’s cost. A few thesis-forward lines (“He understood then…”) risk overstatement but don’t collapse resonance. Subtext rides images (thread as vein; garden tending). The ending lingers with a durable, non-tidy aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—beauty’s return against a flawed genesis—emerges from images and action, culminating in the egg as a reweighted symbol rather than a lecture. The final vow offers a resonant, non-literal answer without tidy moralizing. Occasional explicit thematics (“genesis was flawed”) risk overstatement but do not smother the subtext. The aviary/egg reprise gives the piece a lingering aftertaste of frail hope.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of healing, inherited guilt, and compassionate repair resonate through concrete acts (the graft, the coin, the listening). Yet explicit thesis statements (“This scar will sing,” “proving her truth”) edge into moralizing and reduce subtext. The final paragraph tells what the images already show. Strong motifs do much of the work; trimming declarations would heighten depth.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, skepticism tempered by earned belief, and patience are woven through images (paused geese; shards; hushed city) and culminate without moralizing. The geese’s pause/resume reframes time as discipline, which reweights the ending. The liberation of public memory parallels a private ache without being stated. Ambiguity remains humane and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Generational recursion, “approximations of infinity,” and light-without-fire interlock through concrete images (petals, gear, sonar returns). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: choose illumination despite repetition, accepting the cost of continuity. Occasional explicit thematic phrasing skirts declaration but stays voice-motivated. The aftereffect is contemplative rather than didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of communal grief emerges organically through particulars: ribbon, poems, graves, and migration. The final image reprices earlier motifs without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer via the collective gravestone and the ribbon binding the family. A few overt phrases (“shape of grief”) brush the edge of explicitness but don’t collapse subtext. Resonance lingers in image more than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Time, tide, and balance integrate into a resonant moral calculus; the rake handle’s inscriptions concretize “incremental absolution.” The clock’s toll shifting from dirge to promise is a strong reweighting. One line edges toward thematic spelling-out (“must share these inscriptions”), trimming subtlety. Overall, the theme emerges from images and acts more than from statement.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of intention, time, and echoes recur through chess, gardening, and the tapestry. Some insights are told rather than shown (“the shape of intentions was not rigid, but fluid”), trimming subtext into statement. The final image carries a quiet repricing but is softened by meta interruptions that undercut resonance. Still, the chess/echo motif does meaningful thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—innovation as cultivated within constraint, ignorance mapped into possibility—emerges through action and motif rather than sermonizing. Recurring images (ice as parchment, ink as mineral night, quill) reweight at the end without a tidy moral. A couple of abstract formulations nudge toward thesis-speak, but the final poise resists closure-by-explanation. The aftertaste is reflective and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rich motifs (dust, embers, mist, “thistled calm”) develop a theme about revival through overlooked remnants and clandestine art. The ending offers a resonant, image-led answer: stories return by humble particles, carried by music. A few declaratives (“stories could never truly die”) nudge towards moralizing and reduce subtext. Still, the symbolism is coherent and mostly earned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme (“mirage of safety,” partial truths, earned incompletion) emerges organically from objects and actions. Recurrent images (ash, rocking motion, vanishing point, fractured porcelain) reweight at the end without sermonizing. The final placement of the mask functions as an answer: enduring with curated fracture instead of total exposure or denial. Resonant and disciplined.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Competing narratives (celestial lore vs engineered control) are dramatized through object and action rather than pure thesis. The ending reweights meaning: preservation becomes refusal, with cost and dignity. A few overt declarations (“rational rebellion”) brush against didacticism, but the last image holds subtext. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Vanishing arts,” “subtraction,” and “braiding” recur as images that evolve toward the final hush. The piece resists tidy moralizing, with a quiet earned wisdom grounded in scene. A few lines skirt thesis (“We begin… by denoting what binds us”), but the imagery carries most of the thematic weight. The closing poise reweights prior material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of quiet resistance, memory as sustenance, and beauty from decay arise organically from pruning, planting, and communal cooking. A few lines tilt toward thesis (“This isn’t fighting the system…”) but most resonance comes through image and action. The final image reweights prior motifs without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of safeguarding wonder within utility emerges organically via motifs (hive, nectar, match-flame) and Elias’s tactic of truth-through-mystery. The final cadence reweights the crisis as an invitation to curiosity rather than despair. No sermonizing; the imagery does the work. Minor neatness limits the lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of memory, displacement, and renewal emerge through concrete acts (object placement, scent) rather than abstract lecturing. The “shard of hush” reframes silence from loss to charged presence; the final image reweights prior details. One sentence edges toward thesis-statement (“He understood then…”), slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, resonance is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of certainty vs nuance, life/animation, and blurred boundaries arise organically from foxglove, quartz, and the garden’s purpose. Subtext is present in image and action, but moments of direct statement (“welcome nuance”) over-explain. The final image reweights earlier motifs effectively. Resonance is slightly undercut by the meta addendum after the natural ending.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Chance versus control, regret transmuted through method, and the perilous seduction of perpetual motion cohere in images rather than platitudes. The dice and gears recur with reweighted meaning at the end. The piece resists moralizing and leaves purposeful ambiguity about what’s lost in the break. A hair more friction between want and need on the page could have amplified the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, language, and kindness interweave via concrete symbols and vignettes, with the moon/brush motif evolving nicely. However, the explicit thesis-statement (“strangers do remember”) in the final beat tips into stated moral, softening subtext. Earlier images (the wildflower, the unsigned paints) already conveyed the argument effectively. Resonance lingers, but subtlety is compromised at the last moment.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres around preservation vs. vitality, exile’s memory-work, and the price of revival. The opera lens and thaw reweight meaning at the end—history must be touched to live, even if it decays. Subtext of community identity and climate pressure accrues without sermonizing. The resonance is strong, if a touch on-the-nose with repeated “historically oriented” labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres: hidden radiance in ordinary things versus the tyranny of fate, with an ending that reweights hope as costly defiance. Recurring images (counter-clockwise, low tide, hunger stone) evolve meaningfully. The phrase “latent radiance” is reiterated a bit too declaratively, edging toward label rather than pure scene-earned resonance. Nonetheless, the final image answers the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.6)
    Resonant motifs (mirrors, luminance, repulsion/allure) support themes of revelation vs. concealment and the social physics of fear (isolation). However, explicit thesis lines (“fear thrives on silence, crumbles in revelation”) and the advisor’s closing aphorism edge toward moralizing. Subtext exists in the mirror/dance-in-reverse paradox but is partially overwritten by direct statements. The ending’s conceptual note lands but could linger more through image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of transmuting adversity into art emerges organically through concrete acts (sketched resonance; dubbing obstacles into instruments). The final claim—“no barrier endured that couldn't be restrung into symphony”—edges toward explicit moralizing, slightly flattening ambiguity. Subtext hums in image (restless → resolute euphony) and the orchard’s survival as a reweighted rule-set. Resonance lingers, but neatness trims depth.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of knowledge-seeking versus containment, costs of language and contact, and duty to a living world emerge through particulars (shell patterns, gate corrosion, watcher-stasis). The ending’s conceptual repricing reframes curiosity as complicity with a felt toll. No moralized summary; the ambiguity—rescue vs unleashing wrath—lingers productively. Symbols recur with earned weight (whistle lowered; foam-glyphs).

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of noble lies vs historical truth is coherent and layered through images (ivy, rose, illuminated letter) and the familial thread. Some lines verge on moralizing (“truth was the only rescue”), flattening subtext that the images already carry. Still, the ending reframes prior images with conceptual cost, earning reflection. The piece resists total tidy moral calculus by honoring why the lie existed.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (interlaced absences, memorializing the unfulfilled) emerges through object, setting, and embodied acts rather than pure declaration. The inkwell’s reuse and the sealed notes reweight “repair” as elegy. Occasional explicitness and the meta close trim the lingering aftershock. Still, the final repositioning carries resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of truth vs. propaganda and preservation-through-submersion emerge organically through objects and action. “Reclaimed stillness” functions as both tactic and ethical stance, and the closing reprices the city’s myth without sermonizing. Some thematic phrasing edges toward explicitness, but the images carry most of the weight. Resonance lingers via the charged stamp and currents-as-clues.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: craft as ritual, grief as energy that can be shaped but not erased, and communion with a world that responds to inner states. Recurring images (shadow, lanterns, cranes) gain new weight in the ending’s fragile peace. No sermonizing; the final cadence carries complexity: healing equals ascent and descent. Subtext of transgression (forbidden recording) shades the solace with moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of grief transmuted into power, the ethics of repurposing “unused potential,” and complicity in weaponization emerge through images rather than sermonizing. The crystal’s reweighted meaning at awakening reframes the premise with a clear conceptual cost. Occasional diction (“awakening,” “potential”) skirts abstraction, but the final charged poise resists tidy moral closure. Resonance lingers in the idea of perturbing the perturbors.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Missing pieces” and “interstices” yoke the codework to belonging in a coherent, image-based argument. The type-foundry metaphor reweights the theme in the ending (“forging clarity from chaos”), avoiding overt moralizing. A few lines verge on direct thesis (“this frequency wasn’t mere sound”), but the piece mostly lets image do the work. The final chord resonates without neat didactic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Time, memory, and fabrication braid tightly through the watch hand and driftwood carvings, reweighted in the ending. The line “he had become a thief of truths” flirts with overt statement but is grounded by concrete images. The final talisman gesture offers a non-literal answer—truth as time reclaimed—without moralizing. Subtext in silence and ritual does the thematic heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of apology→forgiveness and recycling error into wisdom develop through recurring images (drawer pull, moon phases, untethering). Subtext in Lira’s “words are wind” and the mist lifting enriches the moral shift. A couple of lines edge toward thesis-stating (“recycled more than mistakes”), but the ending mostly earns its resonance via image. The familial note with Tomas grounds the abstract in personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Map vs. heart and flickering faith recur through concrete images (broken compass, poles-as-constellations, dolphins). Some theme statements are told outright (“to align heart and action”), edging toward platitude. The final beat gestures at repricing, but because the reunion is summarized, resonance is softened. Still, the “terrestrial constellation” motif offers a coherent thematic thread.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—empathy as a second-chance engine—emerges through concrete images (the pulsing signature as a bridge across regret, submerged relics of scores) rather than argument. The baseball’s reweighted meaning at the end (talisman of a “hard-won heart”) helps resonance. Some explicit moral phrasing and the meta coda slightly thin subtext at the last beat. Still, the final reconfiguration lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Metamorphosis as acceptance of grief’s change integrates with setting and ritual, avoiding bald moralizing. Recurring images (moonlight, spices, cosmic intimacy) reweight the final moment. The fortune’s line could read didactic, but it’s rebutted by concrete actions and a sealed sensory coda. Resonance lingers without tidy moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of legacy, regret, and time’s reparability (in essence, not form) emerge from particulars—the cracked saucer’s “mending,” handprint across realms, clouds veiling the sleeping child. The final repricing (“cloudbound repentance bloomed… breathable grace”) reweights prior images without a tidy moral. One line (“she understood: the lost time gathered here”) leans expository, but it doesn’t collapse the subtext. Emotional afterimage is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Compassion versus inherited violence emerges from particulars: photos’ tears, shadow work, Kwan Yin’s tear. The final image reweights prior motifs without explicit moralizing, though lines like “no desire for conquest” edge toward telling. Subtext lives in the ritual’s gentleness and refusal of force. The resonance is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.7)
    Thematic throughline—change as “vibrant hush,” abundance from giving—emerges through recurring images (jars, fireflies, black sand, tempered lava). The revelation is visualized (phosphorescent shells, mirrored constellations) rather than merely told. Some lines verge on moralizing (“Transformation’s texture unfolded...”) which slightly flattens subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior motifs without a didactic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Light/sparks versus dominion accrues through specific images and culminates in a quiet reconfiguration (“the spark herself”). The “winking hush” ethos coheres with the theme of subversive, wordless change. However, with minimal on-page harm or moral trade-offs, resonance doesn’t deepen into complexity. The piece avoids moralizing but stays relatively safe.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: control vs surrender to pattern, promise as duty, vision’s cost reweighted into purpose. Recurring images (borrowed dawn, eels, spiral) develop in concert with the arc and re-tone the ending. A few lines verge on stated uplift (“the world after friction’s end felt whole”), slightly flattening the ambiguity. The final image still invites reflection without a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs (scars/maps, storm/lightning, timer) cohere into a resonant argument about repression refining—and scarring—voice. The final images reweight prior material, though the quoted line “Scars are the stars we navigate by” tilts toward thesis-stating. Subtext largely rides image and action rather than sermonizing. Emotional aftereffect is contemplative and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (needles/angles/sundial) braid into a theme about redirecting conflict and re-mapping fate through inquiry. The final gesture offers a resonant answer—questions as destinations—without outright moralizing, though a few lines skate close to thesis-stating. Subtext in the move from steel to ideas is effective and earned by the cipher’s revelation. Complexity is present but could cut deeper into ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: beauty and story as resistance in carceral chaos, rendered through concrete acts (mending covers, quotes on beams, the tin ferrying ideas). Recurring images (moonlight, fracture, bloom) reweight the ending without sermonizing. The last lines reprice the premise: hope as crafted, risky labor. Complexity persists—danger remains present.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Time, fate, and art-as-interruption interweave through concrete motifs (clock, compasses, film, tides) that shift meaning in the finale. The piece resists moralizing; resonance arises from the reconfigured image of time moving again. Subtext (paths unchosen, improvisation vs. destiny) accrues organically from action. The aftereffect is contemplative and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme (memory’s preservation through communal interpretation, science braided with myth) emerges from action and recurring images (seed, blooms, storm). The ending reweights prior material: resolve found within “luminous doubt” rather than certainty. No sermonizing; resonance lingers through implication. Slight repetition in phrasing blunts peak subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Motifs (bonsai pruning, tide-gifts, compass, cerulean) braid into a coherent meditation on remorse and earned gentleness. The final image reweights prior details without sermonizing; “Forgive me, Mira” risks directness but is earned by the ritual. Thematic complexity persists in the cost of pride and the patience of craft. Subtext operates in the action of shaping and weaving rather than thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of discovering profound truth in humility, decay, and "gradual change" is expertly woven through the story's central imagery. The connection between the decaying greenhouse, the fragile butterflies, and the slow erosion of stellar cores is resonant and insightful. The score is slightly tempered by a few instances of thematic over-explicitness, such as when "the core concept of gradual change permeate her being," which comes close to stating the moral instead of letting the final image carry it alone.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding new art in ruin emerges organically from the plot and culminates in a strong final image. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its central thematic question multiple times ("to discover purpose in the pauses"). This thematic echo borders on authorial summary, particularly in the reflective block, preventing the theme from resonating with the full power of implication.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of transforming trauma into connection is beautifully woven through the core concept of translating emotion into vibratory music. However, the story's final two paragraphs slip into overt thematic summary, explicitly stating the meaning of the events. The final sentence, "to rectify silence with the music of the soul," is a Thematic Echo that explains the story's point, slightly diminishing the resonance that the powerful preceding scene had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of rest, duty, and memory is subtle yet profound, emerging entirely from the story's particulars. The final image of souls finding permanence as ink in eternal books is a brilliant, non-literal resolution to the problem of restlessness. It avoids moralizing, instead offering a complex and resonant idea of what it means to be laid to rest, which elevates the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of intergenerational resilience is central and potent. Unfortunately, the story compromises its own subtext at the climax when Elara explicitly states the theme: "they've nourished our legacy." This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a direct authorial statement, a significant flaw that undermines the otherwise powerful scene. The final paragraph recovers some ground, but the direct explanation dulls the story's lingering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of love, memory, and healing emerges organically from the story's central images: the camera obscura, the shared breath, the luminous flowers. The final realization that love's storehouse is "the heart's quiet archive" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial question, beautifully re-contextualizing the entire quest. The final image of the obscura capturing "eternal breath" instead of a static picture is a sophisticated thematic grace note that avoids any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of time, memory, and perception is integrated with remarkable coherence, emerging organically from the interplay of character, setting, and concept. The recurring motif of "fading photographs" is powerfully re-charged in the climax. The final lines, describing time's texture as "grains of sandpaper regret, threads of velvet anticipation," provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without a whisper of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of resilience blooming from division is powerfully integrated, culminating in the final, resonant image of planting seeds. The story successfully avoids a simple moral, contrasting the public, chaotic celebration with Elias's quiet, foundational act of hope. The score is slightly tempered by the explicit statement of the theme ("to plant resilience in the dry soil of a land starved"), which borders on thematic echo, though the powerful final image ultimately does the primary work.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of memory's impact and resilience is powerfully explored through the central metaphor of forging absences. However, the story occasionally tips into direct thematic statement, particularly in the bracketed authorial asides that reveal the intended meaning. The final line, "a faint, healing hum," is a much more resonant and effective thematic delivery than the more explicit articulations preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of destiny and reinterpretation emerges organically from the story's imagery, culminating in a resonant final image of the star map. However, the final paragraph tips into overt thematic statement with lines like "she wasn't just a thief anymore, but a guardian" and "destiny's echoes guiding her steps." This explicit moralizing slightly undermines the subtext and lands as a "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thematic development is strong and well-integrated, with the setting beautifully reflecting the internal "thawing heart." However, the story occasionally veers into stating its theme too explicitly, as with the line "mirroring the core concept that had haunted him: the thawing heart." This moment of thematic echo, while brief, slightly undermines the otherwise masterful subtext and prevents the piece from reaching the highest tier in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of vulnerability as strength emerges organically from Elara’s actions. However, the story undermines its own subtext with the final, explicit sentence: "vulnerability, embraced, was power incarnate." This is a classic "Thematic Echo," a moralizing summary that replaces earned resonance with a direct statement, significantly weakening the story's literary impact at the last moment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is the story's resonant core, emerging organically from the synthesis of image, action, and concept. The idea of mapping chaos and preserving memory against oblivion is never stated, only enacted. The recurring motifs of "ambered hush" and "marbled hush" accumulate meaning beautifully, and the final image of the mental map provides a complex, non-literal answer to the story's central existential question. It avoids any hint of moralizing, leaving a powerful, lingering aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of consciousness as a layered, amalgamated phenomenon is potent and well-integrated into the central imagery. The final scene provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's driving question. However, the piece suffers from several instances of "Thematic Echo," where key concepts are explicitly stated in thesis-like sentences (e.g., "...thoughts weren't solitary, but communal..."), which slightly undermines the otherwise elegant, emergent quality of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of connection through radical honesty is powerfully rendered through the central metaphor of the doodles. The final image of the interwoven sketches provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of mistrust. However, the theme is slightly over-articulated in moments like "honesty's raw form" and the heavy repetition of "ambiguously clear," which veer toward thematic labeling rather than pure subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of faith-based connection versus empirical measurement is developed with nuance through potent symbols like the mended marbles and the sentient garden. The final image powerfully resolves the central question without overt moralizing. However, the final sentence, "And in the measurable world of luck, Elias found his unquantifiable truth," verges on a thematic statement, slightly over-articulating the otherwise elegantly shown conclusion and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of time's nonlinear nature is elegantly integrated with the plot, emerging organically from character motivation and action. The story avoids moralizing, and the final image of a "tapestry of sideways eternity" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conceptual question. The execution is strong, though it lacks significant subtextual layers, presenting its theme quite directly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of memory, art, and silenced voices emerges organically from the story’s particulars without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image of "a love betrayed, a voice forever silenced" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central mystery, re-contextualizing the ghost story as a poignant tragedy. The recurring motifs of water and silence are woven in skillfully, culminating in a thematically rich conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of finding resilience in ambiguity ("swaying certainties") emerges organically from the central image of the smudged illustration and the flickering aurora. The story masterfully avoids didacticism, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question in the final image. The connection between Mira's fault-tolerant nature and the alpine edelweiss is a particular strength, integrating concept and character beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of haunting as a manifestation of human guilt rather than supernatural force is developed with nuance and subtext. The story reframes the "ghost shift" as an echo of regret, a concept that lands with force in the final paragraph. The closing image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central inquiry, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of witnessing change and the nature of permanence is developed with subtlety and grace, emerging organically from the story's imagery rather than through direct statement. The contrast between the decaying, organic library and the eternal, mineral refuge provides a powerful central metaphor. The final image—the keeper chronicling the river's carve—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central questions about time and observation, avoiding a simplistic moral entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding renewal within loss ("ordinary magic") emerges organically from the story's powerful imagery—the enduring sage, the eclipse, the keepsake. The subtext is handled with grace for most of the story. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a "Thematic Echo" by explicitly stating the thesis: "Ordinary magic, she thought, thrives in such moments—eclipses of the soul, where shadows reveal the light." This moment of telling slightly undermines the powerful showing that preceded it.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic resonance is the story's greatest strength. It masterfully weaves together memory, loss, and the purpose of storytelling in a world without a future. The final realization is a complex, non-moralizing answer to the central question, emerging organically from the discovered artifacts rather than being stated, culminating in a poignant and lingering final image.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of "open secrets" and fate versus agency is woven skillfully through the narrative particulars, particularly the microdots and the prophetic fortunes. The story avoids moralizing, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The final image powerfully encapsulates the central thematic question, showing the transposition from hidden individual secrets to a shared, unfolding destiny.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of exposing hidden assumptions is powerfully integrated into the core conflict and action. However, the story suffers from overt thematic statements, particularly in the final act. The line "the core concept etched in his mind: unraveled stillness was not end..." is a direct summary of the theme, a "thematic echo" that replaces earned resonance with explanation, significantly reducing the score.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.3)
    Themes of time, memory, and artistic creation emerge organically from the story’s central images and actions, avoiding any direct moralizing. The nautilus shell, the mirrored horizon, and the "upturned hush" all work in concert to build a complex thematic resonance. The final image provides a non-literal, poetic resolution to the character's "chronological homesickness" that is both beautiful and deeply satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of self-integration through confronting past choices is coherent and well-developed. It emerges directly from the plot's structure of "retracing" fractured timelines. The final image of the ripple expanding in harmony is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. The score is tempered because the story occasionally states its thematic concepts ("fractured timelines," "labyrinth of self") too directly, bordering on thematic echo rather than allowing them to remain purely subtextual.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the theme is otherwise beautifully woven through character and action, it is significantly undermined by a moment of overt thematic statement: "That filament of hush was her core concept..." This line functions as a Thematic Echo, explicitly telling the reader the story's thesis and demonstrating a lack of faith in the subtext to do its work.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of integrity evolving under pressure is coherently woven through the narrative. However, the story occasionally resorts to stating its theme directly, as in "solitude as the forge of unyielding honesty," which feels like authorial summary and slightly undermines the otherwise effective subtext and resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of memory and sensory-triggered grief is explored with nuance and depth, emerging organically from the story’s potent imagery. However, the resonance is slightly undermined by a moment of over-explication. The line "...the impact of memories lay in their sensory anchors..." explicitly states the theme, functioning as a "thematic echo" that replaces a moment of pure emotional experience with an analytical summary, weakening an otherwise powerful climax.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme exploring the value of memory, suffering, and freedom is woven effectively through the central motif of the rope. The story's final choice offers a resonant, ambiguous answer, refusing a simple moral. However, the theme's power is diminished by moments of overt authorial statement, particularly the line "should he trade his scars for stardust, or cling to the fray that made him whole?" which functions as a thematic summary rather than letting the action speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in the incomplete is central and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext by stating its theme too directly. Phrases like "to find beauty in the unfinished" and calling the ripples "the unfinished beauties" function as thematic labels. This directness, particularly the repetition of "magnificent simplicity," feels like an authorial assertion rather than an emergent property, slightly flattening the potential for deeper resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of authenticity versus simulation is explored with nuance, culminating in the sophisticated insight that her "half truths had eased their burdens... in veiled kinship." The story wisely avoids a simplistic moral, instead suggesting a continuum between counterfeit and genuine connection. The final image of her "real one, thorough and alive" smile offers a resonant, embodied answer to the story's central question, avoiding any preachy summation.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme of "cycles of compassion" is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of showing over telling. The narrator explicitly states the theme multiple times, such as when describing "compassion's true power lay in its cycles," and Mira's line about the locket's "symbols of compassion." This heavy-handed moralizing, a form of Thematic Echo, preempts any subtlety and leaves no room for reader interpretation, resulting in sentimentality rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of kinship enduring beyond loss emerges organically from the plot and central imagery. The final image of the dedicated arbor offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's quest for belonging. The story's strength is its embrace of complexity, transforming sorrow rather than erasing it. The score is slightly tempered by moments of direct thematic statement, such as Lir's line about "kinship endur[ing] beyond words," which borders on stating the theme outright.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thematic exploration of art, legacy, and eternity is skillfully woven through the narrative's core concepts. The infinity pendant, the echoes, and the final "unresolved yet complete" cadence all work in concert without resorting to overt statements. The story's final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of artistic legacy, framing it as a beautiful but binding loop. The theme emerges organically from the particulars of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of ambiguous loss and its integration into one's life is explored with nuance and sensitivity. The core metaphor of emotional mathematics develops from a "cage" to a "map," offering a resonant answer to the central question. While highly effective, the final realization is articulated with a clarity that borders on a stated moral ("perhaps loss was not erasure but a new term..."), slightly reducing the subtextual power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of becoming visible as an act of inheriting and passing on kindness is developed with subtlety and grace. The final image of Elias and the young woman sharing a "sense memory" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The note, "you are seen," borders on being too direct but functions as an in-world action that narrowly avoids becoming a thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of understanding nature through surrender rather than control emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the smiling, transformed Elara provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The narrative avoids simplistic morals, though the explicit naming of the "circuitously sincere" trait comes close to stating a thematic idea directly instead of letting it remain purely subtextual.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding meaning through connection emerges organically from the story's particulars. However, the final paragraph lapses into overt thematic summary with the line "meaning emerged not in solitude, but in the earnest exchanges that bound survivors." This explicit statement is a "Thematic Echo" that slightly diminishes the resonant power of the final image, telling the reader what to feel instead of trusting the scene's work.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The themes of hubris and the hidden costs of power emerge organically from the plot. The final image of Elara's changed eyes is resonant and avoids a simple moral. However, the score is limited by a moment of thematic over-statement in the final act, where the narration explicitly articulates the forces' purpose as "guardians...to prevent exploitation," which borders on explaining the story's moral to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding resilience in loss is central and integrated into the story's core symbols. The final image of the resonant hum provides a poignant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the story undermines its own subtext with an overly explicit thematic statement: "...the exile was not mere loss, but a forging, absences navigated to reveal resilience." This thematic echo significantly reduces the score by replacing earned resonance with a direct summary.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding one's true path through a blend of analysis and intuition emerges organically from the plot. However, the final line—"Elara's analytically artistic soul found its true map"—is an overt thematic statement. This explicit moralizing slightly undermines the resonance of the final image, replacing earned subtext with a less powerful summary.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    A complex and beautiful theme emerges from the synthesis of disparate patterns. The final image of the tile as a "silent conductor" is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. However, the preceding line, "she realized reflection wasn't about belief, but about bravely opening to the patterns that connected us all," is a major flaw—an explicit thematic statement that undermines the subtext and costs the story publishable perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding meaning in eternity emerges organically from character and conflict. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elowen's initial void. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with moments of over-articulation, most notably the line, "Not an end, she knew now, but a quiet revolution of the soul." This thematic echo states the conclusion too directly, preventing the theme from landing with the full power of implication.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of balancing deceit and justice is woven beautifully through the narrative, culminating in the elegant paradox of the formula. However, the story's final two sentences ("political asylum felt less like escape...") state this theme too directly. This moment of thematic summary slightly undermines the resonance of the final image, replacing earned subtext with an explicit authorial interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme—the power of artifice to reconstruct reality—emerges with subtlety and force from the story's central images and actions. The parallel between shaping bonsai and writing invented histories is elegant and resonant. The final image of Elias returning to "illuminate" the town provides a non-literal, emotionally complex answer to the central problem, avoiding a simple moral in favor of earned, fragile hope.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of erased histories and the nature of memory emerges organically from the story's particulars without a single line of overt statement. The final image of weaving disparate stories into a whole provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what constitutes an identity. The piece achieves a profound emotional aftereffect through its imagery—"jagged, salty layers"—and avoids any hint of sentimentality or a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding profound truths in ephemeral, subjective experiences is woven well through the narrative's imagery. The final image of the "unsolved yet illuminating" riddle lands with resonance. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its theme too directly, as in the line "why do we seek eternity in ephemera," which functions more like a thesis statement than subtext, slightly diluting the otherwise potent sense of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of balancing communal identity against the pressures of gentrification emerges organically from the plot. The final mural of the phoenix is a potent, if slightly overt, thematic image. The story avoids a simple moral, landing on a complex compromise, but occasionally leans on declarative statements like "to navigate gentrification not as victims... but as a unified flotilla," which border on thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of preserving fleeting natural beauty against encroaching human progress emerges organically and powerfully. The "dawning hush" and the "hourglass grain" act as potent, non-literal symbols, resonating with a deep sense of loss and the urgency of preservation. The final image of the captured hush and the nightwatch's spectral plea offers a strong, complex thematic answer without moralizing, leaving a poignant emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of mending hope and finding guidance in obscurity emerges organically from the central action. The final image of the drone as a "jewel in the calm dawn, carrying his mended hope" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question without resorting to moralizing. The thematic execution is strong and integrated, resisting simplistic conclusions.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic exploration of order versus nature, and maps versus reality, is woven skillfully through the narrative. The central metaphor of finding "natural cartography" on a frosted window is both original and resonant. The story's final image—the window frosting over anew with "secrets for the next seeker"—provides a thoughtful, non-didactic conclusion that lingers effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of communal harmony arising from shared, purposeful action is powerfully integrated into the central conceit. The final image of the "wild hush transformed into a living breath" offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is tempered by moments of overt thematic statement, such as Thorne's line "to balance what the hush has broken," which verges on summarizing the story's core idea.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding strength in transient memories is powerfully dramatized through the story's central mechanic. However, its impact is significantly undermined by being stated explicitly early on ("Elara's motivation burned fierce: to harness the ephemeral..."). This instance of thematic echo violates the principle of showing over telling and prevents the story from reaching a higher tier of literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is handled with exceptional subtlety and power, emerging entirely through the interwoven motifs of storytelling, silence, and imprisonment. The story offers a profound meditation on inheritance and the power of narrative to define reality without ever stating its thesis. The final image of the tamed wolf is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, reweighting all prior material with a sense of hard-won peace.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of guilt, ambition, and eternal love emerge organically from the narrative. The final image of the pulsing bead offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the score is slightly tempered by the repetitive use of the key phrase "mournful elation," which functions as a thematic label that verges on telling the reader the intended feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of art healing communal trauma emerges organically from the central weaving metaphor. The story's final image, with the community gathered around the cracked illustration plate, offers a superb, non-literal resolution. The score is slightly tempered by a tendency to state thematic concepts directly, such as "stitching the fractured world into something sacred," which verges on telling the reader the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of "interrupted journeys" is woven through the narrative with considerable skill, connecting Elara's diaspora past with the ancestral bones and the act of restoration. The final image of the rebuilt sundial provides a powerful, non-literal resolution. The score is tempered by a slight tendency toward direct statement, particularly in the final line which risks summarizing the theme ("journeys no longer forever interrupted") instead of relying solely on subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding poetry in overlooked, analog spaces is beautifully integrated through imagery and action. The juxtaposition of chalk and holograms is a powerful, non-verbal exploration of the core idea. However, the story undermines its own subtlety with the on-the-nose final note, "Find the poetry in what they ignore," which functions as a thematic summary that slightly deflates the resonant ambiguity of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of unheard stories and hidden truths is woven deeply into Elara’s motivation and methods, emerging organically from the narrative rather than being stated. Subtext flourishes in her disguised wisdom and the council’s feigned unity. The ending, with Elara preparing to voice these truths, offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The themes of forgiveness and reclaiming the past emerge organically from the story's central magical conceit. The healing shard is a powerful, integrated motif. The score is held back slightly by the final paragraphs, where the prose explicitly states the theme—"moonlight healed not just the shard, but the scars within"—a minor thematic echo that trades resonance for unnecessary clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of healing through shared narrative is powerfully integrated into the story's core action. However, the story occasionally lapses into thematic summary, undermining its subtext. Lines like her motivation "to graft new meaning onto old wounds" and the final sentence's "anxieties shared and thus diminished" state the theme too directly, bordering on a moral that would be more resonant if left purely to the story's potent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of rediscovering artistry by connecting to a timeless, shared creative spirit emerges organically from the plot. However, the story suffers from a critical flaw in its final lines. The meta-commentary ("Wait, that's over—let me adjust for count...") shatters the fictional dream, replacing resonant imagery with authorial intrusion. This act of telling instead of showing functions as a thematic summary that severely undermines the earned, subtle conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of curiosity versus certainty is potent and well-integrated through the central conflict and the symbolism of the restored murals and the hobo nickel. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Elara's final line, "Perhaps the secret is in the asking, not the answer," and the concluding summary, "forever trading the known for the curious horizon," function as moralizing labels that reduce the resonant ambiguity built by the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of subversive creation as a form of rebellion emerges organically from the central conceit of the "counterfeit garden." The story's final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of state control. However, a few lines veer into direct thematic summary, such as the final paragraph's "standing guard over one's spark meant planting it in the wild," which slightly undermines the subtext by stating the moral too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of transforming pain into beauty is masterfully integrated, emerging organically from the central action rather than through authorial statement. The final image of the "blossom armistice" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It's a powerful and complex metaphor that lingers without needing to be explained.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme is woven seamlessly into the story's fabric through concepts like the "museum of extinct feelings" and the act of mending with sound. The narrative resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex meditation on memory, loss, and the value of preservation in the face of inevitable decay. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion to the story's central question about purpose and futility.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of truth and honesty as a foundation for trust is central and well-integrated into the plot's magical premise. The primary weakness is its explicit articulation. Elara's line, "...it's a symphony, chords of truth that demand honesty to play," functions as a thematic statement that preempts resonant discovery. The resolution is tidy, offering a simple moral rather than complex, lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of harmonizing engineering with nature is coherent and skillfully integrated through the central conceit of "encrypted compassion." The final image of using the surveyor's chain for "measured unity" is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraphs verge on thematic summary, with phrases like "harmonizer of worlds," which slightly over-articulates the moral instead of allowing the final image to carry the full weight of the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of authentic renewal versus protective fabrication is woven seamlessly through the story's core images, particularly the contrast between the meteorite's reality and the dust's ephemerality. The final image of a "history no longer reinvented but authentically renewed" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It avoids a simple moral, leaving a lingering, complex emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of "necessary distances" is thoughtfully explored and integrated into the story's core mechanics. However, the story occasionally veers into direct thematic statement, slightly undermining subtext, as with the line "necessary distances were the quiet architects of meaning." While the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer, these moments of over-articulation prevent the theme from emerging entirely through implication.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of belonging is central and coherent, but its execution relies too heavily on direct statements of motivation and yearning. This explicitness undermines the power of subtext and the potential for a more resonant, earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme emerges organically from a powerful set of images, the story falters by making it too explicit at the end. The crater glass literally transliterating the theme into text is a major device that undercuts subtext. The final paragraphs contain several sentences that directly state the story's moral (e.g., "discovery lay not in permanence, but in the scatter and the sprout"), a significant flaw that reads as authorial summary rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's theme is coherent but undermined by heavy-handed, repetitive authorial statements that function as direct moralizing. Phrases like "orchestrated serendipity" and "randomness ordered into memory" are explained to the reader, eliminating subtext and preventing thematic resonance from emerging organically from the events. This direct telling, a form of Thematic Echo, significantly flattens the story's potential for depth.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story masterfully develops its themes of memory, rebellion, and art's permanence without resorting to overt statements. The central concept of transforming nostalgia "into something new, untethered" is beautifully dramatized. The final image of the cosmic verse soaring into the sky provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of the ban's erasure, leaving a lasting impression of defiance and creation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding value in the mundane emerges organically from the story's central images of light and water. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its thematic aims. Phrases like "he aimed to exalt the everyday" and the final summary, "he had found the glow in the grit," function as thematic labels that replace the resonance of the final image, preventing the piece from fully trusting its own powerful symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of innocence bartered for wisdom is potent, and the central imagery of scars and the cracked box supports it beautifully. However, the story suffers from repeated, overt thematic statements that undermine subtext. Phrases like "translate that pain into a universal language" and "innocence wasn't shattered but bartered" function as authorial explanations rather than emergent truths, a significant flaw for this literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme—hope as a calculated, adaptive process—is potent and well-integrated into the central metaphor. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its theme too directly, particularly with the explicit equation "Hope = (Tide Rise × Timeline Divergence) / Logical Anchor," which feels more like a thematic label than an organic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of historical responsibility and atonement emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The central conceit of "walls dreaming" is beautifully paid off, shifting from a metaphor for loss to one of potential redemption. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara’s quest, reframing her personal history as a collective map for the future without stating an explicit moral.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of art granting a form of immortality is woven organically through the story's imagery and action. The final images provide a resonant answer to the central question. However, a few lines near the end, such as "she found her calm purpose: to grace the impossible with borrowed life," verge on thematic summary, slightly diminishing the subtextual power of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    A coherent theme of imperfect peace and the cost of redemption emerges, skillfully echoed in the "flawed beauty" motif. However, the story undermines its own subtext by stating its theme directly, particularly with the line "The core concept burned in her mind: the price of redemption...". This moment of thematic moralizing replaces earned resonance with overt explanation, a significant flaw in an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of dominion, memory, and atonement emerges organically from the story's particulars. The central image of the fractured land mirroring a fractured soul is sustained without ever feeling heavy-handed. The final action offers a resonant, non-literal answer to his conflict, setting an "echo" free rather than stating a moral, which leaves a lasting, complex emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of rebellion fueled by the memory of dissent emerges organically from the central metaphor of "harvesting echoes." The final, ambiguous image of the snow-veiled path provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, avoiding a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is potent and well-integrated into the character's conflict, but its resolution is undermined by overt moralizing. The line "storytelling's ethic lay not in tearing down but in building bridges" is a direct thematic statement that replaces the resonance of the final image with a simplistic moral. This flattens the complexity of the debate the story initially poses, offering a tidy answer instead of a lingering, resonant question.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of honoring transient beauty and overlooked histories emerges organically from the story’s particulars. The final image of the unraveled totem is a powerful, non-literal answer to the central thematic question. The score is slightly limited because core thematic concepts, like "interrupted cadence," are explicitly named rather than purely shown, verging on thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    The themes of forgiveness, memory, and redemption are woven seamlessly into the plot. The story's central metaphor, giving voice to forgotten names through an act of precise craft, powerfully mirrors Elara's own journey of self-forgiveness. The final image of her as a "living transcribed memory" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion that elevates the narrative beyond a simple resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transcending a perceived curse to find purpose emerges organically from the plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the dream figure's line, "...to transcend the illusion of control," borders on a thematic echo, stating the story's thesis too directly and slightly undermining the subtext built elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme exploring the tension between empirical science and mystical belief is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, its expression is marred by heavy-handedness. The repeated phrase "empirically ironic" functions as a thematic label, stating the story's thesis directly rather than allowing it to emerge fully from subtext, which prevents the theme from achieving true resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is clear but delivered with a heavy hand, favoring direct statement over emergent discovery. Lines like "resentment...was a chain forged in isolation" function as authorial moralizing that summarizes the epiphany instead of allowing the reader to experience it. The ending offers a tidy answer rather than resonant ambiguity, violating the rule against thematic statements that replace scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of reconciling pragmatism with imagination emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery, particularly the sextant and the glass mountains. The final image of Elias being both "firmly grounded yet reaching toward the infinite" is a resonant, non-literal resolution. The piece is only held back from a higher score by the concluding phrase, which states the theme a bit too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of resilience emerging from broken promises is developed with subtlety and power, primarily through the central metaphor of "deciduous vows." The final image is resonant and lands the theme non-verbally. However, the line where the quartz reveals its new wisdom feels like a thematic summary, slightly over-explaining the story's point and pulling it back from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story explores compelling themes of nonlinear time, knowledge, and destiny. The cameo's blankness as a "mirror for the soul's unruly desires" is a potent central metaphor. However, the execution is hampered by moments of overt thematic statement, such as when Elara has a breakthrough that "bathrooms... were portals for such insights." This direct explanation ("thematic echo") undercuts the subtext and feels less earned than the story's more imagistic revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of knowledge, and particularly the power found in its omissions, is expertly woven into the narrative's core concept, character methods, and setting details. The "Library of Unlearned Lessons" and the plants thriving on "narrative inconsistencies" create a coherent and intriguing thematic landscape. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer, though its impact is slightly muted by the conflict's facile resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of memory, identity, and storytelling as a means of reclamation is sophisticated and emerges organically from the story's particulars. The central paradox of "trapped freedom" is beautifully sustained, resisting any simple moral. The final image of Elara smiling as she vows to continue offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest—the act of weaving the narrative *is* the finding, regardless of the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of translating confusion into clarity is coherent and well-integrated through Elara's actions and the story's core conflict. However, the ending features explicit thematic statements and summation, which diminish the subtext and resonance of an otherwise strong conceptual foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of forging harmony from discord is elegantly woven into the narrative fabric. The central concept of the "bloom of hush" serves as a powerful, resonant metaphor that is actualized in the final scene. The story's final image—the "spectral flower of quietude"—provides a non-literal, emotionally satisfying answer to the central problem without resorting to moralizing, leaving a lingering sense of earned peace.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of finding meaningful patterns within chaos is masterfully woven into the plot, character, and central objects. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a direct thematic statement ("coincidences were the universe's quiet language..."), which slightly undermines the powerful resonance of the preceding action. The story shows its theme so effectively that this final moment of telling feels redundant and lessens the impact of an otherwise subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.5)
    The themes of identity, memory, and preservation are potent and well-integrated into the concept. However, the story suffers from "Thematic Echo," repeatedly stating its core ideas ("sculpt identity from experience," "preemptively nostalgic") rather than allowing them to emerge solely from action and image. This over-articulation lessens the subtextual power and makes the theme feel declared rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of creation as an act of defiance against despair is seamlessly integrated and powerfully realized. It emerges organically from character, action, and image, never resorting to overt moralizing. The final image of the word "Rise" hanging in the starless sky is a masterful, non-literal answer to the story's central question, reweighting all of Elias's prior doubt and struggle into a moment of luminous, earned hope.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story develops its theme of transition and temporality through resonant imagery—the tidal pools, the cicada, the stars. The subtext is strong throughout the silent observation. Unfortunately, the ending succumbs to a "Thematic Echo," where Elara explicitly states the story's thesis. This direct moralizing ("Time's texture... is not smooth... but layered—rough where we cling, fluid where we release") replaces earned resonance with a summary, significantly weakening the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of freedom versus confinement emerges organically from the story's core conceits and imagery. The subtext is rich, contrasting intangible value with concrete construction. The final line, "To stretch the silences... before they contract like your bunkers," is powerful but verges on a 'Thematic Echo,' explicitly stating the central tension and thus slightly undermining the resonance that was already achieved through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of silence as a therapeutic agent is well-integrated and emerges organically from the atmosphere and action. However, the story's subtext is weakened by Elias's direct explanation of the theme to Lira. This moment of "thematic echo" explicitly states the story's thesis, reducing the resonance that would have been achieved by letting the final, quiet image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of synthesizing past and future, nature and technology, emerges organically from the setting and character's motivation. The concept of "futuristic nostalgia" provides a strong, coherent core. However, the story falters slightly at the conclusion by resorting to thematic statements that feel too explicit, such as calling the ending a "perfect harmony" and a "spark for reclamation." These lines state the theme directly rather than letting the final resonant image do the work, which slightly undermines the subtext built throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    A complex theme of constructive severance emerges organically from the story's imagery and central conflict. The piece resonates with a powerful, ambiguous morality. However, the final line, "bridges burned to build better air," functions as a direct thematic statement that moralizes the ending, a significant flaw that undercuts the otherwise potent subtext by replacing resonance with a tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transmuting adversity into value is potent and well-integrated into the plot. The final image of fungi cradling diamonds provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by a few on-the-nose thematic statements, such as "forging value from adversity" and "turn scheme into salvation," which border on thematic echo rather than allowing the concept to emerge entirely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of liberation through the destruction of a corrupt legacy emerges organically from the plot. The story successfully avoids a simple moral, finding release in what would typically be a tragedy. While potent, the theme is occasionally handled with a heavy hand, using phrases like "scepter of revelation" and "dynasty ender" that state the symbolic weight rather than letting it resonate entirely through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of moving from fearful withdrawal to creative engagement is expertly woven into the core metaphor of the puppeteer. The final image of the unsnapped armor provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story occasionally slips into over-articulation, as with the line "a core concept of loyalty whispered," which verges on stating its theme directly.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding meaning in "small kindnesses" and overlooked histories emerges organically from the story's particulars. The final action—transcribing the file—serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the central thematic question. However, a line like "magnifying these obscured generosities could illuminate her path forward" borders on stating the theme directly, slightly reducing the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of fighting apathy with historical truth is a strong concept and integrates well with the plot's objective. However, the execution lacks subtlety, with repeated phrases like "tyranny of indifference" and "coded freedom." The final two sentences become an explicit thematic statement, which undermines the resonance of the climactic scene by telling the reader what to feel instead of letting the image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, exploring silence, memory, and the power of absence without a single line of exposition. The central concept that true power lies in "what wasn't played" is beautifully dramatized in the climax. The final, resonant image offers a non-literal resolution that powerfully answers the story's central question about breaking a cycle of dread.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of balancing order with wildness emerges organically from Elara's journey. However, the story undermines its own subtext with an explicit thematic statement near the end: "the leaves' message was one of balance, urging the sorters to remember the wild heart beneath order." This moment of telling what was already shown acts as a thematic echo, reducing the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of embracing chaos over rigid order is woven seamlessly into every element, from the character's profession to the final symbolic object. The needle-less compass serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question, a perfect objective correlative for "befriending uncertainty." The ending resonates strongly, recontextualizing his entire life without stating a moral, which satisfies the core requirement for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    The themes of redemption, imperfection (kintsugi), and memory are tightly interwoven. The story uses its central action—mending the crucible—as a powerful, non-literal exploration of mending the self. The final image of the redeemed vessel is resonant. However, the thematic explicitness of the whispered line, "Names weigh because they remember," borders on a stated moral, slightly undercutting the subtext by articulating the story's core thesis too directly at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of healing through joy is central, but its delivery is weakened by overt statement. The line, "Healing isn't in silence... but in reclaiming the joy that pain tried to drown," functions as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the story's thesis. While the recurring "luminous ache" motif adds resonant complexity, this direct moralizing prevents the theme from emerging with full subtlety from the narrative's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of quantifying mercy in the face of immense suffering is explored with nuance and avoids easy moralizing. The concept of an "equation" for forgiveness emerges organically from the character's past as a cartographer. The final image of him walking a path is a powerful, non-literal answer to his quest—the "mathematics" are not a formula to be solved, but a path to be walked. The story trusts its imagery to carry the thematic weight without overstating it.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory, legacy, and the validation of forgotten histories are woven deeply into the narrative. The final image of echoes pouring forth provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the recurring thematic phrases like "anchors of intuition" and "eternal instant," while conceptually consistent, sometimes feel stated rather than purely emergent, bordering on thematic labels.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of uncovering hidden truths to release past burdens is clear but handled with a heavy hand. The story explicitly states its central metaphor—"to discover what ceilings hide"—at both the beginning and end, functioning as a thematic echo. This over-articulation replaces subtext with direct statement, preventing the theme from emerging with the resonance required for top-tier fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of destructive creation—of shattering a static perfection to achieve a transcendent, eternal moment—emerges organically from the story’s core conflict. The narrative avoids moralizing, instead presenting the outcome as a complex new state of "destabilized perfection." The final image of the library floating on "the captured essence of all time" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme exploring the power of myth versus empirical truth is potent and well-integrated into the plot. The final image of Elysium as a "jewel of contrived history" provides a resonant, ambiguous conclusion that avoids a simple moral. The theme's delivery is occasionally too direct, with lines that explicitly state the story's thesis, such as when explaining Elias's belief that "truth lay not in bones but in reinvention."

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of restoration through gentle craft ("mending what isn't torn") rather than force emerges organically from every element of the story. It is embodied in the character's profession, his chosen method, and the nature of the magical resolution. The final image of reclaimed light offers a powerful, resonant answer to the story's central problem without resorting to a single line of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of mystery versus rationality emerges organically from the plot and setting. The final image of the compass as a "new vial" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the explicit use of the phrase "hinged awakenings" to describe the climax and in the final line feels overly thematic and less subtextual, slightly weakening the emergent quality of the theme by stating its mechanics too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of ancient wisdom versus modern technology emerges clearly, but it is crippled by overt repetition and a heavy-handed final summary. The concluding line, "perpetual learning meant reimagining... the very weave of time," functions as a textbook thematic echo, stating the moral instead of letting the final image resonate. This direct explanation flattens the subtext and damages the story's literary potential.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding beauty and defiance in hidden, nocturnal spaces emerges organically from the story's imagery. However, the final paragraph resorts to a direct thematic statement that feels overly explicit for a literary piece. Lines like "It mirrored her grandmother's life... And it spoke to Elara's own heart" replace earned resonance with explanation, a significant flaw that undercuts the subtext built so carefully through the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of history as a haunting, active force is powerfully integrated through the central metaphor of the retrocognitive trap and the submerged archive. The story avoids simple morals, focusing on the searing personal cost of unearthing truth. However, the final thematic statement—"mending the fractured archive... one searing truth at a time"—is slightly too explicit, verging on a summary that slightly diminishes the resonance of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of earned revival over magical quick fixes is powerfully integrated, particularly through the amber bottle's journey from wish-granter to relic. The final image resonates well with this concept. The score is held back by several instances of "thematic echo," where the narration explicitly states the theme in prompt-like language (e.g., "true revival came from within..."), which feels like a moral summary instead of trusting the narrative to deliver the message implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic resonance is achieved with superb subtlety and depth. The story explores the tension between observation and participation without a single line of exposition, letting the theme emerge purely from image and action. The final image of Elias pressing the shaving to his chest offers a profound, non-literal resolution to his central dilemma, re-contextualizing his entire life’s work.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic exploration of order versus chaos, legacy, and time is seamlessly integrated through potent metaphors like heirloom seeds defying decay. The story avoids didacticism, allowing its themes to emerge from the central conflict and imagery. The final image of melting ice provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions, achieving a powerful emotional aftereffect without a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of listening over noise emerges organically from the character's actions and the central conflict, culminating in the powerful image of the bell's toll. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary ("And so... listening prevailed over noise, zero hour a threshold of serene wisdom"), slightly undermining the earned resonance of the climax by over-stating what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding strength in vulnerability is central but is executed with excessive directness. The story suffers from thematic statements that articulate the moral explicitly, such as, "in your fall, you teach me to stand still." This negates subtext and replaces earned resonance with a summary, particularly in the final paragraph, which reads like an explanation of the story's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of memory, neglect, and silent stewardship emerges organically from the story's potent imagery rather than from direct statement. The "tangled covenant" is explored through the specific, concrete actions of the ghosts and the revelations within the stained glass box. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, affirming the power of perceptive witness over explicit words.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of time shifting from a measure of loss to a fabric of connection is developed with nuance and powerful imagery. The concept evolves organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph lands too close to overt thematic statement: "he understood: time's texture was not loss, but the soft persistence of connection..." This line functions as a Thematic Echo, slightly undermining the otherwise resonant conclusion by summarizing it for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme is coherent and elegantly integrated into the story’s imagery, it suffers from severe over-articulation. The narrative repeatedly states its thesis in declarative sentences, culminating in a final paragraph that reads like a moral summary ("she had discovered that true beauty lay not in perfection..."). This heavy-handedness erodes subtext and replaces earned, emergent resonance with direct explanation, a significant flaw for publication at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of interspecies respect is coherent and integrated into the plot, culminating in the discovery of the murals. However, the theme is occasionally delivered through direct statement ("respect could mend what division had broken") rather than emerging purely from subtext. The simplistic, wholly positive outcome lacks the complexity or ambiguity expected in top-tier literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of homecoming as a "rebellious fusion" emerges organically from the story's central images—the ancient tower, the alien footprints, and the prehistoric amber containing an alien echo. The final image of the pulsing amber is a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's quest. However, the score is capped by the final two sentences, which veer into thematic summary ("homecoming was no singular chemistry... rebellion academic no more"), slightly undermining the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of resilience and nature's reclamation of human scars is handled with exceptional grace. It emerges organically from the central images—seeds, bird calls, flowers on a battlefield—rather than from exposition. The final image of the sprouts offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, achieving a powerful emotional aftereffect without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of memory versus reality, and the complex nature of survival, emerges organically from the story's central images—the preserved leaf versus the "tinted" text on the cylinder. The final image of the "echo bridging what war had torn" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Harlan's quest. The score is held just below the 9-band because the repeated phrase "tinted revelations" borders on a thematic label rather than pure emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding connection through isolation is skillfully woven through the motifs of "true north" and sketching. The final image of merging past and present sketches is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final thematic statement—"true north led not away from family, but through the silence to them"—is overly explicit, verging on a moral that slightly diminishes the earned resonance of the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story's theme of restoring balance through reverent, playful action is coherent and consistent. However, its delivery is heavy-handed, frequently repeating keywords like "wonder," "chivalrous," and "playful" as direct labels. The final line, "chivalrous, forever apprentice of wonder," acts as a thematic summary that replaces the resonance of a final image, which is a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme is sophisticated and emerges with startling clarity from the central metaphor of the pawn-less chessboard. The story explores the power of small, unseen actions versus the impotence of static authority without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central thematic question, leaving a lingering, complex aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of integrating trauma to redefine 'home' is potent and emerges organically from the plot. However, the story falters with a moment of overt thematic statement: "The core concept unfolded: buried talents, once entombed by fear, now erupted..." This line functions as a thematic echo, explicitly labeling the story's machinery in a way that slightly undermines the otherwise strong subtextual work.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of forgiveness as the ultimate strategy emerges organically from the chess metaphor and the central conflict. However, the story leans heavily on repeating key thematic words ("winnow," "fierce repose," "woven hush"), which at times feels like authorial insistence rather than subtle emergence. The line identifying forgiveness as "the ultimate strategy" borders on a direct thematic statement, slightly reducing the subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central theme is explored with nuance through the potent metaphor of light and refraction. However, the explicit thematic statement—"the price of forgiveness was not erasure, but multiplication"—is a rare misstep. This moment of telling slightly undermines the otherwise masterful showing, reading like an authorial signpost in a story that doesn't need one.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in brokenness (Kintsugi) is powerfully integrated into the core action. However, the story leans on direct thematic statements. The line "beauty forges from the broken" in the final narration is a "Thematic Echo" that slightly undermines the otherwise potent imagery by stating the moral outright, preventing the theme from emerging purely through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of temporary eternity is skillfully woven through the story's imagery, from the faded paintings to the transient oasis. The final image of the painted shell is resonant. However, the story's final line ("...captured not just nostalgia, but the ache of temporary eternities glimpsed and lost") verges on explicitly stating its theme, slightly diminishing the power of the subtext that had been built so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of subtle power versus brute force is elegantly woven through the narrative, emerging organically from character and action. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering the climax as a resonant, non-literal proof of its central question. The final image of Elias returning to his duties, armed with a quiet "knowing," provides a powerful thematic aftereffect. The only slight weakness is the final sentence's use of "screaming its truth," which verges on stating the theme too explicitly after it has already been so effectively shown.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story’s themes of loss, connection, and the remapping of purpose are handled with remarkable subtlety and depth. The central concept of "reverse migration" is explored through concrete action, not abstraction. The final image of "Loss's map redrawn" and the station holding the "echo of returns" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central emotional question, avoiding any hint of sentimentality or moralizing. The theme emerges organically from the potent synthesis of character, setting, and action.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of necessary illusion versus brutal honesty is central and explored with nuance, avoiding simplistic moralizing. Subtext is rich, operating through imagery like "merciful shadows" and "fractured harmony," which resonate deeply with Elias's quest. The ending provides a profoundly resonant, non-literal answer to the core thematic question, reweighting the premise with emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding connection within isolation is potent and culminates in the resonant final image of Elias adopting the flower. The story mostly allows this theme to emerge through action and atmosphere. Its score is lowered by the line, "in isolation, one could borrow another's memory to fill one's own," an explicit thematic summary that lessens the power of what was otherwise effectively shown.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of confronting regret and choosing a new path is elegantly woven through the narrative's central metaphors (uncharted voids, diverging paths, a doorway). The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elias's plight. However, a few phrases, such as "charting a new course from intuition's edge," verge on thematic summary, slightly over-articulating the story's core idea.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme is handled with sophistication, emerging organically from the narrative's central images of bleeding light and woven menace. The story explores leadership and inner emptiness without resorting to moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, complex answer—a rebirth that carries a permanent scar—which reweights the initial premise beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the theme of reinterpreting the past is coherent and integrated, its execution is far too explicit. The story suffers from a severe "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, repeatedly stating its own meaning, as seen in "their friendship as that palette, hues of resolve repainted through this act." This direct moralizing undermines subtext and replaces earned resonance with a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of integrating past and future selves through narrative is artfully developed and emerges organically from the plot. The final image of "imagined wings" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. However, the score is tempered by the final two paragraphs, which come dangerously close to summarizing the theme directly ("to distill chaos into narrative was his lifelong vigil"), a slight thematic echo that slightly undermines the otherwise superb subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in ordinary objects and shared grief is potent, but its delivery lacks subtlety. Key thematic concepts are stated explicitly and repeatedly ("unveil the ordinary miracle," "reading between the lines"), functioning as authorial labels rather than emerging organically from the action. The final paragraph, in particular, borders on summarizing the moral, which undercuts the resonance built by the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of transforming pain into art is elegantly woven through the story's central magical system and Elara's actions. The final image of the glowing rune provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core conflict. However, the story’s final sentence—"her youthful superstitions the key to enduring the gales"—verges on stating the theme directly, a minor but noticeable slip that slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "imperfect miracles" is woven deeply into the narrative's fabric, from the flawed perfume to the bittersweet reconnection. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is held back by the one moment of overt thematic summary—"It was their shared core concept: imperfect miracles"—which slightly undermines the otherwise excellent use of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of truth versus illusion emerges organically from the plot and central metaphor of the dictionary. The final image of "authentic silence" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme is potent and well-integrated into the story's imagery, but its delivery is marred by overstatement. The final paragraph articulates the story's central insight—"clocks measured the quiet cuts of existence"—so explicitly that it borders on a thematic summary. This moment of telling slightly diminishes the resonant power of the preceding scene, replacing earned subtext with a direct statement that feels like a thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of release through connection is powerfully integrated with the story's central scientific metaphor. However, its delivery is heavy-handed, violating subtext in the final act. The line "it was release through connection, not isolation" is a critical thematic echo, explicitly stating the story's moral rather than allowing the final image to resonate on its own, which is a significant flaw for a literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the theme of "lucid contradictions" is coherent, the story suffers from explicitly stating its own thesis repeatedly. Phrases like "the certainty of uncertainty" and the final paragraph's summary of carrying forward a "responsible gamble of understanding" function as direct moralizing. This thematic echo replaces resonant subtext with intellectual summary, significantly weakening its literary impact by explaining what should be felt.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of endings being necessary for beginnings is powerful and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story suffers from a critical flaw: it states its theme too explicitly. The line, "Because endings must learn to begin," delivered as dialogue, is a Thematic Echo that replaces subtext with a direct thesis statement, undercutting the otherwise resonant and subtle storytelling demonstrated in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of memory's weight and the tension between preservation and regeneration emerge organically from the story's core images. However, the resonance is slightly undercut by the explicit repetition of key thematic phrases like "the weight of small moments" and "haunted euphoria." These act as labels that sometimes state the theme rather than allowing it to remain fully subtextual, bordering on "Thematic Echo."

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of reciprocity and connection is woven skillfully through the narrative, emerging organically from the characters' interactions and the central symbol of the moon rock. The story wisely resists a tidy moral, embracing the complexity of fleeting connection. The final note, "cure's in the sharing," while thematically consistent, is a minor flaw as it explicitly states the insight the preceding scene had already beautifully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the potent central metaphor of mapping emotional trauma. The final image of the stillpoint provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the piece occasionally veers close to thematic summary, particularly in the final paragraph ("uncharted depths now charted within"), which slightly undermines the otherwise strong subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of finding purpose from past mistakes is present but lacks subtlety. The narrative repeatedly uses explicit thematic language ("thresh meaning from the chaff," "sift through life's scattered grains"). The final sentence—"even wrong seeds could yield unexpected harvests"—functions as a direct moral summary, undermining the potential for resonant, earned insight and replacing it with a platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding meaning in silence and emptiness is beautifully woven through the central conceit. The final image provides a powerful, non-literal answer to Elias's initial sorrow. The score is slightly limited by Lir's final signed line, "Silence sings when we listen," which functions as a thematic statement that is a touch too explicit for a story this reliant on subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central theme—passion as a force for both destruction and preservation—emerges organically from the character's actions and the story's core motifs, particularly the recurring image of fire. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is limited by the theme's occasional lack of subtlety, primarily through the hammering repetition of "volcanic tenderness" and a final sentence that verges on a tidy thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memory, rebellion, and the nature of loss emerge organically from the story's central conceit. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions, beautifully avoiding a simple moral. The score is slightly tempered because the recurring phrase "auroral sorrow" borders on labeling the theme rather than letting it remain entirely subtextual, though it doesn't fully break the subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of subtlety versus noise is central but handled with a heavy hand. The story commits the error of thematic echo, explicitly stating its core idea multiple times, most problematically in the final paragraph ("whispers had threaded through the storm, guiding truer than any shout..."). This moralizing replaces earned resonance, telling the reader the meaning instead of letting it emerge from the events.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of finding light within darkness is powerfully rendered through the central metaphor of the star-patterns. The dental mirror, a tool for seeing decay, repurposed to reflect starlight is an ingenious thematic reversal. However, the score is capped by moments of thematic overstatement, particularly the narrator explaining the guardian’s motive and the final line, "darkness had learned its lesson," which replaces resonance with a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of strategic, silent defiance versus overt rebellion is powerfully developed through the central chess metaphor and the imagery of light and shadow. The story avoids any moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the actions and atmosphere. The final image of "forests germinating in minds awakened" is a resonant, non-literal payoff to the initial motivation, achieving a high degree of thematic elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of liberation through self-acceptance emerges organically from the plot and character arc, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of Elara diving into the deep provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial struggle. The repeated phrase "combative tenderness" effectively becomes a motif that crystallizes the story's core thematic tension, re-weighting her final choice as both a struggle and a release.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, particularly the contrast between the desiccated flowers and the newly carved bird. The story explores grief, performance, and the creation of meaning without ever resorting to moralizing. The final image of the carving beside the bouquet offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict, reweighting the nature of hope in this barren world.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of dissolving boundaries is woven skillfully through the story’s core imagery and actions, resisting easy moralizing. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about beauty and connection. The piece is weakened only by a few moments of near-explicitness, as in "parables of isolation and unity," which come close to stating the theme directly rather than letting it emerge purely from the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding beauty and resilience in imperfection is woven skillfully through the story's central images and character motivations. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary. The line "The phoenix's legacy lived on, not in perfection, but in the bartered awakenings..." explicitly states the moral, undermining the power of the preceding resonant imagery and replacing earned subtext with a tidy thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of connection enduring beyond physical presence and loss is developed with nuance and potent imagery. The story avoids simplistic moralizing, offering its conclusion in the resonant final image of the internalized song. While phrases like "the true texture of connection she craved" verge on thematic labels, they are mostly earned by the specific, concrete journey that precedes them, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the narrative's central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of healing through connection and purpose is clear and emerges organically from the imagery. The story builds resonance through recurring motifs like light, stars, and crafted objects. However, the final sentence ("in teaching Lira to bloom again, she had illuminated her path from rock bottom") is a thematic echo that over-articulates the story's message, slightly undermining the powerful subtext of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding tangible human connection in the ruins of abstract digital value emerges organically from the story's core conflict. The narrative resists easy answers, presenting a method rather than a prophecy. The final sentence, while resonant, verges on stating the theme directly ("...profound reconnection to the human threads that no crash could sever"), slightly diminishing the power of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of innocence's end as a painful but necessary evolution emerges organically from the story's core concepts. The final image of a "tapestry of hope amid ruin" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the score is tempered because the ultimate secret is delivered via direct statement from a spectral figure, which borders on a "thematic echo" that slightly lessens the power of earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of hope's commodification and the bittersweet duty of preservation is developed with nuance and subtlety. The final image of the shadow stabilizing into a "new bloom" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem without offering a simplistic moral. The concept of "luminous regret" itself is a powerful thematic synthesis that elevates the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of reconstruction after betrayal emerges organically from the central metaphor of the regenerating tail. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic summary. The final line, "We rebuild, one layer at a time," functions as a concluding moral that is too explicit for a story of this literary ambition, slightly flattening the earned resonance of the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of reading scars to find meaning is woven through the story's central images with impressive cohesion. The concept of the "displaced miracle" is introduced and then powerfully re-contextualized at the end, providing resonant closure. The final paragraph slightly over-articulates the theme ("closure not in forgetting, but in reading..."), a minor slip that keeps it from a higher score, but the final image of the flowing hourglass is a much stronger, non-literal answer to the story's question.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of stored love and memory emerges organically from the story's particulars for most of its length. However, the final paragraphs lapse into direct thematic statement, particularly the line "psychometry wasn't mere reading, but a bridge..." This explicit moralizing undermines the powerful subtext built previously and constitutes a significant flaw at the story's conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of creativity requiring surrender rather than force emerges organically from the plot. However, its resonance is diminished by moments of thematic overstatement. Lines like "'Remembered stardust,' one silent voice murmured, a core truth uncoiling" and "this was no mere artistic block, but a call to reclaim the universe's forgotten fragments" function as thematic echo, explicitly stating the moral rather than allowing the final image to carry it alone.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of cultivating hope amidst personal emptiness emerges organically from the story's core conflict. The final image of the dreamless guard finding an internal "spark" offers a complex, resonant answer to the story's central question. However, the line "cultivation was not conquest, but a gentle unraveling" borders on an explicit thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of reconciling rigid logic with wild intuition, and mechanism with nature, emerges organically from the story's core conceit. The final image of "organic vines merged with circuits in blooming harmony" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The score is slightly limited by moments where concepts are explicitly labeled ("the hum of insight, that core concept"), which veer close to stating the theme directly.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding courage through surrender and indirect paths is coherent and well-integrated. However, it borders on being overly explicit, with lines like "'Courage waits where the ridge meets the wave...'" acting as direct thematic statements. This occasional lack of subtext prevents the theme from achieving the highest level of resonance, coming close to the "thematic echo" anti-pattern without fully succumbing to it.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of healing at the cost of connection is powerfully integrated. The final image of Elias as a guardian of the "fragile thaw" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to his quest. However, the score is slightly tempered by a couple of lines that lean into thematic summary, such as, "To understand the cost of safety was to embrace the seraphically mundane." This direct statement dilutes the subtext and borders on a "thematic echo" anti-pattern, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of truth's inevitable victory over illusion is woven seamlessly through the narrative, not stated. The core concept of the "rune of drift" perfectly embodies this, suggesting lies are naturally drawn to the surface. The final image of Varak's "graceful collapse" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the conflict, avoiding a simple moral and instead providing a powerful, elegant metaphor for the insubstantiality of deceit.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of loss yielding to adaptation is powerfully integrated through recurring imagery, particularly the contrast between the “skeletal branches” of dead coral and the new “hidden blooms.” The story resists easy moralizing, offering a complex, resonant conclusion. The line "A periodic eternal truth, she mused" is a minor thematic echo that states the theme a bit too directly, slightly weakening an otherwise masterful and subtle exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of finding order and meaning within chaos is developed with subtlety and power. The central question, "There's order up there... why not here?", while slightly explicit, serves as a perfect pivot. The resolution avoids a simplistic moral, instead offering a potent closing image: the rebellion's scattered failures re-envisioned as a "constellation waiting to connect," a resonant and non-literal answer that elevates the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of evolving tradition with intent is coherent and integrated into the plot. However, its resonance is weakened by explicit authorial statements. The final sentence, "ensuring destiny was not imposed but co-created," functions as a thematic summary that replaces the subtext of the final image, reducing its power.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of rooting hope in the reality of loss is potent and well-developed through imagery. However, the story occasionally undermines its subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, such as, "Her motivation crystallized in these visits: to root hope in the unyielding earth of truth." This "thematic echo" slightly reduces the resonant power of the ending by stating what was already being effectively shown.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of reassembling a fractured self from the pieces of the past is powerfully integrated through the central metaphor of the tangled threads. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by moments of thematic over-explicitness, particularly the question, "Was reality truly shattered, or merely waiting for an artist bold enough to reassemble it?"

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story builds a coherent theme around hidden truths, effectively using the disappearing ink as a central motif. This is severely undercut by the final sentence, a "thematic echo" that explicitly states the story's moral ("time slowed to forge survivors' resolve..."), fatally compromising subtlety and earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of knowledge as a dangerous, suppressed contraband is central and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story occasionally lapses into telling the theme directly, as in the line "knowledge as the ultimate contraband, smuggled against the regime's sterile lies." This direct statement slightly undermines the subtext. The final image successfully offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, but the overt thematic articulation earlier prevents it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic resonance is the story’s core strength, emerging organically from the interplay of character, action, and image. The final image of the roses provides a potent, non-literal answer to the central conflict. The score is slightly tempered because the repetition of key phrases like "engraved quiet" verges on stating the theme, reducing reliance on pure subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is woven into the very fabric of the premise, exploring trauma, healing, and the paradoxical nature of silence and noise without a single line of exposition. The concept of "transliterating" grief into a tangible form is expertly executed. The final image of Elias cradling the captured echo provides a resonant, non-literal answer to his quest for wholeness, reweighting the entire narrative with potent emotional meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of truth versus deceit, particularly the contrast between grand cosmic lies and grubby human ones, is well-integrated. The "orbits of regret" concept serves as a resonant motif that is cleverly re-contextualized by the ending, shifting from a celestial phenomenon to a human, psychological one. The final line feels slightly too much like a thematic summary, but the core idea lands with complexity and avoids a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic integration is strong, weaving together grief, memory, and technology. However, the final sentence—"the tattooist had mapped not just stars, but the contours of forgiveness, etched deep within"—is an on-the-nose thematic summary. This direct statement slightly undermines the resonant power of the preceding images by explaining what was already beautifully shown, a significant flaw in an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding meaning through shared creation rather than verbal debate emerges organically from the central mandala sequence. The final image resonates without stating a moral. The score is held back slightly by the recurring phrase "meaning in the mess," which verges on a direct thematic statement rather than pure subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of healing trauma through renaming and radical empathy is potent and well-integrated into the plot. The final image of the thriving plaza offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is tempered by the repeated use of key phrases ("aberrant mercy," "warm coldness"), which functions as a mild thematic echo, making the theme more stated than subtextual.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story skillfully integrates its themes of loss, memory, and the restorative power of performance. The central metaphor of "intertwined echoes" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of artistic isolation and despair. The final image of flickering possibilities is strong, though the final clause, "luring hope from the shadows," borders on a thematic summary that slightly overstates the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of authentic, embodied connection versus artificial intimacy is woven through the narrative and resolved in the final image of the light painting. The geode and somatic markers serve as strong, concrete vehicles for this theme. The ending offers a resonant answer, though the final sentence, "And in that delicate hope, they found the telepathy they'd always had," borders on an overly explicit thematic statement, slightly diminishing the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of memory as a bridge between epochs is elegantly integrated through the central concept of the "transitional object." The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the piece is weakened by a Thematic Echo in the closing beats; Elara's narrated line, "From the elm's silent witness, I speak for the forgotten winds...", comes perilously close to summarizing the theme directly, sacrificing subtext for poetic pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of choice versus fate is coherently developed through the story's central imagery and actions. The resolution, however, borders on being overly explicit with the prophecy's final line: "choose not the foretold, but the alive." This comes close to a direct thematic statement, slightly reducing the subtextual resonance that the otherwise potent symbolism of buttons and echoes had built. The final action to share the wisdom saves it from feeling like a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of renewal ("fixing what's broken") is woven through the setting and plot, creating a resonant final image. The weakness lies in its explicit articulation. Lines like "...a promise of renewal that mirrored her core quest: fixing what's broken within herself" are thematic statements that preempt subtext, a clear instance of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of simplifying complex heritage to find its core truth is powerfully conceived and integrated through the palimpsest metaphor. However, the story leans too heavily on direct thematic statements and keyword repetition ("distill," "essence," "percolate"). The final paragraphs summarize the theme ("complexity yielded to core," "essence of his promise lighting his path") rather than letting the final image carry the resonance alone, which slightly undermines the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of endurance through compassion emerges organically from the story's imagery. However, the climax includes a line that comes too close to a direct thematic statement: "places resisted change not through stubbornness, but through the quiet thrum of sustained compassion." For a top-tier publication, this moment of telling undermines the otherwise powerful, resonant imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding resilience in loss emerges organically from the story’s central images. The final image of moonlight on the floating petals is a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial grief. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the direct thematic echo in the line "reflecting light into the dark corners of her doubt," which explicitly repeats the motivation stated earlier, making the connection less felt and more declared.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transforming solitude into strength emerges powerfully from the story’s events and imagery. However, its impact is slightly diminished by an overly explicit statement of intent ("her motivation crystallized: to translate that isolation into independence"). This thematic echo in the narrative voice feels like an unnecessary authorial intrusion that doesn't fully trust the potent symbolism of the final scene to convey the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of connection emerging from hidden, individual lives is elegantly woven through the story's central images: the ghostwritten letters, the thrush twigs, and the interconnected lilies. The final realization provides a resonant answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by the direct statement of the theme, as in the motivation "to find the thread that connects all things," which borders on thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of truth versus deception emerges organically from the plot, brilliantly paralleling the cosmic trickery with Harlan's terrestrial power plays. The story avoids moralizing, instead using its central conflict to explore the nature of manipulation. The final image of "honest silence" serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a lasting impression of a hard-won, temporary clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from a critical flaw: its theme is stated, not dramatized. The repeated use of "rebellion," "mutiny," and "defiant" is heavy-handed, particularly in the final paragraph, which reads like a thematic summary. This overtness ("a rebellion not just of spaces, but of self") robs the narrative of subtext and resonance, replacing emergent meaning with explicit labels.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "unifying opposites" is handled with excessive directness, bludgeoning the reader with repeated thematic statements that sap the story of subtext. The phrase or concept appears over eight times, culminating in a final paragraph that explicitly summarizes the moral: "rekindled the empathy that binds us, opposites no longer at war." This heavy-handedness constitutes a "Thematic Echo," replacing earned resonance with overt explanation and significantly weakening the story's literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of vindication, the weight of history, and truth's eventual emergence are woven organically through the plot. The story avoids overt moralizing until the final sentence, which comes close to summarizing the theme with the phrase "reversible redemption." The final image of the nail on the map is a much stronger, more resonant conclusion, providing a non-literal answer to the story's central question about legacy and courage.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding redemption or amnesty for past failures is well-integrated through the central images of the broken bridge on the flake and the real, forgotten bridge. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext by explicitly naming its core concept, as when Elias "turned the phrase [pixelated amnesty] over in his mind." This thematic labeling slightly reduces the resonance that the powerful final image otherwise achieves.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of cyclical journeys and reconciling with the past is woven through the narrative with resonant images like looping rails and the inherited money. Unfortunately, the story surrenders this subtlety in the final sentence. The line "...to harmonize the echoes of fathers and sons in the gathering twilight" is a direct thematic summary, a "thematic echo" that explains the story's meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to resonate through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of shared burdens is central and well-integrated into the plot. However, its primary articulation comes via a direct quote from the inscription: "What one carries alone crushes; divided among kin, it lifts like wings." This moment of telling slightly lessens the power of subtext. The story recovers well, as the true thematic payoff is not the quote itself, but the final, resonant image of Elara's new purpose, which provides a non-literal answer to the story's central question about how to apply this wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of confronting unvarnished truth versus guarded self-protection is beautifully integrated into every element. The "frozen confession" and the "flesh-eating seed" that instead binds are potent symbols that develop organically from the plot. The story's final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, resisting a simple moral in favor of a complex, deepened serenity that lingers effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thematic concerns of healing, connection, and restoring balance emerge organically from the central conflict and imagery. The final image of the renewed covenant provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's problem. However, the piece occasionally lapses into thematic summary, with phrases like "the intersection of dreams" and "eclipsed covenant" repeated to the point of becoming labels that slightly diminish the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of healing through shared trauma and the active reinterpretation of the past is powerfully integrated. The final image of the card turning to dust, leaving "bartered peace," provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion without moralizing. The story avoids simplistic resolutions, suggesting a complex exchange rather than a simple erasure of pain. The final image powerfully reweights the meaning of her loss and his betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thematic development is outstanding, emerging organically from the central character conceit and setting. The motif of "after the applause" is re-weighted beautifully at the close. However, the otherwise subtle theme is slightly undermined by an overly explicit statement in the penultimate paragraph ("Purpose, he realized, wasn't in the spotlight's glare but in the quiet sifting after..."), which feels like a summary of an already well-demonstrated idea.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transition as reconfiguration is potent but is undermined by explicit authorial statements. The line "...revealing that transition wasn't loss but a reconfiguration" directly articulates the theme, functioning as a "thematic echo" that preempts subtext and reader discovery. This reduces the final image's resonance by explaining its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from the preceding particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through metaphor and action, exploring the preservation of identity in the face of timelessness. The concept of "smelting" identities into tomes is a brilliant, resonant image that avoids didacticism. The final line, "weaving contradictions into the fabric of forever," serves as a powerful, non-literal summation of the story's core inquiry without stating an explicit moral. The catalog entry, while slightly direct, is justified by its in-world framing.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of connection overcoming isolation is potent and well-integrated through the central metaphor of the pearl and the crystalline caves. However, the execution occasionally lapses into overt statement, slightly undermining the power of its imagery. Phrases like "dissolving the walls not just of rock, but of entrenched isolation" articulate the theme too directly, replacing the resonance of subtext with the finality of a moral, which weakens the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story develops its themes of memory, guilt, and redirection with subtlety, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids a simplistic moral. The river motif is woven in effectively. The score is capped by the "bathroom graffiti wisdom," which functions as a thematic echo, explicitly stating the story's thesis ("The river bends but never breaks; turn back to heal what flows away") rather than allowing the meaning to remain fully emergent from action.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story skillfully weaves themes of secrecy, truth, and the risk inherent in seeking knowledge without resorting to overt statements. The central conceit of the "library of unspoken words" is a powerful thematic anchor, and the final image of the dreamer documenting these truths provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. The subtext of the confidence man's legacy adds a compelling layer of ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of choosing and shaping one's destiny is beautifully integrated through the central metaphor of "perforated destiny." The final image of a "purposefully porous" path provides a resonant, non-didactic conclusion. The score is slightly tempered by closing phrases like "communal bloom" and "propagation of self," which lean towards thematic summary rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story achieves profound thematic resonance without a single line of overt moralizing. The central theme of creating beauty and meaning in the face of annihilation emerges organically from character, action, and image. The final image of the glowing emerald chip acts as a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question, perfectly embodying a "beautician's touch against the void."

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding peace in cyclical renewal is elegantly woven through the story's imagery, from charred branches sprouting anew to the act of scalloping. The issue lies in the final paragraphs, which state the theme too explicitly ("contentment bloomed in acceptance," "she understood contentment as..."). This thematic summary undermines the subtext, explaining the story’s meaning to the reader instead of letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of embracing nuance over absolutism emerges organically from the story’s central conceit. The final image provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is held back by Thorne's line, "It's not about erasing certainty, but inviting the subtleties that make it real," which functions as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the theme rather than allowing it to resonate purely through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of surrender for rebirth ("vanishing to appear") is woven into every element with great skill. However, the final paragraph verges on summarizing its own theme ("vanishing became the gateway to eternal appearance"). This slight over-articulation lessens the resonant power of an otherwise elegantly demonstrated concept.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme is woven skillfully through image and action, exploring transcendence, memory, and connection without resorting to exposition. The final image of the restless pulse provides a complex, non-literal answer to Elara's quest for freedom. Her triumph is tinged with a new kind of entanglement, a resonant ambiguity that elevates the story beyond a simple success narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of authentic simplicity versus automated perfection is coherent, its delivery is heavy-handed. The story ends by explicitly stating its moral (“automation could mimic brilliance, but only the simple held the sacred”), which undermines the resonance of the final image. This thematic echo in the final paragraphs feels like a summary that doesn't trust the reader to grasp the story's point through its events.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of fulfilling old promises and finding hidden beauty is resonant and emerges organically from the imagery. However, the final two paragraphs drift into thematic summary, explicitly stating what the preceding scenes had already beautifully implied. The line "In that discovery, the attribute of hiding behind truth dissolved, leaving only authentic resonance" is a critical flaw, a "Thematic Echo" that flattens the earned, imagistic conclusion into a neat moral, weakening the story's subtextual power at the last moment.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of relinquishing the fragmented past to enable a unified future is expertly woven through the story's core mechanics. The foreign coins as "false securities" and the act of distilling a single truth from cosmic chaos create a powerful symbolic structure. The final image of the coins falling into the void provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict without resorting to moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of mastering fear and grief by giving it form is powerfully rendered through the central magical conceit. The final image of the crystal as a beacon rather than a wound provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core problem. The score is held just shy of the 9-band due to a moment of thematic over-statement in Lira's final, clarifying line.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme—that sincere, albeit weak, effort can restore balance—emerges organically from the plot and character. However, the final paragraph lands with a thud, explicitly stating the moral: "lukewarm magic proved enough, impossibility made plausible by earnest heart." This thematic summary undermines the resonance of the imagery, substituting a powerful, emergent idea with a less impactful thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of transforming generational trauma into a narrative of shared sacrifice is developed with nuance and power through the progression of discovered photographs. However, the story falters at the end by explicitly stating its theme. Lines like "our grandfathers didn't just lose a home; they gave one to the world beyond" and the summary of "threading their tales into a tapestry" constitute a thematic echo, replacing earned resonance with a direct moral statement.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of balancing logic and intuition is woven seamlessly through character, action, and imagery, avoiding didacticism. The story’s final realization—"intuition as the hidden variable, sentiment the catalyst"—is earned through the preceding struggle. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's quest, though the articulation of the theme within her vision borders on being slightly too explicit for a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.4)
    Themes of vigilance, the burden of solitary judgment, and innovation under pressure emerge organically. The story avoids didacticism, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to its central questions. The ending's acceptance of the "watcher's burden" reweights prior material with compelling emotional and conceptual complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of achieving wholeness by integrating complementary opposites is artfully woven into the central action of the story. The final image of the two Kais is a potent and resonant answer to the story's core question. A minor flaw is the slightly over-explicit thematic statement, "the custody battle resolved not by law but by defiant life," which borders on summarizing the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of innovation born from mystery is coherent, but its execution is hampered by overt thematic statements. The final sentence, "The storm-born silence had birthed not a flower, but a revolution," is a heavy-handed thematic echo that summarizes the story's point rather than letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of processing unspoken grief through a physical metaphor is powerful and original. However, the story undermines its own subtext with an overly explicit explanation: "...a tangled mass of thorny vines, symbols of the unspoken barbs that had choked their joy." By labeling the metaphor, it veers into allegory, sacrificing the resonant ambiguity that elevates literary work. The strong final image partially recovers this, but the moment of thematic summary is a distinct flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of accepting uncertainty is central and coherently developed, resonating powerfully in the final image. However, the story repeatedly states its theme in direct, abstract terms ("Uncertainty was no enemy, but a companion..."). This thematic echo borders on moralizing, reducing the power of subtext and preventing the theme from emerging solely through the story's potent imagery and action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story dramatizes its theme effectively, culminating in a resonant final image that answers the central question without moralizing. However, it is significantly weakened by the explicit statement of its core concept: "Creative destruction: the alchemical truth..." This thematic echo acts as an authorial intrusion, explaining the theme to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge fully from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the theme of finding beginnings in endings is coherent, its execution lacks subtlety. The theme is stated explicitly multiple times, most notably in the "creed she'd honed," which feels like authorial summary rather than emergent understanding. This directness, along with phrases like "practical magic at its finest," prevents the theme from resonating as deeply as it could have.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of interconnectedness and order within chaos is coherent and supported by key images like the hourglass and the celestial patterns. The story successfully avoids a simplistic moral. The primary weakness is a lack of subtext; the theme is often stated directly, culminating in the final line's "permanent whisper of worlds entwined," which functions more as a summary than a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme emerges with potent subtlety from the story's central collision of logic and emotion, optics and sinew. The story resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex, resonant redefinition of human connection as something raw and enduring, not engineered. The final image of the "fevered sinew of the soul" provides a non-literal answer to the story's central question that lingers powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of connection versus isolation is explored through potent imagery like the "chain link" and the "bridge to the stars." The ending avoids a simplistic moral, offering a resonant image of continued striving. However, the frequent repetition of key thematic phrases like "unfolded horizons" and "somber marvel" verges on thematic labeling, slightly undermining the subtext by making the implicit too explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of preserving memory against the silence of progress emerges organically from the plot and Elara's unique profession. The objects—photograph, locket, hearing aid—serve as effective thematic vessels. The story stumbles at the end with the summary line about ensuring "the vulnerable voices would echo on," which states the theme too directly, bordering on a moral. This slightly undermines the resonance built through imagery and action.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory, legacy, and the ghosts within technology emerges organically from the story's core elements. The concept of undersea cables carrying not just data but the "unresolved transmissions" of the lost crew is a powerful and well-integrated metaphor. The final image of the cables that "now sang with their silent return" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question of remembrance without resorting to overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the theme is powerfully dramatized through the central action of using a failure (broken porcelain) to create strength (a restored ghost), the story undermines its own subtext with explicit thematic statements. The dialogue "From failure, we harvest strength," functions as a Thematic Echo that states the moral directly, reducing the resonance that the final, more subtle image of the clear radio signal would have otherwise achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of translating loss into a new form of life is handled with sophistication and depth, emerging organically from the story’s unique mechanics rather than through direct statement. The final image of textures singing is a powerful, non-literal resolution that re-contextualizes the entire story from a tragedy of loss to a myth of transformation. The piece avoids simple morals, offering instead a complex and resonant meditation on memory and art.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of reframing loss as transformation is potent and well-integrated. The "cosmic joke" motif provides a strong throughline that pays off in the final beat. However, the resonance is slightly undercut by a moment of thematic overstatement in the line "loss was just the universe's puckish nudge," which states the theme too directly instead of allowing the imagery to carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of natural wonder versus mechanical order emerges organically from the story’s conflict and imagery. The locust shell serves as a powerful, integrated motif for transformation. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary ("breaking free was not just escape, but rebirth, her motivation realized"), explicitly stating the moral instead of allowing the triumphant final image to convey it alone, which slightly weakens the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the theme is potent, its delivery is undermined by overly explicit statements. The final paragraph's realization ("Elias understood: broken promises healed not in grand gestures, but in the fostered links of absence...") functions as a thematic summary, a critical flaw that replaces earned resonance with a direct, authorial moral.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of finding life and possibility within silence and decay emerges organically from the imagery. However, the resonance is slightly undercut by moments of over-articulation, such as when Elias's motivation "crystallizes: to interpret this silence not as absence, but as boundless possibility." This borders on a thematic statement, pulling back from the subtextual power of the final scene.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of interconnected, non-linear narrative is brilliantly integrated with the central conceit of hyperbolic geometry. The final image of the "infinite garden where narratives bloomed" serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The theme emerges organically, with only a minor slip toward direct statement in the final paragraph ("stories resided not in isolation...").

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of grief transforming into release emerges organically from the story's central conceit and imagery, avoiding direct moralizing. The concept of "luminous absence" is beautifully developed, turning a void into a source of gentle light by the end. The final image of the fading projection offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, only slightly diminished by the explicitness of "she understood."

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme emerges coherently from the story's central metaphor, but the locksmith's dialogue ("This lock...veils an idea...") verges on explicit thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory, loss, and the enduring power of folklore emerges organically from the events and imagery, rather than being stated. The story invites reflection beyond its immediate plot through the poignant contrast of a mechanical present and a magical, sunken past, culminating in an emotionally resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's quest. The score is capped at 8.8 due to line-level artifacts in the final third of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of resilience is coherent, the story frequently states it directly rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. Lines like "mentor resilience," "build resilience here," and the final summary "resilience mentored and returned" function as thematic labels. This overtness, particularly in the closing line, undermines the otherwise resonant imagery and feels like an unnecessary explanation of the story's point.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of preserving magic in a mundane world is developed effectively through resonant imagery. The final scene provides a concrete, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the piece verges on thematic echo by repeatedly using key phrases like "color of wonder" and "succor," which slightly undermines the subtext by making it overly explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of guilt, confession, and redemption are powerfully integrated into the central metaphor of unraveling knots. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal resolution that avoids moralizing. The only minor weakness is the direct statement "grounding these spirits wasn't just duty—it was redemption," which slightly undermines the subtext by articulating the theme too explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of interpreting silence with empathy is profoundly woven throughout, from the "whispered chapel" concept to the use of silent video footage. The ending, where the chapel releases "cool, silent air... only the empathetic weight of ages," offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Elias's quest, reweighting all prior material without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of letting go is central, but it is often stated too directly, undermining subtext. The crewman's note ("a physics of release we cannot chart") and Elias's final whisper ("the physics is in the release, not the grasp") function as explicit thematic summaries. This over-articulation, especially at the climax and closure, feels like a "thematic echo" that replaces earned resonance with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of giving voice to the voiceless emerges organically from the protagonist's core identity and her actions, rather than from direct statement. The story's final image of the transformed courtyard offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem of being unheard. The integration of character, action, and outcome creates a coherent and satisfying thematic arc without resorting to moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding joy within anguish is central and well-integrated into the plot, but its execution borders on being overly explicit. Phrases like "to seek out the joy beneath anguish" and the final revelation of "transforming anguish into a watchful joy" function almost as thesis statements. While the final image is resonant, this direct articulation in prompt-like language ("Thematic Echo") prevents the theme from emerging with more powerful subtext and nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of memory’s persistence in absence is poignant, but its delivery is hampered by overt labeling. The repeated use of "spooled wholeness" and the final declaration "He had proven it" function as thematic summaries, reducing the power of the subtext. While the closing image is resonant, these direct statements prevent the theme from emerging with the subtlety required for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding infinity within limitation is potent and well-developed through the story's central conceit. The final image of the mural as a "sky alive with human fractals" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is lowered by a moment of thematic echo. The line "discovering limits meant not surrender, but infinite exploration within them" states the theme too directly, replacing earned resonance with a summary that feels like an authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of bridging chosen solitude with shared wonder emerges organically from the plot, culminating in the final image of Elara's discovery serving as a "bridge to the crew's shared horizon." The hopscotch board as a child's game hiding a serious purpose is a strong, resonant metaphor. The theme is slightly over-articulated in the final reflection on reclaiming "the world's hidden glow," but it stops short of becoming overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of true mending versus superficial fixing is developed with subtlety and grace. The recurring motif of "driftwood"—representing memory, the passage of time, and eventual renewal—is woven expertly through the narrative, culminating in the resonant final line. The story avoids moralizing, allowing its thematic point to emerge organically from Elara's climactic realization and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of collective hope is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, sacrificing subtext for direct statement. The final line, "...a testament to brambled hope—thorny, resilient, and eternally entwined," is a thematic summary that tells the reader the moral instead of letting the final image resonate on its own, which significantly lessens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding beauty and continuance in flawed endings is potent and woven through the story's central imagery. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core tension. The score is slightly tempered by moments where the theme is articulated a bit too directly, as in the summary of Elara’s motivation, which comes close to stating the story's thesis rather than letting it emerge solely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding purpose in unwanted responsibility emerges organically from the plot. The central motif of "graceless beauty" is effective, and the final image of the frost provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is slightly tempered because the repetition of key thematic phrases feels a bit insistent, bordering on overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story successfully integrates its central metaphors, but its thematic delivery is heavy-handed. It succumbs to the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern by repeatedly stating its core idea ("translate separation into connection") in both narration and dialogue. This explicit moralizing replaces subtext and resonance with direct statement, particularly in the final third, leaving little for the reader to discover.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme—that creation arises from quantified absence—is powerfully integrated into the story's core action and climactic image. However, the story occasionally leans on explicit thematic labels like "integrated fragmentation" and "glimmering parole." These concepts are demonstrated well, but stating them so directly in the narration feels like a thematic echo, slightly undermining the subtext by making it overt.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of processing trauma and empathy is woven skillfully through the core conceits of tasting memories and the pavilion of remorse. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the line about grinding regrets into "polished lessons" states the theme a bit too directly, slightly weakening the subtext at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of connection overcoming isolation is coherent and powerfully integrated through the central metaphor of turning "silos into symphonies." However, the execution lacks subtlety. The theme is often delivered through direct statements—"bridges from our silos"—rather than emerging organically from subtext. The final paragraph functions as a moral summary, explicitly telling the reader the story's meaning, which feels heavy-handed for this literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of resurrecting forgotten aspirations is woven deeply into the plot, character, and central object. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question without resorting to a simplistic moral. The score is tempered slightly by a tendency to state its concepts directly, as in "Entangled memories, that was the core concept haunting him," which verges on thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of vigilance is present and consistent, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The final paragraph functions almost as a thematic summary ("a testament to the vigilance that now seeded her soul"), which feels less resonant than if the idea had been left to emerge purely from the final image. The recurring "latent blaze" motif is effective, but the overall thematic execution verges on being too explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding resonance in brokenness is potent and emerges organically from the central action. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic statement. Lines like "The sound was empathy itself in motion" and the final paragraph's summary of the theme's "proof" are heavy-handed, replacing earned resonance with a direct authorial explanation. This thematic echo in the final third significantly limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding "beauty in the difficult" emerges organically from the character's struggle and is powerfully crystallized in the final image of the "board reset for deeper play." The chess motifs and the dented stone serve as resonant, recurring images that deepen the thematic inquiry. The score is slightly tempered by the direct statement of the theme ("Elias sought... to discover beauty in the difficult"), which feels a touch less elegant than the otherwise masterful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the story dramatizes its theme effectively, it suffers from explicit thematic statements that undermine subtext. Phrases like "the path to empathy lay in attuning to others' inner frequencies" function as authorial explanations rather than emergent truths. This direct moralizing, a form of "Thematic Echo," reduces the piece's literary power by telling the reader what to think, even though the final image itself is quite resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding harmony within chaos emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph commits a significant flaw by explicitly stating the theme: "the serenity in motion wasn't escape but embrace..." This "Thematic Echo" acts as a moral summary, replacing the resonance of the final image with a direct explanation, which undermines the subtext built throughout the story.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of resilience being a deliberate, inherited legacy rather than a natural miracle emerges organically from the plot's resolution. The story avoids moralizing, and the final image of Elara pocketing the arrow tip provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of Arboris's survival. The connection to past pilots who "seeded" the world adds a layer of historical depth that enriches the core idea.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of turning hindsight into foresight is coherent and well-integrated into the plot. However, its expression borders on being overly explicit, particularly in phrases like "turning hindsight into preemptive strikes against fate." This tendency towards thematic summary, especially in the latter half, slightly undermines the subtextual power of the otherwise resonant images and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of wonder's essential nature emerges powerfully through the story's central imagery and climax. However, the final paragraphs undermine this resonance by explicitly stating the theme multiple times (e.g., "certifying that wonder was no luxury," "proving wonder essential"). This instance of "thematic echo" feels heavy-handed, distrusting the reader to grasp the meaning from the potent events that just unfolded.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of transforming failure into strength emerges organically from Elara's actions and the central magical concept. The final image of the driftwood markers as "beacons of her transformed path" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. The score is slightly capped because the final paragraphs lean towards summarizing the theme ("weaving failures into the strength of worlds entwined") rather than letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges with profound grace from the story's central metaphor. The initial question of quantifying emotion is answered not with a formula, but with the resonant image of a "turbulent flow of shared feeling." This resists a tidy moral, instead offering a complex, earned insight that recontextualizes the entire narrative without a single line of exposition, achieving a powerful and lingering effect.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of coaxing wonder from routine is beautifully embodied in the climactic scene. However, the story undermines its own subtext by repeatedly stating its themes in both dialogue and narration. The final paragraph, in particular, summarizes the moral ("ensuring no memory fully faded without germinating anew"), a thematic echo that lessens the impact of the otherwise resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of connection and reflected emotion is powerfully integrated through imagery, culminating in a strong, non-literal epiphany. The score is held back by the final paragraph, which contains a thematic echo that over-explains the discovery and authorial commentary that muddles the thematic resonance at the last moment.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of sacrifice for the sake of connection is woven beautifully through the narrative, emerging organically from character and action rather than statement. The central motif of weaving and unraveling provides a potent physical metaphor for memory, loss, and hope. The final image of the bare loom and the hope-threaded silence offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion that avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of coaxing resilience from ruin is woven through the narrative effectively. The story avoids a simplistic moral, instead landing on a resonant image of quiet, ongoing work as the source of strength. However, the thematic keywords ("azure defiance," "bartered awakenings," "understanding and confusion") are repeated so frequently that they border on becoming thematic labels, slightly undermining the subtext by making it overt.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of responsibility and the weight of knowledge is developed organically through the central metaphor of "weight," which shifts from abstract secret to a literal cosmic force. The ending offers a resonant answer, crystallizing in Elara's decision to "map responsibly." The final sentence borders on thematic summary but is sufficiently grounded by the preceding emotional beat to avoid feeling unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration of solitude, legacy, and anonymous connection is sophisticated and deeply integrated. The story uses its central objects—the stones, letters, and sea glass—to build its themes without ever resorting to direct statement. The final image of the beam carrying the "bottled essence of safety" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions, achieving a rare level of poetic and emotional power.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges with superb subtlety from the story's particulars, exploring the transition between old and new worlds and the bittersweet nature of creation. The central concept of shaping a new dawn from "ancient shadows" is beautifully realized without resorting to direct statement. The final image of the gentle rain provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of embracing visibility and its inherent risks is beautifully woven through the central metaphor of "iridescent caution." The final image of the patrons drawn to her light provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her question. However, the story then explicitly states its own moral twice ("the quietly explosive truth settling in her chest..." and "the heart's gift was the courage..."), which feels like a Thematic Echo that slightly undermines the power of the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding resilience in sorrow is developed with subtlety and culminates in a resonant final image, avoiding a simplistic moral. The central concept of "quantified sorrow" is potent. However, the story occasionally explains its own symbolism too directly, as with the description of the broken sextant's fractures marking "degrees of loss." This brief moment of thematic over-articulation is a minor flaw in an otherwise strong thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic resonance is achieved with exceptional subtlety and power. The core theme—that collective memory and art are essential for communal survival—emerges organically from the narrative's concrete actions and imagery. The final image of the "woven dawns" offers a potent, non-literal resolution that recharges all prior motifs without resorting to a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding wisdom in mistakes and connection in paradox is central and coherent. However, the story undermines its own subtext with an overt thematic statement in the final paragraph. The line "...to remind that true connection hides in plain sight, paradoxes nestling compassion within solitude" functions as a moral, a "Thematic Echo" that explains the story's meaning instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own, significantly reducing its literary power.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding holiness in the mundane is skillfully woven through the story's central actions and imagery. The bread from the vanished bakery is a particularly potent symbol of this idea. However, the theme is occasionally stated too directly, as when the text notes the ritual "transformed the mundane act of eating into something holy," slightly undermining the subtext by making it explicit text.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of preservation through meticulous, quiet labor emerges organically from the story’s every element. There is no moralizing; instead, the final image of the rekindled vows provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the threat of oblivion. The story's concept and theme are perfectly integrated, achieving a quiet profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of trust—its value, fragility, and the cost of its breaking—is skillfully woven through the narrative via the central conflict and the symbolic watch fob. The final image of Elara securing the fob while trust audibly breaks provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The theme's execution is strong, though slightly undermined by the initial awkwardness of the "capturing the sound" motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the theme of cosmic interconnectedness is conceptually strong, its delivery is severely undercut by the on-the-nose dialogue at the climax. The mist-weaver's speech ("We are the bridges... to remind us we're not separate from the cosmos") is a classic example of a thematic echo, stating the story's core message directly. This replaces subtext and earned resonance with a final-paragraph moral, significantly weakening the piece's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story has a coherent theme about memory, pain, and artistic redemption. The problem lies in its delivery, which lacks subtext and relies on thematic echoes. Key thematic phrases like "uncork the suppressed creativity" and "inescapable calling" are repeated, explicitly stating the theme rather than letting it emerge. This over-explanation reduces the story's resonance and feels like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of truth's restorative power emerges organically from the plot mechanics, particularly Elara's gift and the nature of the Echo Vault. The story builds resonance effectively until the final sentence. The line "...proving that even after the oasis dried, truth's small moments could irrigate the soul" is a "Thematic Echo," a direct statement of the story's moral that undermines the power of the preceding image. This authorial intrusion prevents the theme from landing with the subtlety the rest of the story earns.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of truth requiring a medium beyond mere efficiency is beautifully and organically woven into the narrative. The final image is resonant, but the story's last sentence ("he had harmonized a fractured world...") functions as a thematic summary. This direct statement slightly dilutes the power of the preceding imagery, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding wholeness in fragments is powerfully developed through the story's central action and imagery. The final image of the retained shard as "fuel" provides a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the conflict. However, the final paragraphs slip into redundant thematic statements ("wholeness felt fragmented still," "wholeness pieced from fragments"), a minor thematic echo that slightly dulls the impact of an otherwise subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "listening heals" is handled with excessive directness, undermining any potential for subtext or resonant discovery. It is explicitly stated in Elara's motivation, reinforced by a note inside the locket, and summarized in the final paragraph. This thematic moralizing ("her heart proving the truth: listening had healed the fractures") replaces earned resonance with a simple, declared message, which is a critical failure for literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of transforming vulnerability into strength is woven through the entire narrative via strong, recurring imagery of webs and dance. While the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer, the theme is occasionally stated too explicitly in the narration. This tendency toward thematic echo slightly undermines the subtext, preventing the theme from emerging purely through action and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of memory, loss, and reclamation emerges organically from the story’s potent central metaphor. The pressed wildflowers serve as a perfect, resonant image that answers the story's central question without needing words. The final sentence ("proof that even deleted memories found their way home"), however, slips into explicit moralizing, stating the theme directly in a way that slightly undermines the power of the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the central conflict between chaotic prophecy and focused tranquility. The use of a crane wing (peace) to "map silence" creates a powerful, non-verbal exploration of how quiet intention can overcome destructive noise. The final image of the hushed haven provides a resonant answer to the story's central question without resorting to a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story develops its themes of history, communication, and truth with subtlety and depth, primarily through the brilliant "agreed upon lies" concept. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, Thorne's confession, particularly the line about Elara's curiosity feeling "like homecoming," verges on a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating a feeling that the preceding text had already successfully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of integrating past trauma to forge self-reliance emerges organically from the central conceit and culminates in a powerful final image. However, the story commits a significant misstep by explicitly stating its theme in a key motivational passage: "to translate isolation into independence, to alchemize the solitude..." This moment of telling undermines thesubtlety built elsewhere, functioning as a "Thematic Echo" that preempts the reader's discovery and flattens the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of repurposing one's skills—turning "calibrated treason" from a political tool into a method for personal healing—is insightful and elegantly woven through the narrative. The central symbols carry this theme effectively without being heavy-handed for most of the story. A minor deduction is warranted for the final paragraphs, which verge on summarizing the theme directly ("calibrating treason into forgiveness"), slightly undermining the otherwise powerful resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    A resonant theme about the nature of humanity and connection emerges organically from the story's particulars. The melted snow globe and the reformed snowflake serve as a perfect thematic container for the idea of reclaiming something pure from tragedy. The score is held back by the one moment of overt thematic statement: "...the expedition's downfall stemmed from suppressed affections..." which explains the theme to the reader directly, rather than trusting the powerful imagery to convey it alone.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of honoring unseen labor is central and well-integrated with the story's core images. However, the piece undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic statement. The final sentence, "...in following moon paths, one mends not just nets, but the soul," functions as a concluding moral, a thematic echo that lessens the resonance of the preceding imagery by explaining it too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of harsh truth versus comfortable lies is woven directly into the plot and character motivation. However, the story undermines its own subtext by frequently stating its theme explicitly. The final paragraphs, in particular, lapse into summary ("offering a seed of real redemption"), which feels like a "thematic echo" that tells the reader the moral instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of power born from isolation is potent and well-integrated into the imagery. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit statements. The line "unfolding the core concept: variant allegiance as a living force" reads like an authorial note, stating the theme directly rather than letting the resonant final image of the lone prophet carry the weight of meaning by itself.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of connecting generations and finding redemption in salvaged things is beautifully embodied in the central action. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the score is held back by the explicit use of the phrase "gleaned redemption" twice, which functions as a thematic label that slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    The themes of harmony, protection, and the interplay between the "fleshly" and "ethereal" elements are strong and emerge organically from the story's core concepts. However, the closing line, "a testament to the fleshly ethereal dance... that had preserved the harmony of worlds intertwined," functions as a thematic statement, reducing its emergent quality.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of patient, enduring change versus rash, fiery rebellion is woven into every element, from the setting to the core action. It emerges organically without a single line of explicit moralizing. The final image of the cracking ice is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, resonating with all the preceding material about ice, patience, and slow, powerful forces.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central theme of freedom from oppression is powerful, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The parallel between Clara's escape and Elias's professional struggle is explicitly stated ("mirrored Elias's own suffocation"), a thematic echo that tells rather than shows. The final line, "ready to ignite his own liberty's flame," further underlines the theme instead of allowing it to resonate through the image alone, bordering on moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of second chances and redemption emerges organically from the plot and central metaphor. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly direct thematic statements. Thorne's line, "Everyone deserves a second opinion on their worth," while pivotal, verges on a "thematic echo" that states the story's thesis too plainly, slightly diminishing the resonance that the final image otherwise earns.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is woven seamlessly through image and action, exploring creation, consciousness, and the nature of pioneering vision without a single line of overt statement. The central question of whether machines can "yearn" is answered not with a simple yes, but with the complex, resonant image of the "unheard" bell. This ending provides a non-literal, emotionally honest answer that reweights the entire narrative and lingers beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of memory versus erasure is explored with nuance and depth, emerging organically from the plot rather than through statement. The story brilliantly reframes its central question, moving from "where do files go?" to "what does it mean to remember?" The final line—"a promise that absence was never truly final"—serves as a resonant, non-literal answer that recharges the entire narrative without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of empathy as a tool for peace is powerful but delivered with a heavy hand, undermining its potential for resonance. The story explicitly states its thesis ("map empathy onto action") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext and image. This directness prevents meaningful ambiguity and reads more like a moral than an exploration. The central metaphor of piecing together fragments of empathy is clever but overly literal, leaving little for the reader to uncover.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges with grace from the story's particulars, contrasting the clinical search for an "ending" with the lived experience of solace in ruin. The shattered-but-mended parasol tip is an elegant, recurring motif that perfectly encapsulates the central idea without overstatement. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's driving question, successfully avoiding any hint of a tidy moral and embracing a complex peace.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "destined mismatches" is central and developed through the key image of the burned letter. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic statement, bordering on moralizing. The final sentence, "...a testament to destinies that mismatch to make way for unexpected harmonies," is a Thematic Echo that summarizes the point for the reader, slightly weakening the resonance that the preceding scene had already powerfully established through subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of preserving sacred knowledge through quiet, dedicated action emerges organically from the plot without a single line of exposition. The final image—the pavilion's murmurs carrying a "new timbre"—provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion that beautifully encapsulates the story's core idea of endurance and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transmuting trauma into communal art is potent and emerges organically from the core conceit. The final image serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the repeated use of key thematic words ("transmute," "alchemized," "masterpiece") borders on thematic labeling, slightly undermining the subtext by making it too explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of resilience emerges organically from the central metaphor, but the final paragraphs undermine this by stating the theme directly. Lines like "the pattern of growth was resilience" and "growth was not linear conquest" function as thematic summaries, slightly diminishing the earned resonance of the closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, time, and identity emerge organically from the story's unique premise and setting. The central metaphor of capturing the "sound of growing older" is resonant and well-sustained. However, the piece is marred by a direct thematic statement in the final line ("no longer entirely forgetful"), a textbook example of a "Thematic Echo" that states the moral instead of trusting the resonant final image to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of harnessing the ephemeral is present, but its delivery is too explicit. The final paragraph devolves into a direct statement of the story's moral ("the universe's greatest escapes began not with thunderous roars, but with the hush of a falling leaf"). This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, undercutting the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of healing through the reclamation of fragmented memories is beautifully woven through the central image of the broken record. The story avoids a simplistic moral, offering a resonant final image of reunification. However, a few lines verge on thematic summary, such as "convincing Elena that goodbyes could heal as much as they hurt," which slightly over-articulates the subtext instead of letting the scene's action carry the full weight of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of restoring order and precision (clockwork, runes, cycles) to a world undone by chaotic absurdity (bent spoons) emerges organically from the plot. The final image of Elara holding the key to "close its greatest loop" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. It successfully avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the symbolism to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of turning loss into a new form of joy is potentially powerful, but its delivery is entirely too overt, stripping the story of subtext and resonance. The narrative repeatedly states its own themes using prompt-like phrases ("to turn mistakes into constellations," "nostalgic innovation"). The final paragraphs devolve into thematic summary, a critical flaw that replaces an earned, emergent feeling with a direct authorial statement, violating the principle of showing over telling.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of creating hope through reflection rather than consumption is potent and emerges organically from the character's backstory. The final image of reflected light on weary faces provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's quest. The score is slightly limited by moments of thematic overstatement, particularly the line, "light shared without fire, a stillness that reflects the vastness above," which functions as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the story’s thesis in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of reclamation is powerfully integrated through the central images of the moss garden and the re-contextualized amber pendant. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the dialogue, "I've decided to let it sweeten the silence between us," verges on stating the theme directly, a slight thematic echo that momentarily dilutes the subtext built so carefully through imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of preserving ephemeral hopes against despair emerges organically from the story's central conceit and imagery. It avoids didacticism, allowing the final image of the manuscript as a "talisman of collected dreams" to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial conflict. The recurring motif of going "against the current" reinforces the theme without overstating it, resulting in a complex and satisfying emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of restoring tradition and reconnecting with the past emerges coherently from the story's events. The final image of the renewed land and chanting villagers offers a resonant answer to the central problem. However, the story occasionally veers close to stating its theme directly, as in "without these sacred practices, her home would fade," which slightly reduces the subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges with exceptional grace from the central metaphor of alchemical cartography. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the resonant final image—"veins of light tracing paths through grief's wilderness"—to provide a complex, non-literal answer to the problem of loss. The use of discarded items to create a tool of navigation is a powerful, integrated subtext on finding meaning in brokenness.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of preserving magic through rational means is explored with nuance and depth. The story avoids simple moralizing, instead offering a complex meditation on memory, craft, and healing. The final image of the harvest as his "own reflection, echoed back" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of finding purpose within inescapable constraints emerges with haunting clarity. It's developed entirely through the central metaphor of weaving and collecting, avoiding any didactic statement until the final, earned insight about the trap becoming a "loom for universal truths." The final image provides a resonant, complex answer to the story's core question about entrapment, leaving a lasting impression of profound, stoic grace.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transforming loss into meaning emerges organically from the central metaphor of carving and the structure of "harvesting" memories. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the score is capped by the explicit thematic statements, particularly Marcus’s quoted advice, which functions as a "Thematic Echo" that states the moral directly rather than allowing it to remain fully emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of regret and memory is explored with exceptional nuance, emerging organically from the story’s central conceit. The resolution, which redefines redemption as the weaving of broken stories into a new whole, is a resonant and non-didactic answer to the story's core question. The final image powerfully encapsulates this complex idea without overstating it.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of resurrecting hope from decay emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the story undermines its subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Phrases like "to puzzle out new equations for hope" and "wove despair into tentative optimism" function as Thematic Echoes, stating the story's thesis directly and reducing the power of the otherwise effective symbolic action.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of integrating past failure rather than conquering it emerges organically from the story’s central action and imagery. The final image—the unfinished clock face among the timeless crystals as the sanctuary becomes a home—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elias's conflict. The story avoids moralizing, allowing the quiet complexity of his peace to linger effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of self-deception as a form of architecture is potent and well-integrated through recurring motifs like bridges, layers, and the sundial. However, the final paragraph verges on overstatement. The line "illuminating how his own life had been built on similar structures, errant pursuits masking the lies he'd told himself" is a thematic echo that summarizes the epiphany rather than allowing the images to complete the work, slightly reducing the subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme is the story's heartwood, emerging organically from the central metaphor of knots and seeds. The narrative beautifully explores the preservation of ephemeral wisdom, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids a simple moral. The thematic work is very strong, though a few lines, such as being "rewarded with the weight of preserved eternity," verge on summarizing the theme too explicitly in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding presence in absence is beautifully woven through the central metaphor of the weft thread. However, the story falters by over-explaining itself near the end. Lines like "He understood then that healing's geography lay not in distant lands, but in these intimate projections" and "obituaries for the living that explained why some presences lingered in absence" function as thematic summaries. This explicit moralizing undermines the otherwise potent subtext, replacing earned resonance with a stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of organic life versus sterile mechanization is woven into every image, from the calcified feathers to the oil-slick rivers of the past. The story resists a simple moral, landing on a "bitterly sweet" revelation that serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to its central conflict. The final image of the fragile egg perfectly encapsulates the complex, aching hope at the story's core.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding resonance and life in trauma is powerfully integrated through symbolism (grafting, coin, sand). However, the story suffers from several moments of "thematic echo." Lines like "Scars remember the fire, but they can carry a tune if we let them" and the final sentence's "proving her truth" state the theme too explicitly, converting powerful subtext into text and slightly diminishing the resonant ambiguity required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of liberating memory versus skeptical realism emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids didacticism. The connection between the city's curse and the protagonist's maternal loss provides effective subtext. The only minor weakness is the thematic scaffolding, where keywords like "luminous," "skepticism," and "defiant" are repeated to the point of feeling overly deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    A coherent, complex theme emerges around determinism and the nature of progress, and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the theme's power is somewhat undercut by its explicit articulation in the narration (e.g., "trapped the future in the past's shadow"), which occasionally replaces subtext with direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of memory, grief, and inheritance emerges organically from the story’s potent symbols: the ribbon as a "resilient braid," the butterflies as a "silent thunder." The final image of the family dinner, bound by the ribbon and a new poem, offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the shape of grief. It avoids sentimentality and tidy morals, leaving a powerful emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of public confession versus private penance emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The recurring motifs of balance, tides, and time are woven together effectively. However, the story verges on overstating its theme in the final paragraph with the explicit phrase "Incremental absolution had arrived," which slightly undermines the powerful resonance of the final action by explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of discovering the past is well-integrated until the final paragraph, which commits a significant flaw. The line "...the shape of intentions was not rigid, but fluid, tenderly organized by time's hand..." is a direct thematic statement that functions as a moral. This "Thematic Echo" replaces earned resonance with overt explanation, undermining the subtlety built throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of transforming ignorance from a "void to vessel" is developed with nuance and precision, emerging organically from character action rather than authorial statement. The final image of the poised quill is a perfect, non-literal embodiment of this theme, offering a resonant answer to the story's central question without a whisper of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of narrative resilience is beautifully integrated, emerging organically from the central metaphor of dust being taught to tell stories. The story avoids overt moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image of shimmering dust in concert halls as an answer to the initial problem. This ending reweights the entire piece, suggesting that hope lies in the overlooked and the humble.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of safety as a fragile mirage emerges organically from the story's central images—the motorized chair, the shattered vase—rather than from direct statement. The subtextual link between Elena's artistic method ("incomplete information") and the nature of memory itself is sophisticated and well-executed. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about grief and remembrance, avoiding sentimentality and leaving a lasting, complex emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of preservation versus progress emerges organically from the central conflict over the cog. While some early phrasing is a bit on-the-nose, the story's final image—etching a secret philosophy onto a sewer wall—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. It masterfully embraces complexity, avoiding a simple moral in favor of a poignant, ambiguous act of defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of mending division through art emerges organically from the central conflict and the powerful metaphor of "subtracting noise." The story avoids didacticism, allowing its ideas to resonate through concrete images like the zither's rosette and the final braided harmony. The ending offers a complex, non-literal answer to the story's questions, resisting a tidy moral in favor of a poignant, lingering ambiguity about art's endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of "gentle rebellion" is coherent but delivered with excessive authorial force, violating the principle of emergence. Lines like "This isn't fighting the system... It's planting in the cracks" function as direct thematic statements ("Thematic Echo"), reducing subtext and preventing the theme from arising organically from the narrative's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of preserving wonder within a technical, mundane world emerges organically from character and action. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image—Elias closing the box—that serves as a non-literal answer to the central thematic question. The bee/nectar motif beautifully connects the world's mechanics to the story's core emotional tone.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    A potent theme of renewal through quiet reverence emerges organically from the story’s central action. However, its resonance is significantly undercut by moments of direct thematic summary. The line "He understood then: houses felt alive when their displaced objects were returned to harmony" is a prime example of a "Thematic Echo," stating the story's moral explicitly instead of allowing it to resonate through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of certainty versus nuance is elegantly woven through the story's core conceits—the construct, the animated garden, the dual-natured foxglove. The final image of the garden breathing anew is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The score is tempered by moments where the theme is stated too directly, such as when Lirien's motivation is "crystallized" or in Elara's final, slightly over-articulated epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is seamlessly integrated, emerging from the central images of the staircase, the dice, and the concept of perpetual motion. The story explores regret and potential not through statement but through a compelling metaphysical conceit. The final image of the chipped die becoming whole is a masterful, non-literal answer to the central problem, re-weighting the entire narrative with a sense of profound, earned transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of enduring, remembered kindness is potent and emerges organically from the central imagery of lost languages and shared humanity. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The whispered line, "Kindness circles back, like the moon," and Elias's final thought, "strangers do remember," state the theme directly, diluting the resonance that the powerful final image of the smiling stranger could have carried on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of preserving cultural memory is woven seamlessly through character, setting, and action. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a complex resolution through its final image. The line "history thawed, but not yet lost" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, acknowledging both the loss inherent in change and the hope of continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme is ambitious and coherent, its delivery is hampered by overt thematic statements ("countering the clockwise tyranny of days") and repetitive labeling of the core concepts. This heavy-handedness, particularly the repeated phrase "bleak exhilaration," functions as a thematic echo that lessens the power of discovery for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of confronting secrets to defeat fear is clear, but its delivery is too explicit. The advisor's final whisper, "See? Repulsion yields to allure when weakness is bared," is a direct thematic statement that functions as a moral. This summary undermines the potential for resonance, telling the reader the story's meaning rather than letting it emerge from the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of transforming adversity into art is powerfully and consistently explored through image and action. The story avoids preachiness until the final two sentences, where "no barrier endured that couldn't be restrung into symphony" verges on an explicit moral. While the preceding narrative earns this summary, the final image alone would have carried the thematic weight with more resonance and subtlety, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of forbidden knowledge and the cost of curiosity emerge organically from the plot, avoiding any hint of moralizing. The final question Elara faces—whether to free her brother at the risk of unleashing wrath—serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central tensions. The final image perfectly encapsulates this complex thematic ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "noble lies" is explored with nuance, and the final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its themes too directly, as when Elias explicitly defines the concept or explains the parallels he's drawing. These moments of thematic summary slightly flatten the subtext, preventing the piece from reaching the highest tier in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of honoring abandoned dreams and finding meaning in decay emerges organically from the story’s central action. The final image of the notes sealed within the foundation provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered because a few key phrases ("interlaced absences," "archeologist of abandoned dreams") come close to being overt thematic statements rather than purely emergent concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of history as a constructed, biased narrative versus an unvarnished truth is explored organically through Elara's actions. The ending resonates by transforming the central quest rather than simply answering it. The story avoids simplistic moralizing, though the final lines verge on stating the theme directly ("surfacing the submerged truth"). The recurrence of "stillness" and "dappled" feels slightly over-insisted upon, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of transforming grief through creative expression and integration is beautifully woven into every element, emerging organically without explicit statement. The symbolism of lanterns, captured dreams, and origami cranes is cohesive and deep, contributing to a rich subtext. The "fragile peace" at the end offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting prior material with genuine complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of weaponized grief and the commodification of potential emerge powerfully from the plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is held back by the over-reliance on repeating key phrases ("unused potential," "intangibly tangible"), which function as thematic labels that are slightly too explicit, bordering on thematic echo rather than allowing the theme to arise purely from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding connection amidst fragmentation ("missing pieces") is beautifully integrated, particularly through the central metaphor of the type foundry matrix chip. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The score is slightly tempered by a few lines that articulate the theme a bit too directly, such as describing the frequency as a "resonance of identity," which borders on thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story powerfully integrates themes of memory, truth, and time, primarily through the central metaphor of manufactured lineages and the symbolism of the driftwood. The watch hand is a superb thematic object. However, the final sentence—"even false memories could not erase the carvings of the heart"—functions as a direct thematic summary, slightly undermining the "show, don't tell" principle and preventing the final image from carrying the full weight of the theme on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story is built around a coherent, resonant theme of atonement and growth, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The core concept of "recycling mistakes" is stated explicitly multiple times in narration and dialogue, culminating in Lira's final line, which acts as a direct thematic summary. This over-articulation replaces earned resonance with a declared moral, weakening the story's literary power.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of finding a new way to navigate—by heart instead of maps—is skillfully woven through the story's central imagery (the broken compass, the utility poles). However, its power is significantly undercut by on-the-nose thematic statements ("align heart and action") and the meta-commentary in the final paragraph, which replaces resonant imagery with a bald summary of thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of empathy versus erasure is explored effectively through the central conceit. The final image offers a resonant answer to the story's core question. However, the theme is occasionally stated too directly ("His motivation crystallized: to kindle empathy"), which slightly undermines the power of subtext and makes the thematic discovery feel less organic.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of renewal requiring the embrace of feared transformation is woven coherently throughout, from the phoenix motif to the final metamorphosis. The final image of the two wolves running together provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about overcoming grief. However, the explicit repetition of phrases like "cosmic intimacy" and "paradoxically steady" occasionally verges on thematic labeling, slightly undermining the otherwise organic emergence of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story masterfully explores themes of memory, regret, and matrilineal legacy without a single line of overt moralizing. The central symbol of the cracked saucer mending "in essence" is a sophisticated and resonant answer to the story's core question. The theme emerges organically from the concrete, ritualistic actions, culminating in a final image that is both specific and universal.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of healing trauma through compassionate confrontation is potent and seamlessly integrated. The central metaphor of stitching shadows to light is executed beautifully, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids a simplistic moral. The piece is docked slightly for moments that verge on thematic summary, such as the direct explanation "Shadow work required this delving," which momentarily replaces showing with telling.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transformation through selfless giving emerges organically from the plot, but the story undermines its own subtext with heavy-handed thematic statements. The final paragraph explicitly articulates the story's moral ("Transformation's texture unfolded before him: not a violent rupture, but a vibrant hush..."), a classic case of "Thematic Echo" that replaces resonant imagery with a tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of silent, intellectual rebellion versus brute force is potent and emerges organically from the plot. The final line, "the vigilant sentinel became the spark herself," provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story occasionally veers into thematic summary with phrases like "tiny flames of revolution waiting to be fanned into a blaze," which slightly undermines the subtext by stating the metaphor too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic exploration of connection, order, and the transformation of a burden into a gift emerges organically from the story’s central actions and vivid imagery. The narrative beautifully braids the cosmic with the personal—eel to star, aurora to tide, curse to map. The final line, where the "borrowed dawn" yields to a "true sunrise of purpose," offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding guidance in trauma is potent and emerges organically from the story's core metaphor. The ending avoids a simplistic moral. However, the story comes perilously close to stating its theme directly with the line, "Scars are the stars we navigate by," which feels more like an aphorism than an earned thought, slightly undermining the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transforming conflict into inquiry is potent and organically resolved through the final action. The closing image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is held back by the anti-pattern of "Thematic Echo"—the core theme ("turn questions into destinations") is stated too explicitly and repeatedly, reducing the subtext and trusting the reader less than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of creating order and beauty from chaos is woven skillfully through recurring imagery of light, fracture, and blooming. The final image of a "garden in gravel" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final sentence veers into a direct thematic statement ("proving that even in cages, poetry and friendship could hammer chaos into something eternal"), which slightly undermines the preceding subtlety by over-explaining the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of transforming memory and stasis into defiant creation is woven skillfully through the story's core images—the broken clock, the flickering compasses, the final symphony. The conclusion offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, landing on the image of a "bridge between what was and what might yet be." The score is slightly tempered by a few lines that verge on stating the theme directly, such as when "the core concept of flickering compasses emerged."

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory as a fragile, living practice emerges organically from the plot and imagery, avoiding didacticism. The story’s final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question, embracing the complexity that victory may be cyclical and incomplete. The piece resists a tidy moral, leaving a powerful and lingering sense of hopeful anxiety.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of resolving unspoken grief is handled with elegance and emerges organically from the story’s central images: bonsai, the sea, the compass, and the lace. The final image of the cerulean color on the antique fabric provides a potent, non-literal resolution to Elias's quest. The story only falters slightly by occasionally stating its thematic aims too baldly, as in the final paragraph's summary of his healing, which verges on moralizing.

Subtext resides in the butterflies’ fragile dust—once dismissed, now valued—mirroring her rejected self.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of choosing connection over analytical safety emerges through the doorway visions rather than authorial statement; the refrain “lingering promise” is character-bound, not thesis-label.

    Theme emerges organically: knowledge preservation demands destructive rebirth—fire as memory’s midwife. Subtext is strongest in the slashed portrait: erasure as preservation. Final image of “tender flame to carry back” reweights her original library fire without moralizing. Avoids tidy redemption; she remains exiled, now burdened. One near-preach line—“her arson an echo of the passion that built and buried Thalor”—leans toward thesis; still within tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as rebellion against oblivion. The garden’s sonic ecology literalizes this without overt statement; the ending’s image of Elara drumming alone reweights the premise—rebellion succeeds by internalizing loss. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through action: stealth circuitry outperforms macho noise. Final image—coin warm, aurora fading—quietly reweights the opening boast without moralizing. Subtext in Marco’s stunned surrender suffices, though his interior silence keeps thematic counter-voice thinner than ideal.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: darkness as necessary ground for starlight. Subtext resides in the guardian’s silence and the mirror’s redirected beam—no moralizing. Final image reweights the premise without statement, leaving resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: the quiet subversion of conformity through strategic empathy. Subtext resides in gesture—the cradled king, the aligned fabrics—never in exposition. The ending offers a charged poise: forests of second thoughts germinate without triumphalism, leaving elders’ power intact but cracked. Moral complexity remains; no tidy moral is stated.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—freedom through self-revelation rather than flight—emerges from the image chain: nets → maps → scales, each object re-weighted across the arc. The oceanic pacifist premise strips classic siren violence away, so “embrace” becomes the only weapon, a conceptual twist that reframes mer-identity outside predator tropes. No character moralizes; the final shimmer of scales answers every prior question without a declaring sentence. The slight reserve comes from the mother-backstory delivered in one summarizing clause, blunting the thematic counter-argument that land-life also offered belonging.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through image pattern: cracked ice = shattered decree, bioluminescent blooms = reclaimed art. No moral stated; final dawn image reweights earlier “lantern-moth hush” into liberated glow. Ambiguity remains—was transgression worth frostbite?—inviting reflection without tidy answer. Recurrent light/water motifs constrain choices rather than decorate.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of “beauty in flaw” emerges through glass bubbles and warped concertina panels, avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext operates in the plant lexicon and the unspoken fear of further loss. Final chord re-prices imperfection as mutual salvation, giving resonant non-verbal answer. A trace of writerly self-commentary (“This motivation drove him…”) slightly over-articulates intent, holding the score short of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: sound as woven velvet against the soul; the final bell-song internalized offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing; ambiguity lingers—connection remains fragile under the grid’s “fragile hum,” resisting tidy solace.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of renewal through shared vulnerability emerges via craft and cosmos, never sermonized. The stencil’s vine-to-constellation motif reweights subtly at closure. Subtext operates in the silent hand-off of the lotus. Avoids tidy moral yet flirts with sentimental glow.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from concrete acts: divination as cultural cartography, loss as generative myth. Subtext in Theo’s skepticism and Elara’s vulnerability avoids didacticism. Final image—dawn clearing the skylight—reweights the premise: understanding, not prediction, is the new value. No moralizing; resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of necessary loss emerges through imagery rather than assertion. The child-apparition’s revelation skirts platitude but stays anchored to Elara’s past, giving conceptual cost. Final image of “steadily unpredictable tapestry” reweights prior material without moralizing. One hairline slip: “evolution’s anguished joy” borders thesis-statement.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through the footage contrast: shared dreams commodify hope until it fractures. The final stabilized bloom offers a non-literal, bittersweet answer—hope preserved yet altered—without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of reclamation after betrayal emerges organically from beats; tail regeneration mirrors personal repair without overt statement. Final image avoids moralizing, offering resonant ambiguity, though thematic wording (“balance self-respect…”) is stated in prompt-like diction once.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of “displaced miracle” emerges solely through image—scar, frozen sand, buried opal—never named in abstraction. Final reweighting: survival guilt becomes generative custodianship, resonating without moral. Coffee-ring divination and plant telepathy integrate as idiosyncratic lived magic rather than symbolic furniture. Ambiguity remains: miracle is neither cruel nor kind, simply rerouted.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: stored affections as spectral archive, love’s negative space as palimpsest. The final image of letters suspended between frames offers a non-literal answer—redemption through retrieval. No moralizing; complexity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of reclamation through cosmic surrender emerges via concrete pattern—star-trails rejoin her veins—avoiding overt thesis. The remembered-stardust motif reappears at closure, reweighting prior material without moralizing. One near-echo (“hidden ember”) flirts with abstraction but is grounded in brass temperature earlier, keeping sentimentality at bay.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from pattern rather than statement: cultivation as gentle unraveling versus conquest. The glowing dune reprises early ash-whisper to reconfigure meaning—life from absence. No moralizing line intrudes; the faint smile and hollow eyes keep ambiguity alive. Conceptual repricing lands cleanly: renewal is real yet personally withheld.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of reclaimed cognition emerges through imagistic refrain rather than thesis, satisfying the “no moral” rule. The gear-neuron metaphor carries consistent conceptual weight, reprised at the end. Yet the absence of sacrificed alternative keeps the repricing mild; the insight feels affirmative, not costly. Ambiguity is present but not charged—reader reweights less than character does.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of self-imposed leashes emerges through star-stamp motif and shoreline mirror without moralizing; final image of her punching others’ tickets reconfigures the vigil into communal ferrying, offering resonant after-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges implicitly from bolt’s return: refuge that heals can also ossify; acceptance, not escape, is the remaining music. No moralizing line; final “melody hummed in his chest, unspoken yet alive” reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers—hope is real yet frostbitten.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through recursion: bleaching as both death and map-blankness, migration as both loss and hidden reroute—without any character naming the metaphor. The atlas page’s migration from relic to lens quietly reweights grief into provisional stewardship; the reader finishes re-thinking “extinction” as spatial amendment rather than terminal erasure. No moralizing coda intrudes; the final tap drift lets the ocean answer. The concept stays particular to Elara’s witnessing vocation, resisting grand-standing eco-allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through pattern: cosmic order versus human chaos, resolved not by victory but by alignment—Elara chooses to tune herself to the stones’ rhythm. Subtext resides in the opera glasses’ shift from nostalgic relic to tactical lens. The ending avoids moralizing; the hum’s promise of storms carries ambiguous cost. Resonance is earned, though the rebellion’s politics remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: tradition as living root, not petrified crust. The embryo image literalizes the idea while the kite script supplies mythic depth without sermonizing. Final image—Mira carrying the pulsing embryo into the reconstruction—reweights prior material, offering a Charged Poise that invites reflection on co-created destiny. One declarative line (“ensuring destiny was not imposed but co-created”) flirts with thematic echo but is salvaged by its placement mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of anchoring optimism in realism emerges through orchid, photograph, and cliff-edge persistence. No moralizing; final image of “seed” reweights prior grief without statement.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the concrete act of untangling: fragmentation is not a flaw to fix but material to re-weave. The tarot’s fractured imagery and the lighthouse’s fractured light mirror Elias’s psyche without overt statement. The final image—a mandala of cards and a newly bound cord—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: art born from necessary darkness. A hairline risk of thematic echo in “luminescent ache” keeps it just shy of 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges from the ink’s vanishing act: truths revealed only to those willing to disappear. No direct statement; the disappearing ink motif reweights from “evidence” to “veil of mercy.” Subtext in the sorcerer’s chant and Elara’s silent vanishing suggests time slows to force survivors to witness and thus to choose. Final image—Elara gone, drone returning with secret—offers a non-literal answer: knowledge demands erasure of self.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge as contraband, archives as complicity. The letter’s gilded contraband ink and the dormant networks become charged images that reweight meaning at the end without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of peace-as-resilience emerges through action: knife sheathed, scrap planted, dome quiets. Final image of brighter blooms reframes “engraved quiet” without moralizing; ambiguity remains—will it hold?—yielding lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges as the alchemy of grief-into-sound: the garden transliterates sorrow into glyphs, the fisher transliterates void into song, and the feral lullaby becomes both threat and balm. No moral is stated; the final stillness reweights earlier chaos without sermon. The goddess echo remains ambiguous—world-breaker or world-mender—so complexity lingers. One abstract phrase (“primal silence that birthed all noise”) flirts with pseudo-profundity but is quickly grounded in the spike’s warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    “Orbits of regret” offers a resonant metaphor for generational complicity; the image of starlight mocking human deceit threads through without overt thesis. Theme emerges from the object (nib) and the hoax reveal, avoiding final-paragraph moralizing. Complexity is limited: Elara’s own complicity is never interrogated.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from conflict—guilt vs atonement—earned through specific embodied action (amber tether). The final image, silent meteor trail echoing peace, offers resonant non-literal absolution without didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of meaning-through-mess emerges via sand-image, not statement; ambiguity is preserved, no moral is preached. Final image reweights prior noise without tidiness, though thematic counter-readings stay modest. Resonance is concrete yet not strikingly non-obvious.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: mercy becomes aberrant when it forgives the unforgivable, yet that act reforges community. The rename’s reweighting of “curse to caution” supplies the resonant non-literal answer without sermon. No thematic echo sentence; instead, the tessera’s subtle mend under her palm declares the thesis. Complexity remains—survivors’ wary eyes admit the risk of relapsing into fire—so ambiguity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of art-as-survival emerges through image, not thesis: echoes, encores, synesthetic stage-light memories. Nostalgia is treated as both sedative and snare—ambiguity stays intact. Final image of “intertwined echoes” reweights earlier “ash-tasting silence” without moralizing. Ghost’s vaudeville era never becomes nostalgic set-dressing; it refracts Eliza’s present fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly: embodied attention outperforms synthetic telepathy. No character states it; the final print’s gold/blue swirls reweight the premise without moralizing. The geode’s recursive layers echo their mutual recursion of touch and interpretation—image refracts idea, no thesis required.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: continuity across extinction. The elm leaf—once part of a living forest, now a data-crystal—embodies the fragile thread between pre-human vitality and post-human silence, reweighted in the final overlay without a syllable of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of choice versus fate emerges through the concrete labor of sorting relics; no explicit moralizing. Final image of turning the last hourglass reweights earlier vigil as prelude to release. Subtext in the silent warehouse and the jar’s hum invites reader reflection without didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of renewal through shared fracture emerges from the thawing earth and the mended cipher; no explicit statement. The pillbox’s shift from narcotic to evidence embodies the conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers—will exposure heal or destroy them—without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the concrete act of stitching: complexity distilled to essence. No moralizing; the final ledger line is image, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers—will future travelers still demand more?—yet the reconfiguration feels complete.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges implicitly: persistence-through-tending versus surrender-through-neglect. Final image of potter-hands “itching for clay” recharges the motif without moralizing. Subtext stays restrained—no thesis statement—though “sharp gentleness” edges toward prompt-echo. Complexity is present but not deepened by character contradiction; hence very good, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of resilience through shared vulnerability emerges via concrete ritual rather than statement. The moonlit petals refract the father’s “illuminate what lay concealed” ethic into a communal future, avoiding moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    Brittle awakenings drive all action; no tidy moralizing—translating isolation becomes an earned, risky stance: coexistence with ghosts, not people.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of secret love made visible emerges via twig-spiral built from withheld letters, avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext runs through the envelope’s silence: gratitude plus invitation equals reciprocity. Final image of clasped hands over the spiral reconfigures anonymity into shared authorship without moralizing. Some lingering abstraction (“thread that connects all things”) blunts specificity yet sustains inviting ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—truth as contested frequency—emerges through sub-sonic distortion rather than lecture. Final “honest silence” reweights all prior noise without moralizing. Ethereal grit tone lets cosmic awe coexist with rusted metal and political grime, embodying the thematic tension. Still, the absence of Elara’s private reverb in that last moment keeps resonance a fraction short of full charge.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of spatial rebellion against imposed geometries emerges through action and image rather than statement; the final image of Elara “ready to redraw the world’s boundaries” reweights the premise without moralizing. A faint echo of “wistful rebellion” in the last paragraph nicks the score.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of empathy as bridge between opposites emerges through image (mask ribbon vs. quarry stone) and action (sketch unifying them), never stated. Final sketch offers resonant, non-literal answer to communal silence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Emergent theme: truth’s tidal cost—exile can be annulled yet weather remains ruined, so justice is partial. Copper nail’s migration from coffin to station map reweights “reversible” as material memory, not erasure. No moralizing; final image invites uneasy reflection on whether revelation matters in a broken world.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the looping motif: past sins returning as invitation to reclaim rather than curse. No tidy moral—final image reconfigures the meaning of “routes that circle back” via dusky, charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of communal vs. solitary burden emerges through star/dream parallelism rather than declaration; final inscription line is the only overt statement and it is placed at climax so −0.4 thematic-echo penalty applies, but not fatal. Subtext operates in the telegram’s pressed petals—fragility of memory, need to transmit tenderness. Ambiguity remains: will she dare share her own burdens, or merely chronicle others’? Emotional aftereffect is gentle uplift rather than searing recognition, keeping score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of confronting unmirrored guilt emerges through concrete action (thawing the confession) rather than statement; the seed’s shift from devourer to binder offers resonant, non-literal closure without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Unity of realms vs individual rootedness emerges through image and action, never lecture; the re-lit covenant reframes harmony without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as the price of rewriting grief: ash becomes shared light, love as exchange rather than possession. No thesis stated; meaning accrues through root-lover-card triangulation. Final dust-image reweights the Lovers motif without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—whose peace, whose future?—yet complexity feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—value lies in the quiet sifting after the spotlight—emerges through the parallel between discarded quarry scraps and discarded lives, never sermonized. The grille cloth’s return reframes “after the applause” from lament to vocation without explicit statement. Subtle irony: the man who mis-prices trinkets finally refuses to devalue his own debris. Final image resonates, but the fair/failure setup is generic and could swap for any humiliation, trimming distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: transition as reconfiguration rather than loss. The seed’s sprout reweights earlier cuneiform metaphors, offering a non-literal answer that lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of preservation versus flux emerges through concrete ritual rather than statement; the final image of inked identities dancing with the moon offers a non-literal answer to the cost of immortality.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of reconnection emerges through spiral-scripted grief and crystalline reflections, never stated outright. The ending’s shared radiance reconfigures prior imagery without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—will light truly travel beyond stone?—inviting reflection while avoiding equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of redirecting guilt’s current emerges through recurring water/river images and the final accordion cadence; no explicit moralizing. Subtext operates in timeline graffiti, but its anonymous source blunts irony. Resonance is palpable yet stops short of reconfiguring prior moral accounting—ambiguity remains but lacks a sting of new weight.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of reclaiming silenced voices emerges through images (hovering books, unspoken regrets) rather than statement. Final “symphony of silenced voices” reweights prior cipher loops with conceptual cost. Avoids moral lesson; ambiguity about confidence-man trap lingers. Slight abstraction in “fractured past” keeps it from resonance ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thematic question—dream vs empire—emerges from concrete stakes and resolves in the non-literal violin’s cry. No tidy moral; the mulberry ache lingers as a resonant charge. Closure image reconfigures meaning without authorial statement.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of beauty as defiance against erasure emerges through the mortician’s craft inverted on herself; no narrator spells it out. The emerald’s green glow reframed as perennial hearth-light reweights earlier maternal image, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: future keepers may ignore the chip, resisting tidy thesis. Final image invites counter-readings of futility or transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of acceptance-through-cycles emerges from the hairpin’s return and the scallop action; no closing moral stated. Resists binaries yet stays legible, though “vineyard hush” leans toward atmospheric branding rather than shifting meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through the chime sequence and mirror void rather than exposition. The final image reframes prior motifs without moralising. One friction: “cloak of doubt” is named repeatedly; this near-thesis echo nudges score down from 8+. Still, ambiguity lingers—Thorne’s own flicker of doubt complicates any platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges purely through pattern: ripples invert rings of age; stone’s splash⇄cellular decay; vanish⇄appear. No explicit “lesson” paragraph stains the close—final line (“mirror of quiet revelation”) acts as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting earlier withheld truths. Ambiguity remains—will surrender save or erase her?—inviting reflection without moralizing. Subtext of scientific ethics threaded via “weaves truth carefully,” dramatized by her suppressed notes.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of stillness-as-mobility emerges through the arrowhead’s heartbeat and the canyon’s layered dust, culminating in a resonant, non-verbal image of a body rooted yet spiritually unbound.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the keystone’s organic glow versus algorithmic auroras; the final image of “quiet holiness” reweights the premise without sermon. Subtext is carried by gesture—tears freezing, crystals asymmetrical—rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: the tension between luminous vows and lived routine resolves into the indigo of sound itself. No moralizing; the final image of dawn-lit lamps awaiting “newfound color” reweights prior motifs. Subtext operates in the orb’s silent hum and the hush that “lingers like a promise kept.”

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: the price of aligning with a dying cosmos is relinquishing the relics of fragmented pasts. Subtext resides in the silence between static bursts and the spiral pattern of scattered coins. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—coins vanishing into darkness—without moralizing. A hairline slip toward thematic echo (“ready to lead the enclave toward rebirth”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of naming fear emerges organically from Elias’s ritual; no character states it outright. The final image—monsters tamed into guardians—offers a non-literal answer to the cost of sacrifice without moralizing. Subtext hums in the gramophone’s spectral overlap of beast-roar and Lira’s last words.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of balance and devotion emerges through concrete action: drip rhythms echo vanished seas; bell repair becomes ritual reparation. Subtext resides in the bell’s mute tongue and Elias’s half-voiced incantations. Final image—moisture welling from cracked earth—offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Slight abstraction in “cosmic imbalance” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of trust-as-survival emerges through action and image rather than statement; the final “soundless echo” reweights the opening silence into a charged poise. Avoids moralizing, but the conceptual cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of reclaimed sentience emerges entirely through the vivification act—no narrator sermon. Numbness vs. raw vitality is reconfigured when the “mirror” twin blinks first, re-pricing Kai’s prior survival as half-life. History-rewrite backdrop offers conceptual irony: external timelines flex while his inner timeline finally locks. Final image of dual selves on the rock answers the thematic question without moral tag.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of renewal-through-enigma emerges via organic imagery rather than thesis. Final image reweights earlier “stale puzzles” without moralizing. Subtext of decay-as-attraction (corpse-flower) lingers plausibly, inviting counter-readings on artistic risk.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the literal act: grief must be aerated, not entombed. The half-sung lullabies carry subtext—fragments of marital intimacy weaponized against silence. The final image of “pure, resonant peals” offers a non-literal answer: laughter can return, but only as echo, never as original voice.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through the motif of boundaries (light/dark, exile/home) without direct statement; final image of mist parting offers non-literal resonance. Ambiguity lingers: uncertainty becomes ally, not enemy. No moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Creative destruction” emerges through action—each melt/reform—not lecture; theme matures into faith-renewal via sacrilege. Frozen-bloom metaphor migrates from soul stasis to thawed possibility without authorial thesis. Final image of living silver vines offers resonant, wordless answer: creation requires wreckage. Complexity preserved—no sermon, no moral ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of renewal-from-ruin emerges through mirrored images—dead towers, eroded gorge, revitalized signals—without authorial thesis. The shard-of-hush concept reconfigures noise into pattern, but it lands as a private vision rather than a shared societal re-pricing, keeping resonance intimate rather than urgent. Subtext stays implicit; no moral is preached. Sufficient for length, but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of time’s fragility and human resilience emerges through imagery rather than statement, but the final paragraph edges toward explicit summation (“permanent whisper of worlds entwined”). Subtext is strongest in the empty hourglass as mute emblem; elsewhere, the story gestures at profundity without risking ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the concrete paradox of engineering emotion: the final image reweights “connection” from silk to scar-tissue without moralizing. Recurring “sinew” shifts from tool to scar, accruing pressure rather than decorating. No echoing thesis statement; the insight stays implicit in the cracked glass. Ambiguity lingers: the gallery’s “rational enchantment” is now permanently laced with his private grief, inviting counter-readings on whether art or artist is more broken.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of bridging irreconcilable depths emerges through the anchor-link’s transformation from scrap to star-map; no moralizing, only the somber marvel of connection that still aches.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as public health, caretaking extended past death. The locket’s inscription and the saved atrium reweight “voices that endure” without sermon.

Only the final spoken assurance veers toward explicit, muting the resonance a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: the immortality of sensation over sound, the cost of preservation. The final image of the canyon singing textures offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No moral is stated; ambiguity lingers in the curse’s survival.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of “harmony untamed” emerges through concrete events; the cosmic-joke reframe is earned by the phone’s confessions and Elara’s bodily change, avoiding overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of “breaking free” emerges through cumulative imagery—husk, cracked stone, dissolved shell—rather than exposition. Final reconfiguration is legible: mechanism loses dominion, wonder returns, no moral recap required. Yet the reprise is conceptually neat; ambiguity and counter-readings are curtailed by the unambiguous victory.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    Healing vows via mail becomes the thematic spine; the quiet reunion moment crystallizes meaning without overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)

    Theme emerges through pattern: analog memories as physical imprints vs digital ephemera. The ending reframes memory ownership without moralizing, letting the garden image carry conceptual repricing and social cost of lost tangible past.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges—absence as generative light—through color chemistry rather than statement. Final image reweights earlier “luminous absence” from loss to gift without moralizing. Motif of disappearing foam recurs naturally in pigment swirl, constraining choice. Resists tidy profundity; ambiguity lingers whether brother’s laughter is echo or projection.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    The unity-across-stars idea reconfigures prior grief into quiet resolve; the final image recharges the earlier star-hair ribbon motif without overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of memory as tidal theft emerges through image and action; final glow reframes earlier nostalgia without moralizing. Subtext is strong, yet leans on familiar folkloric tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of resilience versus reflection emerges through recurrent mirroring (glass, tea leaves, mentor/mentee) that reweights at closure: mentor becomes forward-walker. No moralizing; final image of Elara’s reversed steps speaks wordlessly. Subtext resides in gesture—handing the shard equals handing back identity. Shadow-as-doubt motif shifts from trap to released possibility without thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the concrete act of cultivation and release; no moralizing statement intrudes. The motif of “color” evolves from fading hue to impossible blossoms, recharging prior material without explicit commentary. Subtext operates in gesture—Elara’s scarred hands, the seed’s silent song—rather than exposition. Final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the hush motif: unspoken guilt is the real net that traps both living and dead. Subtext resides in the salt-dark fibers—each knot a word Elara swallowed. The final image reframes silence from refuge to prison, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. No thematic echo is spoken aloud; the reader carries the re-weighted quiet away.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the tension between interpretive empathy and the muteness of the past; no character states it aloud. The whispered chapel’s silence reweights the premise: knowledge may reside in absence. Final image—the open door breathing wordless air—offers a resonant, non-moral answer. Subtext operates in the grainy flicker of silent film and the unheard “whispers.”

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from salt-logged particulars: release as entropy, surrender as conservation of energy. Subtext resides in the static hiss of a vanished pilot and the settling plastic snow—no moral sermon. Final image reweights “anchor in storms” into “anchor let loose,” offering resonant ambiguity. Avoids tidy thesis; complexity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: the ethics of articulating silenced creations. Subtext lives in the ghost’s “silent longings” and Elowen’s reluctant yet compelled response. No moralizing; the final image of hovering light invites multiple readings—liberation or new burden. Motifs of gears and flowers reconfigure from mechanical oppression to organic release without overt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges gently: pain can refract into unexpected joy. The diary’s shifting light literalizes the idea without moralizing, and the final beat reweights the spire from prison to beacon. Ambiguity is present but thin because Elara’s own stakes remain observational.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: emptiness as archive, grief as taxonomy. The emotional aftereffect is concrete—reader left with the hush of star-dusted regret—no moralizing. Final reweighting (“voids weren’t empty; they were archives”) lands via image, not statement, though a shade more ambiguity could deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of “limits as gateway” emerges concretely: face-blindness first framed as cage, then as telescope that reveals hidden archive and new technique. Subtext resides in gesture—thumb on coin, brush on bark—rather than exposition. Final image reframes sky as human fractal without moralizing. No tidy maxim, just irreversible reconfiguration of sight.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—lonely scholarship as bridge to communion—emerges through the hopscotch-to-map transformation; yet the closing “shared horizon” is stated more than dramatized, muting the resonance that would reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of repair as cosmic rhythm emerges from specific events: frozen mechanisms, mirror reflections, syncopated heartbeat—never stated, always enacted. Subtext in uncapping her own heartbeat redefines repair beyond surfaces. Final image (mirrors gleaming gentle sync) offers non-literal answer: mending is aligning with universal pulse. No moralizing; resonance built from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—healing through communal effort—emerges via communal ritual rather than authorial lecture; final image of nebula seeds settling offers resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of mercy-in-flaw emerges organically from the cracked puppet and the flawed world; no direct statement. Subtext operates in the silent communion between adjuster and artifact. Final image of glowing cracks offers a non-literal answer: beauty and continuance reside in fracture. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—reluctant duty vs desire for freedom—surfaces in embodied action (tripping over roots yet placing nuts) without tidy moral; final graceless-beauty image reweights the curse without statement.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of separations-as-prelude-to-reconnection emerges organically from the braided river trope and chemical self-assembly metaphor, avoiding thesis lines until the penultimate paragraph. The final image of the husk in her pocket reweights earlier vacancies with tentative promise. One explanatory line (“translate this apartness into something connected”) edges toward moral summary but is partly earned by prior patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from pattern, not lecture: quantified emptiness becomes generative, reframing erasure as first material of authorship. Moonlight’s parole migrates from curio to liberated energy, mirroring Elara’s self-release. Final image of open shop and arriving visitors offers Conceptual Repricing—blankness is now commodity, origin is product, search becomes service. No moralizing line declares “creation needs absence”; the reconfiguration is felt in the dimmed bottle and reopened doors.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of transmuting grief into wisdom emerges through the chef’s literal tasting of memories; no explicit thesis stated. The tidal-pool motif (sand basins → ice rivulets) quietly mirrors the refining process, reprised at closure when dawn “gleams anew.” Final image of cooking to heal rather than haunt offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: will new diners refill the basin?

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of translation-as-repair emerges through staged particulars: German-Spanish-Polish weave inside one folk tune. Final image of “silos into symphonies” reweights earlier star-hush without moralizing. Subtext in gestures (Klaus’s narrowed eyes softening when the weight swings) carries more meaning than dialogue. One thematic echo line (“bridges literal and figurative”) edges toward statement, kept just shy of penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the helical imagery and mirror shards: the price of resurrecting forsaken dreams is to become one. Subtext operates in gesture—Elias’s trembling fingers, the mirror’s cracked reflection—never in direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the archeologist is now part of the fossil record he sought to catalog. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the moonlit abyss.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Emergent theme of custodial vigilance grows from doodle to seed without sermon; “latent blaze” motif migrates from personal zeal to world-guarding burden. Ending image of pocketed seeds reframes prior archive fever into stewardship, earning quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of beauty discovered in difficulty emerges from Elias’s precise correlation of silence—beauty draws its charge from the very fracture (dent, eclipsed covenant) rather than resolves it, leaving hopeful melancholy crystallized under nexus light.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of empathy-through-attuned-silence emerges via diary’s unpaid grief, not authorial decree. Final reconfiguration reweights silence from passive absence to active ethical burden, avoiding moral lecture. Some late lyrical abstractions (“eclectic heart fuller”) slightly dilute subtext, but overall resonance is earned through specific particulars of the mother’s entries.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: serenity is not stillness but rooted motion. Subtext lives in gesture—her trembling hand steadying only when sketching decay. Final image of “serenity in motion” is earned, not stated, and invites counter-readings about the cost of wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of resilience-as-seeded-sacrifice emerges through the arrow-tip visions, never stated. Subtext operates in the echoes and the silent covenant Elara accepts. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of foresight carved from ruin emerges through pattern: wind vectors, torn metal, salvaged patch. Final image of investigator walking into lengthening shadows reweights premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through color-into-sound alchemy rather than thesis: wonder is framed as a civic utility, not luxury. The final image of star-eyed ice-woman offers non-literal rebuttal to “encroaching gray” without sermon. Subtext resides in negative space—the sculpted hush—whose flip to resonance reconfigures meaning. One fleeting line—“prove wonder essential”—verges on echo, but its placement mid-story and immediate embodiment keep it from moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Failure as growth engine: rigid guardianship must become vulnerable partnership. Theme is dramatized, not stated; the ending’s quiet hush offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: the futility of reducing human feeling to formula. The final image—torn ambiguous broadsheet—reweights the entire quest, offering a resonant, non-moral answer that lingers in the reader’s own emotional turbulence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the shepherd’s spontaneous songs and Elias’s lighter gait: wonder is not preserved but propagated, each brief encounter seeding myth that outlives memory; no moral is stated, only enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of interconnection emerges organically through the prism’s reversal: what she sought to prove in the world she must first accept in herself. Subtext of forgiveness is carried by the frost’s softening arms, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of preservation-through-loss emerges organically: the only way to “keep” the brother is to destroy the record of their shared past. Subtext operates in the bead’s fossilized sap—memory locked by death—and in the orchard’s rot feeding new growth. No single character articulates the thesis; the final image of the empty loom radiates the reconfiguration without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges from accumulated cost: each weft adds cosmic burden; final realization reframes mentor’s exile and Elara’s mapping ethics. Resonant without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: isolation answered by anonymous solidarity, safety bottled in fragile glass and words. The sea glass and letters reweight each other at the end, refracting the same ache without moralizing. Subtext hums in every silence and spiral of stones.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges entirely through image-shift: shadows move from destructive relics to life-giving rain, re-weighting “ancient” into fertile ground for post-print rebirth. No explicit thesis; final “cycle turned, steered by reflections unseen” offers open, resonant reconfiguration. Herald’s laughter-as-thunder motif returns charged with self-extinction, satisfying 9+ gate. Only hairline slip: “poison of forgotten headlines” veers toward editorial nudge.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of courageous visibility emerges through light/scale imagery rather than statement. The donor-heart metaphor invites dual authorship, lending complexity. Final image avoids moralizing but skirts sentimental convenience—“iridescent caution” is thematic branding delivered twice, slightly blunting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of quantified sorrow and celestial witness emerges through concrete objects and actions rather than statement; the final image of “constellations of resilience” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of communal memory as binding light emerges through image, not statement. The woven dawns shift from lost artifact to living tapestry, reconfiguring meaning at the close. Subtext in spectral figures drawn by melody avoids moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thematic question of compassion hidden in solitude lands via quiet act of returning invitation transformed—reweights prior isolation with elegiac cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s acts: holiness in the overlooked. The bread’s return as communion and the green shoots amid ruin offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of memory-versus-oblivion emerges from the lantern’s dying light and Elara’s refusal to let it lapse; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of “enduring light” reweights earlier frost imagery without moralizing. Subtextual hint that her own life-force fuels the vows lingers but remains under-played. Complexity is present yet could risk a touch more ambiguity for top band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of fragile trust among outlaws emerges through action, not lecture. The “sound of trust breaking” motif is seeded early and reprised at the flare’s hiss, though the conceptual cost could resonate deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of cosmic entanglement versus human skepticism emerges through image and taste, not statement; the final reconfiguration offers quiet resonance without moralizing, letting ambiguity linger.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the interplay of memory and creation: the same faculty that torments Elias becomes the instrument of rebirth. The jester painting and the cave’s light accrue meaning without overt statement. Final image—charcoal dancing in crystal glow—offers a non-literal answer: creation transmutes sorrow into beauty. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of micro-truths as civic water emerges through action, not thesis: wilting leaves, crystalline confessions, final vow to irrigate souls. No moralizing—final image lets recovered farmer’s plea stand as resonant reconfiguration. Subtext in Kael’s jealous stance and browned edges implies larger corruption without speechifying. One soft echo: “small moments” iterated twice near end.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: wonder as endangered spectrum re-ignited through engineered awe. Subtext traffics in light/color metaphors for authenticity, culminating in a resonant final image without sermonizing. Some symbolic language (“truths would dull,” “gray monotony”) edges toward overt statement but stops short of final-paragraph thesis-spelling.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of fragmented wholeness emerges from Elias’s literal fragmentation and reassembly of memory. No moralizing; resonance arises from the cooled box’s ember glowing like a rose node. Final image reweights prior motifs without statement.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the concrete release of letters rather than assertion; the final image of neighbors reading yellowed confessions offers a non-literal answer to “listening heals.” Subtext lives in Harlan’s gravelly pause and the bakery heir’s half-said feud—gesture carries what remains unsaid. No late moralizing; the locket’s inscription merely echoes without sermon. Complexity is present: healing is communal, not sentimental, and Eliza’s own loss stays unredeemed.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: encryption of grief into power, the alchemy of vulnerability. The final image—sisters ascending in light—reweights the lab from prison to birthplace without moralizing. Subtext in the dice’s runes and the dance’s silence lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from Elias’s choice to bear the cost of memory rather than forget; no tidy moralizing. The wildflowers’ return as proof that deletion is not erasure offers a quiet, resonant closure without platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges from repeated hush of prophecy—silence as constructive act, not stated moral. Subtext in ritual gestures, not exposition. Ending reframes prior whispered secrets as potential cosmos-altering power now neutralized. Avoids tidy lesson; complexity preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of “listening to the living past” emerges through concrete objects (seal, cornerstone) and embodied rituals (tea, wax). Subtext operates in Thorne’s silences and Elara’s growing recognition that the building’s grief is also theirs. Final image of the sigil pressed under meteors offers non-literal answer: language is covenant, not translation. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the iterative act of archiving: isolation alchemized into self-containment without external validation. The shell's emptied silence and dawn-bright garden reweight the opening motif of quarantined voices, offering a non-literal answer—solidarity through solitary transformation. No moral is stated; the image carries the conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers: independence may itself be a quarantine, but the text does not force the reading.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the tension between treason and forgiveness: the empire’s rot mirrored in the lover’s betrayal, both excised by the same scalpel of ink and blood. The rose thorn and key reprise with reweighted meaning—pain becomes tool, lock becomes metaphor. No moral is stated; the final image of Elara walking into true night offers quiet resonance. The story trusts the reader to feel the cost without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of chosen silence versus exploited resonance emerges through the shell’s disclosures and the final hushed voice, avoiding explicit moralizing. the reed-blown melancholy motif threads without overt symbolism, and the ending’s quiet re-toning reweights prior song-images with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme crystallizes through recurring cameos of gentleness amid ruin, culminating in the single snowflake that embodies reclaimed innocence. No character moralizes; the final image reweights the premise without declaring a thesis. The concept of “windows of connection” keeps theme anchored to concrete mechanics rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of unseen labor emerges organically through mesh-mends and tea-leaf voyages; no final moralizing paragraph. The reweighting is subtle—nets and soul alike are “mended” by attention—yet the concept remains a single-note meditation rather than a question that deepens. Subtext stays in image (knots = constellations = lives), avoiding abstractions. Lacks a counter-argument or cost that would complicate the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Myth vs. engineered sanctuary emerges organically through the reassembled documents; no character lectures us. Final image of the “flawed” crystal reweights the premise—salvation was always there, hoarded by fear—leaving an aftertaste of squandered hope without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: the peril of wielding forgotten lore to reorder loyalty. Subtext lives in the radio’s static—whispers of “elders call the end” hint at cyclical hubris. Final image of dawn refracted through broken cobalt offers ambiguous resonance: renewal or ruin, left unsettled.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of salvaged memory emerges organically through the jar images and the lullaby callback; no editorial throat-clearing required. Final line’s “bridging what the dunes had buried” offers a charged, non-moral reprise. Could climb higher if the cost to Elias were more than atmospheric, but the emergent pattern is solid and untendentious.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of harmony-through-vulnerability emerges via the flesh-ethereal pulse of the relic and Elias’s skin-warm key; no moral is stated. The final prismatic halo refracts earlier gold sunset, reweighting beauty as guardianship burden—an earned echo. Yet the concept of “sonic absolution” remains more poetic label than lived epiphany; the story leans on lyric recurrence rather than a single crystallized image that redefines the rule-set. Ambiguity is coherent, but the thematic aftereffect is gentle rather than haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from action: patience as revolutionary force. Subtext in moonlit silence and magnetic pull avoids moralizing. Final reconfiguration—lake cracking—offers quiet, non-literal answer: change begins imperceptibly yet inevitably.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges from historical enslavement vs modern cover-up parallels; lantern’s reprise reweights “freedom” as ongoing vigilance against invisible control.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of “second opinions on worth” emerges through the heart’s revival rather than sermon; Thorne’s single-word line “Deserve” crystallizes it without moralizing. Harlan’s lullaby and the daughter never seen again reprice the abstract word “deserve” into lived consequence. Final sun-shaft image offers non-literal answer: redemption is mechanical yet fragile, never proclaimed. No final-paragraph thesis statement; avoids echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of yearning as emergent property of mechanism is woven through image and action; the unheard bell offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of preservation versus corporate erasure emerges from concrete events rather than lecture; the closing image of archiving the patch quietly reprices the value of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from pattern: salvage of broken things (lace tip, Kai’s wife, floe refugees) revalued rather than discarded. Final image reframes “endings” as communal transition, not private exit—no moralizing statement needed. Ambiguity lingers: did she really hear it, or join the living chorus? Resonant without tidy thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of “mismatched destinies” emerges organically through parallel stories and vine metaphor rather than declaration. Subtext operates in gesture: passing the charred edge is tacit admission of unfinished grief. Final image reweights the burned letter from wound to wisdom, achieving quiet Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing; however, the insight is familiar—points deducted for lack of surprising moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—memory’s fragility and the duty to anchor wisdom—emerges from ritual action, not statement. Final image reweights the opening “whisperfield calm” into a charged stillness that “carried a new timbre,” a conceptual repricing earned by the rite. No moralizing line intrudes. The half-mask honesty motif threads through but does not flip meaning; hence short of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as communal mending, not moralizing. The lavender’s reclamation of the factory embodies the subtext that beauty can metabolize ruin. Final image of petals on photographs offers non-literal resonance without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: language’s resilience outlives its containers. Subtext coils in the crystal’s refusal to repeat the same echo twice. Final image—scholar shelving the crystal among tomes—reweights the entire archive from mausoleum to nursery. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of preservative nostalgia emerges from material acts—arrow smudged, tape whirring—never essays. Final image reconfigures earlier tidal metaphors: the “tide’s endless longing” is now a finite loop on a spool, conceptually repricing the ocean into a handheld object. Subtle counter-reading lingers: by bottling age he also petrifies it, letting ambiguity breathe. One soft spot: “sound of growing older” is named more often than varied in phrasing, nibbling at resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Harnessing the ephemeral becomes both aesthetic wonder and existential debt; the theme resonates through the clock’s blur-to-tick and the probe’s vanishing streak, giving texture to transience without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges implicitly: mundane moments re-stitched into sacred farewell. Subtext lives in the vinyl fragment’s reweighted meaning and the scent of hope reconfiguring regret. The final image—mother and daughter over the shard—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge as repair of a bent world, loops as responsibility. Subtext stays in gesture (silent key withdrawal at dawn). Final image avoids moralising, though the cosmic-restoration thesis edges close to prompt-echo—kept just ambiguous enough.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the tension between nostalgic garden play and the hard knowledge of changeling theft. The final forgiveness image reframes the central question—turning illusion into a constellation—without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through recurrent glass-light imagery: stillness that magnifies rather than consumes. Mother’s “light doesn’t need to burn” refrain is the only near-epiphany, but it is dramatized via the final beachside showing, not sermonizing. Subtext of trauma (fire) versus generosity (reflection) lingers without tidy moral. Final image reweights prior isolation into communal wonder, meeting the non-literal answer test.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of reclamation through shared fragility emerges organically from image and gesture; the amber’s shift from wound to bridge is resonant. Subtext is strong, though the “honeyed hush” concept edges toward label.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of salvaging abandoned hopes emerges entirely through image-chain (wildflower, rope, loom, kite) rather than thesis. Final seal reframes earlier “incomplete spirals” into permanent archive—earned reweighting. No final-paragraph moralizing; resonance stays imagistic. Ambiguity lingers: is preservation rescue or imprisonment? Complexity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of cultural memory versus innovation emerges through the loom’s fusion of tech and vine, never sermonized. The final image of dawn-lit carvings rewakens ancestral gratitude without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will next generations maintain the songs? The reweighting satisfies complexity, though the absence of counter-argument keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—grief as terra incognita that can be mapped only by enduring it—emerges through image, not aphorism. The final map-pulse reframes every prior discard (nail, bottle, leaf) as coordinate points, a conceptual repricing that reweights loss as topography. No moralizing sentence intrudes; resonance lingers in the silent orchard exhalation. A fraction withheld because the heartbeat motif never acquires ironic counter-meaning, keeping complexity just shy of full 9.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges as the cost of preserving awe inside rational cages: the cavern’s sigh endorses yet mourns the act. Subtext resides in mirror-play—peripheral glints stand for overlooked grief—so the final image reweights earlier “reflection” without moralizing. No thesis lines intrude; one faint echo of pseudo-profundity (“store wonder in the cellar of reason”) is uttered once and immediately dramatized, escaping penalty. Ambiguity lingers: will bottled echoes heal or merely haunt?

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges from iterative burden-gathering: endless loops vs finite choice. Subtext in silence where grief calcifies avoids moralizing. Final image (weighted belt) reweights premise—acceptance of infinity’s cost—without tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—“loss as material to be shaped, not absolved”—emerges through image rather than declaration; the ash wood’s burn-rate quietly mirrors grief’s slow smoke. Final image answers the core question wordlessly: peace is not discovered but carved, stroke by stroke. No moralizing, just reweighted meaning. One felicitous line (“harvest it, or it harvests you”) flirts with echo but is earned by scene particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: memory as mosaic, regret as raw material. Subtext in the ticket-stub’s whisper and the gear’s hiss reframes ambition as communal residue. Final image of ghostly nod offers non-literal absolution without moralizing. No thematic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of renewal-through-precise-attention emerges organically from Elara’s engineering ethos; the sextant’s obsolete star charts quietly reprise as “equations for hope.” Subtext avoids sermon, ending on an image that reweights the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elias’s core conflict—reconciling abandoned dream—drives the climax and exacts visible cost (placing the blank clock face among crystals as relic), though the external stakes are muted to internal stakes, limiting escalation grandeur.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: journals of deceit mirror Elias’s own layered self-lies. Final image of the silent sundial recharges the motif of “fleeting, directional truth” without moralizing. Subtext operates in the gap between salvage triumph and quiet renunciation. No thematic drift or sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: memory’s fragility versus the will to endure. The rope’s knots and fulgurite’s lightning scar embody the same paradox—fragile vessels for eternal fire. Final image of Elias walking into white silence offers non-literal answer: preservation demands disappearance. No moralizing; resonance is carried by snow, glass, and retreating fog.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: absence as a living geography, loss as texture for renewal. The final image of the frayed thread reweights the motif without moralizing. Subtext is carried in gesture—the silent fall of leaves, the coiling thread—never stated.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of organic fragility and mechanical sterility; no explicit moralizing. The egg’s iridescent shell reframes every prior fragment as relics of a lost genesis. Subtext pulses in silence—the still mechanical birds versus the living yolk. Final image offers a non-literal answer: nurture the impossible seed inside the machine’s heart.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of redemptive song emerges through images—scar cambium, coin chord, kelp-drift hush—never sermonized. Final “song has begun” is understated CR that reweights all prior fire imagery. Subtext in wanderer’s touch to his cheek lets silence carry shared pain. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in whether the graft will truly take, yet emotional after-effect resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars: skepticism tested by literal memory-flow, patience rewarded by cosmic timing. Final image reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext is gesture (glow, crack) rather than assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Generational recursion theme emerges concretely via gear engravings, petal fractals, and foresight pings—no thesis statements. Closure image (kinforms whispering, sigh persisting) reweights prior material with conceptual cost: enlightenment shared yet loop intact. Ambiguity remains—sharing might still matter even if pattern holds—inviting reflection without moralizing. One hairline slip: “light without fire” almost editorializes, but phrasing is character-bound and early, dodging final-paragraph sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the accumulating pattern of ribbons, poems, and butterflies rather than statement; the ending’s communal gravestone offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how grief can be both shared and beautiful. No moralizing intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of absolution emerges through the rake’s salt-etched splinters, not pronouncement. The final image—tower bell at dawn sounding “a promise rather than a dirge”—reweights every prior toll without moralizing. Only the phrase “restore that shared balance” flirts with Echo; it is brief and embedded in action, so the slip is fractional.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of intentions as fluid echoes emerges through artifact and imagery rather than statement, yet no new angle is added to familiar gothic motifs. The closing reweighting (tapestry = unresolved duel) gives slight lift.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme crystallizes via the kingfisher quill image: foresight as cold, precise inscription, not magical prophecy; the silence before ink touches page reframes ignorance as creative material, achieving resonance without moralizing, though theme is stated once in prompt-echo that slightly blunts subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of narrative resurrection via humble debris emerges through image (dust motes, ember breath) rather than assertion; no final moralizing. Subtext operates in the double life of the scores—publicly legitimate, covertly seditious. The thistled-calm motif modulates from decorative to charged when dust stirred by that “calm” begins to speak. Ambiguity remains: we do not know if the orchestras will dare to play the hidden tales, letting the theme linger without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the repeated shattering of vessels—vase, photo, memory—without explicit statement. The mirage of safety is interrogated through material fragility; the final image of the mask on the stilled chair offers a non-literal answer: permanence through deliberate fracture. Subtext operates in silence and ash, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of competing temporalities (celestial rhythm vs. engineered control) emerges organically through the cog and the journal; the final image of Elias etching “quiet defiance” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: harmony as subtraction, not addition. The zither’s rosette reframes from ornament to amplifier of vanishing arts, offering a quiet conceptual repricing without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from action: reclamation of discarded stories through literal grafting of memory into soil. Subtext operates in the silence after each pruning snip—what is severed cannot be reattached. Final image of communal greenhouse resists tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in who will ultimately control the fruit. Resonance is earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of wonder versus utility emerges inductively from bee-pollination metaphor and Elias’s toll-booth theatrics, avoiding overt thesis. Final image of “nectar dusk sweetening the air” reweights the tower’s drones as both miracle and vulnerability. Riddle’s hive/queen rhetoric invites reflection on civic cooperation without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: is wonder worth the fragility? Not yet resonantly charged.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges via tactile ritual: memory fixed by scent, life fixed by arrangement—no thesis states it. The orris shard’s reprise on the mantel reweights "hollow shell" into "quiet blaze," inviting reflection on impermanence without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—will other houses call?—and complexity is honored.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: the cost of trading infinity for one authentic sensation. The perpetual-motion conceit reframes regret as physics; the dice embody chance and consequence without sermon. Final image reweights the entire ascent—no moral stated, only the hum of gears and the warmth of almost-touch. A sliver more ambiguity could deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges via accreted mini-acts of compassion encoded in lost scripts; no overt thesis stated. Final whispered line reweights prior vignettes without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—did the woman below truly recall?—inviting reflection. Lost-language motif shifts from preservation to invocation, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of cultural continuity versus entropy crystallizes through recurrent ice/image opposition without authorial thesis. Final image—loaves rising beneath dripping vault—reweights the dread into fragile hope, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration. Subtextual irony: the very relic meant to “preserve” hastens decay, yet forces rebirth. Avoids overt moral; one abstract clause “history thawed, but not yet lost” nicks full 9.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the inverted clocks and final reversed beam: defiance reconfigures time yet cannot purge its shadow. No moralizing—bleak exhilaration stays implicit in “every step beyond fate echoed with the sea’s mournful sigh.” Ambiguity lingers: did hunger lift or merely shift? Reconfiguration of stone’s scars into vessel of light supplies non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of revelation vs. silence emerges through the clasp-mirror system without moralizing; final image reweights earlier “grotesque parodies” into liberation. Ambiguity remains—was advisor psyche or specter—inviting reflection, but epiphany leans slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: adversity as raw material for art. No explicit moralizing; the final image of buoyant, chiming orchard reweights prior struggle without statement. Subtext lives in the shift from “restless euphony” to “serene crescendo,” a conceptual repricing of chaos into harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of interlaced absence emerges through concrete acts—mortar mixed with memories—rather than exposition. Final image of dreams entombed in fresh stone offers non-literal answer: preservation equals burial. Subtext whispers that commemoration may perpetuate loss rather than redeem it, a complexity earned by the story’s own method. No platitudes or final-paragraph thesis statements intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from archival method: history as sediment that can be deliberately sunk. Subtext operates in the stamp—once a tool of authority, now a weapon against it. Final spiral image reweights all prior “dappled” light motifs as hidden-depth clues rather than decorative ambience. No moralizing sentence closes the piece; the re-indexing imperative is left ominously open.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from recurrent image set—light caged, paper freed, shadow excised— culminating in the non-literal answer that grief must be shaped but can never be dispelled. No explicit thesis; final image of spiraling island and ascending cranes reweights earlier lantern imagery without moralizing. Subtext rests in gestures: the tremor of callused hands confesses more than any interior monologue. Ambiguity lingers—will the cranes return?—yet stakes feel definitively re-priced.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of “unused potential” into weaponized grief; no explicit moralizing. The geode’s shift from wedding shard to targeting crystal reconfigures meaning without statement. Final image—survivor ascending to hunt the hunters—offers resonant, non-literal answer to loss. Ambiguity lingers: renewal or further ruin?

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of belonging emerges via star-map fragments and chip letterpress metaphor; final hum avoids explicit moral. Subtext in “interstices between stars” reweights solitude into connection. No motif recurrence beyond chip/constellation; could deepen with earlier planted image returning. Ends with earned wonder, not statement.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the inverse equation: forged histories for clients, a single withheld truth for his child. The driftwood “family tree” knot becomes a concrete image for entangled deceit. Final image of the watch-hand in pocket reconfigures time as something he can no longer stop. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity remains—confession may wound, yet silence already has.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom threads through brass pull and moon-phase protocol, but final Lira line edges into explicit thesis (“recycled more than mistakes tonight—perhaps even our enmity”). Emergent resonance is strong yet slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of charting by heart emerges organically from the compass’s mechanical betrayal and the shift from sky to power-line beacons; no overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of the birthday ritual: instead of marking growth, Elara retroactively redeems eroded years. The saucer’s crack shifting from symbol of rupture to conduit of mending supplies a resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext remains in gesture—ink bleeding like the fracture—rather than exposition. A trace of sentimentality in “garden of reclaimed moments” keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of transformation emerges from the tactile friction between grit and gift; no explicit statement. Subtext resides in the silent exchange between released light and arriving villagers.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of quiet invention vs. iron tyranny emerges through concrete imagery: half-painted sundial = incomplete imperial time, cradle-sparks = ideas awaiting ignition. No character sermonizes; meaning accrues via action and object. Final “wink in hush” reconfigures prior sentinel duty into conspiratorial creation without moral tagline. Subtext in glances, shadows, and shared spark-fire invites multiple readings—hope, complicity, risk—while resisting tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of pattern versus chaos emerges through concrete ritual and charged aurora image; no moralizing, only resonant reconfiguration of “promise” from sorrow to beacon.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from geometry of fate—questions bent into destinations—without authorial intrusion; final image of fencers debating beside the refracting atrium crystallizes the motif of dignified chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    “Beauty from chaos” emerges via concrete acts—scrap verses, rebuilt shelves, whispered readings—never sermonized. The moon-fracture/light motif returns in the closing “luminous fracture of his soul,” reweighting earlier imagery without moralizing. Complexity is thin: no counter-argument that beauty might invite punishment, so theme feels one-note. Subtext operates mainly in image rather than character tension, yielding solid but not arresting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges as the alchemy of loss into art: time broken is time remade. Subtext operates in the flickering compasses and spinning clock—symbols of direction reclaimed. Final image (bridge between was and might yet be) offers non-literal answer without moralizing. No motif is ornamental; each recurrence constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from the accretion of bloom/seed/ridge imagery: memory must be repeatedly cultivated, not stored. The final circling dance offers a non-literal answer—embodied repetition is the only insurance against erosion—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in Elara’s half-smile, inviting counter-readings about whether ritual can truly outrun monsoon entropy.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the specific color yielded by salt, light, and thread: remorse must be materialized before it can be relinquished. Subtext resides in the ghost-ship compass—an echo of voyages that never return—so the final homeward twist reweights earlier maritime loss. No thesis is stated; the cerulean stain is the non-literal answer. The only drag is the near-literal echo of “cerulean regret” in opening and close, slightly thinning ambiguity.
