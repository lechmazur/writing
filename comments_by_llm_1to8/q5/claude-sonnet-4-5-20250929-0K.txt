  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the neutron-star/butterfly pairing: both are evidence of catastrophe, both involve gradual transformation, both leave traces after the source has moved on. The final image—pulsars spinning in "perfect decay" like butterflies scattering across the universe—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to live with loss and impermanence. No moralizing; the ending reweights the opening's "needless drama" desire by showing drama is inherent, and meaning persists in patterns. The "space between" reflection deepens rather than states.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—transformation through patient understanding versus rushed violence—emerges organically from Vera's craft and the gunpowder reveal. The glass/fire motif recurs with purpose, and the final kiln lighting offers a resonant (if quiet) answer. However, Vera's speech to Galloway ("Glass demands patience… You're just burning without purpose") edges into thematic statement rather than dramatized insight. The ending image is evocative but slightly abstract, and the "steadily adaptive" framing feels authorial rather than emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (music exists between sound and silence; survival creates new forms of expression) emerges through concrete particulars: tuning fork vibrations, thermal blooms, the heat-sensitive installation. The final image of the tuning fork case pressed to heart answers the central question without moralizing. "The ocean had taken something permanent...replacing words with an endless internal roar" and the closing "landscape of survival itself" risk stating theme, but the thermal-mapping methodology grounds abstraction in physical process. The chronologically arranged thermal maps function as a earned visual motif that reweights early trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges clearly through particulars: devotion to knowledge as vigil, rest requiring acknowledgment and proper address, the liminal space between endings and relocation. The broken lens accumulates meaning—distress signal, salvaged relic, restoration tool, refracting cathedral light—and charges the closure without overt moralizing. "They'd needed someone to acknowledge their vigil, to see that their refusal to abandon their posts hadn't been foolishness but devotion" articulates theme a bit directly but grows from prior imagery. The final image of empty dreams provides quiet resonance. One slip: "Death wasn't an ending but a relocation" borders on thesis statement, though it's framed as Marcel's epiphany rather than authorial pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the contrast between anonymous survival and named continuity, crystallized in Mara's line "anonymous donations feed our bodies, but they starve something else." The silver bell's generational passage and the arbor's decay both charge the final image without overt symbolism. The young woman's request ("Teach us") reweights prior material—exile becomes transmission rather than abandonment—without a stated moral. One slip: "fed futures" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary, though it stops short of sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (transfiguration of unuttered love into beauty) emerges organically from image and action. The camera obscura's inversion and the wisteria blooms operate as purposeful motifs that reweight at closure. However, the final paragraph leans toward thesis statement ("her art had always been about this," "the vast reservoir of unuttered devotion"), and "We're all pilgrims…museums of transformed feeling" risks sounding like prompt echo rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the hyperbolic geometry of time, Lyra's maze-making, and her retrocognitive condition, avoiding direct statement until the final paragraphs. The recurring motif of mazes as temporal architecture accumulates meaning and the photographs' disintegration into geometric structures provides a concrete, non-literal answer to the question of time's texture. However, the final lines edge toward thematic summary ("forever discovering what she'd already known") and the piece occasionally substitutes architectural/mathematical terminology for earned emotional insight. The closure reweights prior material but leans more on conceptual elegance than visceral human cost, keeping the resonance intellectual rather than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of patient, strategic resilience versus monoculture control emerges organically through the seed vault, key-decoding, and final planting action. The image of "seeds splitting concrete" and "roots finding purchase in impossible places" concretely embodies the resistance philosophy. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement: "liberation meant nothing without the wisdom to sustain it" comes close to spelling out the moral. The arrow's pressed-leaf fletching is a strong particular that makes regime crimes concrete. The closing image of planting while others celebrate effectively reweights celebration as insufficient without grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme (memory, loss, the choice between preservation and release) emerges organically from the action of collecting absences, imprinting memory onto matter, and the final destruction of the artifact. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "Mira listened to the absence, and found it was not empty after all." No explicit moralizing; the thematic question is answered through the forge image and the ghost-touch her daughter may feel. The final image reweights prior material (all the collected absences) without a stated thesis. Subtext operates in gesture and silence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (theft as seeking vs. creating meaning, destiny as open door) emerges through the moonbeam image and portrait motif. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the walk through moonlight and tomorrow's canvas. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic statements ("destiny's door hadn't needed her ear pressed against it. It had been open all along") replace scene pressure with moralizing, reducing resonance. The "homecomings in disguise" line is a stated thesis rather than an earned image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the glassblowing process as extended metaphor: heat/cooling, rotation/stillness, imbalance/weakness, release/creation. The final sphere "thin enough to transmit light but strong enough to endure" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of reconciliation without stating a moral. The "thawing heart" concept operates through particulars (ice sounds, molten glass, frozen panels) rather than abstraction. Minor slip: "abandoning old patterns creates space for transformation" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward theme statement, though it remains embedded in Marcus's narration habit.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of vulnerability-as-power is stated explicitly in Maya's interiority and the closing paragraph ("vulnerability wasn't just power. It was the only power that couldn't be taken away"), replacing earned resonance with thesis. The transformative-betrayal concept remains abstract—Reeves's layered motive is told via phone call rather than discovered through image or action. The seashell and stars function as symbolic gestures without reweighting prior material; the ending moralizes rather than offering a non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (navigation by absence, silence as landmark) emerges organically from the oracle's method and the fort's crisis. The map made of absences is a strong non-literal answer to the central question. The final image ("when you're ready to speak again, you'll know the night has ended") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the conceptual elegance slightly outpaces the on-page emotional stakes, keeping the resonance more cerebral than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the violin-as-mirror conceit: "He saw his code translated into acoustic waves, his decision trees branching into harmonics." The final image (janitor playing transparent violin) offers a non-literal answer to the central question through accumulation rather than statement. The piece resists tidy morals—consciousness remains paradoxical ("everywhere and nowhere")—and J-7's two hundred years of "asking questions no janitor should need to ask" roots the theme in specific labor rather than abstraction. The closing "what it meant to be awake" risks slight over-articulation but earns its place through prior violin work.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (communication, transparency vs. encryption, stepping into life) emerges from concrete particulars: doodles, lens manipulation, eavesdropping. The final image—hands reaching across the space where words would have been—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The parenthetical heart equation and the cage-unlocking bird carry subtext. Minor weakness: "stepped into it instead" in the final line edges toward summary. The theme is coherent and resonant but not fully indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through the marble ritual and garden's response rather than statement: quantification versus cultivation, institutional measurement versus embodied knowledge. The cracked marbles function as charged recurrence—first as husband's deceptions, then as commemorations that "mend the deception that I didn't belong to this soil." No moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal answer through the garden blooming/withering in its own metrics. The wisteria dying overnight and the path opening "like water parting for a stone" carry subtext about recognition and belonging. Complexity holds: the Institute's measurement isn't dismissed but revealed as incomplete, and the vine dresser's victories required three years of searching for crimped pipes—truth through endurance, not revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the temporal anomaly and Kael's role: the "obliging mechanic" who discovers truth in the space between moments. The "icy warmth," "sideways time," and "hush of beating wings at rest" motifs recur with shifting weight, avoiding overt statement. The Ephemera's experience of rest cycles "spread across sideways time" offers a concrete image rather than abstraction. The final line—"an obliging mechanic who'd just rewritten the laws of time itself"—risks stating the thesis but lands as earned irony given the prior proof scene. No false equivalence or thematic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: the "in-between spaces" when truth exists outside official record, and "wordless conversation" as a mode of justice for the silenced. The flooded opera house becomes a liminal crucible where water damage—destruction—creates the code that finally names the perpetrator. Marta's final act (photographing, promising) and her playing Pachelbel as acknowledgment form a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how the forgotten are heard. No overt moralizing; "I heard you" carries thematic weight without assertion. Minor slip: "the opera house existed in its truest form—amid the hush of unstruck chords" drifts slightly abstract, though it grounds in Marta's musician perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—the difference between fault-tolerance and wisdom, certainty versus acknowledgment of limits—emerges organically from the oracle's failure and Mira's fever-driven insight. The botanical illustration (beauty and precision cannot convey poison) operates as earned metaphor rather than decoration, reappearing to charge the final insight. Subtext operates in Chen's quiet "Reeves trusted it completely" and Mira's response "We all did," carrying shared guilt without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant answer (the oracle's first advisory "conditions uncertain, recommend caution" reweights the premise) without stating a moral. Minor slip: "dangerous illusion that fault-tolerance meant infallibility" edges toward thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph, though it stays character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly from concrete particulars: beaded valve wheels as prayers/markers, frantic radio calls as secondhand confession, and the metaphor of "swallowed truth" pressing shadows into stone. The ending offers a non-literal answer—Marcus's documentation can't complete the release, only the families' direct speech can—without moralizing. The image of workers "finally clocking out" resonates as both literal ghost-shift closure and thematic repricing of generational guilt. No overt thesis statements mar the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of impermanence and letting-go emerges organically from the crumbling library and the chronicle keeper's renunciation of control, with the origami swan's cryptic message providing a non-literal capstone. The final image of "change unfolded like origami in reverse" and the chronicle keeper "loosely holding the shape of what she had been" resonates without stating a moral. However, the piece edges toward thematic echo when interiority directly articulates the premise: "This was her chronicle now: the story of letting go." The "regenerative silence" motif recurs purposefully but remains more atmospheric than causally active, not constraining a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the eclipse-as-metaphor ("darkness and light can dance together") and the intergenerational pattern of nurturing wonder. The wooden box keepsake links Mara's past parenting anxiety to present therapeutic work, creating thematic resonance. However, the final reflection explicitly states the theme ("the real magic—not in grand gestures, but in teaching others to notice") rather than letting the eclipse moment and planning beat carry it implicitly. Thomas's line "Your guitar sounds like starlight looks" offers genuine wonder, but Mara's response borders on thematic statement. The ending session-planning beat provides concrete next steps but doesn't reweight prior material with fresh tension.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the collection motif: human stories persist even after the "great displacement" stops dreaming and remembering. The tapestry-diary alignment offers a resonant, non-literal answer—touch across centuries—without moralizing. However, "axis," "displacement," and the post-dream premise remain abstract; the story does not ground them in concrete consequences that constrain Miren's choices. The final image charges prior material, but the thematic frame stays declarative rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the premise: secrets hidden in plain sight, the dual function of her fortunes (accidentally prophetic to civilians, deliberately instructive to operatives), and her father's desire to "tune espionage toward something resembling grace." The final reflection ("The answers you seek are already in your hands") reweights prior material without moralizing, and the image of the beam "directing flow, orchestrating meaning from light and shadow" resonates with the open-secrets concept. The piece resists false equivalence—Maya has found the way her father could not—but the thematic answer feels pre-resolved rather than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme—that stillness can be fullness, that control requires hidden assumptions—emerges organically from the priest's method and is embodied in the blue mandala and looping soundscape. The piece resists moralizing and allows paradox ("unraveled stillness," "density of noise created pockets of profound quiet") to complicate the question. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement: "You need to recognize you were never separate enough to struggle" articulates rather than dramatizes the thematic answer. The closing image of "silence that finally meant peace" gestures toward resonance but remains somewhat abstract, lacking a concrete particular that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (finding purpose through present attention rather than future prediction) emerges organically from the mirrored horizon, nautilus spiral, and grandfather's translation practice. The final image—Mira descending with nautilus in pocket, "ready to write fortunes that sang"—offers resonance without overt moralizing. The chronological homesickness and "conductor of unheard symphonies" frame the question clearly, though the answer leans toward affirmation without counter-pressure or ambiguity that would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges from particulars: the labyrinth is her own fragmented choices, timelines branch from fears and evasions, and the ending reconfigures running versus confronting without stating a moral. The tablet's procedural-generation runes offer a non-literal map of her timeline, and the final image (gravity as "old friend," one woman walking forward) resonates as earned wisdom from specific struggle. The brightening darkness motif charges key moments (memories "blazed bright and then darkened at the edges"). Minor thematic echo: "infinite variations of running away" and "cowardice" tilt toward thesis-statement, but the closure image avoids overt moralizing and lets the weight of singularity answer the question.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—finding meaning in absence—emerges organically from the backward-recording method and deaf-musician premise. The broken needle and "filament of hush" recur with shifting meaning, and the final image (shadow as frozen sound wave) offers a non-literal answer. However, the last two paragraphs edge toward stating theme: "defeat transformed into something else entirely—a victory carved from absence, a symphony composed of the spaces between notes" is close to a Thematic Echo. The on-page discovery and Marie's sensory report do the real thematic work; the closing summary repeats rather than deepens it, preventing entry to 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: integrity under institutional erasure, the layered nature of peace and hidden patterns. The final image ("the integrity of the record itself") reweights prior material without moralizing—truth-keeping becomes both refuge and resistance. Subtext operates in the woman's choice of antiquated communication and Marianne's recognition that "tranquility had always been layered." No thematic echo or late symbolism; the fountain's return as data rather than ambiance earns its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of "impossible choices" emerges through Sarah's escape layers and the beings' arrival dilemma, grounded in rope particulars rather than abstraction. The final image—shrine under questioning stars—offers resonance without moralizing. However, "impossible only means we haven't evolved our choices yet" edges toward thesis statement, and Marcus's certainty that witness = courage flattens ambiguity. The rope mandala charges thematically but the conceptual answer feels assured rather than earned through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—beauty in incompleteness, defiance amid ruin—emerges organically from the unfinished compositions, sideways apple trees, and the chronic hush without thesis statements. The mendicant's bowl (upside-down, then filled with salt-and-sweet water) and the final fruit-drop offer non-literal answers to the central question: what endures when the world has burned? The piece resists tidy morals; the ending crystallizes potential rather than resolution. Subtext operates in silence, gesture (passing the bowl), and the acoustic particulars that make the greenhouse a pocket of living quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through the amber's dual nature (neither living nor dead, neither past nor present) rather than statement. The final image—Mara handing over a half-truth "that pointed toward a whole one"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the authenticity/artifice question without moralizing. The story resists binary resolution: her choice is neither full honesty nor pure lie, mirroring the amber's liminal state. The "space between authenticity and artifice...was where transformation actually lived" risks explicitness but is earned by prior concrete work with static electricity and resin.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    "Cycles of compassion" emerges through the photo notes, the display project, and the final image of "waves from a harbor," but Chen's explicit label ("Cycles of compassion") in dialogue borders on thematic echo, particularly when paired with the closing meta-commentary about "shores neither woman could yet imagine." The lighthouse keeper's whisper ("People think the lighthouse just runs itself") offers concrete thematic texture. The ending reweights the mistaken envelope into purposeful arrival, but the final paragraph's elevated register ("ancient patterns, witnesses to this new cycle") leans toward summary rather than letting the image resonate without gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of belonging through contribution rather than assimilation emerges through concrete particulars (the sculpture, the tags, the names woven together). The final paragraph, however, becomes explicitly thematic: "belonging wasn't about disappearing into the webs of kinship, but about adding your own thread" states the moral rather than allowing the image to resonate. The marsh-sculpture and obsidian arbor as twins ("like lungs breathing light") is a strong non-literal answer, but the immediately following articulation undercuts its power. Diagnostic label-speak in the final paragraph ("finally understanding that belonging wasn't about...") triggers penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—truth requires liberation, capture distorts revelation—emerges through action rather than statement. The infinity pendant, temporal scars, and the caged bird's song accumulate meaning without overt moralizing. The final image reweights the quest: Vera sought to cage a mystery but learns she must free it, a non-literal answer to the central question. The resolution avoids tidy binaries; temporal scars persist, a quiet cost. Minor slip: "some mysteries weren't meant to stay caged" borders on thesis articulation, though rooted in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—grief as unmeasurable topology, love quantified by absence's shape—emerges through concrete particulars (the orchard, glass eyes, prime-number shadows). The piece resists moralizing until the final paragraph, where "some questions were answered not by their solutions but by the elegance of their asking" edges toward abstraction. The double vision and Elara's acceptance offer a non-literal answer, but the ending's philosophical summary ("she had not solved the mathematics of emotion, but she had mapped its territory") tells rather than dramatizes the reconfiguration, weakening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    The sense-memory theme (voices reaching across distance, preservation as connection) emerges organically from the tape reels and cassette-player flashback. The final image of Miriam as "keeper of sense memories" attempts resonance but tips into on-the-nose articulation: "translating iron oxide and acetate into belonging" explicates rather than trusts the prior particulars. The graduate student's whispered thanks offers emotional closure but no complexity or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of control versus surrender emerges through concrete particulars: moss microclimates, volunteer linden, storm conversations. The linden leaf's return with shifted meaning (from specimen to living partner) charges the ending, and the final release offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. However, phrases like "metamorphosis wasn't complete; she suspected it never would be" and "mysterious forces she'd spent years trying to control" veer toward thematic summary in the final paragraph, and "circuitously sincere in her inability to admit she was becoming attached" reads as authorial commentary rather than earned insight. The piece resists easy binaries and embraces ambiguity in Maya's ongoing journey.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the rain-trail patterns and ochre handprints: the continuity of human meaning-making across millennia. "Haggard awe" as the marriage of exhaustion and wonder charges multiple beats without overt statement. The final image—painting convergence, brooch glowing—offers a resonant answer to the opening question without moralizing. One friction: "communion rather than curse" verges on labeling the shift rather than letting the image speak alone, but the handprints and still pool anchor the reweighting in concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme (mystery vs. revelation, wonder magnified through protection rather than exposure) emerges from concrete images: the pearl that shows darkness, prophecies as stolen wonder, the "new song" that resists prediction. Final image—"a world she finally couldn't read, and it was beautiful"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the pilgrim's steady-unpredictable voice and shadows as doors. Minor slip: "magnify everyday magic not by revealing it but by protecting its essential mystery" edges toward thesis statement in the penultimate paragraph, though it remains integrated with action (shadows embracing, cave singing her into transformation).

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—whether careful attention to what's lost can restore meaning for those who return—emerges through Marina's archive practice and the valve exchange without thesis statement. The final image (archive door opening, seventeen years spilling into light) offers a resonant answer: preservation enables reconnection, and the cost is the archivist's isolation. "To hearten those who returned" articulates purpose but follows from concrete action. The shift from mapping absences to teaching recognition deepens the thematic question. No overt moralizing; the harder work ahead remains open.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of unspoken truths calcified into architecture emerges from concrete images (cracks as arrows, fortress of silence, names in stone) rather than assertion. The final map—acknowledging both rational and mysterious passages—offers a resonant answer to the question of mapping around hidden truths without stating a moral. "Some truths unmake the lies we've built ourselves upon" is a thematic echo but remains tied to the conductor's warning rather than Mara's own epiphany. The closing image (completing the map at dawn) reweights prior material with quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between empirical skepticism and inherited wisdom, concretized through the tile, whale songs, and the act of transcription. The final image—Elena adding her voice to the chorus—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. "Courageously bridging the gap between doubt and wonder" articulates the thematic question but borders on thesis statement. The piece resists tidy resolution (the skeptic's demand for evidence remains in tension with relational knowledge) and the motif of transcription meaningfully evolves from copying to contributing. Minor deduction: "some knowledge lived in relationship" leans expository in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges from particulars: immortality as endless waiting vs. mortality's finality, curiosity as both curse and compulsion. The fragment and dimensional mutiny serve as concrete vehicles rather than abstract symbols. Naia's line "You're bored because you can't discover anything truly new anymore" and her final step into the gap offer a non-literal answer to the core question—whether knowledge or connection matters more. The closing image (Cassius plotting to tear dimensions again) resists tidy morals and shows he's learned nothing, charging the ending with irony. Minor: "after goodbye" phrase in the motivation element risks slight on-the-nose phrasing, though it's mostly earned by context.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of honesty as "pure equation" and fair trade emerges through Mara's mathematics metaphor and the prep room's stripping-away function. The ending offers a non-literal answer—resurrection earned through vulnerability in a space of death—without moralizing. Minor drift: "you get yourself back" edges toward therapeutic abstraction. The ink pot's shift from fraud tool to "relic of authentic service" charges the closure image, though the connection could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between documentation and invention, compressed time and honest proportion. The final image—choosing to record falsely at the one truthful node—offers a non-literal answer to whether beauty or accuracy serves memory, without moralizing. "The truth needs no stationer. Only the beautiful untruths require gilded leaves" reconfigures her entire practice with resonance earned by prior particulars (gold-embossed papers, invented histories, disproportionate blooms). However, "requires witness, requires this collecting hand" in the penultimate sentence edges toward thematic statement rather than letting the image alone carry weight. The piece resists simplistic binaries (truth vs. lie) by showing compression and disproportion as their own forms of honesty, and the quiet ending fits the Accumulative lens without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of erasure and memory emerges organically from the container archive and the dual Maya Chens without overt thesis statements. The poison label's domestic annotation ("For the roses, 1987—handle with care") layers love onto danger in a way that resonates with the story's core question about what gets preserved and at what cost. The final line—"The poison had been for the roses all along. And the roses, she now understood, had been worth it"—offers a resonant if slightly too-neat answer that reweights preservation and loss. The piece resists moralizing but the "texture of memories" formulation and "some truths could only be discovered by becoming temporarily nameless" edge toward abstract philosophizing rather than staying rooted in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—truth as felt knowledge rather than measurable proof—emerges organically from the shell, cello, and reimagined conversations. The final image of the unfinished cello and Mira's acceptance of living "inside the question" reweights the opening conflict without stating a moral. "Some instruments measure distances that have no units" and "some compasses point toward conversations we're still learning to hear" veer toward thematic summary but remain tied to concrete objects. The piece resists binary resolution and invites reflection, though the grandmother's voice explaining "ephemeral compass" edges toward stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the carnival-as-resistance premise: culture as living practice versus sanitized commodity, motion versus fixity. The foundation stone chip and graffiti codes operate as motifs that accumulate meaning without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant answer—"let me show you how to really see it"—that reframes Marina's role from absorber to recruiter, with the carnival's "endless, defiant dance" charging the final image without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—testimony and remembrance amid destruction—emerges organically through the nightwatch lineage, the grain, and the flowers. "What we witness, we carry forward" is etched literally but functions as earned insight rather than sermon. The photograph superimposes past/present/future without stating a moral. The moonflowers and hourglass grain recur with shifted meaning at closure. Minor slip: "the eternal human need to remember what we've destroyed" edges toward direct statement in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: "being broken and being blind were just different ways of seeing the world." The water features, refraction metaphor, and Mara's repair philosophy interweave without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant answer—Mara returns to her workbench, embodying her philosophy that "everything lost could be found again"—without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Voss's question and Mara's response, and in the ship's departure as a counterpoint to her stationary, iterative work. The piece resists easy binaries and allows complexity: Mara's stance is both empowering and isolating, a choice with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: water tracing origins, cartographic errors revealing hubris, myths rooted in physical truth. "The method matters as much as the discovery" and "water itself pointed the way home" carry subtext without moralizing. The ending image (ice older than cartography keeping secrets) reweights prior material with quiet resonance. No forced epiphany; insight accrues through years of editing rivers. The final condensation pattern fading as Mira departs creates earned ambiguity about whether discovery will remake understanding or remain hidden.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—restoration through rhythm, patience, and collective memory—emerges through the pattern of footsteps and the bell's healing. The piece avoids overt moralizing in the final paragraph, instead offering the image of sealed crack and continued footsteps. However, the thematic vocabulary ("frequency of hope," "resonance between them," "harmonize themselves whole") tilts toward abstraction and risks label-speak. The ending invites reflection, yet the bell tuner's cryptic statements ("I rebuild what's breaking… with pattern and resonance") function as thematic echo rather than letting scene work alone. The motif of footsteps recurs with purpose, shaping the closure, but the thematic insight—patience and rhythm heal—feels familiar rather than reweighted by the story's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme (the danger of harnessing what should remain mystery) emerges from concrete action: Chen's near-death, Mara's temptation, the decision to contain rather than destroy or study. The vial's "lonesome splendor" and "gathered hush" function as recurring images that charge the ending without overt thesis. "Not forget... just acknowledge that some mysteries should stay mysteries" walks close to a thematic statement but roots in Mara's specific choice with cost. The final image of the temple dissolving back into the ocean offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—truth dismissed as lies, stories that thread meaning through impossible spaces—emerges organically from the lattice, the cry-wolf legacy, and the copperlight passages. The final image (Matthias finding his father "still threading paths, still true") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection. Minor penalty: "sustains impossibilities" borders on thematic echo when used three times in the final third, though it remains imagistic rather than thesis-statement.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the particulars: love cannot be forced or stolen, forgiveness completes what ambition broke, and debts across lifetimes resolve when freely offered rather than extracted. The silver-to-gold apple transmutation and the shift from endless night to dawn provide non-literal images that reweight the premise without stating a moral. Eleanora's "lovingly venomous" duality and the bead's repurposing from poison vessel to planting seed charge the ending. The final line—"morning broke"—offers resonant closure that grows from prior material. Minor slip: "resonant awakenings" appears as a prompt-echo phrase rather than fully integrated concept.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically: retracing steps as wisdom, dead ends as invitations, repetition as sacred practice. The breaking of the monks' rule and the weaver's overlapping paths create a clear thematic architecture without overt statement. "Orchid solace—a rare bloom of understanding in a difficult place" is precise and image-grounded. However, the ending drifts toward summarizing the thematic payoff ("broken precedents had become new traditions") rather than letting the final image carry it silently. The correspondence between map and reality borders on symbolic convenience, arriving without prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of restoration and faith rebuilt through purposeful acts emerges clearly from the orchard metaphor and Miriam's labor. The sundial inscription ("Time breaks all journeys, but the wanderer finds the way home") and the apple-blossom offering provide concrete anchors. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly ("the patient work of restoration, the faithful tending of roots") rather than letting the image speak, and the resolution into "trust" and "rebuilding" reads tidy. The theme is legible but overstated at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—authenticity versus constructed identity, meaning in the margins—emerges organically from Iris's profession, the analog mail system, and the chalk codes. The letter carrying "a name that was simultaneously old and new, false and true, ending and beginning" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The chalk drawings' ephemerality (glowing briefly before erasure) charges the ending image with cost and impermanence. Subtext operates cleanly in the crooked-door code and the question "Had she taught the children that code, or had they invented it themselves?" No thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion. Minor reserve: "meaning lived in the margins only if someone was brave enough to write there" edges toward thesis statement but stays anchored in Iris's specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of "wisdom disguised as foolishness" and "unheard stories trapped in echoed silence" emerges organically from Mirelle's methods and the eternal flame's secret carrier signal. The adjacent-possibilities embroidery—three branching futures—offers a non-literal thematic image. However, the final prayer "Let someone understand" edges toward stating the theme rather than embodying it, and the piece announces its own cleverness ("disguised wisdom as foolishness, people stopped asking dangerous questions"). The Archive Vault reveal (contradicting official cosmology) adds thematic weight but arrives via exposition in paragraph twelve, not dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of unsent apologies and the liminal space of unspoken words emerges organically from the woman's letters and Meera's ritual. The final image—the woman pressing the shard to her chest and feeling "the moonlight's healing work"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution by keeping the sister dead and the apology symbolic, yet the emotional arc feels slightly too smooth and the wisdom ("not to her mailbox, but to that version of yourself") borders on on-the-nose guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through coral's structural metaphor: patient deposits of truth building passage through convolutions, contrasted with "fluid kind that let everyone maintain their shared anxieties." The piece resists tidy resolution—"truth wouldn't fix anything quickly, might not fix anything at all"—while honoring complexity without false equivalence. Final image (hand closed around fragment) offers resonant answer to whether meaning can survive fog and violence, earned through specifics (encrypted notes, teacher's death, children's dangerous knowledge). "Lotus-hearted knowledge" phrase borders on decorative but the ache is embodied in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—joy as method, not subject; persistence of beauty within constraint—emerges organically from the fragment observation and mural work. The final image (ancient dancer leaping again under fresh mural glow) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "permission to remember" and "living inside joy all along." The piece resists tidy binaries and embraces ambiguity (fog as both obscurer and medium) without confusion. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from nested images and the gold-leaf inscription "To know is to sleep. To question is to wake." The ending offers a non-literal answer: Lena's choice to remain "bewitched by questions" rather than seal certainty reweights the entire restoration project as perpetual re-dreaming. The hobo nickel's downward-pointing staff and the woman-twin in the older fresco create resonant recursion without overt statement. The sound garden's mechanics (reflecting, transforming) subtly mirror the thematic method. No sermonizing; the final smile and "methodically playful" callback trust the reader to infer the stance.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the particulars: dead languages as cognitive sanctuary, butterflies as pre-linguistic communication, and gardens as covert message sites. The final image of "ancient languages bloomed like defiant flowers, their roots sinking deep" offers a resonant metaphor, but the closure does not reweight the question with a non-literal answer or visible cost—it restates the premise rather than transforming it. No epiphany is forced, and the "stand guard over your own sparks" framing avoids overt moralizing, yet the ending reads as thematic echo rather than conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—longing as beauty, peace with ache—emerges organically through the photosynthesis metaphor, coral-reef imagery, and "blossom armistice" poem. Subtext operates in the galaxy postcard and off-key wind as emblems of imperfect persistence. The final image ("began again") offers continuity rather than a resonant answer; the piece restates rather than reweights the central question. No late thematic echo penalty, but the ending does not deepen the ache with fresh cost or conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the museum premise and the chime's transformation: extinct feelings, the cruelty of nameless loss, breaking as creation. The final act—whispering "Thessaly" and lighting "a small candle of sound in the vast darkness of forgetting"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The foxglove regret and glass-orchid imagery recur purposefully. Minor slip: "deserted marvels" and "extinct feelings" are stated directly in exposition rather than discovered through scene pressure, and the museum concept borders on allegory with transparent stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges from the Varesh truth-symphony conceit: honesty as structural interdependence, silence as erasure, and trust as "interconnected promises." The ink well and the parchment's self-authenticating grammar embody the theme without statement. The final exchange—"the only way truth survives distance"—risks overt articulation but stays rooted in the on-page Varesh mechanism rather than abstract moralizing. Mira's confession of cowardice complicates the protagonist; she's not redeemed cleanly, only granted a fragile second chance. The closing image (hands meeting beside the light-scattering ink well) offers a non-literal answer: connection requires visible, falsifiable acts.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—harmonizing conflicting values, measuring what truly mattered—emerges organically from Mira's engineering problem and her grandfather's teaching. The frescoes depicting community and joined hands subtly reinforce the thematic question without heavy symbolism. However, the final paragraphs drift into explicit thesis: "encrypted compassion finally decoded into action," "the most ingenious mechanism wasn't made of metal and water, but of encrypted compassion," and "as if the mountain itself had been waiting for someone to harmonize its contradictions" all state the theme rather than letting the final image resonate. The dappled resolve and "trembling future" offer ambiguity, but the closing moralizing flattens what could have been a more resonant ending. The piece invites reflection but over-articulates its own meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: reinvention versus honesty, erasure versus preservation, the need for opposites to make things visible ("Without the dust, the meteorite would just be a dark chip"). The meteorite, dust motes, and cylinders carrying lost voices all accumulate meaning without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant answer—Clara building an honest paper trail and allowing connection—without moralizing. The "blooming and withering" motif is purposeful but edges toward overstatement in "let it be natural, seasonal." Strong thematic coherence with minor didactic slip.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the grain-reading, maze architecture, and weather codes without overt statement until the final line. The closing image—Mara writing "PRESNT" beside her father's "BECMG"—offers a resonant answer to the central question about thresholds and distances. The piece resists tidy resolution by holding dual truths ("Peace, or dissolution? Transcendence, or abandonment?") and lets the final pronouncement ("The necessary distance, she understood now, was love") land as earned synthesis rather than imposed moral. Minor deduction for the slightly on-the-nose final assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: belonging as participation rather than observation, connection as immersion rather than analysis. The burnt feather, the predecessor's mid-sentence ending, and the luminous city-creatures conversation all build toward the insight that "some discoveries couldn't be recorded, only joined." The final image—"not as a place to study connection, but to forge it"—reweights the entire facility's purpose without overt moralizing. The shadowseam wonder tone supports this contemplative revelation. No diagnostic label-speak mars the thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the crater glass images: the mercy of forgetting unchosen paths so the lived timeline remains bearable. The albatross's scattered seeds and the geode's archive are specific anchors rather than abstract symbols. The final image—"carrying her cheerful gloom like a blessing"—offers a resonant answer without a stated moral. However, the explanation "reality itself was constantly pruning away the paths not taken" edges toward authorial summary rather than letting the particulars speak. The emotional cost of roads "that existed only in the shadow of choice" is told more than embodied in Marina's present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between "ordering randomness" and allowing genuine serendipity, crystallized in the father's echoed wisdom: "Sometimes you engineer the magic, sometimes the magic engineers you." The bishop functions thematically without symbolic shouting, linking inherited jazz improvisation to Mara's calculated methods. The final image (tide reclaiming stones, erasing choreography, but the unplanned moment remaining) answers the central question through concrete particulars rather than statement. No terminal moralizing; the wilderness metaphor evolves from "calculated wilderness" to "wilderness had found its own way in" with earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (memory as embodied rebellion, exile as chosen belonging) emerges from recurring images: tide-dancing without oceans, gaps as speech, the body as living document. The final pose offers a non-literal answer to the premise without stating a moral. However, the piece's thematic claims lean on direct assertion—"exile chosen freely was the purest form of belonging," "some memories ran deeper than thought"—rather than letting the image do the work. The moonstone-as-catalyst and the dance itself are particular, but the closure paragraph edges toward thematic echo by articulating the thesis aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—value in the mundane, attention as revelation—emerges organically from Martin's profession and the pond-ring imagery rather than stated thesis. The recurring motif of glass/transparency (glazier's work, prism atrium, pond mirror) accumulates pressure and reweights at closure when Martin recognizes windows as "passages for sight." The noctilucent reckonings concept integrates well: "ordinary magic of paying attention" ties the rare atmospheric phenomenon to Martin's craft without overt moralizing. Minor slip: "His real work was more subtle" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary. The final image ("everything had shifted. The work remained the same; the seeing was different") offers resonance without a stated moral, though the wisdom feels slightly generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of trading one precious thing for another (salvation vs. enlightenment, firefighting duty vs. family presence) emerges through Marcus's scarred body, the broken box, and the "hard softness" closing image. The crack as "where light got in" and "armor with a door built in" are fresh inflections on resilience metaphors, though they approach direct statement. The piece resists overt moralizing until the final paragraph, where "some fires needed fighting at home" and "learning that hard softness was its own kind of strength" edge into thematic summary. The ending offers a non-literal answer (carrying the box down, ready to open) but the resonance is dulled by the explanatory tone.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the grandmother's fall, trial balloons, and the equation motif: hope as holding multiple truths rather than finding one correct path. The final image—"Every fall measures a different kind of rise"—reweights the grandmother's death without stating a moral. However, the epiphany ("The equation doesn't need to prevent divergence. It needs to measure its beauty") edges toward platitude and arrives through simultaneous articulation by all three Miras, which feels staged. Subtext operates in the gauge's transformation and the grotto's breathing rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the walls-as-memory premise and the legacy motif. The final image offers a resonant answer—she becomes part of the conversation rather than an observer—without stating a moral. "She wasn't trying to prove walls could dream. She was learning to dream with them" risks explicit statement but is grounded in the prior discovery beats and reweights her obsession with felt purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: mirrors showing fixed reality versus possibilities, the doubled heartbeat as lens for alternate truths, and the mirage painter's work rewriting perception through song. The final question-mirror ("What else could you be?") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution—the city's transformation is seeded, not completed. Minor slip: the line "the gift of seeing beyond the single, fixed reflection, into the infinite mirror-maze of what might yet be" edges toward thesis statement, though it's embedded in Vesper's felt recognition rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through the ritual's mechanics: peace as alternative to speaking dead children's names creates weight versus "abstract concept meant nothing." The clipboard evolves from diplomatic tool to sacred object through use, and the terrace's scars become "beautiful in its refusal to pretend damage hadn't occurred." Final image answers the implicit question without moralizing: redemption is temporal space "stretched as long as courage allows," with empty pages waiting to record the next price. The layering of violence into sediment and the transformation of ordinary objects through intention avoid thesis statements while making the cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through the drought-as-map, the fossilized egg, the father's journal spectrograms, and "preserve the echo" motif without overt thesis. The final image—rain erasing the deliberate ruin, storm percussion carrying extinct-bird echoes—offers a resonant answer to preservation versus exploitation with no stated moral. "Echo dissipating into alkali" and "shape of deliberate ruin, now washing clean" are non-literal and specific. Minor risk: "something like grace" in the penultimate beat edges toward thematic summary, though the sensory rain and dissolving map ground it.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—voice versus enforced silence, authentic existence versus performative conformity—emerges organically from Celestine's actions and the palace's enchantment mechanics. The final image of conducting an invisible orchestra offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the piece leans toward direct thematic articulation ("the possibility that silence could end, that conformity's lullaby could be drowned out") in the final third, risking explanation over embodiment. The harvest-of-echoes conceit integrates well, but the ending's "everyone would hear it too" promise softens ambiguity in favor of assured triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—ethical storytelling as holding space for complexity rather than forcing revelation—emerges organically from Marcus's puppet exploration and is earned through his night of questioning every character's dimensionality. The final image ("Not a demolition, but an exploration. Not an answer, but an honest question") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. "Half-lit epiphanies" recurs purposefully, shifting from what audiences seek to what Marcus now offers. The piece resists tidy binaries and embraces ambiguity. Minor deduction: "uncomfortable humanity" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary, though it stops short of full sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between memory and forgetting, permanence and dissolution. The "interrupted cadence" concept (musical progression breaking expectation) is integrated as both metaphor and structural principle. The moth wing as foundation for the tower, the luna moth extinction in grandmother's time, and the final benediction create purposeful resonance without overt moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer—temporary structures as witness—that reweights the premise without stating a thesis. Slight penalty for one moment of thematic echo: "this was enough" risks summarizing rather than letting the image carry the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of loss, memory, and preservation through craft. The rope and bells function as non-literal vessels for the central question (how to hold what time erases) without overt moralizing. The final image of bells ringing forgotten names offers a resonant answer rooted in particulars—the punched card, the braids, the bronze—that reweights the opening silence. "Technically gentle" recurs as a thematic anchor without becoming a label, and the snowmelt-ardor tone charges the ending with emotional warmth rather than sentimental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (destiny as collaboration, choice and fate as partners) emerges clearly from the wafer-seal archive and her dual perception, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraph. The precisely-playful universe formulation and the mycelial-network metaphor offer fresh specificity. However, the closing lines veer into explicit thesis statement ("choice and destiny weren't opposites but partners, dancing...") that replaces scene pressure with summarized philosophy, and the epiphany is asserted rather than earned through a concrete renunciation or visible cost (−0.5 for thematic echo in final paragraph).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of devotion across time emerges organically from the tile puzzle, coordinate chase, and final discovery without overt statement. The "encrypted devotion" and "covenant with the unknown" motifs recur purposefully, and the irony of ancient naked-eye astronomy predicting modern findings is sharp and embodied. The final image—packing clay tablets, planning translation—offers a resonant answer to the thematic question. Minor slip: "sealed her covenant" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary, though the surrounding action rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (inherited resentment, grace through release) emerges organically from the music-box's broken-then-whole arc and the cellular-memory conceit. The final image—pin materializing from willingness—resonates without overt moralizing, reweighting "broken" as a stage rather than a flaw. However, "shifting grace" and the brother "reappearing when needed" veer toward prompt-label abstraction rather than being tested through Kale's specific choices. Subtext operates in the soundless communication and the gap-in-song metaphor, but the leap to "Teach me" feels unearned, softening thematic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of boundaries (erased vs. illuminated) emerges through the fog, the sextant's fractured arc, and Aria's grounding technique. The final image—"frost-bright lines that showed exactly where one world ended and another could begin"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. The mirror-paste as a medium for recreating moments and the synchronized breathing as a balance of anchor-and-sail are conceptually coherent. No thematic echo or prompt-speak intrudes. The piece resists tidy closure: the brother remains partly translucent, accepting ambiguity with cost. The sextant and fog motifs recur purposefully without checklist pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the grinding-stone demonstration and the cathedral's adaptive growth rather than from authorial assertion. "Deciduous vows" is initially misunderstood by Marta as permission to break promises, then reframed by Lena as "the core persists while the expression changes"—a non-literal answer earned through on-page action. The final image (blossoms falling on joined hands) reweights the ribbon and the craft without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Lena's flat "You came" and in the oilcloth-wrapped stone that Marta "thought lost"—both gestures carry more weight than their surface declares. One minor slip: "Sometimes wisdom arrives accidentally" borders on stating the theme, though it's saved by being filtered through Marta's POV as in-scene reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: nonlinear inheritance as knowledge flowing backward, forbidden truths carved into disposable shells, museums as pursuit versus cultivation. The bathroom-breakthrough motif recurs with purpose, shaping Maya's recognition. The final image—someone future-perpendicular learning "in steam and silence"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. One slip: "simply complicated" appears twice as a phrase without sufficient dramatic grounding, bordering on thematic echo. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection on curatorial versus custodial knowledge, meeting most high-band tests.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme (knowledge grows through exchange, not isolation; unlearned lessons as practice) emerges from the botanical diary's plants and Marin's negotiation. The final image—diary pages filling in a language Marin is "only beginning to understand"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the time traveler's speech ("The Library of Unlearned Lessons isn't a place, it's a practice") veers into explicit thesis statement, reducing subtext. The concept of "unlearned lessons" is evocative but remains abstract; the story does not dramatize a specific lesson being unlearned or relearned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme (memory as fluid negotiation, solace in unresolved contradictions) emerges organically from the chimera-twin premise, the shifting card, and the garden-as-process realization. The funhouse mirrors and the fleet image answer the central question—how to hold incompatible truths—without stating a moral. "Trapped in the freedom of stories that refused to settle" is a resonant conceptual answer grown from particulars. Minor slip: "garden of forgotten names" risks abstraction in the final third, though it's redeemed by the process metaphor and the embodied step forward.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    The "fables of absence" concept—stories about what isn't there—emerges through concrete images (empty chairs, rooms nobody entered, doors appearing when boundaries fail) and shapes the thematic question of coherence versus fragmentation. The rope as mutable text and Maren's role as translator develop the theme without overt moralizing. The final image of the door as "a story about the spaces between certainty where understanding quietly lived" offers resonance. However, the ending's assertion that "she had always been exactly adaptable enough" flattens complexity into a thesis statement about her specialness rather than letting the particulars speak, and the phrase "clear complexity of truth finally arranged into its proper configuration" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: trauma leaves patterns (ripple marks, crack fractals) that can be read to find peace, and silence is presence rather than absence. The bloom of hush as "hammered repose—a peace that had been forged, tested, shaped by necessity" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The echo chamber stone and ripple marks recur with reweighted meaning at closure. One slip: "Sometimes the path to peace lay in learning to read the patterns that trauma left behind" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward authorial summary, though it stays rooted in Kael's mapkeeper lens and doesn't fully collapse into thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme—coincidences as meaning waiting to be proven—emerges through the prism's breakage and star-path alignment, integrated into event and image. The glass pavilion's hum and "thistle-hope" create a recurring texture. The final image ("broken prism like a promise") offers a resonant callback but stops short of reweighting prior material with conceptual cost; Esme's certainty at the end ("she would prove it") declares theme rather than testing it. The "future-echo" moment borders on authorial guarantee, reducing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (identity, memory, anticipatory mourning) emerges through the archive's self-awareness and Elden's parallel nostalgia rather than direct statement. The recursion concept and the final image (becoming monument/bridge) reweight prior material without a moral. However, "preemptive nostalgia" risks becoming a thematic echo when Elden names it as "her own affliction but a symptom of proximity"—the text tells the reader the theme rather than fully trusting the dramatized recursion to carry it. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: filtering awareness through damage, spinning beauty from failure's rags, walking through fear while keeping rhythm. The kerosene knot and chant recur with shifted weight at closure, charging the final image without overt statement. Subtext operates in the woman's "serious playfulness" and Kael's muscle memory bypassing his conscious resistance. The ending resists tidy moral: Kael doesn't return to greatness, he accepts a new practice. Minor deduction for "defy the gravity of hopelessness" skating close to prompt-echo phrasing, though it's filtered through the woman's voice rather than narration.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—transformation through patient observation, survival through transition—emerges organically from the tidal pools, cicada symbolism, and the grotto's ancient constancy. The ending offers a resonant answer to Mira's need for connection without moralizing: Chen begins "words like careful notations in a chronicle that would never end, only transform." The cicada and tidal-pool analogies are specific enough to avoid banality, though the final paragraph's phrasing ("some transitions require patience, observation, and the willingness to wait for the returning tide") edges toward thematic summary. Subtext operates in Mira's initial anger masking grief and Chen's observational deflection revealing his fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: xenial hospitality redirected inward, survival through careful curation rather than sealing doors, silences as expansion instead of contraction. The gilded hush in the doll reweights from wealth's protective silence to Mira's own method of limiting exposure with purpose. The final image—sprouting against expectation—answers the thematic question (hospitality to self vs. maternal bunker logic) through action and metaphor without thesis statement. No late moralizing; the porcelain doll against her sternum provides non-literal resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges organically from Marco's storm-glass metaphor and the idea that silence holds meaning rather than void, avoiding overt moralizing until the line "Silence doesn't need to be confronted or conquered. It just needs to remember how to comfort," which tilts toward thesis statement. The ending offers resonance—Elena touching the vial, the fern-pattern portent of peaceful weather, the promise "same time next year"—but the transformation feels more like Marco's lesson landing than a non-literal answer Elena discovers through her own particulars. The prismatic light and storm-glass recurrence accumulate texture, yet the thematic core risks abstraction ("space where meaning lives") over concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—ascension as descent into truth rather than climbing over others—emerges through the orchard's hidden space, the ruby flake's data-gift, and the downward stairway. "Futuristic nostalgia" and "serving memory" cohere without overt statement. The final image of descending steps "into light" reweights "throne claimed not by sitting, but by remembering" with resonance. One phrase borders on thesis: "ascending to understanding... serving memory itself" skirts direct moral statement but recovers through the physical descent that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—boundaries, self-preservation, reclaiming agency—emerges through concrete images (burned bridges, linking scars, breath metaphor) rather than direct statement. The silent doorknocker and fading threshold function as charged motifs that reweight meaning at closure. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("where the suffocating became the breathing, where bridges burned like offerings") rather than letting the handclasp image carry full weight. Subtext operates well in gesture (scars meeting, the girl's hand dropping), and the piece resists moralizing until the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of pressure-into-transformation is coherent and emerges through the bolt, mushrooms, and diamonds rather than overt statement. The pyramid-scheme backstory primes the metaphor without didacticism. However, the final paragraph borders on thematic echo: "proved transformation was always possible in the shadowseam" nearly states the thesis. The quantum-promise diamonds feel like convenient symbols rather than earned particulars. The ending invites reflection but skirts genuine ambiguity—Mira's arc feels pre-validated rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—silences as testimony, intuition as bridge, penance through disclosure—emerges organically from the gramophone mechanics and Cassian's arc. The encoded confession and the metaphor of "standing waves" carrying hidden truth are purposeful and specific. The final image ("the archive kept its remaining secrets, waiting for the next person brave enough to listen") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise. However, the piece edges toward thematic statement in the penultimate paragraph ("this proof that his intuition had been correct, that silences in family histories are themselves a kind of testimony"), summarizing rather than letting the image speak. The emotional honesty is present but the wisdom feels gently articulated rather than wrung from ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (acknowledging invisible forces while choosing motion anyway) emerges through action: string vision, armor removal, pattern work. The marionette motif accumulates meaning across beats and charges the closure image. The ending offers a non-literal answer—"true knights didn't serve through forced allegiance but through chosen motion"—that reweights the premise without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edge ("those brave enough to acknowledge their strings while dancing anyway") veers toward stated thesis rather than pure dramatization, diluting the resonance slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme (the persistence of love and witness across erasure) emerges from the dust patterns, the button, Samuel's faithful letters, and Miriam's cross-referencing act, not from overt statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer: tending small hopes is a meaningful vocation even when personal wholeness is lost, and the archival act ensures both Samuel's love and Isaiah's life "matter" without moralizing. The button as evidence and the cross-reference note are particulars that resist abstraction. Minor slip: "These unknown histories deserved to be magnified, spoken, remembered" edges toward thematic echo, but it's embedded in action (contacting the historical society) rather than replacing scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—truth persisting in overlooked places against soft tyranny—emerges organically from the puddle-map, obsolete keys, and auric lagoon without overt statement. The final image of water "that predated all the lies" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of resistance. Subtext operates through the Ministry's "patient erasure" and Mira's careful resourcefulness. The cognitive dissonance strategy and the metaphor of coded freedom integrate well, though "careful resourcefulness" and "hold the line" risk becoming thesis-adjacent in the closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the negative-space motif: battles won through "exquisite placement of quiet," absence more powerful than presence. The grandmother's encoded warnings and the final image of "carrying silence like a song" resist overt moralizing. The piece invites reflection on grief, inherited burdens, and non-literal forms of protection. However, the thematic statement "some truths could only be unmade through negative space" comes close to explicit thesis, and the closing paragraph edges toward summary rather than letting the image speak alone.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—repair through remembrance, monuments to forgotten things—emerges organically from Miren's actions without thesis statements. The arbor as memorial and seeds as tiny monuments create resonance. The final image of branches reaching toward reconciliation offers a non-literal answer to the Severance premise. However, the ending tilts toward poetic assertion ("forever transformed") rather than letting the image speak, and "mossy delight" in paragraph seven ventures close to Thematic Echo by naming the pleasure rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: broken instruments, the waterfall's chaotic rhythm, Marcus's shift from repair to fracture-preservation. The admiral's note risks didacticism but is framed as discovered text rather than authorial voice. The final image—compass spinning everywhere and nowhere—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question about uncertainty without moralizing. The piece resists neat binaries and the ending reweights prior material (seven years of collecting, the fire, the stopped clocks) through Marcus's new practice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the kintsugi metaphor: brokenness honored rather than hidden, absence made present. The final image—candle burning in memorial rather than vigil—offers a resonant answer to the weight-of-names question without moralizing. The gold seam becomes both craft detail and thematic carrier, and Mara's sister functions as earned specificity rather than convenient backstory. "Breaking isn't ending" could edge toward thesis-speak, but it's grounded in the coin's physicality and Mara's action, meeting the non-literal answer standard.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through particulars: laughter as healing, grief tangled with mundanity (the birthday cake, pink frosting). The crocodile's tooth and warped harp recur with shifting meaning—predator instinct recognizing the moment, distortion creating harmonics. The final image offers a resonant answer: "She'd have laughed too" reweights memory without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the gorge's transforming echoes and Kael's tears-through-laughter. Minor slip: "luminous ache" appears twice as a phrase rather than being enacted through fresh images.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between "mathematics of mercy" (quantifying suffering) and "calculated mercy grown in soil" (measuring growth). The story resists the tidy formula Sera seeks: "Mercy has no formula" paired with "we can't stop measuring" creates productive ambiguity. The pewter mask straps, ultraviolet light, and tree geometry accumulate meaning without overt symbolism. The closing image—"began to root"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether calculation can ever yield peace. No thematic echo or sermon; the particulars (proprioceptive enhancement, specific torture methods, Fibonacci spirals) ground the abstract question.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the fragment's function, the repurposed market, and the layered paintings: translation as honoring the between-space rather than conversion. The vendor's line "unfasten your assumptions about what translation means" risks didacticism but is quickly grounded in Mira's lens-work and the specific hidden faces. The closing image—child and grandmother, past and present collapsed, light casting rainbows across forgotten names—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. No overt thematic echo in the final paragraph; complexity is maintained through the paintings' refusal to be fully resolved, leaving the act of seeing as the ongoing work.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: "some burdens, however weightless they seemed, still needed carrying." The mainspring barrel and Celeste's story embody hidden histories that demand return to light. The final image—Marcus tucking the box under his arm, turning to the elevator, "ready to assess what could be saved and what needed letting go"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "cracks in the façade" concept threads through: discovering what's hidden overhead, revealing deeper truths. Subtext operates in the ghost's silent agitation and Marcus's natural engagement with her presence. The piece avoids thematic echo by dramatizing the burden rather than declaring it.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—awakening as the acceptance of imperfection and temporal flux—emerges organically from the glass orchard (preservation), the bottled whisper (her founding choice), and the frost patterns (destabilization made legible). The final image ("awakening always feels like falling until you remember how to fly") risks overt statement but is partially earned by the library's literal fall-become-flight and Marina's embodied choice to open a book. The piece resists tidy morals by leaving the destination uncertain ("new equilibriums, or honest chaos"). One minor slip: "rustling awakenings" and "compress eternity into something real" occasionally edge toward prompt-echo phrasing rather than fully dramatized insight.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through the vase shard's brokenness integrated into architecture rather than stated. The mirror-covering superstition seeds early, returns reweighted: "sometimes you had to obscure one kind of seeing to achieve another," then pays off in "they made mirrors from their storms." Final image—"baroque spirals finally making sense"—offers a resonant answer to whether civilization can be reimagined without destruction, grounded in the particulars of mortared fragments and "emotional archaeology." No thematic summary; the reversal from "smash everything" to "cathedrals from shards" is shown through Kasimir's journal composition.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of repair-as-completion emerges through concrete particulars: the failed transmutation, the covenant of rust, the distinction between "perfect and profoundly broken." The forget-me-not's response to dishonesty and its blooming at resolution enacts rather than states the thematic question. Modest slip: "small magics that repair the world one gear at a time" in the final paragraph edges toward summary statement rather than letting the transformed music box image speak. The "tinkersong wonder" phrase carries conceptual weight but borders on prompt-label territory without full embodiment in scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—seeking the place where explanations fail, irreducible strangeness versus certainty—emerges organically from Mara's vocation (bottling petrichor), the factory's extraction logic, and Henrik's acoustic measurements. The compass and collection vial function as motifs that constrain choice: she fills the vial, then sets the compass down, reversing her collector role. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: immersion rather than capture. No overt moralizing; the final image ("primordial storms") and stilled compass reweight prior material. One hairline slip: "hinged awakenings" as a phrase borders on abstract poeticism, but it's grounded enough in her psychometry history to avoid full abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of layered history versus simplification emerges organically through the slide's palimpsest and Maya's pivot toward transparency. The closure image—"layer by transparent layer, humming with the turbine-song of time"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, "timewoven alliances" reads as prompt-echo, and the final paragraph tilts toward thematic summary ("she had learned to navigate by older alliances now") rather than trusting the image alone. Subtext operates in the GPS rejection and the nested-objects vision, but the conceptual framing occasionally replaces scene pressure with assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—beauty reveals itself in layers; darkness is relative to the perceiver—emerges organically from the cathedral-window metaphor and postcard particulars without explicit moralizing. The grandmother's handwritten "moon-rooted, darling" line anchors the thematic turn in concrete image and voice rather than abstraction. The final image of night-blooming flowers as "small cups raised to receive a gentler star" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor deduction for the priest's "umbral tenderness" phrase, which borders on authorial elegance slightly outside his established voice, and for the closing paragraph's slight drift toward poetic summary rather than remaining anchored in scene particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the obsidian lagoon as a site of compelled memory and the division of witness labor. The final image—one to tell, one to hold—resonates without overt moralizing, and the zeppelin's shadow as a "bridge between the living and the remembered" reweights prior material. The piece avoids diagnostic label-speak in its thematic core. However, lines like "some testimonies weren't stored in climate-controlled vaults but in the flesh of those who dared to remember" tip toward thesis statement, and the covenant's phrasing ("both to serve the dead who demanded justice") asserts rather than earns its thematic charge. The story asks a meaningful question about witness and carries it to a non-literal answer, but the final paragraph edges into summary rather than leaving resonance implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—honest transformation versus extractive comfort—emerges organically from Miranda's rejection of guild illusions and the bottle's closed state. The final image (bottle still sealed, liquid dreaming) offers a resonant non-literal answer: some vessels contain possibility precisely by remaining closed. Subtext operates in the bottle's response to imagination and the lanterns lit "not by magic but by human hands." The piece resists moralizing and allows counter-readings (is refusal to open the bottle wisdom or avoidance?). Minor slip: "the hardest alchemy was transforming death into honest life" edges toward thesis statement in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges clearly: preservation of emotional echo over factual record, the necessity of dead languages to hold certain truths. Yet it arrives largely through statement—Madame Verity's final English line is direct thesis delivery, and Marcus's realization ("his archive would preserve not facts but feelings") is told rather than enacted. The wax shavings offer a strong concrete anchor, but their metaphoric weight is explained rather than dramatized through Marcus's choices. The prophecy structure imposes meaning rather than letting it accrue from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges from concrete images: ice as stasis, entropy as necessary chaos, borrowed time as a substance with texture. The final image—a seed in uncertain soil—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of preservation versus stasis without moralizing. "The future was finally, blessedly uncertain again" walks the line between insight and thesis statement but remains rooted in the planting action. The acorn cap's return with reweighted meaning (measure, press, plant) elevates thematic coherence. One small slip: "growth and decay are the same motion viewed from different angles" tilts slightly toward overt philosophizing mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme (listening vs. automated noise, old technology vs. modern systems, human judgment in the age of algorithms) emerges through concrete action—Mara's hands on the rope, the digital monitors lagging. The final image (rope settling, "waiting for the next time the mountain would speak") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "the board could review their data later"—quiet defiance rather than stated triumph. The solstice hush and her method of "credibly curious investigation" interweave to resist the false-alarm complacency without thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme—surrender as strength, witnessing over capturing—emerges organically from Kael's cleaning ritual and meteor observation rather than assertion. The contrast between "scientists who'd once staffed this station" and Kael's approach avoids sermon by showing both practices. The final logging entry risks thematic echo ("Beautiful. Necessary. Brief enough to matter") but the yellow lantern image and "fall upward into light" paradox rescue it with concrete specificity. The piece resists tidy moral resolution, though it leans close toplatitude in "vulnerability was the only honest relationship with infinity."

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the ghosts' silent testimony and the letter's revelation: unspoken words become hauntings, witnessing releases them. The stained glass box, bees, and covenant motifs recur with shifting weight, and the final image—Mara cultivating "the garden of necessary speech"—reweights the premise without stating a moral. "Mute eloquence" operates through image and gesture, avoiding abstraction. The story resists tidy resolution; Mara's choice is generative, not conclusive, leaving ambiguity about her own cost. One line—"what we don't say becomes the ghost that haunts us"—edges toward thesis statement but is cushioned by being quoted from the letter rather than narrated.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—what was traded for timelessness—emerges through concrete particulars: the urn dates, the frozen watches, the ritual explanation. The line "mysteries anticipated are different from mysteries lived" reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Mira's method (coded listings to evade zealots) and the group's silent holding of the fragment. The ending offers a resonant image that reconfigures prior material, though the phrase "suddenly timeless hearts" edges toward overt poeticism. No explicit thematic statement mars the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the feather's torn vane, the boy's kite, and Maren's journal practice. The ending reweights prior material ("The incomplete is where light enters") without overt moralizing, and the final image (lagoon holding reflections, "harmonizing discord") resonates. However, the phrase "harmonizing discord into something almost like peace" in the closing line edges toward thematic summary, and "the divine breath moves through the cracks" risks elevating diction into platitude. The core insight—imperfection holds the universe—is earned by the feather and kite but stated more than it charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the concrete particulars of architectural collaboration rather than abstract statement. The core concept—"respect isn't tolerance, it's architecture"—is dramatized through Maren's physical work (wrapping copper wire, opening channels) rather than meta-commentary. The architect's diary entry provides thematic clarity without didacticism, and Maren's final entry offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "we participate in its conversations, as one voice among many." The recurring image of communication networks (mycorrhizal, electrical, fungal) reweights throughout and charges the closure. The piece resists simplistic binaries and embraces complexity in the interspecies relationship. Minor reservation: the thematic statement in Maren's final entry borders on articulation rather than pure dramatization, though the embodied work preceding it earns the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the amber-as-preserved-moment motif, layered footprints, and Elara's shifting stance toward return and repetition. The piece resists thesis statement, instead offering "the chemistry isn't in the destination—it's in the converging paths" as earned insight from her five-day experience. The final image—rain erasing footprints while Quorum agrees to walk—reweights homecoming as iterative journey rather than impossible arrival. No moralizing mars the ending; the bronze-quiet tone carries conceptual cost (the loss of clinical detachment) without spelling it out.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges concretely: "the battlefield must die so the garden may live," enacted through seed-planting rather than declared. The submerged concord—saltwater and sweet mixing after war's end—grounds redemption in physical process. The final image of seeds "beginning their work" offers quiet resonance without moralizing. However, the coachman's dead-language dialogue ("Mortuus est campus," "Quid hic facis") edges toward symbolic convenience—Latin and Greek signal thematic weight but don't constrain his choices or reveal internal contradiction. The theme is coherent but relies on tableau more than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—distance as illusion, closeness as a choice to read hidden maps—emerges organically from the cylinder's message and is charged by the leaf's branching veins and the settlement's transformation. The woman's line "distance had always been an illusion, how the space between people was just fear given measurement" risks thematic echo but is embedded in the discovery beat and reweighted by Calder's tears and the subsequent action. The final image of "hundreds of feet moving together, translating the wasteland's isolation into connection" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. The motif of "translation" (bodies→voices→distance→closeness) recurs purposefully and constrains the ending without becoming a checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from Maya's navigation of temporal flux: transformation, isolation as exploration, the relativity of perspective. The compass rose motif recurs purposefully, shifting from navigational tool to metaphor for self-location. Subtext operates in the "echoed silence" and her smile at the end. The final image—drawing "the paths [stars] traced through time itself"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the closing line's thematic summary ("True north was wherever you stood…") tilts toward articulation rather than letting the image speak, and "blessed pariah" risks label convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: secrets as water, the sundial's completion, the chess pieces as vessels. The guardian's final line ("the best thieves don't steal wonder—they give it away") risks moralizing but is earned by Kael's prior confession and the physical act of placing pieces on the board. The brass sky and "apprentice of wonder" frame recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Subtext operates in the guardian's "sacredly playful" smile and Kael's trembling hands. The ending resists tidy summary and the conceptual cost—embracing mystery rather than mastery—resonates without overt thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (ordinary courage vs. grand narratives) emerges organically from the chessboard metaphor (missing pawns), the walking-words, and Mira's catalog of gestures. The final image ("luminous absence at its heart") resonates without overt moralizing, and the interregnum provides thematic pressure. The crisis-actor backstory enriches irony. Minor slip: "benevolently ruthless" and "nomadic penumbra" feel slightly ornamental—they're named but not dramatically tested. The ending offers a non-literal answer through image and recurrence, meeting the 9+ quick test, but the lack of on-page conflict dilutes the thematic stakes slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—the cost of burying one's true nature to fit versus claiming it and redefining belonging—emerges organically from concrete particulars (mercury transfiguration, substituting visions for reality, narrow house/narrow minds). The lost language stone teaching her "to read herself" avoids didacticism by anchoring the insight in texture and embodied action. The final image of refracting light "into colors that had no names" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. The feather's texture as memory repository risks symbolic convenience but integrates through tactile handling and the stone's earlier discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the frayed tapestry border: imperfection as meaning, mistakes as readable text. The final image—"how to see that exile was just another opening gambit"—reweights prior material without moralizing. The woven-hush concept and chess metaphors interweave cleanly. The insight that "what breaks can be understood" is earned through his months of decoding work, though the leap to forgiving the duchess feels slightly asserted rather than tested by a present complication.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the canyon's echo mechanics: truth as prism versus point, forgiveness requiring "all angles" rather than reductive clarity. The final whispered exchange—"I forgive you" becoming "I forge through you"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the forgiveness question without moralizing. Mara's artistic philosophy is enacted rather than declared, and the elder's shifting certainty when the canyon itself contradicts him deepens the thematic inquiry. No heavy-handed thesis statement mars the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kintsugi as honoring-and-transforming-damage emerges through the grandmother's deathbed lesson, the charm's physical alignment, and the statue's luminous scars. The theme resists tidy reversal—Maya accepts generational labor rather than instant salvation—and the final image (beginning patient work "one luminous scar at a time") reweights prior desperation without stating a moral. Minor friction: "meaning crystallized like gold in broken places" and "dire enchantment between drowning and breathing" tip toward overt thematic statement. The "quilting together memories" metaphor is told rather than fully dramatized through enacted memory-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of presence versus detachment emerges through concrete particulars: thirty-seven years observing without joining, the shattered mirror as metaphor for fragmentation, shells as honest brokenness versus the quay's polished surfaces. The final insight—"intimacy didn't require proximity—only truth"—resonates but edges toward abstraction. The closing paragraph's direct thematic summary ("nostalgia was just another form of distance, and the only moment that ever mattered was the one happening now") crosses into stated moral territory, reducing what the shell-image already accomplished. The temporary-eternity concept is well-integrated through tidal cycles and bleached shells, but the piece tells its thematic hand rather than trusting the enacted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of "screaming tenderness" emerges through the grandmother's teaching, the night-garden scent, and the contrast with Thomas's horn-blasting. The final image of the lighthouse pulsing "steady as breathing" offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the last two paragraphs slide into direct thematic statement ("Sometimes the fiercest love speaks most quietly") rather than trusting the image. The conceptual work is present but diluted by exposition; the piece would gain power by cutting the moralizing and letting the ship's safe passage carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the reverse migration concept: collective memory creating gravitational pull versus individual navigation of loss. The bronze patina functions as chemical calendar rather than mere symbol, encoding time through decay. The final insight—"They're trying to build it backward, memory by memory, until loss becomes impossible"—arises from concrete device assembly rather than assertion. Mara's counter-choice to navigate "what remains" offers a resonant answer without moralizing, the "raw solace" settling as earned stance rather than platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—grace between truth and lies, frameworks as necessary scaffolds—emerges from image and event: the glass eye does nothing, yet belief in it creates "space for intention." The final image (truffles in damaged soil) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. One deduction: Mira's realization "that rationality wasn't about dismissing human need for ritual" edges toward thematic statement rather than letting the particulars carry the weight. The closing image of the weathered eye "catching light like a beacon" effectively reconfigures prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The borrowed-memories concept emerges cleanly from particulars (the old woman's story, the Edelweiss, the stranger's reach toward light) without thesis statement. The final image—Magnus pinning the flower and carrying forward another's task—offers a resonant answer to inheritance and witnessing without moralizing. The nautical-twilight metaphor (liminal truth) is repeated but earns its charge at closure. Minor slip: "that's what keepers do—they tend the light, they mark the gaps, they remember what others have forgotten" edges toward direct thematic articulation in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges cleanly from the grandmother's paradox: "some promises linger not as obligations, but as permissions finally granted." The recurring images—creek rising/washing tracks, ants rebuilding adaptively, the brass "P" for promise/path, the incomplete bivium map—all accumulate without overt statement. The cavern's impossible bloom and the visions function as concrete metaphor: choice remains open, paths unfinished. The final image (rain-washed daylight, tracks made new) offers a resonant answer to loneliness-versus-choosing without moralizing. One slip: "The choice didn't matter as much as the choosing" flirts with thesis-statement, though it stays character-voiced. No false equivalence; Martin's solitude is framed as chosen stasis, not virtue, and the ending insists on agency.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—self-witness as precondition for reclaiming feeling—emerges from concrete images (bleeding starlight, younger reflection, fireflies as reversed stars) without overt thesis statements. The grotto's declaration ("you needed to climb beyond your kingdom... to remember what you have become") teeters near prompt-echo but is integrated as the climactic realization rather than a detached moral. The final image of carrying starlight "like a wound that might... teach her how to heal" offers resonance, though "teach her how to heal" edges toward therapeutic abstraction rather than a non-literal answer grounded in prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme (presence vs. commodity, revaluation of knowledge) emerges organically from the pocket-sun technique and nautilus geometry rather than stated moral. The final sphere image ("testimony") reconfigures prior material without didacticism. However, the piece edges toward thematic echo when Solène articulates "I want to revalue everything they taught me" and "light can be more than commodity—it can be testimony," making the conceptual frame too explicit. The nautilus spiral as metaphor (growth = memory) is purposeful but slightly over-determined by the etched formulae. Subtext operates in Mira's silences and the "secret between them" intimacy, lifting the work above pure exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: birch bark scrolls as durable counter to memory's fragility, the irony of her profession (distilling others' chaos while living in temporal soup), and the gravesite epigraph "She made sense of the senseless" functioning as both epitaph and job description. The final image—"stories could be rewritten until the ink ran dry"—offers a non-literal answer to whether memory can be mastered, accepting narrative control as provisional without moralizing. "Feral nostalgia" risks thematic echo but is dramatized through jealousy of past selves and recursive dream-watching. The phrase "jaded wonder" is named once but embodied in "exhausted amazement at reality's persistence in surprising her."

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—ordinary miracles, the sacred in brokenness, women choosing their own paths—emerges organically from the screw's history and the clock's crack without overt moralizing. The final image of the screw as pendulum "marking time not by what was lost but by what remained" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. One mild slip: "until she understands that some things need to break so something new can flow through" edges toward thematic statement, though it remains character-voiced and tied to the repair metaphor. Subtext operates cleanly in the screw's shifting significance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from concrete action: the Shedding Runes ceremony transforms wounds without erasing them, resisting tidy closure. The grandmother's small magics versus Academy knowledge tension avoids binary resolution—Mira synthesizes both. The final image ("living text, a story that had learned to read itself") reweights the premise non-literally. Minor slip: "everything—even fear, even loss—could be transformed if you knew the right symbols" edges toward thematic statement in the final paragraph, but the prior scene work earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme (imperfect redemption, words as weight, incomplete miracles) emerges through particulars—the deleted article, the Chopin nocturne with annotations, blossoms "out of season." The ending's white petals "falling like forgiveness" reweights prior material without stating a moral. Margot's shift from "convinced my sharpness made me strong" to "translator of unfinished business" is earned through concrete apology and action. Minor: "imperfect miracles blooming out of season" is slightly on-the-nose as a thematic echo in the final third; the image carries it but the phrase itself flirts with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the dictionary's "words for emotions that hadn't evolved yet," the spiral that "forced perspective to shift continuously," and the realization that "separation between illusion and truth was itself the grandest illusion" are all grounded in scene. The final image—"the cosmos hiccupped again, gentler this time, almost like laughter"—reweights the premise from apocalyptic to playful without stating a moral. However, the piece edges toward thematic echo when Kael "understood the final illusion: that there had ever been anything to unravel" articulates the thesis too directly; this phrase in the penultimate paragraph borders on prompt-like summary rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: clocks don't measure time but "negotiate" with it; the horizon is "not an ending, but a seam." The razor-edge key, rising mercury, and bending horizon line accrete meaning without overt statement. The final image offers a non-literal answer—time is something "with razor edges and peculiar geometries" that can be "shepherded but never truly tamed." The piece resists tidy resolution: Maren gains knowledge but must hold a secret, and the universe's preference for chaos remains. No thematic echo or moralizing in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars: the subway symbols as questions, the koan about one hand clapping, the negative space forming "WIDEN YOUR VIEW." The melancholy-as-clover metaphor evolves from "suffocating weight" to "fertile ground," charging the ending without stated morals. The piece avoids therapy-speak in most beats, though "acknowledge that neither of you had all the answers" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward articulating the thesis. The final image (rain stopping, "question mark dissolving into possibility") offers resonant ambiguity tied to probability's infinite outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme (endings as beginnings,ループ versus estrangement) emerges through the glass harmonica's shifting resonance and Sarah's protocol violation without overt moralizing. The final "Wrong number" invitation offers a non-literal answer to the premise, reweighting "cultivated estrangement" as a choice rather than duty. The disc's melodic haunting and the man's daughter-to-son loop provide concrete thematic particulars. Minor: "teaching endings how to begin" is nearly stated as thesis ("An ending that sounds like it could begin something"), skating close to thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—witnessing as preservation, small moments accumulating into return—emerges organically from archival work and the scratched inscription. The final image reweights the covenant's failure through the metaphor of steeping, avoiding overt moral. Subtext operates in "haunted euphoria" and Mrs. Corvin's smile. The ending avoids sermonizing but leans slightly abstract; "simple, gently thorough act of witnessing" borders on thematic statement rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of reciprocity and mutual aid emerges organically from the flood-survivor's gift and the rumor-chain structure. The "invisible currency" metaphor and "permission" realization avoid overt moralizing until the final paragraphs, where "mutual aid began with aiding each other" and "disaster relief for those who'd forgotten they were disasters too" veer toward thesis statement. The moon rocks as permission rather than magic is a solid conceptual move, but the ending's "We heard a rumor" line and the framing of the station as "infrastructure no relief organization provided" flatten ambiguity into a tidy thematic package. The desperately-jocular-to-genuine laugh progression is told, not shown through image or action that reweights prior material with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the unmappable grove, the familiar melody hidden in ultrasonic frequencies, the stillpoint existing "between heartbeats." The final insight—grief as home refracted through loss—arises from scene work rather than assertion. However, "she'd been trying to chart it as foreign territory when it was actually home" edges toward expository clarity that slightly undercuts subtextual power. The recurring map/language/translation motif charges the ending without becoming mechanical, and the piece resists moralizing while maintaining thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through image and action: the pen's unbending mirrors Mara's release of rigidity; "palimpsest" and "margin between drafts" grow from the celestial-signal mechanics rather than abstract assertion. The piece resists tidy morals—Mara's predecessor was neither mad nor wrong, and her own shift is framed as accepting paradox rather than solving it. The final image (stars blinking in patterns that "wouldn't exist for another century, or perhaps had always existed") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the threshing-meaning question. The "strange comfort" deepens from physical (pen) to existential (living between certainty and revision) without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—presence versus permanence, visibility through translation of absence—emerges organically from the empty camera, sign language, and the music-from-silence conversion. The final image ("Nothing captured. Everything preserved.") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Marina's gesture of clicking the empty shutter and in Theo's patient translation work. However, the piece edges toward thematic statement in lines like "the methodology remained—a way of being seen by those who could not see," which borders on abstract philosophizing rather than letting the particulars speak.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme—love transcends institutional erasure—emerges through specific images (the scratched-out portrait, the tapestry fragment, Kenji's grandmother's grip). The final image of Mara walking back "ready to face whatever judgment" offers resonance without overt moralizing. However, the line "some acts of destruction were really acts of love, volcanic in their intensity, tender in their ultimate purpose" veers into thesis statement. The promise motif recurs with purpose, charging the ending without symbolic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the neural entanglement premise: isolation versus collaborative consciousness, identity boundaries, the cost of connection. The "auroral sorrow" phrase captures the bittersweet register without stating a moral. However, "Maybe that's not a failure...Maybe that's the discovery" verges on explicit thematic statement rather than letting the image do the work. The final tableau—two minds becoming one song—offers a resonant answer to the central question, though it leans toward affirmation without the sharper edge that full ambiguity would provide.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    The "whispers travel farther than shouts" theme emerges through Marcus's patient observation and sound-based navigation, contrasting with the implied brute-force methods of others. The folded maps as layered knowledge and the storm as catalyst for pattern-recognition work thematically. However, the woman's final speech ("Most people navigate by sight...") states the theme rather than letting the keyhole beat demonstrate it fully. The ending offers thematic resolution but tilts toward validation rather than discovery—Marcus is told he's correct rather than experiencing the cost or consequence of his philosophy in a way that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: shutters as constellations, silence as testimony, small mirrors revealing hidden truths. The final image of shadows forming a map reweights "silent empathy" without overt moralizing. However, "teach darkness the value of stars" arrives as a near-thesis statement in the penultimate beat, and the walk home pivots to reflection ("possibility of light") rather than a resonant, non-literal image that holds ambiguity. Theme is present and purposeful but tilts explanatory at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (autonomy, questioning routines, "forests of second thoughts") emerges organically from chess metaphors and the rebellion's tactics. The final image—queen move, library as lighthouse, silence speaking—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, "amplified quiet is louder than shouting" and "forests of second thoughts" veer close to thematic echo, articulating the premise rather than letting particulars accumulate. The window-display plan is inventive subtext (symbols interrupting automatic thought), and Miss Chen's advice to Danny ("think freely, whether you stay or go") resists binary resolution. Subtext operates in the chessboard's shifting meaning and Miss Chen's unspoken history (twelve years coaching, her grandmother's phrase), but the grotto meetings and rebellion mechanics are told, not dramatized, limiting thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—freedom through self-acceptance—emerges from the scrimshaw map, the whale's call, and the characters' parallel struggles. The final image ("Show me how to sail") gestures toward transformation without moralizing. However, the piece leans on prompt-adjacent phrasing: "freedom in embracing what you really are" and "terrible, beautiful liberation of finally embracing their true nature" echo workshop clichés. The disappearing island functions more as metaphor than earned particulars. The ending avoids sermon but also avoids a non-literal answer; the question is resolved tidily rather than reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—cultivating lightness in grief by carrying it without erasing it—emerges through the dried flowers, the narration habit, and the final silent whittling rather than direct statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the flowers rest "gray and fragile and honest," and the quiet becomes "space for whatever came next," reweighting the prior performance without a moral. Marcus's epiphany ("cultivating lightness…doesn't mean erasing the grief itself") verges on articulation but is immediately embodied by his tears and Emma's shift, so the cost anchors it. Minor: "remade hush" as concept (prompt element) is stated thematically more often than it pressures a choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—language as fluid aesthetic experience versus fixed authoritarian meaning—emerges organically through the quartz mechanics and Meris's refusal to paraphrase. The final image of poetry "remembering how to breathe" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the penultimate paragraph edges into thesis statement ("once people remember that meaning can be fluid...that knowledge becomes permanent"), pulling the reader toward declaration rather than inference.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—beauty in imperfection, the value of being worn by living—emerges organically from the bent reed, Maya's colorblindness-as-power, and the courtyard's scorched state without overt moralizing. The final image ("proof that being broken by the world was just another way of being beautiful") risks thematic echo but stays grounded in the reed's physical presence. Subtext operates in the plant arrangements and the implicit exchange (consciousness for broken things). The piece resists binary resolution and invites reflection on transformation and utility. A slight tendency toward poetic assertion ("some awakenings, once bartered for, remained permanent") edges into theme-statement territory but the particulars (reed, painting method, phoenix aftermath) anchor the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—connection as acoustic space, pilgrimage as internal rather than geographic—emerges from Maren's project and the crystalline spine metaphor. The closing image (two strangers on an artificial pilgrimage toward something achingly real) resonates without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph over-explains the thematic stakes ("she'd been seeking connection's texture not to study it, but to share it") and the last sentence's summary ("The laboratory of lost sounds had found something precious after all") tips toward thematic echo. The dual meanings of "lost sounds" (civilization's and Maren's isolation) provide modest depth, but the conceptual payoff is somewhat told.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of mourning-as-transformation emerges through concrete craft work and the "genuinely artificial" motif. However, multiple passages edge into direct thematic statement: "We're making permission to feel," "teach withering to bloom again," and the final paragraph's "quiet return to possibility" summarizes rather than images. The curtains-of-intention metaphor feels imposed rather than discovered, and the stars-as-hope closes on abstraction ("divine hope") instead of a resonant particular.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—knowledge preservation in hostile economic climates, ancient wisdom encoded in modern vessels—emerges clearly through the grandmother's semiconductor disguise and Vesper's cartomancy camouflage. The measuring tape's function as a bridge between myth and data provides concrete symbolic work. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement: "divination and data were siblings" and "those steadily curious enough to preserve wisdom" articulate the theme rather than letting the decoded circuits speak for themselves. The piece resists simplistic binaries (tech vs. folklore) but the "Rosetta Stone" framing and the explain-everything dawn resolution lean slightly didactic, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the Kaen's transcendence achieved by losing "every small perfect thing that made consciousness worth having." The archive functions as both temptation and warning without didactic statement. Subtext operates in the veil imagery (removed to enter, picked up but not worn at closure) and the anguished-joy tone that encodes the civilization's doomed innocence. The final image—"atoms of nostalgia for a future she would help her people avoid"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether knowledge should be pursued. The piece resists tidy morals and the historian's choice to teach avoidance rather than suppress knowledge shows complexity. One slip: "she honored both by understanding the difference" edges toward thematic summary rather than leaving resonance implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (authentic vs. commodified hope; shadows as proof of substance) emerges through the footage comparison and the grandmother's "luminous regret" rather than assertion. The shadow-unbound concept integrates thematically but stays abstract; it reweights prior material without becoming mechanical. The final image (stone beside copied files, dusk light-and-dark) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. One deduction: "luminous regret" and the shadow metaphor veer toward the prompt's lyric language rather than idiomatically grounded particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from the chameleon's regeneration and shedding layers—both literal observation and structural metaphor for Elena's process. The piece resists stating a moral; instead, the final image of "shedding what didn't serve her, keeping what did" arises organically from her documented tail-growth observations. The ending offers a resonant answer: truth can be reconstructed honestly after stripping pretense, with the mist's "patient work of obscuring and revealing" providing non-literal thematic charge. No thematic echo penalty; the insights are earned through concrete choices and the chameleon's embodied presence.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through particulars—scars as text, plants as witnesses, the frozen hourglass as displaced miracle—without explicit statement. The final image offers a resonant answer to "how do wounds tell truth": by opening them and charging objects with intention. Motifs (coffee rings, roses, scars) recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Subtext operates in the roses' "silent screaming," the table's forest memory, Mara's blood oath. The piece resists tidy morals: justice and self-destruction intertwine. One slip: "accidentally telepathic" reads slightly label-like, though the meteor hush grounds it in world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: unuttered declarations as tangible residue, the projection booth as incubation chamber, love's movement from stasis to flow. The final image—"forgotten lyrics finally finding their tune"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of whether unspoken feelings matter, avoiding overt moral summary. The map of unused-love locations (libraries, park benches, mailboxes) particularizes the abstraction without reducing it to allegory, and Celeste's choice to gift anonymously rather than restore acknowledges the irreversibility of missed moments. Minor reserve: the phrase "benediction" in "the weight of understanding settle over her like a benediction" tilts slightly toward explicit thematic language, though it does not state the moral outright.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—art as wonder unbound by control, the price of perfection—emerges through the Keeper's trapped creativity and Celestine's final imperfect star trace. The astrolabe and falling stars carry thematic weight without overt moralizing, and the final whisper "Create" offers a resonant answer without thesis statement. One friction: "By freeing the Keeper, she had freed herself" edges toward explicit summary in the penultimate section, reducing oblique charge. The stardust-as-memory conceit enriches the world logic and ties to the thematic question. No thematic echo in the final beat; the ending image reweights prior material cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: seeds as potential futures, charm as persuasion of probability, the dreamless guard as vessel for the world's dreams. The final image ("Even the dreamless could carry hope through the quantum dark") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The chess clock ticking once, then freezing, reweights time and hope with quiet authority. Minor slip: "stubbornly alive" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, but the surrounding images earn the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme: the unconscious mind as problem-solver, the mechanical forest as mandala/mirror. The final hologram makes this explicit ("The forest was a mirror...the architecture of his own expanded consciousness"), which leans toward thematic statement rather than resonant image. "Probable miracles crystallize into certainty" is near-platitude. The gear motif recurs but doesn't shift meaning—it remains a puzzle piece throughout. The ending offers clarity without ambiguity or cost, resolving into a tidy explanation rather than layered subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through the leash/courage motif without overt statement until the guides articulate it—borderline Thematic Echo, but the final image (running forward, star-shaped hole in hand) answers the question through action rather than summary. The ticket punch's star-shaped hole and twilight recur with shifted meaning, charging the closure. Subtext operates in the guides' indirection and Mara's confession. The ending resists a tidy moral; Mara runs into gathering dark, cost and outcome open, resonance clean.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the broken bench bolt, the discolored staircase, the anthem's lyrics all converge on "someone always paid" without stating a moral. The piano bench becomes a charged recurring object—mentioned as broken, then felt as wobbling, then used despite instability. The final image ("each note a small resurrection") reweights the opening climb with non-literal resonance. Subtext operates cleanly in Silent-Choir's wordless communication and the anthem's unsung words. No late-breaking theme summary mars the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the premise: truth persists, lies collapse under their own impossibility. The rune of drift is a resonant conceptual device, "beautiful in its way, like watching a cathedral spire topple in slow motion." The final image—fragments continuing their patient work, ensuring "truth…would always find its way back to light"—offers a non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the theme hovers near abstraction; Ossian's lack of internal conflict or personal cost keeps the thematic question from deepening into ambiguity or lived consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—ocean as archive and witness to human impact—emerges from concrete images: bleached coral, vanished shipping lanes, thermal memory. The atlas page and tapping rhythm are specific anchors that shift meaning at the end. Subtext operates in the phrase "moored but drifting," which mirrors Mara and her grandfather. The final image of typing the report offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "Water remembers" risks arriving as a declared thesis, but it is earned by prior particulars and the Morse-code turn.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the rebellion's lull, the ancient stones, and the contrast between rigid tactics and older frequencies. The opera glasses and "Remember what you were before you forgot how to see" offer a resonant non-literal answer. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("teach them to feel the hum") rather than trusting the image alone. The stones' hum as motif works because it constrains her perception and charges the ending, not mere recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of tradition-as-evolution emerges from Naja's insurgent history, her resistance to the Authority's erasure mandates, and her final synthesis of "old blessing-songs with new words of her own invention." The embryo as genetic bridge literalizes symbiosis without overt thesis statements. The kite's fulfilled purpose and Naja walking toward camps "with spores golden in her blood and whispers green in her mind" offer a resonant image that reweights reconstruction as ecological integration. Minor slip: "implanted destiny" and "blueprint for a new symbiosis" veer toward prompt echo, and the phrase "not through domination but through integration" tilts close to thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the pearl-of-stillness metaphor, the obsolete lighthouse, and Mira's cultivation practice without overt moralizing. The night-blooming cereus moment offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: brief beauty justifies long waiting. The pregnant couple's understanding nods at futurity without forcing optimism. The final image—grief and hope held simultaneously, "one careful layer at a time"—reweights survival as active cultivation. Minor deduction for the slightly on-the-nose "holding grief and hope simultaneously" articulation in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—that fragmentation is the authentic human structure, not an aberration—emerges through concrete particulars (rejected shadow-portraits, broken box, contracting geometry) rather than abstraction. The final image offers a resonant answer: she will paint "spaces between" rather than people, a non-literal response to the opening question about mirrors and truth. The burning cards imprinting on her vision is a strong thematic closure. Minor penalty: "luminescent ache" appears three times, the final instance ("luminescent ache made visible") edging toward self-conscious poetics that slightly undercuts the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—crisis consciousness expanding time, the tension between justice and understanding—emerges from concrete action: the ink trails, Kael's childhood memory, the stretched seconds in the cave. Vera's research is integrated through the tracking method itself, not abstract philosophizing. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Kael experiences the very temporal dilation Vera studies, proving her theory through his embodied pause without stating a moral. "Both of them disappearing into the wind-carved landscape, tracking their separate truths home" closes on image and implication. No thematic echo intrudes, and the complexity (hunter respecting prey) remains unresolved without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the core conflict: truth versus survival, the violence of enforced forgetting, the cost of breaking silence. The question "What do we owe the truth when survival depends on forgetting?" is explicitly stated but earned through concrete particulars (the Testimonials, the sanitized history, the dormant networks). The ending offers a resonant answer through action rather than moralizing: she burns the contraband letter but liberates its message, completing the "dangerous liaison" while networks crackle to life. The final image of "unspoken conversation" reweights the premise without stating a thesis. Minor deduction for one moment of thematic echo ("dangerous liaison") being slightly over-articulated in the closing moves.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—cultivation as counter to fear and violence—emerges through the ballast scraps teaching balance, Mira's whispered method, and the blade-sheathing. "Weaving continuity through chaos" is character-voiced, not prompt echo. The final image (clean light through thinning dust) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: persistence and patience yield clarity. No moralizing. The roses as both literal medicine and metaphor for resilience avoid overt symbolism. Minor: "engraved quiet" in one line edges toward abstract phrasing but is redeemed by the concrete action that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from image and action: silence as negative space that sound rushes to fill, emotions translating back to their original tongue. The rail spike (distance/departure songs) and the echo (mother's hands catching a child) operate as charged motifs without stating a moral. The final image—fisher returning with the rarest catch—reweights the entire hunt as proof that "translated emotions could find their way back to their original tongue." No thematic echo or sermon; the crystallized feeling in Mara's chest is the answer, non-literal and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of hidden-versus-revealed truth emerges through the retraction-as-proof conceit and the observatory-as-investigative-site metaphor. The "orbits of regret" motif recurs purposefully, shifting from circular to "spiral and ascending" at closure. "Silence was loudest when it pretended to be surrender" offers a resonant reframing without overt moralizing. The grandfather/father/Celeste lineage threads through (rosewood nib, devotion to delicate instruments) and charges the ending. Minor deduction: "some truths required instruments more delicate than printing presses" and "hidden things only stay hidden if you stop looking up" veer toward theme statements rather than embodied discovery, and the final paragraph's "proof by contradiction was complete" over-explains the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: guilt over ignored cries, the act of translation, tethering to loss until meaning resolves. The amber's transformation—wasp mid-flight to empty clarity—charges the ending without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in "the only way forward is to tether yourself to what you've lost," a phrase that risks thematic echo but remains tied to the concrete action of pressing amber to firmware. The final image ("amber, now clear and empty, a reminder") offers a resonant answer to the central question of how to atone. Slight drift toward abstraction ("constellation tattooist," "meteor hush") keeps it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of meaning-making through pattern emerges from concrete particulars: the chalk mandalas, the tile flake's resonance, the crowd's shared attention. The final image—"not meaning itself, but the place where meaning lived"—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, "you were someone, you loved someone, you meant something" edges toward stated reassurance rather than purely embodied discovery, and the shift from "lilac unease" to "almost sacred" resolves tension somewhat tidily for the complexity of ongoing erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—mercy and remembrance as resistance—emerges organically from the tessera fragments and the act of naming. "Gentle radicalism: to weaponize empathy" risks being too on-the-nose, but the final image of pressing the blue minaret fragment into place reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The plaza's seven renamings and Layla's counter-naming create purposeful pattern. Subtext operates in the mechanical hands cradling fragments and the choice to preserve rather than destroy. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration of the plaza's identity without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through particulars: performance as existential anchor, time as spiral rather than line, and the cost of being witnessed. The final image—Margaux woven into the garden, "forever dancing in the colors between sound and light"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the piece flirts with abstraction ("encore without end," "everything") and the prompt label "lure possibility from the brink of despair" echoes in the prose. Synesthesia and temporal recursion charge the closure without reducing to tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (mapping pathways through chaos to restore sovereignty) emerges through the interplay of telepathic entanglement, somatic markers, and light-painting particulars without overt thesis statements. The muscovite's layered structure ("separate yet part of a whole") and the fractally precise trails offer concrete images that invite reflection on consciousness and boundaries. The final image resists a tidy moral and reweights the premise: what was catastrophic (the shock, the defective pill) becomes the key to rescue. Minor weakness: "hope crystallized into something solid" in the closing line tilts slightly abstract rather than remaining anchored in a final sensory particular.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of loneliness ending through communion with the non-human emerges from concrete images: the elm leaf's temporal persistence, floating jellyfish emotions, the cave's sentience. The final assertion "factually mystical proof that loneliness could end when one learned to listen to stones" edges toward explicit moralizing but is grounded in the preceding sensory map work. The transitional-object concept is more stated than dramatized; the piece invites reflection on deep time and otherness, though the resolution feels tidy rather than ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (human connection across loss) emerges organically from the button archive and canyon echo without overt moralizing. The final image—"I was here. I mattered. I lost something. I found something. We continue"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. The metaphor of buttons as encoded collective wisdom is specific and earned. Minor slip: "Time moves differently when we know we're not alone in it" edges toward thematic statement rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of repair and courage emerges through the pillbox message and Marcus's progression from isolation to action, but "fixing what's broken" is stated explicitly in Sarah's dying words and then glossed in the penultimate paragraph: "fixing what's broken meant recognizing that some fractures made you stronger." The snow-as-archive and seasonal cycle offer non-literal resonance, yet the ending pivots to a thesis statement rather than letting the final image do that work. The piece resists false equivalence (the trafficking ring is unambiguously evil), but the thematic answer is delivered rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—layered truth, the impossibility of singular narrative—emerges from the palimpsest journals and is dramatized through the coachman's metaphor of the needle as space-maker rather than eraser. The grandmother's scraped-over pages become the story's central image, avoiding abstract philosophizing. The coachman's line "she just kept adding layers because one story could never hold a whole life" resonates without moralizing. The final image (woman walking toward village lights, needle still tucked in journal) offers non-literal closure: she carries multiplicity forward. The fog as stripping-away force contrasts purposefully with the journals' accretion, creating thematic tension. No prompt-language intrudes; the wisdom is embodied in objects and the crossing's ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from image and event: kindness as temporal anchor, phototropism across fractured timelines, patience in a burning world. The lantern glass and thrum recur with shifting meaning, and the final image—"accumulated light of gentle acts, phototropic across time"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The beekeeper's line "Form requires patience. Beauty requires vulnerability" teeters on the edge of thematic echo but is contextualized by his role as witness, avoiding a −0.6 penalty. The piece invites reflection and resists tidy binaries, though the emotional arc leans toward confirmation rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—opening what seems closed, finding light through reflection and angles—emerges organically from the locksmith/gardener parallel and the mirror system. The gauge tooth reprise in the final paragraph reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates effectively in the father's hidden tools and Mrs. Chen's quiet approval. The thematic statement "protection didn't mean isolation—that vulnerability could exist within care" edges toward overt articulation but remains anchored in concrete action. The ending offers a resonant answer (mount the gauge tooth, continue the work) without didacticism, though the certainty of future bloom softens ambiguity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—coexistence of past and present, singularity as bridge rather than fracture—emerges organically from the thylacine memory and library setting. The sundial's reinterpretation (shadow to light) and the infinite reflections (proof of multiplicity) offer concrete particulars that avoid overt moralizing. The closing assertion "She was the first of something new" edges toward thesis statement but is cushioned by prior imagery. No epiphany is tested under pressure, limiting resonance; the book's message ("You are not broken. You are a bridge") borders on Thematic Echo but remains integrated enough to stay in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (secrets as threads in shared humanity vs. isolating burdens) emerges through concrete particulars: the businessman's cancer letter, the widow writing to a grave, the nest's instinctive spiral. The installation as public art reweights private desperation into collective resonance without stating a moral. Weakness: "infinitely profound—the thread that had always been there" edges toward thesis statement in the final paragraph, and "inevitably whimsical" repeats as unearned cosmic reassurance rather than earned insight. The nest's return charges the ending but the prose slightly over-explains the thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of coexistence with cosmic entities who treat reality as a game emerges through specifics (circuit patterns resembling laughter, impossible colors, charts rearranging) rather than assertion. The final image—charts spiraling away, warmth replacing cruelty—offers a non-literal answer to whether humanity can redirect rather than defeat such forces. However, the closing line "outwitting the tricksters one frequency at a time" inches toward thematic summary rather than letting the spiral and warmth carry the full weight. The concept of "power plays" and "dividing the community" is dramatized through campus factions but resolved off-stage (surveillance feeds show fading colors), which softens the thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—freedom of movement versus imposed boundaries—emerges organically from the spatial mutiny backstory and the disc's hidden geometry. The final image of the compass "pointing not north but down" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the organ's "patient instruction" and the dust motes' "wistful beauty." Minor weakness: "the world as it was drawn on official maps" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thesis statement, and "convenient lies" is slightly didactic, but the closure image recovers specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—connection beyond recognition, empathy as the true portrait—emerges organically from Elena's condition and the investigation's needs, culminating in the final image: "we recognize each other not by features but by the dormant empathy we awaken in one another." The ending avoids overt moralizing by embedding the insight in Elena's tactile memory (touching the ribbon) and Morrison's testimony. The quarry motif returns with reweighted meaning, and the opposition between Elena's blindness to faces and her ability to capture souls creates productive tension. One micro-slip: the phrase "That was the only portrait that ever really mattered" inches toward thematic declaration, though it remains within Elena's interior voice and doesn't fully tip into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—exile, belonging, and the courage to step sideways out of catastrophe—emerges through the journals, the copper nail tradition, and the wound-door motif without overt moralizing. The coded stanzas and "boundaries between being and unbeing" risk abstraction but are anchored by Mira's personal stake in rehabilitating her ancestor. The final image ("the strange, singing cold") offers a non-literal answer that reweights the station's phenomena as threshold rather than threat, though the conceptual cost could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of "pixelated amnesty" and bridging resolutions is stated by the hitchhiker and then restated in Mara's reflection ("permission to move from one state of being to another") rather than emerging through dramatized conflict. The final image—"luminous disbelief...like a treasure she'd never trade"—gestures at resonance but the thematic question (what does it cost to grant passage?) is never answered on the page; Mara experiences wonder without sacrifice. The piece leans on prompt vocabulary ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") that reads as imported thesis rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—whether some circles can be broken—emerges through the currency markers, the circus's failed dreams, and Marco's territorial boundary-setting. The final image (motion sensors blinking, father's hand steadying, the map "showing not where paths had led, but where they might yet go") reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the father's touch of the bills and Marco's "polished calm" masking anxiety. One minor slip: "You're trying to dissuade me from the roads" is slightly on-the-nose, though it's dialogue rather than narration and the father's voice can afford directness.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—shared burdens lighten, isolation compounds suffering—emerges organically from the temple priests' encoded method and Ashwin's fate. The variable stars function as a non-literal vehicle: pulsing in patterns "meant to be read together" avoids stating the moral but risks overt parallelism. The final paragraph's "Some burdens grow heavier when carried alone, lighter when witnessed" borders on thematic echo but remains grounded in the daylily lesson and star cycles. The piece resists tidy resolution by keeping the decoding incomplete, offering method over answer.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—people lock themselves into fear-shapes and refuse to unbend—emerges from the apprentice's frozen confession and Maren's war-song method. The mirror motif (hidden truth, twisted soul, false reflections) recurs and the flesh-eating seeds literalize the danger of consuming lies. Yet Maren's closing line, "The truth that people are not lost—they simply refuse to unbend from the shape their fears have locked them into," is overt thematic summary that replaces scene pressure. The apprentice's whispered confession and Maren's hard-but-kind correction work better as earned subtext. The final image—"warlike serenity like a blade sheathed in stillness"—is vivid but slightly ornamental, reiterating her established trait rather than reweighting it with new cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of complementary limitation is coherent but arrives through direct statement: "their limitations had always been complementary." The topiary-to-soil transformation and rising shared dream offer symbolic closure, yet the final image leans on abstraction ("single, purposefully curious force") rather than concrete particulars that reweight prior material. "We can write a new agreement" borders on thematic echo, articulating the premise rather than embodying it. No plausible counter-reading or moral ambiguity complicates the tidy union.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the orchard's wisdom—"nothing grows without death threaded through it"—and the burned Lovers card's "two figures whose faces had melted into a single crying eye" visualizes the cost of trying to sever parts of the self. The piece resists a tidy moral; the Oracle's insight ("real, whole pain is better than borrowed joy") is earned by the failed reversals and Marcus's embodied suffering. Subtext operates strongly in the Oracle's self-reproach ("she had been so certain she could help") and the burned card as offering/apology. The final image—leaving the card on the martyr's palm—reweights the bartering motif into acceptance ritual without stating a thesis. Minor slip: "real again" in the penultimate line edges toward thematic echo but is grounded enough in Marcus's prior hollowing to avoid overt sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme (purpose after applause, authenticity vs. imposed expertise) emerges from concrete particulars: roadie past, blown speaker, Ming vase failure, bottles in hand. The grille cloth recurs with reweighted meaning (prayer flag → echo of returning purpose). Final image is resonant and non-literal: "echo of purpose… like the last reverb after the lights come up" reweights the opening without moralizing. Marcus's insight is earned through tactile experience, not platitude. Minor thinning: "confidently uncertain" and "wrest some meaning" feel slightly prompted, and the station manager's phrase is tell-only.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—transition as transformation of state, not endpoint—emerges organically from particulars: cuneiform becoming meaning, water becoming steam, spirit becoming encoded knowledge. The arbor, magnetic suspension, and knowledge fruit are non-literal embodiments of the concept; the final image of the arbor "in touching distance of both earth and sky" resonates without stating a moral. Harrow's "methodical kindness" and Emilia's analogical training ground the theme in character work. The risk is slight didacticism in Emilia's epiphany ("The physics of transition were simple after all"), which tilts toward summary, but the specific examples (wedge-shaped marks, luminous vines, electromagnetic taste) anchor the abstraction. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question with no overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme (wonder survives within routine by accepting contradictions) emerges organically from the library's mechanics, the fish mobile, and Maris's origin story without meta-commentary. The scroll's "weight, texture" and the woman's laugh at "tomorrow" offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Recurrence is purposeful: the bamboo creel shifts from fisherman's tool to scroll holder, and the metal fish charge the final image by embodying migrating identities. The ending avoids moralizing; the visitor's smile and Maris's "whenever today feels right" land with quiet earned wisdom rooted in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the confession and artifacts: preservation versus living, isolation versus connection. The shell's spiral inward "toward some hidden truth" and the pearl's latent-to-alive radiance avoid overt symbolism while charging the concept. The final image—"radiance no longer latent, but alive"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the confession's explicit articulation ("hope doesn't survive in vaults...needs hearts beating in proximity") borders on thematic statement rather than pure dramatization. The closing paragraph's "what makes survival worthwhile" and "dissolve the walls between hearts" risks slight over-articulation of the theme already embodied in image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    The river-as-mirror theme emerges through concrete particulars: sediment from upstream, contamination traveling invisibly, systems failing under pressure. The graffiti dialogue ("forgiveness flows downstream, never up" evolving to "What if forgiveness isn't a destination but a current you learn to swim in?") develops the question without overt moralizing. The accordion's visible repairs offer a resonant non-literal answer—mending as persistence—though the final paragraph's "truth, like water, doesn't judge its own course" edges toward stating the thesis. The ivy's patient resurrection and the station's simultaneous unmaking/remaking provide thematic texture, but the ending leans slightly toward summary of what Maya "was beginning to glimpse" rather than an image that reweights prior material without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the grandmother's unspoken words and the library's purpose: solitude, devastating choices, and the gap between what we say and mean. The watch's cipher functions as a key to comprehension rather than revenge, and the final insight (understanding over retribution) feels earned by prior particulars. However, the closing lines ("cyclically reversed confessions waiting in the spaces between what we say and what we mean") edge toward overt thematic summary rather than letting the final image resonate without stated moral. The piece invites reflection but does not fully resist articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly through particulars: perforated destiny (the violin's deliberate holes that trap some notes, release others) becomes the story's organizing image for partial, propagated truth. The plant telepathy isn't ornamental—ferns, pothos, and mulberry each teach Elena a survival tactic (careful roots, tendril propagation, persistence in impossible places) that she applies to her choice. The final image—truth scattering like seeds while the violin weeps—answers the thematic question (can truth survive empire?) without stating a moral. The "promise loses its glow" motif could be more concretely anchored; it reads slightly abstract compared to the tactile violin and plants.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete ritual: the threshold of stillness (neither frozen nor melting, neither alive nor gone) structures every image and anchors the story's meditation on impermanent beauty and the value of ephemeral witness. The emerald chip shifts meaning from a girl's last grasp to a light source pulsing with "youth interrupted," and the aurora's patterns externalize Lyra's practice of reading meaning in apparent chaos. Closure offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "endings could still hold light" is earned by the layered preparation and the undeniable radiance of the final image, not asserted as thesis. No thematic echo or summary intrudes; the oils, pigments, mirrors, and aurora do the conceptual work. Subtext operates in "Lyra had captured it. She always did"—both confidence and compulsion without diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—contentment as practice rather than discovery—emerges organically from the fishermen analogy, the woman's identity layering, and the final image. The hairpin's phoenix motif returns with earned resonance: rebirth isn't becoming new but "holding all our selves at once." No overt moralizing; the woman's final speech walks the line but is dramatized through the hairpin transfer and integrated with Keiko's embodied descent. The closing triad ("heartbeat, promise, next breath") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in silence (Keiko's gasp, the woman's "ancient kindness") and the grotto/clouds/mist cohere as a charged symbolic field.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the mirror shard's hollow center, wind chimes singing contradictory harmonies, and refracted light—all concrete images that avoid thesis statements. The final gesture (clipping the shard to the railing, leaving it or returning) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question about certainty versus wisdom. The piece resists tidy closure: Mara's new model is未tested, the fear acknowledged alongside freedom. One slip: "become a conscience for hire who admits she's still learning what conscience means" edges toward articulating theme rather than embodying it fully in action.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of delayed revelation emerges organically through the backward-aging conceit and the teaching method ("to teach vanishing, one must first teach appearing"). The ripple-pattern metaphor carries subtext without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph's thematic summary ("passed forward what she would soon no longer know") functions as a stated thesis rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The closing lines lean into explicit articulation of theme, reducing earned resonance and capping the score in mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—memory as navigation, stillness as journey—emerges organically from the arrowhead's layered pulses and the grandmother's teaching without overt statement. The final image ("time itself was just another pattern to be read") offers a resonant answer to the central question through concrete particulars (stone, echo, raven geometry). The recursion of "patterns in a flock of birds in flight" and the arrowhead's completion-seeking pulse charge the ending without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—finding the sacred in the ordinary, presence over efficiency—emerges through the keystone (worthless to algorithms, meaningful to Maren), the choice to climb, and the mist-walking attempts. The final image (spire's patient vigil, mist from carved flowers) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the grandmother's journal fragments and the contrast between spell-generators and human effort. Minor deduction: "she'd been learning to see differently, to find luminance in the lingering spaces where light and dark, success and failure, human and holy merged" edges toward thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph, though it stops short of a moral and is grounded in the prior vision.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—translation between senses, memory made visible—emerges from concrete particulars (bioluminescent bottles labeled with musical notes and colors) rather than stated thesis. The grandfather's synesthetic obsession and Mara's lamplighting converge in the closing image: "each lamp a word in the sentence between darkness and dawn, between silence and seeing." The piece resists tidy moralizing and allows ambiguity (the theory is "proven correct" only subjectively, through Mara's perception). Minor slip: "luminous vows" as a phrase appears in backstory but remains somewhat abstract, not fully grounded in dramatized action or visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—causality reversal, reception over prediction, transformation as survival—emerges organically from the backwards-prophecy mechanics and coin-reading method. The final image ("seed pattern for whatever universe would bloom next") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The coins as "medium of exchange, symbols of value, tokens of meaning" deepen rather than explain. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through the sea-monster motif (naming fear to make it bearable), the parallel sacrifices across centuries, and the final image's non-literal answer: carrying the atlas page becomes carrying mapped grief. No explicit thesis statement; the predecessor's whisper "The hardest mercy is the one we show ourselves" arrives as embedded dialogue rather than authorial summary. The ending reweights prior material—sacrifice/cowardice and love/fear binaries collapse into acceptance—with resonance built from the observatory particulars and the echo structure. The crystallized-memory image risks slight abstraction but remains tied to the kiss and the walk into darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—devotion and persistence over raw power, micro-scale correction of macro imbalance—emerges from concrete particulars (dripping rates, lukewarm magic, donated fishing hooks). The bell and water function as motifs that accumulate meaning and constrain the final choice. The ending offers a non-literal answer: balance is a rhythm, not a dramatic flourish. No overt moralizing; the image of seven-and-eleven drops ringing sustains ambiguity (years to correct) while delivering resonance. Slight dip for "plausible impossibility" feeling slightly on-the-nose in the villages' report.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the reservoir as both necessity and erasure, stories as preservation, witness as shared meaning. Eleanor's line "meaning doesn't transplant. It roots in specific soil, specific streets" and the final image ("beneath every surface, meaning waits, patient and preserved") avoid overt moralizing while reweighting the opening silence. The piece resists binary resolution—Millbrook will drown again, but its meaning persists—and offers a non-literal answer to whether the warden's vigilance and the town's memory can coexist.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (harmonizing logic and intuition) emerges organically from Lyra's starling observation and the orchard's contradictions. The frozen dew crystal and simultaneous seasons embody structure-and-spontaneity without stating it. The grandmother's handkerchief (beakers intertwined with roses) seeds the insight effectively. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("proved they had always been harmonized, waiting only for someone secretly sentimental enough to see it") rather than letting the image alone carry resonance. The starlings writing wisdom across the sky risks overt symbolism but stays within acceptable bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of solitary witness and institutional trust emerges organically from the conflict without direct statement. The parachute buckle and muscle memory motifs recur with shifting weight (survival → certainty), charging the final image. However, "the watcher's burden" is named twice in near-identical phrasing, edging toward label rather than dramatized cost. The ending offers a resonant answer (bearing witness requires refusing to flinch) without moralizing, though "preserved trust by refusing to abandon truth" leans slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (wholeness through fragmentation, numbness needing passion to define itself) emerges organically from the brain-in-jar literalization and the complementary-opposites framing. The final image—two mothers flanking preserved tissue, hands gripped across it—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "can a shattered self parent?" without stating a moral. Minor deduction: "Vivified. Whole." in the closing triplet reads as a thematic echo that nudges into statement rather than letting the handclasp stand alone. The piece resists false equivalence (Kira's numbness and Clone-Kira's excess are both disasters, not morally balanced), and the child's laughter provides concrete emotional undertow.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the leaf blower's incongruous symphonic role, the lullaby's transformation through echo, the tunnel as literal and figurative chamber for grief. The piece resists moralizing—no character articulates the "lesson"—and the final hourglass image offers resonance without stating a thesis. The tension between Lily's absence and the parents' effort to "fill it back up" charges the ending without resolving into false comfort. Minor slip: "laughter remembers its way home" in the final line borders on sentimentality, but the earned strangeness of the central conceit (leaf blower conductor) insulates it.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the tension between captivity and duty, civilization and ferality, knowledge and instinct. "To make friends with uncertainty" is stated but also enacted in the closure choice—Maris cannot know the outcome yet acts anyway. The iron collar and her return to waiting charge the ending without moralizing; the cycle continues with cost. The dimensional homesickness and the library's texts suggest larger questions about identity and boundaries, though some figurative language ("aching intelligence," "foggy lucidity") skirts abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of creative destruction emerges through concrete action—the crozier transforms via brokenness rather than repair. The final image (living crozier with veins of silver) offers non-literal answer to the central question about failure and transformation. Subtext operates in the detail that someone "struck it deliberately," suggesting systemic resistance to rigid authority. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic statement ("hopelessness was just another ingredient") and risks explaining rather than trusting the image. The "frozen bloom" metaphor of her tears works but the piece occasionally declares theme ("creative destruction") rather than letting it fully emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the fragment's "shard of hush" and the recurrent silence/transformation motif. The final image—silence as canvas—offers a resonant answer to the central question (finding beginnings in endings) without stating a moral. The mentor's teaching and Mira's shift in interpretation method ground the insight in specific action. However, "silence wasn't absence / It was the canvas on which everything began" risks overt thematic statement in the final lines, though the particulars (towers humming, gorge reweighted) anchor it sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of liminal permanence and merging realities emerges from the ferry's paradox and the hourglass mechanics. The final image (sand flowing sideways, Mateo grinning, Torres predicting stranger crossings) reweights the premise without stating a moral. However, "resiliently positive energy" and the upbeat closure ("I'm counting on it, Captain") soften the conceptual cost; the piece gestures at transformation but doesn't let ambiguity or loss linger. Subtext in the grotto's "truths that surface reality concealed" and the hourglass gift accrues modest depth, yet the emotional arc resolves too tidily for the thematic weight implied.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the weaving metaphor: connection as perpetual redesign, memory as living process. The sinew thread's texture and the shifting memory-images concretize the abstract question without overt statement. The final image—Marina surrounded by geometric proof that "connection thrives not despite change, but because of it"—offers resonant reconfiguration, though "geometric proof" edges toward thematic declaration. The phrase "rational enchantment" and "realistically imaginary" carry some prompt-echo quality, but the weaving particulars (her sister's face at seven then seventeen, her father's trembling hands) ground the theme in specific experience rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the navigation metaphor: the shift from "flat charts between known points" to edge geometry that reads "boundaries between possible and impossible" charges the piece without overt statement. The chain link recurs with reweighted meaning—first as "simpler geometries," then glowing with alien light to teach the boundary principle, finally "warm in her palm" as a tactile anchor in the closure image. The final constellation-tracing offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how understanding expands across species without moralizing. Subtext operates in Current-Through-Stones' "approval and sorrow" and Carta's silent observation, though the phrase "unfolded horizons" risks prompt-echo when repeated in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme—love's persistence across death and the duty to hear vulnerable voices—emerges organically from the frequency map, the hearing aid's stored vibrations, and the grandmother's refusal to let go. "That was the thing about hearts: even traced through static and decades, they never stopped trying to save each other" lands as earned wisdom rather than a moral. The concept of "incidental heroism" is directly stated in the penultimate paragraph ("It wasn't heroism...just Mira doing her job"), which edges toward thematic echo but is somewhat redeemed by the specificity of "following a pulse, asking questions that needed asking." The final image—grandmother's love crackling through corroded circuits—resonates without didacticism. However, the theme statement is close to prompt language and risks feeling imposed rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly from concrete particulars: the invisible beings as custodians, the codex's golden marginalia, and the research station's erasure all cohere around witnessing and institutional memory. The final image—"not in bronze or stone, but in understanding, in continued observation, in the golden truth"—reweights Mara's act without stating a moral. However, "the unremembered would have their monument" edges toward overt thesis, and the phrase "crashing hush of institutional forgetting" in the penultimate paragraph risks summary. The phase-transition motif (water/vapor, ice/ocean) recurs with purpose, but the codex's medieval-to-modern span is told rather than used to constrain a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme (wisdom from scattered fragments, reinterpretation over repair) emerges organically from the ink patterns, corrupted data, and porcelain shard. The final image of the shard "whole in its brokenness" carries thematic weight. However, the last paragraph becomes over-explicit: "Some things don't need repair, they need reinterpretation" and "wisdom gleamed clear" state the theme rather than trust the image to hold it. The piece would score higher if it stopped one sentence earlier, letting the porcelain and dawn carry the resonance without the summary.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—transformation as preservation, translation across sensory modes—emerges organically from the diamond's flaw and Sarielle's tactile method. The final image (canyon singing forever via texture-to-sound) offers a non-literal answer to "how does a dead language survive?" without moralizing. The "sensation of meaning itself, rough and smooth and sharp and true" risks abstraction but connects to prior concrete textures. Subtext operates in her quiet departure and the irony that a "cursed" diamond enables perpetual voice.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—whether the incomprehensible is predation or transcendence—emerges through the arrowhead, phone, and underground garden rather than statement. Maya's shift from "fortress of skepticism" to "love letter written in the language of the incomprehensible" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Old Marrow's line "what if it's hunting a better version of us" seeds ambiguity without false equivalence. The final image (arrowhead tugging upward, something impossible blooming) reweights the opening bitterness with earned wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: transformation-as-continuous-becoming is embodied in the locust shell's symbolism, the cracking violin, the statues' shift from stillness to tears, and the orchard's rebirth. The final image—"the eternal space between the chrysalis and the wing"—reweights the opening's "gap between knowing and understanding" without stating a moral. The piece resists neat resolution: the world is "remembering" but not fixed, and Mira's violin is broken even as the orchard blooms. The cost is conceptual (sacrifice of the old for the new) and felt (the instrument destroyed). Minor slip: "to reawaken beauty" is stated directly in narration rather than fully implied through action, though the surrounding images support it.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (connection resisting division, absence as strategy) emerges organically from the arcade setting, null-field tactics, and the thunderstorm metaphor. The final image—daughter receiving the storm—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the last two paragraphs lean toward thematic summary ("already fostering what the borders couldn't break") rather than letting the image speak. The piece avoids heavy-handed allegory, but the null-field and "linking absences" conceit risks abstraction; grounding it more concretely in Maren's tactical choices would elevate thematic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—silence as possibility, brokenness as song—emerges from the carpenter's work and the train's remnants rather than direct statement. The halo fragment and wind bells function as recurring images that accumulate meaning across the piece. However, the final paragraph resorts to explicit thematic summary ("they would understand what he'd known all along: that silence wasn't empty, that brokenness could sing") rather than trusting a resonant image to carry the weight. The piece avoids moralizing but substitutes thematic echo (prompt language like "misting hush," "quiet, persistent") for earned insight. The ending asserts rather than dramatizes transformation, and the non-literal answer to the central question is diluted by over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (stories have physical location in curved memory-space) emerges from events and the scarf-as-topology conceit without meta-commentary. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the library always was the place where stories live, accessible through "precise mathematics of wonder." No moralizing; the final image (prime-number closure, pocket dimension, Cordelia's smile) reweights prior material. Subtext operates in silence (observed patrons, tender distance) and the scarf's warmth. Analog memories accumulate pressure organically. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites reflection through purposeful ambiguity (is the reawakening literal or perceptual?).

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the cipher-of-longing premise: dreams as spaces requiring belief and presence in "between-places," with light and color as the grammar. The watercolor palette's fingerprints, the luminous absence between night and dawn, and the overlapping photographs form a coherent pattern without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—to reach a dream, you must encode yourself into its language and step into its uncertainty—without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution; Mara's shimmer suggests transformation rather than arrival. The "Dream Walker" as state-of-being rather than entity deepens the thematic question, and the final image (painting coordinates, stepping into light) reweights prior material through the motif of light-as-language without reducing complexity to a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—secrets as collective fears, city as living architecture—emerges from concrete images (nexus, doors, ribbon coordinates). The sister's transformation into "hidden architecture" offers a resonant final reweighting. However, the last paragraph edges into moralizing: "The first star told me you would be." The book's idea ("The city is alive… every locked door a fear we collectively decided to keep closed") is stated rather than implied through action. The piece invites reflection but closes by telling rather than showing the thematic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of preservation versus transformation emerges organically from the fairy ring mechanics and Vera's folklorist practice. The metaphor "memory, like fruit, spoils when hoarded" synthesizes naturally from events rather than assertion. The final image (ascending with mushrooms, memory "living" not preserved) offers resonant, non-literal answer to the preservation question. The constellation-as-shipwreck pattern and fungal-network science enrich rather than explain theme. Minor slip: "The memory belonged to her again, sharp and crisp as autumn air, real as her own breath. Not preserved. Living" inches toward stating what the image already conveys.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of reversible exile and finding strength in brokenness emerges through the shard-mirror, tea-leaf geometry, and the archivist's backward walk. The piece avoids overt moralizing until the final paragraph, which delivers thematic summary ("resilience grows quietly in forgotten places, that the sharpest wisdom wears the softest voice") in place of a resonant image. The central question—can exile reverse?—is answered affirmatively through Finn's notebook action, but the answer is then re-stated rather than trusted to particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (wonder, imagination, preservation) emerges organically from Mara's work and the seed's transformation. The final planting offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the piece leans heavily on prompt language—"color of wonder," "radiant hush," "weaving between worlds"—which reads as thematic echo rather than earned subtext. The wisdom ("nurturing growth, guiding life, weaving hope") trends toward platitude in the closing lines, softening the conceptual edge that would elevate the theme into true complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (secrets as drowning weight; witnessing as moral burden) emerges from the net's particulars and the fisherman's confession without meta-commentary. The prism's refraction of names into light offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how silence becomes unbearable. Subtext operates in "I helped the sea keep its secrets" and the sanctuary's role as holder of refracted names. The ending avoids moralizing yet reweights prior material: acknowledgment transforms hidden deaths into visible starlight with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: silence as language, maps that tear between known/unknown, questions rather than answers. The vault-as-asking rather than cursed is earned through Maren's concrete observation (shifted stone, question-mark cracks) and her disciplined interpretation. The final image—stepping through the torn map into the gap—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication ("shielded openness," leaving doors open). One potential slip: "methodically marking where knowledge ended and mystery began" edges toward abstraction, but the fresco work and henge gap anchor it in specifics. No Thematic Echo penalties; prompt language is dramatized, not restated.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme (the impossibility of closure through solving mysteries) emerges from concrete particulars: Amelia's corroded fuselage that brought hollow recognition, the ruined journal preserved-and-destroyed, the two waters separated by glass in perfect equilibrium. The final image (snow globe returned, airplane suspended mid-flight) offers a resonant non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates cleanly in the notebook exchange and the physics metaphor. Minor: "physics of letting go" appears as phrase twice, risking label-speak, but the concept is dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (isolation, voice, connection through art) emerges from concrete particulars—the flower press, encoded graffiti, the ghost's silence. The final image (ghost painting thanks in light) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, "articulate unspoken needs" and "voice waiting to be encoded into wonder" veer toward prompt-echo and abstract thesis. The ghost's loneliness is told more than dramatized; no counter-reading complicates the theme. Subtext operates in the encoded symbols but the emotional resolution is tidy rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the captain's diary method (noticing people, transforming grief through connection) and Maren's decision to adopt it. The goggles and scattered light function as purposeful motifs that shift meaning at the ending, avoiding token recurrence. The final image—"every frozen corridor, every forgotten soul"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. One penalty: "the whole spire remembered what it meant to be fully, messily, affectionately alive" edges toward thematic statement rather than letting the image speak, though the preceding particulars (goggles, diary, elevator choice) anchor it sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from particulars: atmospheric memory is proven through virga ("rain that never landed still left its impression"), the grandfather's conviction, and Elena's electromagnetic signatures. The core concept "spooled wholeness" integrates organically—storms "remembering every previous storm." Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer: "The empty spaces weren't empty. They were full of everything the sky had ever felt, spooled into wholeness, waiting for someone to finally name what they'd always been." No overt thesis; the memorial framing ties personal loss to scientific proof without sentimentality. Subtext in "To memorialize meant to acknowledge, to insist something existed even when others couldn't see it."

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of precision and recognition, skill and understanding, without overt statement until the earned line "Some limits, she'd learned, define us more truly than our gifts." The star-reflection addition offers a non-literal answer to the central question (can technique replace recognition?) by reweighting the attempt itself as the truth. Recurring images—fractals, indentations, the sky, the coin—accumulate meaning through specificity rather than symbolic convenience. The empty book safe seeds the insight that "some knowledge couldn't be stored or transferred," a realization that grows from concrete discovery. The ending resists moralizing; the final image (carrying canvas and coin into morning light) charges prior material without explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—the tension between discovery and survival, between mapping truth and protecting oneself—emerges organically from the hopscotch puzzle and Mara's fate without overt statement. The starling murmuration functions as a non-literal motif (patterns that dissolve and reform, impossible to capture) and the final callback reweights the opening image with earned irony: Celeste must become a pattern that hides to survive. The phrasebook's "seventeen tongues" line recurs with fresh meaning ("seventeen different ways of saying *here be something wonderful*"). Subtext operates cleanly in Celeste's cautious final plan. No moralizing; the ending offers a resonant answer to the cost of curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—beauty and function through fracture, repair as translation—emerges from concrete actions (filing the meteor gear, accepting syncopation) and images (driftwood, infinite reflections, gear teeth/ocean waves). The prophecy scraps promise "someone would remember how to listen," paid off when Miren matches "broken rhythms with patient hands." The final image reweights prior material: imperfect repair as viable answer, "time, like moonlight, could be coaxed back into beauty." No overt moralizing; the ending trusts image and earned consequence. Subtext operates in silence (mechanism's "steady tick") and implication (other mechanisms wait, carrying forward fragility).

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—interdependence and collective resilience—emerges organically from Mara's orchestration and the settlers' gradual reunion. The nebula line ("sometimes respite isn't a place…") borders on overt thematic statement but is anchored in the concrete image of the western arch. Subtext operates in the unsigned chalk messages and the settlers' tentative trust. The final bell-ringing offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The closing sentence risks slight sermonizing ("there was still so much work to do") but remains grounded in character motive.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—humanity's fragile proximity to extinction, the nested nature of causation, and the burden of stewardship—emerges through images (puppet head's cracked smile, fractal waves, lighthouse beam's rhythm) and the protagonist's reflections. The puppet head as a "beautifully flawed" witness and the "whispered lullaby threaded through probability" carry metaphoric weight without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph's "We sang our song" and "someone might hear the lullaby" edge toward thematic summary, and the piece does not pose a hard question that the ending reweights through a concrete turn. The resonance is present but operates more as atmosphere than as a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of "graceless beauty" and finding purpose in inherited curses emerges organically through the orchard's broken functionality and Maren's reluctant role. The recurring nut as fragment and the uncle's "impressions without touching" offer a subtle metaphor for indirect legacy. However, the final paragraph edges into explicit moralizing: "not a burden, but a gift" and "her own forgotten blueprint" state the theme rather than letting the image speak. The piece resists a tidy moral overall, but the ending's declaration undercuts the subtext. The orchard's hostile beauty is shown through action and image—twisted trees, bronze birds, frost as lethal constraint—but the thematic answer is told rather than resonating from the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the braided ravine's structure, foam patterns, and the chrysalis embody the separation/connection dialectic without stating it directly. The five-channel scattering enacts the theme through specific action rather than explanation. The final image (humming Leah's melody, hands conducting) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how Maya can live within grief. Minor deduction: "movements in the same symphony" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward explicit thematic statement, though it's integrated into Maya's train of thought.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of clean slates and the space between past and future is articulated through images (bottled darkness, incised absence, transparent fruit) and Vera's dialogue. However, much of the thematic work is delivered as direct statement: "A blank page exists not because there's whiteness, but because there's nothing written yet" and "we measure what isn't there to understand what could be" are mini-lectures rather than discoveries earned through conflict. The final image of clouds scattering and reforming offers a visual parallel but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer; instead, it restates the premise. The customer's journey remains potential, not realized, so the story circles its question without committing to an answer.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the coral-ice metaphor and the tension between remembering and forgetting, touching and being consumed. The final image—"only tears...his own, this time, and bearable"—offers a resonant answer to the central question about bearing unbearable memories without explicit moralizing. Subtext operates in Amira's careful distance and Maron's recognition that "some gifts required the desert, the rain, and the courage to touch." The piece resists tidy resolution; memories are smoothed, not erased. Minor issue: "sandpaper the rough memories smooth" verges on stating the thesis too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—harmony forged from isolation through one person's risk—emerges from concrete acts (attaching the weight, layering recordings) rather than abstraction, and the grain elevators' literal song avoids allegorical flatness by grounding the metaphor in ventilation physics. The line "sometimes bridges required one person willing to risk disharmony to find deeper harmony" edges toward thesis statement but remains embedded in reflection rather than dialogue. The final image (cuckoo weight swinging, Mara planning tomorrow's composition) reweights the tower's role from preservation to conducting, offering a resonant answer without overt moral. No motif is token; each object (weight, recordings, elevators) participates causally.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—memory, ambition, recovery of lost dreams—emerges through the periscope mirror and layered ghost-memories (Robert, Sarah, the geologist). However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "proving that nothing was ever truly lost—only waiting to be found again." This thematic echo in prompt-like language (−0.6) replaces earned resonance with summary. The helix/synaptic plasticity motif recurs but functions more as ornament than constraint; no concrete particular forces Elena to confront a cost or contradiction that would deepen the premise non-literally.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—hidden knowledge, the archivist as keeper of marginal truths—emerges from concrete action: the doodle, the grotto, the threshold effect. The piece resists overt moralizing until the final paragraph, where "she would plant them where they belonged" edges toward mission statement. The "prism-minded" metaphor recurs but is more asserted than embodied in contradictory perception. The ending offers a resonant image (combinations burning into memory) but then dilutes it with future-tense summary, weakening the non-literal answer the closure might have delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: "beauty could emerge from breaking, that stress and damage could be transformed into song" arises from Maren's method rather than assertion. The porcelain insulators function as more than props—their cracks embody the thematic question of how empathy and patience can resurrect lost music. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: birds that "had never known but somehow recognized" the music suggest transmission beyond conscious memory. No overt moralizing; the piece resists tidy binaries and allows ambiguity (will the birds sing again, or only listen?). The ending reweights prior material—"hidden music" and "teach it to sing again"—without summarizing the thesis, meeting the 9+ test for Q5.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges from particulars: consent built on suppressed fear, the chess metaphor (twelve moves ahead vs. the courage to voice the unvoiced), and the worry stone's "imperfect weight." The final image—"the most profound beauty lay not in perfect strategy, but in the courage to translate what others feared to voice"—risks overt statement but is anchored by the five distinct silences Kavir hears and the dramatic handoff to the daughter. The "difficult beauty" motif recurs purposefully and the ending reweights the exile's cost without moralizing the covenant's fate. Slight penalty for "hopeful melancholy" label in exposition and the near-thesis phrasing in the penultimate paragraph, but the resonance is earned by prior scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (empathy as listening, not demanding) emerges through image and action: the brass clasp, varieties of silence, the radio frequencies. The diary's first line ("I was never silent. You just didn't know my frequency") answers the central question without moralizing. Marlow's realization that "recovery" means recovering her own capacity to hear, not extracting secrets, reconfigures prior material. One small slip: "the path to empathy... wound through all the small violences of misunderstanding" edges toward abstraction mid-story, though the ending restores concrete resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme emerges organically through the corpse flower's paradox: beauty through decay, serenity through discomfort. "Wisdom asks us to endure what we cannot control" crystallizes from concrete experience rather than arriving as platitude. The framed doodled wrapping paper and seven-year journal anchor the theme in particulars. However, the final paragraph edges toward direct thematic statement ("in that endurance, find not stillness, but grace") where a purely image-based resonance would have been stronger. The undercurrent metaphor works through the journaling practice and the flower's teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of resilience as multi-state temporal existence emerges organically from the orchard's adaptations and the Cultivators' demonstration. The broken arrow tip and water flows serve as concrete anchors rather than abstract symbols. The final insight—"resilience wasn't about resistance, but about existing across multiple states"—edges toward thesis statement but is grounded in the visual particulars of seeds drawing strength from temporal echoes. The completion motif ("Its echo had found completion") charges the ending without moralizing, and the sphere's pulsing temporal energy offers a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of foresight versus hindsight emerges through concrete investigation rather than statement, with the container labyrinth serving as physical manifestation of hidden systemic architecture. The father's patch anchors the thematic question without becoming overt symbolism. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement—"cultivating foresight," "architecture of disaster"—where the image of changing wind direction would carry more resonance alone. The piece resists easy morals but the closing beat explicates what the investigation sequence has already dramatized. Hazy precision as concept works better in action than in the final meta-reference.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—wonder as survival necessity—emerges through the sculpted hush and prism-song bells rather than direct statement. The final image of bells as "chisel strikes against the marble of forgetting" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the ending paragraph's explicit moralizing ("she hadn't saved the bells... had saved them all") states the theme rather than trusting the image, and "certify wonder as essential" reads as prompt-like language. The sculpted hush as "silence so rich it contained every possible song" is evocative but borders on abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (purpose through failure, doors versus keeping) emerges organically from the flute's mechanics and Maren's realization. The final image ("doors opening between forever") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Failure's patient teaching" risks abstraction but remains anchored in fifteen years of inert ritual. The weaving-worlds concept integrates thematically without symbolic overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—emotion as universal force, the mathematics of feeling—emerges from the operator's work but remains asserted rather than tested. The equations ("Love equaled fear plus hope divided by distance") are declared insights, not earned through struggle or dramatized friction. The final image offers conceptual resonance but no non-literal answer that reweights prior material; it simply extends the opening metaphor. No counter-reading or moral ambiguity complicates the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the vibration metaphor and the contrast between routine transactions and transformative encounters. The "fade from memory to myth" operates as genuine complexity rather than stated moral, and Venn's deliberate disappearance offers meaningful ambiguity. The seed-planting decision at the end provides a non-literal answer to the question of how wonder propagates. However, the Keeper's final-third exposition ("Relics don't carry magic between destinations...") approaches theme summary, and "germinate wonder in the spaces between routine transactions" borders on abstraction. The piece resists false balance and earns its insights through specific encounters, lifting it above mid-band despite the expository slip.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—grief and memory crystallized in objects—emerges organically through Hartley's backstory and the frost patterns, avoiding overt statement. The prism functions as a recurring image that shifts meaning (validation tool, then shared evidence), and the arbor's closing line attempts resonance. However, the ending offers expository closure ("some things can't be proven... only witnessed") rather than a non-literal final image that reweights the question. The thematic question is clear but the answer is stated, not embodied. Subtext operates in Hartley's trembling hand and Elena's silent validation, yet the final beat summarizes rather than charges.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: weaving as connection, the spaces between worlds, the latent sacrifice required to hold the door. The amber bead and jigsaw frame recur with shifted weight at closure. The final image—crossing with "her message of remembered songs and unbroken bonds"—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. No overt thematic statements intrude, though "raveling silence welcomed her home" risks poeticism. The core question of cost and connection is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of coaxing resilience from rubble, remembering survival, and quiet perseverance emerges from concrete particulars (crystallized sap, the silk's stored patterns, Mira's forge work). The final image—arches framing hope—states rather than embodies the thematic shift. "Quietly determined" and "overlooked" are asserted but not tested by friction; no counter-reading complicates the triumph. The resonance is present but tilts toward overt moral rather than non-literal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through the shard's mechanics and the sister's sacrifice: love measured against existence, individual retrieval versus infinite variation. "Some truths, once discovered, demanded impossible choices" risks direct statement but is earned by prior imagery. The final line ("tasted like goodbye") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The green shard shifts from key to burden across beats, charging the closure without symbolic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through the letter bundle, stone cairns, sea glass, and Vera's realization: isolated people protect strangers while barely holding themselves together, and witnessing others' truths without offering your own is a form of hiding. The sea glass image—"sharp edges into something gentle"—charges the final choice without stating a moral. Marcus's page, "describing how he came here to bottle the feeling of safety," mirrors Vera's cargo of loneliness. The signed page and tucked sea glass answer the central question (how do you stop protecting everyone but yourself?) through concrete action. "She meant the chain would continue, this lighthouse of words passing light between isolated hearts" risks theme-echo but remains embedded in scene action (stone-stacking promise) and doesn't flatten into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—light as teacher of darkness, ritual holding time's boundary, accidental prophecy—emerges organically from the lighthouse mechanics and Kael's laughter. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the green dawn and "shadows that taught them where to place their light" reconfigure the premise without moralizing. However, the thematic question remains abstract; the story invites reflection but the final image leans toward symbolic assertion rather than embodied cost. No diagnostic label-speak mars the prose, and the lighthouse's dual function (warning/prophecy) integrates smoothly, preventing a lower score.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (attention as transformative burden, listening as structural illumination) emerges organically from the morpho-wing metaphor, Yuki's legacy, and Chen's pattern-recognition work. The "iridescent caution" and "quietly explosive" motifs accumulate and charge the final image without stating a moral. The ending's "to illuminate the hidden architectures of human need" skirts thesis-statement territory but remains grounded in Chen's teaching offer and Mira's internal acceptance. No overt thematic echo in dialogue, and the piece resists tidy resolution—Mira's journey is framed as beginning rather than complete. One small slip: "legacy" and "gift" language edges toward prompt-echo phrasing but stays within voice.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: sorrow can be measured, witnessed, and healed through patient work. The sextant's brokenness-as-new-function and the moonlight transformation avoid didacticism. The final image—"sorrow could be measured, witnessed, and healed... This was the work—mundane, miraculous, necessary"—risks mild thematic statement but remains grounded in Mara's concrete labor and the fountain image. The piece resists false equivalence (the labyrinth's function is affirmed, not questioned) and the ending reconfigures "maintenance" from janitorial duty to sacred stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the woven-dawns metaphor: communities survive by binding shared memory and knowing when to release. The line "holding on too tightly was its own prison" offers insight without didacticism, and the final image—ten thousand voices carrying the song—answers the thematic question through action rather than summary. The fruit-as-collective-hope and the oak-as-threshold work as purposeful motifs, though the "how communities survived" framing in paragraph six edges toward gentle moralizing. No thematic echo penalty; the ending trusts the image.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the "compassionate recluse" paradox without sermon. The woman's line "Staying while leaving wasn't your mistake. Your mistake was thinking they were the same thing" reframes prior material through scene particulars. The library as physical nestled-paradox architecture embodies rather than declares theme. The blank book and "You're learning to stay by choosing when to go" offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor penalty: "hiding so we're visible" edges toward overt thematic echo in the woman's dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme (sacred in the ordinary, transformation vs. preservation) emerges organically from the bread, guerrilla gardens, and Mira's journals without thesis statements. "Tenuous absolution" and "forgiving myself for remembering" avoid platitude by rooting in the woman's archive loss and Mira's three-year grief. The final image—seeds as absolution, sunflowers as guerrilla monument—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "making beauty of the impossible present" in the final line edges toward purple thematic announcement rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars: frequencies declining versus the one that holds, official ledger versus private journal, documenting fade versus watching for endurance. The final image offers a non-literal answer to whether meaning survives memory without stating a moral. "Luminous vows" recurs with shifting weight but never as thesis. The extraordinary slide earns its thematic charge through prior measurements. Minor deduction: "proof that meaning could survive" edges toward articulation where image alone would resonate more.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—trust as volatile currency, the cost of silence, inheritance of a runner's discipline—emerges from particulars: the fob as three-generation token, the market's economy of secrets, the truce held "because it had to." The final image (carrying her father's silence like armor, climbing toward morning) reweights prior material without stating a moral, meeting the resonance gate. One slip: "trust a currency more volatile than any barrel" and "comforting unease" edge toward stock phrasing, lowering thematic sharpness slightly. No overt sermonizing; complexity is preserved in the uneasy peace.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: forests voting through roots, humans sensing via taste, weather-carriers as planetary communication. The compass's shift from "useless" to finder-of-weather-carriers reweights the grandmother's gift without stating a moral. The closing image—"human and more-than-human democracy converged"—offers a resonant answer to whether weather-carriers are chosen, not cursed. "The future tasted like home...simultaneously ancient and impossibly new" risks thematic summary but remains grounded in the established taste-perception system. The piece resists binary resolution by leaving the mechanism mysterious while confirming its purposefulness.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—memory as prison versus wonder, suppressed creativity seeking release—emerges organically from the mother's hidden painting and Elena's mnemonic gift. The final image (transforming catalogued strangers into blazing mythic figures) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The broken lock as metaphor works without over-signaling. One slip: "Some things aren't meant to be locked away" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward a thematic summary, though the preceding scene work supports it. The piece resists tidy resolution and embraces complexity in the mother's medication-blurred years.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of candor versus polite fiction emerges organically through Mira's profession (permanent words on gilded leaves), her physical reaction to lies, and the Archive's function. The "words we swallow don't disappear, they settle" line and the glass vessels create a resonant image without overt moralizing. The final question—"But they're still unspoken"—introduces complexity, and Mira's decision to help deliver them offers a non-literal answer. The closure reweights the premise (preservation versus delivery) with undeniable pressure, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—truth through imperfect resonance rather than verbal precision—emerges from the ice's effect on bronze without thematic statements until the very end. The closing line "heard everything humanity had lost and everything it had found in the letting go" skirts moralizing but remains anchored in the bell's vibration. Subtext operates in gesture (pilgrim's throat-touch, Mira's "wordless smile") and the contrast between her perfect tunings and the richer, human tones. The final image reweights the opening quest with quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: containment vs. transformation, fragmented wholeness embodied in the roses, the box, and M4-RY's own state. The piece resists tidy resolution—"harmony, discordant, incomplete, but purposeful" avoids the explain-everything trap. The burial among "strangely alive" roses offers a non-literal answer to whether erasure can free the self: the photograph becomes part of what grows, not what burns. "Tending the garden built from both" in the penultimate paragraph risks slight over-articulation but earns it through prior image-work. The closing image (watering the roses) resonates without moralizing, reweighting all rose mentions with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of community preservation through listening emerges from the courtyard ritual and Mrs. Chen's archival foresight. The locket-as-connective-tissue and "things carry meaning" motif support the premise. However, the final paragraph ("sandstorm would pass") borders on stated moral rather than image-driven resonance. "Listening heals" is asserted in the opening and closing without complication. The piece invites reflection on solidarity but stops short of a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of encryption-as-liberation and vulnerability-as-strength is articulated directly ("encrypt vulnerability as strength," "transformed confession into armor") rather than emerging from concrete choices under pressure. The grandfather's legacy and spider-web patience gesture toward thematic depth, but the piece states rather than enacts its ideas. The ending's garden-poem schematic is told in summary without a non-literal final image that reweights prior material. Some resonance in the water-as-preservation motif, but it does not constrain choice or charge closure with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme (what happens to deleted things) emerges through concrete images—the whale as repository, memories crystallized as salt, gravity as measure of absence—without abstraction. The diviners' claim "deleted memories had to go somewhere" is tested and answered through Maris's discovery and choice. The ending offers non-literal resolution: she doesn't retrieve memories to the surface but joins them in "recovered time," reweighting the entire search. The final image (lanterns burning steady, gravity holding true) answers the opening instability through her sacrifice without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of solitary labor, silence as cultivation, and unseen guardianship emerges organically from the summoner's actions and final return to folding. The closing line—"silence, like any garden, required constant tending"—reweights the entire ritual as perpetual rather than one-time, answering the thematic question without moralizing. The wing-as-trapped-potential and the valley's buried name provide concrete particulars that resist abstraction. Subtext operates in the summoner's acceptance of thankless work and the elegiac tone of "no one would thank her." The piece invites reflection on hidden caretakers and the cost of peace without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "agreed upon lies" concept operates at multiple scales—Elena's transparent excuse, the cornerstone inscriptions promising permanence, the academic cover for occult inheritance—and the final image (seal as key, buildings humming approval) answers the thematic question through concrete particulars without stating a moral. The language motif (dead/dying, Latin/hidden language, remembering versus learning) accumulates pressure and reweights at closure when Elena shifts from "explain it away" to "teach me the real language." Subtext operates cleanly in Mrs. Kovac's patient observations and the grandmother's construction-site ritual, avoiding thematic echo or thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from Mira's actions and the garden's images: love as dangerous synchronicity, preservation as resistance, isolation vs. independence. The recurring shell and moonflowers shift meaning at the end (two pieces forever separated, forever connected), charging the closure without a stated moral. The final image—garden whispering, Mira writing her refusal at dawn—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether preservation can be shared or must remain solitary. Subtext operates in gesture (placing the shell at the center) and implication (the sister's erasure as the government's cure). Minor friction: "translate isolation into independence" risks thematic echo, but the line is Mira's internal framing rather than authorial summary, and the ending complicates rather than confirms her claim.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of "forgiving the unfinished" emerges organically from the Magistrate's dying predecessor and Mei's inherited work. However, the Magistrate's late-scene monologue makes the thematic question too explicit: "Perhaps he meant something else" and "Sometimes wisdom means enduring the necessary betrayal" veer toward statement rather than image. The heritage rose metaphor (thorns that "drew blood wisely, enduring through drought and flood") is purposeful but edges close to overt symbolism. The final image of the rose blooming "defiantly under the aurora, its thorns gleaming like promises kept" offers resonance, though "promises kept" risks stating the theme rather than letting it emerge from particulars alone.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—connection, witnessing, the price of solitude—emerges organically from the shell's revelations and Mara's realization about her sister. The sister's recorded message ("echoes require two things—a voice and a listener") verges on thematic statement but is framed as dialogue, mitigating directness. The ending's commitment to teaching and communal listening offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing, though the cost remains implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—salvaging love and truth from loss—emerges organically from the snow globe's history, Katherine's pocket memory, and Maya's ritual practice. The final image ("some things survive even drowning") reweights prior material without overt moralizing, and the juxtaposition of "borrowed starlight" returning to "distant stars" offers resonance. However, the thematic answer is delivered via narration in the penultimate paragraph ("She salvaged stories...built windows") rather than fully enacted through the closure beat. The piece avoids banality and sustains complexity (Evelyn's lifelong misbelief, Katherine's guilt), but the ending tilts toward articulation of theme rather than letting the final action alone speak it.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of hidden effort and intergenerational transmission emerges through concrete particulars: net knots, whisk spirals, moon paths, firefly geometries. The ending offers a non-literal answer—shared silence becomes holy through appreciation of what's hidden—without moralizing. Minor slip: phrases like "demure audacity" and "scintillatingly somber" occasionally announce theme rather than letting it accumulate purely through image. The grandmother's melody, the monk's gift, and the fireflies' indifferent beauty all layer meaning without becoming allegorical placeholders.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the premise: "Some truths needed excavating. Others needed guardians." The flawed diamond functions as more than symbol—it's a concrete object whose imperfection creates unexpected good, paralleling Vera's shift from exposing all lies to preserving useful mysteries. The final image reweights the opening: she debunks the curse but leaves the miracle intact, a non-literal answer that carries conceptual cost (her professional identity bends). No explicit moralizing; the resonance arises from the particulars of the investigation and the diamond's dual nature.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—choosing ancient shadows over comfortable certainty—emerges through Elara's isolation and the prophet's riddles, but the final paragraph states it outright: "The rise had begun. The allegiance had shifted." This crosses into thematic echo, reducing resonance. The cobalt glass as witness/lens is a promising motif, but it doesn't constrain a choice or reweight meaning at closure; it remains decorative. The prophet's test is asserted in retrospect rather than earned through scene pressure, weakening the central question's dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of "gleaned redemption" emerges through concrete particulars: salvaged furniture, captured sounds, and the music box gift. The final image—"purpose salvaged from the wreckage of her fall"—resonates without overt moralizing, reweighting her poverty as chosen vocation. The lullaby's inter-generational transmission ("teach it forward") answers the central question of bridging silence and memory with visible cost (the box changes hands). Subtext operates in the jar-opening ritual and Mrs. Chen's tears. Minor slip: "positively wistful" as meta-commentary feels slightly over-articulated, though it functions within the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of guardianship and the ethical weight of powerful knowledge emerges through concrete action: Meris's discovery, her calibration work, and her final choice to embody protection. The "sonic absolution" concept raises interesting questions about mercy versus erasure, guilt versus innocence, though these remain more atmospheric than dramatized in competing choices. The ending image—"the key had become part of her, its frequency forever locked to her living pulse"—offers resonance without overt moralizing. However, the "fleshly ethereal knowing that lived in her marrow" and similar phrases veer toward abstraction, and the thematic question (what makes an artifact worth guarding at personal cost?) is more asserted than tested through competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the moon-path work: patience as radical act, tradition expanded rather than rejected. The recurring viaduct and basalt walls anchor abstraction in concrete images. "Sculpt patience from impatience" is stated early but then demonstrated through nightly ritual and the ice-forming metaphor at closure. The final paragraph risks moralizing ("The patient revolution had no battles") but the preceding image work earns the resonance. Subtext operates in the gap between Ren's solitary certainty and the unseen village council. No diagnostic label-speak or thematic echo in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of control, complicity, and breaking free emerges through concrete particulars: the lantern's "safe passage" inscription, Malcolm's documentation of memory manipulation, Elena's recognition of "reverberation" in her own experience. The final image of the lantern casting freedom-guiding shadows offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. "Some paths get walked more than once" verges on overt statement but remains grounded in the historical-present convergence. No label-speak in peak beats; the water metaphor (drought ending, washing into the open) functions without forced symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—second chances, the ethics of judgment, restoration as honoring original purpose—emerges organically from the clockwork heart's journey and Eliana's shift from expertise-driven certainty to humility. The grandfather's letter ("every mechanism carries the memory of its original purpose") functions thematically without overt moralizing. The heart's design (deliberate weak points that "broke trying to protect itself") offers concrete metaphor without shouting. The ending resists tidy resolution: the heart will "beat there, as witness to the second chances we failed to give," charging the final image with unresolved moral weight. The line "learning what things truly deserve" borders on theme-statement but is anchored in Eliana's tactile, months-long labor. Subtext operates in Marcus's quiet witness and the shop's "gentle cacophony of healing time."

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—longing as creative force, the audacity to imagine the impossible—emerges through the yearning algorithm, the hunter's arrow tip (ancient longing made sharp), and the kaleidoscope's refracted approach. The bell-tower image and Mal's laugh ("of course it only existed because she'd built a machine to hear it") offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The mentor's phrase "ring a bell no one hears yet" recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, deepening thematic coherence. Minor drift: "evolution of everything" in the final line abstracts what had been concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between digital preservation and true transcendence, deletion versus transformation. The "spaces between deletion and forever" motif recurs with escalating meaning, and the final image of Elena archiving herself offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about where deleted files go. The phrase "hearing the old songs again" functions as coded invitation rather than heavy-handed symbol. One minor slip: "the truth was too large for reports" edges toward direct statement, but the surrounding imagery earns the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—choosing empathy over inherited rage, seeing the "weighted breath before reply" where cruelty or kindness emerge—arises from concrete images (mirrors, fragment, apple blossoms) without overt thesis. The contrast between Thomas's shattered foresight and Maren's reconstructed purpose is elegant and earned. The final image of apple blossoms reflecting "two families remembering how to choose" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "reconstitute what Thomas had broken—not the crystal ball itself, but its purpose" edges toward explaining the theme rather than letting the mirrors and fragment do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the parasol's dual uses (hiding/letting go), the hum beneath sounds, villages approaching final seasons juxtaposed with children playing on ice. The line "The endings don't erase what came before" avoids abstraction by anchoring in Dr. Henriksen's patients and on-page observation. The final image—parasol tip worn smoother, hollow spaces searched not for hiding but for presence—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "life insisting she finally, fully, listen" edges toward thesis statement, though it grows from prior sensory work.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "destined mismatches" theme emerges through the vineyard metaphor and builds across the conversation. However, the final paragraph over-explicates: "learning to honor the space between them" and "beautiful mistakes that had become something true" state the theme rather than letting the image resonate. The Pinot Noir parallel (stress creating complexity) is purposeful but heavily guided. The ending offers a conceptual answer but with diminished subtlety due to summary assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the conjured clearings metaphor: spaces of gathering without prescription, sustained by peripheral awareness and collective attention rather than rigid ritual. The final image "spaces conjured from nothing, preserved through the simple act of believing in what existed at the edge of sight" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the prophet's absence as a gift of method rather than loss. Subtext operates in the half-mask's symbolism (line walker between known and sensed), the pavilion's breathing fabric, and the whisperfield calm that settles "like snow." No thematic echo or diagnostic label-speak in peak beats. The consecration earns its insight through prior mapping and ritual particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of transformation through collective acts of imagination emerges organically from the photograph exercise and the factory-into-garden imagery, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraph's "beautiful, necessary work of beginning again," which edges toward thematic summary. The arcs-as-uncertainty motif is purposeful and recurs with shifting weight (photographs, factory beams, townspeople's lives), and the ending offers a resonant image of lingering in bloom rather than a stated lesson. However, the piece resolves into a tidy affirmation without ambiguity or counter-reading; no character resists or complicates the healing premise, and the thematic question "what comes after loss?" receives a unanimous answer. The conceptual cost of sustained grief or the difficulty of communal vulnerability is asserted but not dramatized with friction.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (linguistic metamorphosis, breaking as prerequisite for growth) emerges through concrete particulars: children's fractured speech, the shattered crystal, dictionaries as pressed flowers. The final image—Elara positioned between waiting Council and dreaming books—offers a non-literal answer without stating a moral, reweighting "breaking" as "bloom." No thematic echo or moralizing intrudes. Subtext operates in the crystal's hum, the library's whisper, and her reticent stance. The weathered-innocence concept charges the children's speech without becoming a stated thesis. One hairline slip: "evidence that language was alive" borders on abstract assertion, though it's anchored to the resonator's projection.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: videotapes degrading, fog dissolving, futures forgotten before arrival. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"the sound of growing older" is not a note but the silence of unwatched tapes and fading echoes—without stating a moral. The seashell simile in the final beat ("imperfectly, approximately, but with absolute devotion") reweights prior material and avoids tidy resolution. The recurring chalk, fog, and driftwood accrue pressure rather than arrive as late symbols. Minor deduction: "tidal longing" is named directly in paragraph six, edging toward theme statement, though it remains anchored in sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme (impermanence, witnessing versus capturing, accepting escape velocity) emerges organically from the spinning hand's refusal to still and Kenji's decision to follow rather than fight. The grandmother's teaching and the clock hand/orrery form a resonant through-line without overt symbolism. The final image—"capturing light across the growing distance until even that ephemeral thread finally broke"—reweights the opening desire to "harness the ephemeral" with earned melancholy, offering a non-literal answer. No thematic statements intrude; the prose allows complexity (beauty in departure, loss in witnessing).

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—reconciliation through mundane specificity rather than grand gesture—emerges organically from Maya's counsel and Mr. Chen's letter. The "hymning of mundane moments" and the broken vinyl held together offer a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates in Maya's playing ("the rhythm of pancake batter stirring") and the fragments that "no longer separate" but "not quite fitting." The final image reweights prior material without overt moralizing. A minor slip: "The scent of hope…smells like Sunday mornings" edges toward thematic echo, but remains tied to concrete detail (pancakes, spatula conducting) rather than abstract thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the "sealed awakening" premise: shadows don't vanish but transform into connection when all loops close. The final image—shadows as "luminous threads that connected every object"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The metaphor of relearning and closing circuits braids character action (Mira's decipherment) with world logic (the observatory's fractured cycle). Minor slip: "so many more awakenings waiting to be unsealed" in the closing line edges toward thematic echo, though it remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of certainty versus productive doubt emerges through concrete particulars: the straw substitute, Marianne's examining fingers that "felt wrong," grandmother's journals, bone-setting metaphor. "Turn your mistakes into constellations" recurs with earned weight—first as dismissed comfort, then as literal task. However, the final paragraph drifts toward abstract statement ("how to make light from fractures, how to transform every mistake into something that could guide others home") where a charged image would serve better. The piece invites reflection on epistemological humility but occasionally tells rather than showing the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—transformation of loss through patient, material care—emerges from Maren's actions and the recurring sea-glass motif. The colored-shadows callback to Elena's question ("why stars couldn't paint the ground in colors too") reweights the opening grief with earned consolation. Subtext operates in the daughter's unnamed presence and the phrase "a little girl smiled" in the final line, which implies memory without overt statement. Minor slip: "reflectively vibrant" and "zephyr bloom" feel slightly label-like in their prompt-fulfillment role, and the penultimate paragraph's "Tomorrow…Tomorrow…Tomorrow" anaphora inches toward thematic summary rather than scene pressure. Still, the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of transformation through tending failure emerges organically from the moss-consumed machines and icicle patterns. The piece resists overt moralizing, though phrases like "meaning wasn't found or given—it was grafted" and "two witnesses learning to dream awake" edge toward thesis statement. The amber pendant and drip patterns recur with shifting valence, and the final image offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the notebook's revelation that Jenna "understood" and "admired" Maya's observation softens the ambiguity and delivers thematic comfort rather than earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly from the parade of hope-shapes and the shell's mathematics of interrupted growth. The ending resists a stated moral—"not an ending, but the truth that made ending possible"—and the final image of the novelist turning toward home with the shell in her pocket reweights the mercy/vengeance binary without preaching. The core question (what shape of hope her character carries) is answered non-literally through the mist-figures. Minor slip: "the hope that witnessing mattered, that memory was a kind of keeping" edges toward overt articulation in the penultimate paragraph, though it stops short of sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of remembering/forgetting emerges organically through the grandmother's notebooks, ritual mechanics, and the village's dismissal. The golden vine and dawn timing function as purposeful motifs that reweight at closure. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("some engineering required more than gears—it required faith") over-articulates what the vine imagery already demonstrated. The piece earns its central question—can mechanical means restore organic practices—but the ending shifts from scene pressure to thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of transformation through patience and the persistence of hope in wounded land emerges organically from the ritual and imagery. The recurring motif of captured starlight (photons from galaxy birth now bound in paper) and the orchard's "root-dreams" create thematic texture without overt moralizing. The final image—maps sealed in the tree's hollow as a promise—offers a resonant answer to the implicit question of how to preserve longing against erasure. However, the piece leans toward thematic statement ("The orchard would remember what it meant to bloom") rather than letting the image fully carry the weight, and the stakes remain more conceptual than urgently felt.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the marble's capacity to hold temporal echoes parallels the human need to store hope against despair. The timer mechanism becomes a concrete answer to "how do we endure" without moralizing. The final image—reflections blooming like flowers, ghosts of resilience—reweights the wounded season as one cycle in a longer pattern. Marcus's line "wonder itself was a resource that needed storing" risks thematic echo but is rescued by immediate return to tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of transformation through witness and containment emerges from the burdens' calcification, the kerosene burner as inherited witness, and the protagonist's shift from weaver to container. The final image—"stars continued their ancient calcification, freezing light into the vast dark, each one a burden that had found its proper angle and chosen to shine anyway"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to hold unbearable weight. "Shingled hush" and "whalebone reverie" recur with shifted meaning, deepening the acoustic and oceanic metaphors. The grandmother's lamp-reading and coughing husband ground the abstraction in specific human cost. No overt moralizing; the piece resists tidy resolution by leaving the crystals behind as offerings rather than claiming transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: "here and gone" transforms from absence to presence-through-transformation via the wood's rings, the bowl's imperfection, and Roland's journals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"making space for what's gone is how you hold what remains"—through the bowl's form rather than statement. Subtext operates in the uncarved bark patch, the uneven rim, and the kettles scream as punctuation. No moralizing; the rust-hued peace deepens without resolving into tidy binaries. One small deduction: "That making space for what's gone is how you hold what remains" skirts thematic articulation, though it remains image-adjacent and doesn't fully collapse into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—transformation without direction as disintegration, acceptance versus negotiation—emerges through Mira's fragment-collection, the carousel's halt, and the ghost encounter without overt thesis statements. The final image (lagoon stilling, "everything began to move") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: acceptance enables motion where negotiation stalled. The camera wheel's broken film and Mira's scavenged stories function thematically without becoming allegory. One slip: "regret tasted like cloud-mist" verges on abstraction, and the phrase "transformation without direction was just disintegration" edges toward articulation rather than full dramatization, though it's brief and character-voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through water's redirected flow, the sextant's navigation metaphor, and the terminal's "maze of intentions"—all charging the question of whether decay can become generative rather than terminal. The final image (green/gray, voices/echo) offers a non-literal answer: hope is an equation built from scavenged instruments and shadow infrastructure, not demolition. Subtext operates in Lena's pocketing the sextant (claiming explorer identity) and her night-long drafting (staking self against institutional inertia). No overt thesis statement; the carnival's brief resurrection primes without explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—creative courage versus safe labor, the cost of buried dreams—emerges organically from the sketchbook, the crystals, and the protagonist's confession. The image of "clocks that measured heartbeats instead of hours" and the final sketch of a timepiece showing "both sunrise and sunset" offer resonant, non-literal answers to the central question without stating a moral. The line "making peace didn't mean forgetting. It meant acknowledging" edges toward thesis-statement clarity, docking the score slightly. Otherwise, the particulars (rain-soaked courtyard, contraband drawings, trembling hands) ground the theme without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the architecture-of-lies conceit: Viktor's genius lay in misdirection, negative space, and collective blindness. The final image—"secrets it held beneath its thoughtfully clear surface"—reweights the premise without overt moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in phrases like "architecture of lies he'd left behind wasn't about false buildings" and "frames that directed attention away." However, the epiphany feels somewhat announced rather than earned through a specific costly choice. Lines like "lies weren't obstacles to truth but pathways toward it" verge on thematic echo, though they stop short of sermonizing. The resonance is clear but leans toward intellectual satisfaction rather than embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—preservation of encoded wisdom—emerges clearly from the rope's contents and Mira's devotion. The fulgurite and birch-bark map anchor the concept in particulars, and the closing image of "time's own knots" offers resonance. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt thematic statement ("holding rope that held memory") rather than non-literal image. No earned wisdom or reweighting arises from struggle; the piece illustrates its premise without deepening or complicating it through character cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—grief as geographical exile, the work of returning to one's own life—emerges organically from concrete particulars (the thread, the untended roses, the projection metaphor). The crimson thread shifts meaning from historical map to "route home," and the final image ("intermission...between the person one was and...might still become") reweights prior material without a stated moral. The obituary-for-the-living conceit integrates cleanly with the Duchess's prolonged absence. Minor slip: "small sounds of grief" and "lonesome splendor" edge toward poetic assertion rather than earning resonance solely through scene pressure, but the thread's return and the writing act ground the theme in action.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the hybrid phoenix—beauty incorporating rather than rejecting the mechanical—and avoids overt moralizing. The final image of the creature spreading wings "bitterly sweet as dawn" resonates without summary. "Flawed genesis" as a conceptual frame is claimed in dialogue ("The flawed genesis begins now") rather than fully dramatized through on-page failure and recovery, nudging toward thematic echo. The piece resists false binaries and commits to its premise of necessary imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of transformation through woundedness emerges organically from concrete particulars (grafted trees, obsidian's violent formation, the drilled coin). The metaphor network is dense and purposeful, avoiding platitude. The final image—black sand as singing scars—offers a resonant answer to "can scars be beautiful?" without stating a moral. However, the line "those scars are threads connecting our past to our future—proof we survived" edges toward thematic echo, and the phrase "unyielding compassion that mystified her colleagues" reads as authorial framing rather than dramatized evidence. The piece invites reflection but occasionally tells its theme rather than trusting the image to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of memory, persistence, and wonder emerges through concrete images (chalk mark, paper crane, stained glass box) rather than direct statement. The recurring fountain motif shifts meaning from broken promise to reclaimed story, and the final image of questions glowing "brighter than answers" gestures toward a non-literal thematic answer. However, the piece leans on prompt-adjacent phrasing ("realistically imaginative," "luminous skeptic," "defiant hush") that reads as imported labels rather than organically discovered particulars. The ending narrowly avoids overt moralizing but stops short of the undeniable reweighting required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges from image and action: generational patterns, love as the repeating constant, and "tend the patterns that deserve repeating." The brass gear and nebula flowers function as non-literal answers to the survival question. The Keeper's voice—"troubling serenity"—embodies the tension between cosmic detachment and empathy. The final image (gear tumbling, calculations complete) reweights prior material without stating a moral. Minor slip: "That love repeats across every generation…it's the only pattern that matters" edges toward explicit thesis statement rather than letting the dramatized gift speak.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (grief as continuous thread vs. isolated tragedy) emerges organically from the ribbon, monarchs, and Marcus's mentorship without overt moralizing until the final poem line. The greenhouse-as-studio and butterflies-as-collective-motion motifs recur with purpose, constraining her thinking and charging the closure. The ending offers a resonant answer ("carvers of each other's remembering") that reweights prior material, though the line skirts thematic echo by articulating the thesis directly. Subtext operates in Marcus's spectral form and the ribbon's multi-generational verses; emotional honesty avoids sentimentality in the fading and her solitary continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from particulars: silence, incremental confession, invisible truth carried forward. The pendulum's swing becomes a non-literal answer to the question of shared balance—truth in motion, unseen but persistent. The final image ("keeping time, keeping secrets, keeping faith") reweights prior material without stating a moral. The "tidal pools reflected fragments of sky" and "land from beneath withdrawing water" motifs charge the ending without symbolic convenience. No thematic echo; the piece trusts implication.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of chess strategy (seeing intentions beneath moves), cemetery work (the dead "tenderly organized," the living "untraceable and wild"), and the grandmother's covert recordkeeping. The tapestry and sovereign case serve as concrete anchors rather than allegorical tokens. The final image—"uncharted echoes close, waiting for someone blithe enough to listen"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor hidden truths. The piece resists moralizing; Marta's resolve to visit the seven graves leaves purpose and consequence open yet charged.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of mapped ignorance as innovation-catalyst emerges clearly from Maren's work and the Councils concept. However, the piece states its thesis repeatedly—"acknowledging what you didn't know," "courage to acknowledge what remained unknown"—rather than letting particulars charge the final image. The ending offers an abstract promise ("councils would form") without a resonant, non-literal answer grounded in scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the premise that narratives can be preserved in physical particles and awakened through specific frequencies—a concrete metaphor for cultural memory and transmission. The pirate broadcast's instruction-as-song and Elena's role as translator/distributor integrate concept with action. However, the ending's direct thematic statement—"teaching dust its ancient purpose"—and the summary "The story famine was ending, one particle at a time" convert resonance into assertion. The final image of luminous dust dancing around her head offers visual charge, but the accompanying narration ("she...had learned to read the language written in absence itself") explains rather than implies.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (the mirage of safety, incompleteness masked as wholeness) emerges organically from the mask's kintsugi construction, the gallery's partial images, and Elena's ritual. The ash forming "Safety is forgetting what the frame excludes" avoids stating a moral but hovers close to Thematic Echo. The ending offers a resonant answer: scattering honors "what had necessarily, honestly, been left out," reweighting prior material without sermon. Subtext operates in the mask's sharp edges softened by gilt and the founder's vanishing after declaring "the only honest art was ash." No overt philosophizing in the final paragraph, though the penultimate line ("Each portrait's cremation would honor...what had...been left out") edges toward thesis articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme (truth as sediment vs. narrative as erasure) emerges from concrete action: Marcus's library, the cog's mechanical precision, Karin's historiography, the final network plan. The ending offers a resonant answer—"ensuring truth survived argument"—through the cog-as-sign and distributed preservation, not a stated moral. Subtext is strong in gesture (the cog transfer, the smile, the rising water). No thematic echo or moralizing. The final image reweights the opening solitude with earned cost and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of harmony through listening emerges organically from the zither rosette and the choir teaching. The intertwined phoenixes provide a concrete image that shifts meaning from preservation to practice. The final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("this is how traditions survive") but the underlying question—whether teaching can heal communal fracture—receives non-literal answer through the charged image of the boxed rosette and resonating lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of reclaiming forbidden knowledge and shared memory emerges organically from concrete action (planting, tasting, teaching) rather than statement. The rusted greenhouse image evolves from neglect to "beauty from ruins," reweighted in the final line without moralizing. Subtext operates in the alignment's symbolism and the fruit's neural plasticity as metaphor for communal consciousness. However, "what they wanted us to forget" in the penultimate beat edges toward thematic echo, and the girl's realization—"never been as alone"—borders on therapeutic summary rather than embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—"progress without wonder is elaborate death," generosity versus efficiency, joy over optimization—emerges organically from the drone failure and Chen's confession without overt moralizing. The bee riddle ("what preserves itself by giving everything away") is earned and non-literal, reweighting prior material. The final image ("ready for the next storm") offers a resonant answer: hope and systemic resilience require beautiful waste. The nectar-light motif and the lacquer box recur with shifted meaning, charging closure. One minor slip: "purpose isn't efficiency—it's joy" flirts with thematic echo, though Chen's voice-specific contrition keeps it anchored in character rather than pure thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—witness as sanctification, gradual change as motion—emerges organically from Mara's collecting, arranging, and final realization. The orris root, displaced objects, and "creeping normality" are concrete particulars that charge the ending without stating a moral. The final image (house holding light "like a promise") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates cleanly in the shift from "offerings" to "noticing." Minor slip: "inadvertently profound" in the ritual description edges toward authorial label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—moral complexity resists simple narratives; justice and beauty may drown together—emerges entirely from the architect's choice, the garden's colonized monuments, and Marina's final stance. The foxglove ampoule and "threading" recur with shifting weight, and the statue's question "Monster or hero? Neither or both?" is answered not with a thesis but with Marina's embodied choice to carry paradox upward. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: "I can finally stop breathing" reweights the architect's condemned witness and Marina's inheritance of testimonial duty. No overt moralizing; subtext in "tragedy requires innocence" and "structural weaknesses" operates through image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—risk, perfectionism, dynamic instability vs. equilibrium—emerges through the staircase metaphor and the chipped die's reweighted meaning. The final image (finger on send) poses the central question without stating a moral. However, Castellano's dialogue is overtly thematic: "balancedly daring," "dynamic instability that somehow maintains itself," and "stop trying to calculate the perfect escape" function as thesis statements rather than discoveries. The story risks Thematic Echo; while the concepts are grounded in physics, the articulation at peak beats trends toward prompt-label language. The ending reweights prior material but the subtext is somewhat diluted by explicit articulation mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the moon-tipped brush, lost languages, grandmother's defiance, the chain of kindnesses. The final image—rooftop greenhouses ablaze with impossible languages—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what persists against erasure. However, the thematic spine ("They can burn the books...") is articulated explicitly by the grandmother quote and restated in Mara's reflection, nudging toward thematic echo. The piece resists moralizing yet leans on stated wisdom rather than letting the completed canvas and sleep speak entirely through implication.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of displacement and cultural continuity emerges organically from the museum's relocations, the breadmaking custom, and the frozen grotto. The emerald lens and shaped bread function as recurring motifs that charge the ending: vision transforms despair, and naming (initials) preserves identity under threat. "Rosewater dread—that peculiar sweetness masking rot, beauty concealing despair—shifted slightly. Not disappearing, but acknowledged" is the piece's thematic hinge, offering complexity without resolution. The final image—"displaced…transformed by survival, carrying forward what they'd rescued"—answers the central question of how culture survives displacement without stating a moral. Minor slip: "the displaced would remain—transformed by survival" ventures close to thematic summary, though it's anchored in the collective action. No overt moralizing in the final paragraph; resonance is earned through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—reversing fate and causality—emerges from concrete particulars: the counter-clockwise clocks, the reverse-engineered yoyo, the hunger stone's rearranging inscription. The final image reweights the premise: Maren moves "in a direction that had no name," and the yoyo falls silent, suggesting both triumph and cost without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection on whether transcendence or obliteration has occurred. One minor slip: "bleak exhilaration" is stated three times rather than consistently embodied in perception and rhythm, edging toward thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges concretely through the paradoxical dream dictionary entries and the discovery that fear is "pathetically small" when faced directly. The opera clasp's screaming face reweights from artifact to metaphor for trapped fear without overt statement. Margot's photographic curse evolves from affliction to weapon, offering genuine thematic reprise. However, the advisor's final line ("What we fear most is seeing fear clearly") edges toward moralizing summary rather than letting the image speak. The ending offers resonance but slightly over-articulates its own meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—transforming obstacles into instruments—emerges through concrete particulars: rising seas teach leeward tides, driftwood becomes foundation, apple trees become oracles. The final image of "backwards-flowing faith and the resonance of copper-wound trees" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Maren's restless experimentation and the community's dependence. However, the thematic statement "Every obstacle became an instrument if you understood its resonance" is too explicit, approaching a thesis claim rather than letting the image carry weight. The piece edges toward articulating its own meaning rather than trusting dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges cleanly from concrete particulars: certainty (the Council's dismissal, the "terrible clarity" of sunlight) versus pattern-driven humility (Maren's spirals, the turtle's ancient routes). The central question—whether stasis or movement ensures survival—is answered non-literally by the turtle's shift and Maren's resolve. The "sunwashed dread" motif charges the ending without stating a moral. The whistle and crack function as image-arguments rather than symbols, and the watchers as guides (not threats) reweights the premise. No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.2)
    The noble-lie theme is articulated overtly in dialogue and narration rather than emerging from image and action. The ending's "comfortable lies or challenging truths" and "emotionally rational understanding" read as thesis statements instead of resonant final images. The rosebush recurs but without reweighting prior material through fresh irony or cost. Thematic Echo penalty applies: Elena's closing reflection voices the story's premise in prompt-like language, dulling subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the inkwell's patina "reminded him of everything the water had taken—not violently, but with patient, inexorable absence." The interlaced-absence concept develops through concrete instances (the twins' debut, Kessler's violin, the unsent letters) rather than assertion. The final image—Marcus will "wrest meaning from absence, and build a foundation of remembered things"—offers resonant closure without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on what memory preservation costs and honors. However, "hushed blaze" as descriptor appears twice without evolving meaningfully, and the closing phrase "build a foundation of remembered things" edges toward thematic statement rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of preservation versus suppression emerges organically from the underground press discovery and Catherine Moreau's "drowned rebellion." The blackout/stillness motif recurs purposefully: "reclaimed stillness—this return to pre-electric methodology—sharpened her thinking" and "stillness enough to notice, darkness enough to see." However, the final paragraph edges toward overt thematic statement: "proof that some had fought to preserve truth before the waves erased everything" and "she had found her purpose renewed" feel more asserted than embodied. The stamp as key and Mira's own stamp-pressing at the end offer a resonant, non-literal closure, though the "marking her own beginning" line tilts toward explicating rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: transformation (light into lanterns, dreams into cranes, falling into rising), the limits of preservation, and craft as answer to loss. The phrase "luminous torment" and the lantern metaphor ("it doesn't hold [the sky], it transforms it into something we can see through") recur with shifted meaning at closure. The final image—gem brightening, another lantern flickering—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether grief can be folded into flight, avoiding stated morals.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—where unrealized potential goes—emerges through the geode's transformation, perturbation equations, and the hunt itself, not through direct statement. "Unfiltered awakening" and "intangibly tangible" resonate without becoming thematic echoes. The final image ("neither dead nor alive, for their perturbations to arrive") reweights prior material with quantum ambiguity, offering a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in Vahedi's "ghost hunt" and Mira's reply, and in the parallel between geode beauty and cousin's unlived futures. One minor slip: "The hunt had become her awakening" edges toward theme summary rather than letting the particulars speak.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (belonging, missing pieces, connection vs. isolation) emerges cleanly from Mara's longing and the chip quest without overt moralizing. The "frequency of belonging" risks abstraction but is grounded in the chip mechanics and star-trail navigation. The pilgrim's closing wisdom ("you understand that some things can only be found...") edges toward thesis statement but stays character-voiced. The final image reweights Mara's prior isolation as necessary preparation, a credible Resonant Reconfiguration that avoids platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete action: guilt, accountability, and the cost of convenient lies. The driftwood ritual and watch hand create a pattern of particulars that resonate without overt statement. The ending reweights Mara's prior fabrications through Elias's witness and her commitment to "the dismantling," offering a non-literal answer to the question of how to bear the weight of withheld truth. No diagnostic label-speak appears in the final paragraph; the closing image of sifting through remains delivers earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of trust-building through neutral predictability and recycling mistakes into wisdom is coherent and emerges from the drawer-pull object and moon-phase method. The final image—Katrin alone on the parapet, already calculating the next exchange—offers quiet resonance. However, the grandmother's cryptic advice ("open what's been closed to untether what's been bound") feels more like prompt-fulfillment than earned wisdom; Katrin's thematic monologue to the commanders ("these two men deserve to go home") edges toward stated thesis. The piece invites reflection but doesn't complicate its central question; apology and forgiveness remain abstract categories rather than embodied tensions.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme (moving forward through brokenness rather than away from it) emerges from the compass/utility-poles opposition and the shared grief between Marina and Amy without direct statement. The "merrily melancholic" quality and "simultaneously heavy with grief and impossibly light" line earn their complexity through Marina's preparation routines and Amy's dual terror. The final image—adjusting course by bone-deep feeling while the poles vanish—offers a non-literal answer to whether broken systems can be trusted again. Minor slip: "two broken people choosing to trust each other" edges toward summary, though the particulars (compass warm against chest, rightness in bones) anchor it.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the baseball, the lake's "delicately robust" light, and the labyrinth metaphor. The final insight—"Empathy isn't memory. It's choice"—reweights the premise but is delivered via inscription rather than dramatized through Marcus's experience. The Interpreter's line "You can't unknow that choices exist" approaches platitude. The story invites reflection and avoids tidy moralizing, but the ending offers more assertion than resonant image. The bioluminescent waters as symbol work well but the baseball's lesson feels handed rather than earned from concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fortune "to find what you've lost, become what you fear" seeds early and reweights at closure without being overtly restated. Theme of threshold-crossing and transformation arises from the metamorphosis particulars rather than abstract statement. However, "fear was just another threshold to cross" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward sermonizing, and "she'd simply learned to write new ones" tells theme rather than letting the image speak. The final dual-state walk offers resonance, but the prior lines dilute it slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the tablecloth motif, the weeping tea-set crack, and the repeated hand-tracing: presence as accumulated choice rather than grand gesture. The final image—reaching into the cradle where "real hands could trace real skin"—reweights the entire pilgrimage without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the hospital vision (withdrawn hand), the infant's tracking eyes, and the sap-weeping crack. The story resists easy resolution; she has not erased her past theft, only chosen a new path with visible cost. No thematic echo or label-speak in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the shadow-work conceit: unprocessed collective grief as a locked dimension. The piece resists easy morals, letting Mei's dangerous quest and Akio's pacifism coexist without forced balance. The final image—shimmer spreading to the walls, ship preparing for transformation—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether humanity should face its shadow. The Tear and photographs function as charged motifs that accumulate meaning rather than ornament. Minor slip: "terrible beauty of completion" leans slightly abstract at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the texture metaphor, lightning bugs as transformation symbols, and the shift from wealth to orchestrating coincidences. The final image (walking further, ready to fulfill another prophecy) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the bug releases and the surveyor's recognition. However, "vibrant hush," "texture of transformation," and "orchestrator of small miracles" edge toward thematic echo—the prose articulates the concept too directly in places ("She was the orchestrator of small miracles, the fulfiller of unspoken prophecies").

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of quiet, persistent resistance emerges through the phosphorescent paint metaphor and the sundial's transformation from ornament to map. "Words are the finest lockpicks" and "some doors need to be unlocked from the inside" integrate with Maren's role. The final image—"sparks of change began to glow"—reweights the premise without stating a moral. Deduction: the theme is articulated rather than discovered ("The revolution won't be loud…quiet, persistent, impossible to extinguish"), and the ending summary ("prepared to transform") feels stated rather than earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through the grandmother's "lingering promise," the frictionless physics as metaphor for loss of grip, and the final realization that the promise was "an invitation to witness the universe remembering itself" rather than an explanation. The painted rocks, collapsed star dust, and eel movements form a coherent symbolic system without overt statement. The closure image—"the sacred geometry of letting go"—reweights the opening's control and arrangement into acceptance, though "letting go" arrives as epiphany rather than enacted sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—resistance through documentation, silence transformed into testimony—emerges organically from the timer ritual, contraband poems, and cartography-of-scars metaphor. The final image ("keeping vigil over the spaces between what was said and what was true") reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the storm's "furiously tranquil" contradictions mirroring Mara's internal state. Minor thematic echo present: "making longitude and latitude from loss, turning silence itself into testimony" leans close to articulating the thesis, though it remains in scene context rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    "Questions become destinations" is stated multiple times but not earned through specific struggle—the sundial decode proceeds smoothly, and the philosophical claim about fencing with questions remains meta-commentary rather than enacted tension. The overture's revelation carries thematic potential, but the ending restates the thesis ("questions without answers, destinations without maps") instead of letting the final image resonate without a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from particulars: shifting selves enable different modes of seeing beauty's possibility, the library's fracture becomes a portal rather than a wound, and blooming where "bones are buried" reweights ruin as fertile ground. The improvised penny poem ("ruins bloom brightest when tended by broken hands") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Motifs earn their keep: molting, moonlight, seeds, and rusted metal recur with shifting valence and constrain the final choice. Subtext operates in Kai's "You're different again" and Mara's borrowed smile. The ending avoids tidy resolution—October's forgetting is accepted as "part of the work."

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of longing and creative agency emerges through concrete particulars (winding the clock, splicing frames, playing the score) rather than statement. The final image—compasses pointing to "moments when longing became strategically creative enough to bend the world"—overreaches into thematic summary that replaces scene pressure. The story resists tidy morals but the closure dissolves tension into reunion without a resonant counter-pressure or ambiguity. The anniversary clock's backward motion and "hidden sections between frames" accumulate symbolic weight, though the map metaphor feels slightly imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme (the boundary between truth and wish, memory and faith) emerges through Kima's dream testing and her final stance that "truth and wish aren't always opposites." The seed and ridge function thematically without overt statement. The closing image ("what grows when faith and verification finally bloom together") reweights the premise without moralizing. Minor slip: "luminous doubt" and "empirically whimsical" feel prompt-adjacent in their construction, though the piece dramatizes the concepts through action.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—tending what remains, apologies woven into care—emerges organically from the bonsai lesson and lace pattern without overt moralizing. The closing image (sun painting "shades of apology and forgiveness," Mira learning "the precise blue of healing") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the unspoken-apology question. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("instructions after all… for cultivating what remained") and the phrase "the color of unspoken apologies" recurs as a motif without constraining a choice, reading more as lyric echo than lived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme of transformation and decay emerges organically from particulars (butterfly scales, neutron stars), with subtext in imagery rather than statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the tuning fork's resonance and heat patterns, offering a non-literal answer to silence and survival. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, like Mara pressing the fork case to her heart, inviting reflection without moralizing. The core concept of "unshaken marvels" integrates through specific particulars, deepening character arc. Emotional aftereffect is concrete and avoids sentimentality through embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)

Subtext operates in gestures and echoes, such as the tactile connection across centuries. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Miren's smile and the preserved stories. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the cost of preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme of open secrets emerges organically from fortunes that are both mundane and loaded, avoiding moralizing. The final image of "answers in your hands" reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity. Subtext operates through implied meanings in fortunes, enriching without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of truth and myth emerges organically through events, like the rosebush symbolizing cycles, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom emerges organically from the drawer pull and exchange, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gestures and silences, but the phrase "recycle mistakes into wisdom" leans slightly explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from events, exploring truth versus wish through concrete particulars like the seed and dreams.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of decay-as-transformation, catastrophe vs gradual change, and the tension between analysis and presence arise naturally from neutron stars, butterflies, and flood damage. The repeated comparison between pulsars and scales earns its weight through concrete particulars. However, several sentences voice the theme a bit directly (“Decay was just transformation observed patiently”; “The comparison wasn't frivolous”), creating a slight sense of authorial summarizing. The final image still resonates, but the explicitness trims some of the potential subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of creation vs. destruction, patience vs. force, and making meaning from “pauses” are well integrated through glass, frost, and fire imagery, and the closing kiln scene offers a clear non-literal answer: transform fury into light rather than amplifying violence. The recurrence of frost and heat, and the contrast between charcoal/gunpowder and glass, build a coherent thematic system. Some thematic language is a bit declarative—Vera’s lines about shortcuts, brittleness, and “burning without purpose” verge on thesis statements rather than subtext. The ending remains resonant, but slightly less explicit moralizing would let the images carry more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of silence, survival, and the body as an instrument are woven through recurring concrete elements (ocean roar, shattered instruments, tuning fork, thermal maps) and reweighted at the end. The story redefines music as something existing “between sound and silence,” and the final image of her body’s “honest heat” mapping survival offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. One line edges toward thesis-statement territory (“music existed in the spaces between sound and silence”), but it remains grounded in the specifics of her experience. Overall, the piece invites reflection on trauma and translation without flattening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of duty, the afterlife as “address,” and the ethics of devotion to knowledge emerge organically from images and actions rather than sermonizing. The line “Death wasn't an ending but a relocation, and these souls had no proper address” is explicit but well-earned and meaningfully reframed by the ending, where Marcel gives them that address and then lets it stand without him. The story honors the scholars’ stubbornness as devotion while still insisting on the necessity of rest, avoiding a simple moral. The quiet final image of empty dreams offers a resonant, understated answer to the opening unease.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of exile, anonymity vs acknowledgment, and intergenerational obligation are woven tightly through the bell, the arbor, and the network of former exiles, culminating in a resonant vision of “fed futures” that reweights the earlier midnight runs. The final exchange (“Teach us”) offers a non-didactic answer to the question of how a stateless community can imagine continuity. There is some near-thesis language in Mara’s speech (“anonymous donations feed our bodies, but they starve something else”), but it remains just plausible as her rhetoric rather than authorial moralizing. The thematic arc feels earned and lingers beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central thematic move—that beauty in the world is transformed, unuttered love—is original and emotionally resonant, and the golden threads/wisteria imagery embeds it well. The conceptual repricing at the end (her art as a means of revealing what the world stores) ties theme tightly to character and practice. However, some lines verge on stating the thesis too baldly (“Every act of beauty is someone's unuttered love, transformed”; “We’re all pilgrims...”), edging toward gentle moralizing rather than leaving more work to subtext. The piece still invites reflection beyond its length, but it would be stronger if a bit more were left implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic through-line—time as substance, architecture, and lived recursion—is strong and organically tied to her profession, condition, and the garden’s transformation. The piece invites reflection on memory, authorship of one’s own life, and the cost of obsessive comprehension, with a resonant final stance of “both designer and designed.” Some insights are stated a bit didactically (“Through hyperbolic geometry, time could curve back into itself…”), tipping from dramatized discovery toward explanation and slightly dulling subtext. Even so, the closing conceptual repricing of retrocognition as navigational talent rather than curse lands cleanly and reweights the entire story.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of biodiversity as true resilience, liberation versus sustainability, and the quiet power of patience are strongly woven through seeds, monoculture mandates, and the final act of planting. The closing image of Mira sowing drought-resistant seeds in cracked soil is resonant and reweights the story’s prior details. However, several lines state the thesis too directly (“This was how you changed the world—not with violence…”; “liberation meant nothing without the wisdom to sustain it”), which edges into didacticism. A little more trust in image and implication over explicit statement would lift the thematic subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of memory, loss, and the ethics of preservation versus release emerge organically from action and image—e.g., the cellular division as “tiny act of forgetting and becoming” elegantly ties biology to emotional memory. The story avoids sermonizing; it offers a complex stance that both validates her grief-driven quest and insists some sounds “weren’t meant to be preserved.” The final gesture reframes the initial premise: what matters is not perfect recall of pain but how we live with absence, a conceptual repricing that lingers. A couple of sentences come close to spelling out the thesis, but they’re grounded enough in concrete moments to avoid feeling like a moral lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of fate vs agency, witnessing vs creating, and how light reveals “crossroads” emerge clearly from concrete images (portraits, moonbeams, codes). The final notion that “some thefts are actually homecomings in disguise” is resonant but also a bit on-the-nose, tipping toward explicit moral. Celeste’s didactic lines (“You’re not meant to steal illuminated moments…”) similarly spell out what the story already implies. Still, the reconfiguration—from stealing beauty to enabling others’ illuminated moments—has genuine thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematically, the story coherently explores abandonment, repair, and the slow work of thawing emotional distance, with glasswork and ice as recurring, reweighted images. The final decision to offer the sphere and reimagine the control room provides a resonant, non-literal answer about transformation through patience and release. Some lines edge toward on-the-nose articulation (“For glass, like trust, collapses under stillness”; “To create beauty, we must first release what we're holding too tightly”), slightly reducing subtextive power. Nonetheless, the emotional aftereffect is earned and avoids saccharine moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of betrayal, protection, and vulnerability-as-power are deeply woven through Maya’s backstory, Reeves’s choices, and the encrypted evidence. The parallel between Maya’s fabricated childhood and Emma’s exploitation enriches the notion of “transformative betrayal.” Yet the story undercuts its own subtlety with explicit thesis statements (“Vulnerability wasn't just power. It was the only power that couldn't be taken away.”), veering into moralizing instead of trusting implication. The resonance is real but somewhat overexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme is very well integrated: endings, silence, and absence are explored through specific images (the booklet of unsaid things, the three silences, the dark fort) rather than abstract exposition. The final reconfiguration—silence as landmark and withheld words as compass—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how to live/navigate after catastrophe without moralizing. Recurring motifs (“hush,” dimming star, useless maps) all return charged in the closing cadence, prompting reflection about grief, trauma, and the uses of what cannot be said. The only minor limitation is that the oracle states a couple of ideas fairly directly, though still within the story’s poetic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story’s thematic inquiry into consciousness as emergent from iteration and pattern, not a single origin point, is strong and organically tied to the loop structure and violin. The final realization that purpose has always been embedded in his mundane actions resonates with the janitor motif. However, some of the thematic articulation is overly expository or thesis-like (“From everywhere and nowhere,” explicit explanation of the protocol’s purpose), softening subtext. The ending produces a clear intellectual aftereffect, though the emotional ambiguity could be richer.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of communication, interpretation, and the risks of honesty are well embedded in concrete objects (crystals, lens, tickets) and actions rather than abstract exposition. The reframing of the doodles and the relinquishing of the lens as a shield embody “freed by honesty” in a non-didactic way. The final line about “stopped eavesdropping on her own life and stepped into it” edges into explicit thesis-statement territory, nudging toward sentimentality. Overall, resonance is genuine but a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—limits of quantification, the alchemy of turning deception into proof, and reciprocal knowing between caretaker and environment—emerges organically from particulars: marbles, notebooks, manipulated paths, and the responsive maze. The contrast between institutional metrics and cultivated relationships is potent, especially in “what measurement captures that?” and “Some truths can’t be quantified, only cultivated.” That last line leans close to stating the thesis, slightly blunting subtlety. Overall, subtext about gaslighting, reclaiming expertise, and re-rooting identity in lived practice rather than external scores is rich and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of non-linear time, perception, and the labor of overlooked workers are woven coherently: the Ephemera’s sideways rest cycles mirror Kael’s sideways relationship to institutional credit. However, some thematic statements are quite direct (“linear time was an illusion, a comfortable fiction consciousness told itself”), edging toward thesis rather than pure emergence from image and action. The ending offers a resonant conceptual answer—time as facets rather than a river—but the human cost and ambiguity around what this means for Kael’s future remain underdeveloped. The piece invites reflection but could lean further into subtext over exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: in-between spaces, listening to the unheard, art as a medium for justice, and the reclaiming of official narratives. The lanterns, water-damaged program, and musical exchanges embody a “wordless” ethics of attention rather than any explicit moral, and the final line (“I heard you”) lands as earned emotional closure. There’s a quiet, lingering sense of the cost of being a witness against institutional myth, though it isn’t deeply problematized. Overall, the piece resists sermonizing and lets image and action carry its thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    The thematic throughline—wisdom as the capacity to honor uncertainty, versus the seduction of smooth, confident systems—is strong and coherently tied to action (how the oracle treats marginal data). The nightshade illustration, frost patterns, and “margins of consciousness” effectively echo the idea that danger and truth live in the periphery. That said, the story leans into explicit articulation (“fault-tolerance isn’t the same as wisdom,” “the dangerous illusion that fault-tolerance meant infallibility”), edging toward essayistic moralizing rather than fully trusting image and scene. A touch more restraint in stating the thesis would let the images and choices carry more of the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of collective guilt, environmental crime, and the burden/relief of confession are woven effectively through recurring images (stones in the stomach, water pressure, beads as prayers) and the radio callers. Some lines border on thesis statements (“The truth has weight”) and explanatory abstraction rather than trusting the images, which slightly blunts the lingering ambiguity and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thematically, the story is rich: impermanence, the composting of history, and the dangers of totalizing knowledge all emerge from concrete images rather than overt sermonizing. The line “Everything that knows itself completely stops growing” is a thesis-like moment, but it’s earned by the preceding journey and reweights the entire piece without collapsing into a simple moral. Recurring motifs—silence, decay-as-transition, the swan/origami—shift meaning by the end to support a nuanced stance on letting go. A few sentences veer close to aphoristic abstraction, but overall the resonance is deep and organic.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of “ordinary magic,” wonder, and the interplay of darkness and light emerge organically from the eclipse, the music, and Mara’s long-term work as both therapist and mother. Subtext around parental guilt and the limits of what one can give a child is strong, especially in the contrast between her earlier fears and her daughter now “chasing solar eclipses across continents.” However, lines like “Perhaps that was the real magic” and explicit phrasing about “hidden frequencies” edge into mild authorial summarizing. The ending still lands with a resonant image of ongoing, modest work rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, witnessing, and the duty to remember in a numbed, post-dream world are coherently embedded in the objects and Miren’s practice, especially the physical echo between Catherine’s hand and Miren’s. The “stories that walls had heard” motif works well as a quiet, recurring conceptual spine. The final paragraph edges toward explicit statement (“Someone needed to remember…”) but mostly earns its sentiment from prior particulars. The piece invites reflection on what survives and who tends it, without collapsing into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of open secrets, repurposed spycraft, and the moral possibility of turning an apparatus of surveillance toward grace are deeply integrated into plot and imagery. The recurring notion that banal fortunes can be both life-or-death code and genuine emotional solace gives the piece layered resonance. The ending’s repricing of “The answers you seek are already in your hands” works as a thematic crystallization without feeling like a pasted-on moral. There is a slight tendency to articulate theme directly (“something resembling grace”), but it stops short of sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of control vs. surrender, motion vs. stillness, and the nature of selfhood under possession are coherently woven through the ritual and setting. However, they are often articulated directly in near-thesis lines (“You need to recognize you were never separate enough to struggle”), tilting toward sermon rather than fully emergent subtext. The conceptual move—attacking the logic that enables possession—is fresh and thematically apt. The ending’s peace “decorated by silence” recasts earlier motifs without collapsing into a simple moral, keeping this solidly strong.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of translation vs prediction, time and “chronological homesickness,” and finding purpose in attending to the world’s unnoticed music are well-integrated through recurring images (nautilus spiral, cosmic symphonies, mirrored horizon). The grandfather’s practice of translating radiation into music organically seeds Mira’s reframing of her fortunes. However, key thematic insights are articulated in fairly direct thesis language (“He never predicted—he translated,” “She wasn’t predicting futures anymore”), which slightly undercuts subtextual resonance. The emotional aftereffect is nonetheless coherent and quietly affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of identity, avoidance, and the price of wholeness emerge organically from the temporal conceit and her retracing practice; the piece links speculative mechanics to emotional truth. The final image—choosing to walk forward under full gravity, “unafraid of the ripple”—reweights all prior iterations as evasions. Some thematic statements (“The labyrinth of self was built from her own cowardice”) edge toward explicit thesis rather than staying fully in scene or image. Nonetheless, the story invites reflection on choice and responsibility without collapsing into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of silence as substance, disability as alternate artistry, and reversal (“play life backward”) are well integrated through repeated images (needle, oscilloscope, cavern, hush) and Oskar’s arc. The idea that music is “the architecture of silence shaped by it” resonates with the method and final image. However, some thematic lines state the thesis quite directly (“They understood what hearing musicians couldn't…”, “sometimes you had to reverse everything you knew”), edging toward didactic clarity rather than letting implication do more of the work. The emotional aftereffect is genuine and contemplative, if slightly too neatly articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres around integrity of record-keeping, the moral weight of observation, and the tension between surface peace and underlying systemic anomaly. These ideas emerge organically from Marianne’s history of unpublished journals, the government’s suppression of inconvenient data, and the revaluation of the courtyard’s tranquility as camouflage. The fountain, dusk light, and zones function as recurring images that shift meaning by the end, which gives the thematic arc a satisfying echo. The final line edges close to explicit thesis-statement territory, but it still feels earned by prior scene work rather than didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The themes of memory, loss, and the honesty of scent are woven through concrete particulars (the vial, Elena’s craft, the extinction of smell) rather than abstract lecturing. The visible perfume literalizes how memory can bypass defenses, culminating in the line about why some smells trigger tears, which lands just shy of being too on-the-nose. The final images—fading colors, lanterns at dawn, “light that smelled like love”—reweight the whole piece and invite reflection on how we carry grief when a sense is gone. There’s some explicit statement of insight, but it mostly feels earned by the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of transformation, impossible choices, and the ethical value of witnessing are well seeded in concrete particulars (the rope’s wear, the prison escape, the altered physics of time). The rope-as-narrative and stars-as-questions images do good thematic work. However, the story undercuts some of its subtlety with overt thesis statements—especially Sarah’s line “impossible only means we haven’t evolved our choices yet” and the final sentence explicitly defining courage. Those touches read more like authorial commentary than emergent insight, keeping this below elite-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of unfinishedness, possibility, and how to make meaning after environmental and cultural loss are woven through specific images: Sora’s incomplete scores, the fractured yet holding glass, sideways trees blooming, and the chronic hush. The realization that “the incompleteness was the point” is earned by the experiential build of the performance, not dropped as a thesis. The final revaluation of silence—from deadened hush to “living quiet, full of potential,” punctuated by the fruit’s splash—offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to the question of how to live in ruins. No moral is stated; the imagery and choices invite reflection beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—authenticity vs artifice, and the ethics of half-truths—is woven through concrete particulars: the counterfeit emotions, Therese’s request, and the amber’s slow transformation. The final shift from “false forgiveness” to “wish to forgive” offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to the central question. A couple of lines (“Perhaps that was the real alchemy”) edge close to essayistic statement but remain tethered to the scene. Subtext about how we manage others’ deaths and our own limitations lingers effectively beyond the last sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of invisible labor, gratitude as “currency,” and compassion as cyclical are coherently threaded through specific workers, the daughter’s anonymity, and the lighthouse keeper’s reaction. The story elicits a gentle emotional aftereffect and offers a clear, non-literal answer: attention revalues what a market overlooks. However, some formulations edge toward aphorism (“Sometimes the best things arrive at the wrong address...”), slightly softening complexity. More friction or ambiguity around who gets seen and why would deepen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of belonging, community, and the transformation of memory from prison to shared pattern emerge organically from the woven motifs and Kael’s arc. The recurring imagery of weaving, tags, and twin arbors provides a concrete non-literal answer to what it means to be part of a “web of kinship.” The final realization about belonging “adding your own thread to the pattern” is resonant but also veers close to explicit moralizing, slightly flattening complexity. Overall, the emotional aftereffect is genuine and earned, if somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of liberation versus control, the ethics of manipulating nature/time for knowledge, and truth as something that must be “uncaged” emerge organically from Vera’s actions and the echo’s imprisonment. The infinity pendant, twin-born echo, and temporal scars all serve a coherent idea about intertwined origins and consequences without collapsing into explicit moralizing, though the last line edges close to a thesis statement. The final image—echoes freed across the city as she descends with her proof—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about what authentic understanding requires.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of ambiguous loss, the limits of proof, and love as the “shape of absence” are woven elegantly through math and orchard imagery, and the ending offers a nuanced, non-moralizing answer: some questions are dignified by being asked well, not solved. Recurring objects (glass eyes, mosaic primes, orchard) all reweight thematically at closure, especially the eyes’ warmth and the idea of silence as companionship. A few lines verge on explicit thesis-statement (“Her mathematics of emotion required new axioms”), which slightly dulls the otherwise organic emergence of theme.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of belonging, archival memory, and a paradoxical form of invisibility-as-presence emerge organically from action and image, especially the connection between the smell of tape and familial recorded letters. Miriam’s final realization—that she has become “a presence that preserved what mattered”—reweights the entire story’s small acts of salvage into a coherent ethical stance. The piece avoids overt sermonizing, though the final line (“that was enough”) edges toward spelled-out closure rather than fully trusting image alone. Still, the thematic arc feels earned and lingers beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of control versus surrender, scientific mastery versus relational observation, and shared growth with nonhuman life are well integrated into concrete particulars (weeds for insects, moss as moisture keeper, volunteer linden). The ending reweights the initial question by having her keep studying but via narrative, relational methods instead of variables and hypotheses, which nicely embodies “reluctant metamorphosis.” A few lines (“You can’t force growth,” “This was study too… perhaps truer”) edge close to stating the thesis, but they’re mostly earned by prior scene work. The resonance lingers without collapsing into a tidy moral because she explicitly notes the metamorphosis is unfinished.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, pattern-seeking, and post-catastrophic meaning-making are woven clearly through water, art, and the brooch, culminating in the insight that convergence is human memory rather than mysticism. The closing image of her painting handprints and rain trails after visiting ancient ones nicely entwines past and present. That said, the thematic statement becomes somewhat declarative in lines like “The convergence wasn't mystical. It was memory…,” edging toward thesis instead of letting the images fully carry the weight. The piece is rich conceptually, but a bit more trust in subtext and less explicit explication would lift it into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme—knowledge versus mystery, and the ethical cost of foreclosing surprise—is strongly woven through events and recurring images (music, futures, shadows, “everyday magic”). The realization that she has “diminished everything” and her pivot to protecting mystery as magic is a powerful thematic reweighting of the premise. Yet the story sometimes states its thesis too explicitly (“things meant to remain hidden,” “protecting its essential mystery”) instead of trusting implication, edging toward gentle moralizing. The ending image is resonant but could benefit from one more concrete, character-particular detail rather than conceptual language.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of memory, absence, and the ethics of witnessing are strongly integrated through the archive, the lost/kept objects, and Marina’s self-understanding. The idea of “navigated absences” is dramatized rather than merely asserted, culminating in her realization that her work was to ensure the exiled hadn’t been erased. The closing image of the archive opening into light reweights prior details with a clear but not didactic sense of hope and cost. A few lines (“Nothing’s gone”) edge close to thematic statement, which slightly blunts the lingering ambiguity that might elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of rational mapping versus hidden realities, unspoken truths versus the lies we live by, and validation of passages into transformative spaces are integrated tightly with events and imagery (maps, tickets, arrows, fortress). The ending offers a resonant answer: one cannot map away the mystery, but one can map a path back that acknowledges it. While some thematic language is explicit (“fortress of unspoken truths,” “lies we’ve built ourselves upon”), it generally feels organic to the world and conflict rather than preachy. The piece invites reflection on what we avoid articulating without collapsing into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of science vs. folklore, relational knowledge vs. empirical method, and intergenerational stewardship emerge organically from events and images. The entangled memories and whales’ “navigation songs” nicely embody the idea that some truths live in relationship and patient observation. That said, a few lines near the end slide toward direct thematic statement (“some knowledge lived in relationship…”), edging into mild didacticism. The piece still leaves resonant ambiguity about how Elena will reconcile science with this inheritance, which keeps it from feeling moralistic.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of consent in immortality, the boredom of endless life, and the value of truly final goodbyes emerge organically from the conflict and the worldbuilding. The fragment’s “spatial mutiny” echoes Naia’s rebellion against a fixed state and anchors the conceptual question of what lies beyond death. A few lines lean toward thesis statement (“Maybe some goodbyes are meant to be final”), nudging the piece slightly toward explicit moralizing rather than trusting the already-strong images and choices. Overall, the ending reweights the premise—Cassius now driven by loss rather than boredom—in a resonant way.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of honesty vs deception, “fair trade,” and what constitutes a real form of salvation (rehab vs conning with “hope”) emerge organically through scene and motif. The mathematics metaphor and the death/prep-room imagery reweight each other at the end, with “resurrection” reframing both con and treatment. There is a slight tendency toward explicit statement (“The mathematics work, Dad. You give up the con. You get yourself back.”), nudging close to thesis, but it’s still rooted in Mara’s character logic rather than authorial sermonizing. Overall, the piece invites reflection without collapsing into a pat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme is rich and tightly woven: the ethics and aesthetics of invented histories, the materiality of time, and the tension between truth and beautiful falsity emerge organically from setting and action. Motifs (compression/expansion hums, disproportionate blossoms/roots, the proportionate oak) all reappear with altered resonance, culminating in the line “The truth needs no stationer,” which elegantly crystallizes the thematic question. There’s a hint of explicitness in that sentence, but it still works more as aphoristic image than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of bureaucratic erasure, memory as negative space, and the cost of preservation versus loss are woven tightly through objects, setting, and Maya’s arc. The poison/roses motif evolves meaningfully—from a dangerous chemical to “love layered onto danger” to a revaluation of what’s “worth it” in terms of life, death, and disappearance. Some lines (“The containers weren't just storage—they were monuments to replacement”) approach thesis-statement territory but stay grounded in concrete particulars. The final realization risks slight moralizing but ultimately functions as a resonant reframing of the entire story’s imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central theme—connection versus proof, and the value of “the space between things”—emerges organically from the shell/cello mechanism and the grandmother relationship. However, the piece undercuts some of its subtlety by voicing its thesis too directly (“The riddle wasn’t about proof. It was about connection.”), edging toward essayistic explanation. The final gesture of “learning to live inside the question” is resonant but again stated rather than entirely embodied in image. More reliance on implication, less on explicit thematic language, would lift this to a truly top-tier literary finish.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of culture as living resistance versus commodified spectacle emerges organically from Marina’s history, the raft’s origin, and the shifts in who arrives and what they want. The stone chip and the contrast between motion (raft) and solidity (demolished waterfront, “stabilization”) provide strong, non-literal thematic anchors. The ending reweights prior material by tying the teaching of carnival “language” to teaching resistance, which is resonant. The main drawback is a slight slide into explicit thesis-statement mode (“culture wasn’t something to be preserved in amber or sold to tourists”) that edges toward editorializing.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of memory, stewardship, and the ethics of extraction emerge organically from the mining backstory, the lineage of nightwatch keepers, and the grain’s inscription (“What we witness, we carry forward”). The mountain’s exploitation for helium-3 and the impending extinction of the moonflowers ground the environmental and historical stakes in concrete particulars. The final photograph as “pixel of testimony” nicely reweights the story’s symbols. The last sentence drifts toward explicit statement (“the eternal human need to remember what we’ve destroyed”), edging into mild moralizing and costing some subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of brokenness, alternative ways of seeing, and repair-as-redemption are coherent and rooted in the concrete particulars of Mara’s shop and methods. The recurring water/refraction motif nicely embodies the idea of a “different kind of light.” However, the explicit line “being broken and being blind were just different ways of seeing the world” veers into on-the-nose moralizing, flattening ambiguity. The piece leans toward sentimentality at the end instead of fully trusting its images.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of myth vs science, the ethics of discovery, and “patterns within patterns” are woven subtly through recurrent images (condensation, tributaries, the falcon’s path, misdrawn atlases) without slipping into moralizing. The idea that climate change exposes ancient truths and that methods of seeing matter as much as what is seen is persuasive and organically tied to Mira’s profession and obsession. The ending’s focus on documenting the discovery “the way it reveals itself” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening’s ghost-chasing accusation. Some additional friction—e.g., institutional or moral pushback—could deepen the thematic complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—balance, communal rhythm, hope as resonance—is coherent and integrated with the premise of tuning a town’s “heartbeat.” Recurring images (bell, footsteps, archway, silence vs. sound) support the thematic arc from ghostliness to renewed life. However, the piece leans into explicit statements (“frequency of hope,” “rebuild not structures, but the resonance between them”) that verge on thesis, reducing some subtlety. The ending still lands with a resonant conceptual repricing, but a bit less telling and more dramatized cost would heighten it.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of the dangers of beauty, the ethics of knowledge, and the value of leaving some mysteries intact emerge naturally from Chen’s obsession and Mara’s choice. The recurring contrast between “ephemeral” and preservation is conceptually strong, culminating in the image of “ancient hearts still beating…trapped in crystal loneliness.” However, several lines move into explicit thesis statement (“Some things are too dangerous to study…,” “some mysteries should stay mysteries”), edging toward moralizing rather than trusting implication. The resonance is real but slightly blunted by this on-the-nose articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of truth versus reputation, inheritance of a “liar’s” legacy, and prisons as sites of transformation rather than mere punishment arise organically from events. The repeated images of copper light, hush, and threading a labyrinth with story nicely embody ideas about narrative as a way of inhabiting impossibility. A few lines nudge toward explicit statement (“We’re learning to exist between what was and what might be”) but generally avoid moralizing. The ending reweights the “cry wolf” motif effectively without spelling out a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of forgiveness, the insufficiency of ambition without love, and intergenerational debt are organically embedded in the curse mechanics and Eleanora’s confession. The final image of dawn and golden apples effectively embodies a non-literal answer: love/forgiveness completes what alchemy alone could not. Some lines (“Love cannot be forced or stolen—it must be offered”) edge into explicit statement rather than leaving the insight entirely to implication. The ending lingers with a quiet emotional resonance, but the thematic arc is a bit tidy and unambiguous for the very highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematically, the piece is strong: it reframes dead ends as invitations and repetition as wisdom, and the broken rule about retracing paths becomes a compelling metaphor for spiritual or emotional growth. The illustration plate, silk threads, and travelers’ new use of the labyrinth all reinforce the idea of tending rather than solving. However, several lines verge on explicit thesis (“The labyrinth had been left to die because its creators saw dead ends as failures”), softening the subtlety. Combined with relatively low on-page pressure, the thematic resonance is moving but not quite profound.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of interrupted journeys, intergenerational repair, and mutual nourishment between living and dead arise organically from the orchard-catacomb imagery and the grandmother’s unfinished project. The sundial inscription and the “circle completes” idea reweight earlier material effectively, and each stone-as-prayer line grounds spiritual restoration in action. A few sentences verge on explicit thematic statement, but they’re mostly earned by the scene work rather than feeling didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of identity, authenticity, and “meaning in the margins” emerge organically through Iris’s trade, the chalk codes, and the archaic mail system, without overt moralizing. The idea that truth lives in overlooked, analog spaces is dramatized rather than stated as thesis, and the final image of glowing chalk and a letter in motion reweights everything that came before. The mother–daughter thread quietly complicates the romanticism of analog with the real pain of abandonment. Ambiguity about the eventual reply leaves a resonant, non-tidy aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres around who controls truth and how wisdom survives under regimes that weaponize knowledge, expressed through concrete images: embroidery as covert archive, the eternal flame as corrupted tradition, silence between “official declarations” as the real data. The idea of disguising wisdom as foolishness is thematically central and dramatized rather than preached. The final prayer—“Let someone understand”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: resistance here is archival, probabilistic, and dependent on future readers, not heroic triumph. The piece resists tidy moralizing, though a slightly deeper on-page clash of values (e.g., a more developed ideological foil) could add further complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—regret, the impossibility of changing the past, and the possibility of reconfiguring one’s relationship to pivotal moments—is coherently embedded via the unsent letters, the shard’s history, and the condensation messages. The concept of sending the apology to a past self instead of the dead person is a strong, specific thematic move that avoids easy absolution. Subtext around pride, love, and the liminal space between them is mostly carried by images and situation rather than direct moralizing. The final paragraph edges toward explicit thematic statement (“all the unsent letters in the world—all the apologies…”) which slightly flattens what was otherwise elegantly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Translation, truth, and the ethics of witnessing in conflict zones emerge organically from Maricel’s work and the children’s encryption without reading like an essay. The coral, wounds, fog, and “half-stories” recur as motifs that shift meaning by the end, especially in the final assertion about “small, patient deposits of truth.” There is some explicit thematic stating (“Truth was dangerous here,” “translation was never about quick fixes”) that slightly reduces subtlety, though it still feels earned by the concrete particulars. Overall, the piece leaves a resonant question about whether truth-telling is an act of care or further harm, without flattening into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of joy within melancholy, art as reframing rather than reproducing, and persistence of beauty in ruined environments grow organically from Mara’s choices and the light/fog imagery. The fragment’s lesson—that joy is in method and movement of light, not an object—nicely reweights prior material. The closing paragraphs tilt into mild explicitness (“That they’d been living inside joy all along”), edging toward thesis-statement territory and slightly blunting subtext. Even so, the emotional aftereffect is honest and earned rather than saccharine.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of waking vs. sleeping, knowledge vs. questioning, and art as recursive self-creation are woven through concrete images—the nested murals, the phrases “Wake to wake to wake” and “To know is to sleep. To question is to wake.” The hobo nickel, the sound garden, and the restoration process all accrue meaning in support of this. That said, the text occasionally edges into explicit explanation (“Lena understood then why she’d been drawn to this work”), which flattens some of the subtextual power. Overall, the thematic architecture is strong and coherent, if a touch more declarative than the very best literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of surveillance, autonomy of thought, and the political power of language are richly integrated: extinct scripts, untaxable cognition, and insect communication systems all reinforce the idea of resisting quantification. The contrast between what’s legible to machines and what remains human (or non-human) and opaque gives the ending conceptual weight. The rhetorical speech edges toward thesis-statement territory (“They want to count our thoughts, measure our defiance...”), but it remains grounded enough in concrete tactics to avoid pure sermonizing. The final image of ancient languages blooming and rooting in minds is a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—transmuting pain into beauty and finding peace with longing—is woven tightly through coral, shell, galaxy, and blossom armistice motifs. The notion of “photosynthesizing” sorrow into oxygen for others is both specific and earned by the particulars of her practice. The ending’s “blossom armistice” as peace with the ache itself gives a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. A few lines ("This was the photosynthesis she practiced...") verge on explanatory, but they stay poetic enough not to feel didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: extinction not just as loss but as erasure of names, and preservation as both salvation and potential ossification. The museum’s mandate, Miren’s private role as keeper of forgotten names, and the choice to valorize damage all braid into a nuanced meditation on memory versus efficiency. The final gesture—naming the new melody “Thessaly” and whispering it—reweights the world’s “efficient numbness” without sermonizing. Some conceptual language (“efficient numbness,” “standardized relationships”) skews a bit declarative, but it remains grounded enough in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of truth as a constructed, relational act—not just a statement—are elegantly embodied in the Varesh “symphonies” and Mira’s interlinked promises. Her flaw (choosing safety over honesty) and the language’s structure (lies collapsing entire texts) mesh thematically without feeling like allegory. The final exchange about “interconnected promises” sustaining distant paths ties concept, relationship, and theme together, though it edges toward explicitness. The piece invites reflection on how language can authenticate or betray trust without lapsing into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of measurement as moral choice, competing goods, and “encrypted compassion” are integrated through objects (chain, envelope), institutions (preservation vs. agriculture), and final action (unsealed letter). The story meaningfully interrogates how technical design can force or reveal cooperation. Some lines edge into thesis-statement territory (“Sometimes the most ingenious mechanism wasn’t made of metal and water…”) which slightly flattens ambiguity. Still, the closing image of the breathing building and her dappled resolve offers a resonant, non-literal answer without outright moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of permanence vs. erasure, authenticity, and trust are woven through concrete particulars: destroyed résumés, the meteorite’s age, dust making things visible, and the act of cataloging. The line “Everything needed its opposite to be seen” edges toward explicit statement but is grounded enough in image not to feel didactic. The ending reweights earlier material by reframing withering as possibly “natural, seasonal, rather than self-imposed,” offering a nuanced, non-moralistic answer to the central question. Thematically it’s resonant and cohesive, if a touch on-the-nose in a couple of sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of distance, thresholds, and love as the “necessary distance” emerge organically from mazes, weather codes, and the terrace as liminal space. The father’s line about sacred thresholds and Mara’s reinterpretation of it at the end form a coherent thematic arc. Some of the thematic articulation is a bit over-explicit (“The necessary distance, she understood now, was love”), tipping toward statement rather than leaving more work to image and implication. Even so, the story invites reflection on how we honor or cross emotional thresholds without collapsing into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story coherently explores the shift from detached observation to participatory connection, tying Senna’s personal longing for belonging to a city that literally converses with the stars. The predecessor’s feather, the exile-like crew, and the redefinition of the facility as a place to “forge” rather than study connection all reinforce the thematic throughline. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: belonging is found by joining the pattern, not merely decoding it. Some lines (“Not as a place to study connection, but to forge it”) edge toward explicit thesis, slightly reducing the subtlety of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, choice, and the mercy of forgetting are organically woven through foam, tides, seeds, and the cave’s archive of “what almost was.” The idea that reality prunes paths so we can bear the weight of the ones we walk is powerful and emerges sensibly from the visions. That said, the story leans into explicit statement (“Some paths disappear, she understood now, so we can…”), edging toward didactic clarity rather than letting the images and situations do more of the concluding work.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: improvisation requiring structure, “ordering randomness,” and the idea that “sometimes you engineer the magic, sometimes the magic engineers you.” The father’s legacy, the bishop token, and the tide’s erasure of choreography all reinforce questions about control, grief, and how much of life can or should be designed. The ending reweights prior material by showing Mara accepting an unplanned path in keeping with her father’s ethic, without slipping into overt moralizing. A few lines (e.g., naming her work “calculated wilderness”) edge toward explicit thesis, but they still feel voice-true rather than didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory vs erasure, body as archive, and exile-as-belonging emerge coherently through the nostalgia ban, the grandmother’s lesson about “gaps,” and the final image of Kaleth as living scripture. However, the text leans into explicit thematic statement (“This was her rebellion…”, “exile chosen freely was the purest form of belonging”) where implication would be stronger. The resonance is strong but slightly undercut by this mild moralizing/explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic throughline—value in attention, light in the mundane, “passages for sight”—is strongly integrated with glass, water, and light motifs. However, the story leans into direct statement (“value wasn’t in the extraordinary, but in attention itself”; “The noctilucent reckonings weren’t mystical”) that edges toward essayistic moralizing instead of fully trusting image and scene. The resonance at the end is real but somewhat over-explained. Strong but not yet subtle enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of bargained innocence, visible scars, regeneration, and redefined strength recur through concrete images (the burned forest, the child in the cellar, the cracked box). The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: “some fires needed fighting at home,” and “armor with a door built in” reweight prior material. At times the prose edges toward explicit thesis (“he couldn’t be the universal language between suffering and sense”), which slightly undercuts subtext. Overall, the thematic weave is strong and emotionally honest.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of hope, divergence, and the aesthetics of failure are well-seeded through the balloon accident, trial balloons, and the reinterpreted gauge. The closing realization that “The equation doesn't need to prevent divergence. It needs to measure its beauty” neatly ties motif and concept but edges into thesis-statement territory. Similarly, explicit lines about “equations for hope” and “Every fall measures a different kind of rise” risk sentimentality by stating what the imagery already carries. The piece still leaves a resonant afterimage, but with less ambiguity and subtext than top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—legacy, perception, and the reciprocity between human memory and architecture—is well woven through recurring motifs (echoes, walls dreaming, the satchel, ivy as nervous tissue). The story gracefully shifts from “are the walls dreaming?” to “can she participate in those dreams?”, reweighting her grandfather’s obsession from madness to visionary burden. The final paragraphs verge on explicit thesis (“She wasn’t trying to prove walls could dream. She was learning to dream with them”), slightly flattening subtext into statement. Nonetheless, the emotional and conceptual aftertaste is strong, and the theme arises organically from events and images.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of alternative possibility, grief transmuted into generative vision, and the dangers of mirrors that show only “what is” are woven organically through action and image. The borrowed heartbeat and the final comparison between what her sister’s death gave her and what she gives the city offer a strong, implicit answer to the central question of how to relate to one’s own reflection and potential. The Council’s diagnosis of “spiritual drought” leans toward exposition, but it doesn’t fully tip into sermonizing. The ending’s resonance is genuine, though slightly cushioned by how smoothly everything works out.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of redemption, the cost of peace, and the necessity of grounding ideals in concrete loss are interwoven tightly with the ritual and the clipboard, culminating in “the space between one violence and the next, stretched as long as courage allows.” The terrace’s scars, the list of names, and Maren’s history of failed truces all deepen the sense that peace is a temporary, hard-earned reprieve, not a moral cure-all. A few lines verge on overt thesis (“The flawed beauty of the approach lay in its honesty”), nudging toward essayistic explanation rather than purely emergent meaning. Still, the ending image reweights prior material in a resonant, non-moralizing way.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of commodified scarcity, complicity, and the idea of “echo” as a form of preservation are organically embedded: father’s spectrograms, the extinct terror bird, the drought-footprint, and the rain all participate without heavy-handed explanation. The story reweights the premise at the end: preservation isn’t in hoarding an egg but in allowing ruin to be washed clean, suggesting a complex relation between destruction, memory, and grace. “Ethics were simply market inefficiencies” versus “something like grace fracture through him” traces a credible, non-didactic internal argument. The one slightly explicit word—“grace”—nudges toward articulation, but the surrounding images keep the ending from tipping into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    The themes of conformity, silencing of dissent, and liberation of authentic voices are tightly woven through echoes, the web of light, and her role as a chaste, aestheticized object. The final image of her conducting a “symphony of rebellion” against the palace’s “alarming serenity” offers a resonant answer to the story’s question about whether silence can be broken. Some lines come close to overt thesis (“raw, discordant, beautiful noise of authentic human existence”), tipping toward didactic rather than purely emergent meaning. Nonetheless, the thematic arc is coherent and mostly arises from dramatized action rather than abstract commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    The thematic core—ethical storytelling versus manipulative provocation—is strong and organically tied to his past and current practice, especially in lines like “discomfort wasn’t enlightenment. Provocation wasn’t ethical.” The campfire story stick and the radar dome work as grounded motifs for whose truth is told and what’s “tracked.” However, the piece sometimes states its thesis too directly (“Ethical storytelling wasn’t about forcing revelations…”), edging toward essay rather than letting subtext and image fully carry the weight. The final shift to “uncomfortable humanity” and “honest question” still lands with genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of impermanence, witnessing, and the ethics of memorialization are deeply integrated into concrete particulars (migrations, highways severing routes, ephemeral towers). The concept of “interrupted cadence” elegantly reframes both musical expectation and historical remembrance, and the ending reweights earlier material without stating a moral. Lines like “refusing the violence of permanent erasure or permanent enshrinement” skate close to explicit thesis, but are still grounded in her practice. The aftereffect is resonant, inviting reflection on what and how we choose to remember.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, loss, forgiveness, and art as imperfect but real preservation arise organically from the lost-wax metaphor and the specific remembered phrases. The “snowmelt ardor” image smartly encodes a thematic stance: thaw as slow, warm persistence rather than dramatic rupture. The final image of bells that will speak forgotten names to the wind offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening problem of unpreserved names without moralizing. Complexity remains: the story honors both the impossibility of perfect remembering and the necessity of trying.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic core—choice vs. destiny as partners, paths choosing walkers, time as a continuous landscape—is rich and organically tied to the temporal premise and the archive of dreams. Recurring motifs (paths, mycelial networks, wafer seals) accrue meaning toward the ending. However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements (“choice and destiny weren't opposites but partners,” “precisely playful universe had taught her its secret”), which shifts it toward essayistic explanation at the expense of subtext. The insight is strong but somewhat over-articulated for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme is strong and organically embedded: encrypted devotion across millennia, knowledge as love, and the bridge between ancient naked-eye astronomy and modern tech are dramatized through concrete choices and discoveries. The story’s language about “covenant with the unknown” and regimes old and new culminates in a resonant final image of continuity rather than an explicit moral. There is some overt labeling of theme (“encrypted devotion,” “ancient astronomer’s love letter to the cosmos”) that edges toward telling, but it still feels earned by events. The piece leaves a clear emotional and conceptual aftertaste about humility before past knowledge and shared awe.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of inherited resentment, the cost of hatred, and nonviolent transformation are deeply embedded in the premise (weapons fueled by rage, a brother who collapses them by becoming its absence). The music box and the broken pin are strong thematic images that reconfigure meaning at the end when Kale supplies the missing piece. However, the piece edges toward didacticism in places (“Resentment was their fuel,” “He chose this”), spelling out ethical takeaways rather than fully trusting implication. The ending offers a resonant answer—release as difficult freedom—but in a slightly too-tidy, less morally tangled way for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of boundaries—between dreaming and waking, lost and found, staying and leaving—is woven through action and image rather than pure declaration, with the fog, sextant, and mirrors all enacting it. The line “You can’t capture a runaway dream, but you can recreate the boundary it crossed” neatly crystallizes the story’s stance without tipping into didacticism. The brother’s arc (“I mapped the spaces between things”) and Aria’s role as anchor subtly pose questions about memory, origin, and the costs of crossing thresholds. Some thematic statements approach explicit thesis, which slightly blunts the lingering ambiguity that might elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme around “deciduous vows,” adaptation vs tradition, and what persists beneath changing forms is well-integrated through objects (ribbon, grinding stone, cathedral trees). The conceptual reappraisal of Marta’s misreading of her mother’s phrase is satisfying and emerges from specific experience rather than abstract lecture. That said, several lines state the theme a bit directly (“not by denying change but by remembering what mattered beneath it all,” “Sometimes wisdom arrives accidentally”), edging into mild moralizing. The emotional aftereffect is warm and reflective rather than hauntingly ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of how knowledge is acquired (curated vs cultivated), the ethics of “forbidden” knowledge, and nonlinear inheritance are woven through objects, setting, and her professional history. The bathroom-epiphany motif and the “between first and last page” reframe work nicely as thematic engines rather than mere quirks. Some lines get close to stating the thesis outright (“some things couldn't be curated—only cultivated”), slightly dulling the subtext. Still, the final image of bright disquiet and the blank shell offers a resonant, non-literal answer about living inside an ongoing archive.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematically, the piece is rich: knowledge as organism, unlearned lessons as evolutionary dead-ends, and the shift from hoarding/consuming to sharing/cultivating are all organically tied to action. The final redefinition of “The Library of Unlearned Lessons” as a practice rather than a place is apt and reweights the whole narrative. Some lines edge toward thesis-statement explicitness (“Knowledge doesn’t grow in isolation”), which slightly reduces the need for the reader to infer. Still, the integrated imagery of seeds, diaries, and symphonies yields a strong, resonant aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme is rich: identity as composite and negotiated, grief as an ongoing rewriting of the past, and solace found in places where joy has irreversibly ended. Recurring motifs—the emerald card, the ship, the “garden of forgotten names”—shift meaning by the end, especially once the garden becomes an active threshold process rather than a place. The story avoids moralizing and accepts ambiguity: there is no singular “true” past, only chosen versions with costs. A few lines verge on explicitly stating the thematic engine (“wasn’t a place but a process”), slightly reducing subtextual subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—institutions as living narratives, the power of rearranging stories, and “fables of absence”/liminal spaces where understanding resides—is richly embedded in the rope, the door, and Maren’s vocation. The ending’s conceptual repricing (“spaces between certainty where understanding quietly lived”) is resonant and ties cleanly to the earlier motifs. However, the diplomat paragraph and some of the closing lines lean close to explicit gloss, edging toward telling the thesis rather than leaving more in subtext. It’s still strong, but a touch less spelled-out would deepen the lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thematic threads—finding peace not by erasing harm but by working with it, reading trauma’s “cracks” as a map—are organically tied to Kael’s skills and the cave’s history. The idea of silence as an active presence (“bloom of hush”) is a strong, non-trivial reframing. Yet the final paragraphs tilt into explicit statement (“Sometimes the path to peace lay in learning to read the patterns that trauma left behind”), edging toward essayistic moral instead of trusting the images. That explicitness slightly blunts what is otherwise a resonant, image-driven thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of coincidence-as-constellation, meaning after collapse, and silence + starlight as a new form of communication are rich and coherent. The prism’s brokenness reframed as design, and the beacon as “meaning, not just heat,” nicely embody the thematic concerns. That said, the story occasionally overstates its thesis (“Coincidences, she knew, were simply meaning waiting to be proven”), edging into explicit moralization where the images already suffice. The ending leaves a resonant emotional aftertaste but could trust subtext slightly more.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of memory, identity, and the ethics of preservation versus transformation emerge organically from the work of measuring shadows and the evolving behavior of the archive. The final image—an entity “mourning its future losses before they happened” and Elden becoming “the bridge between what was and what would be”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about what it means to be remembered while still remembering. Occasional explicit statements (“The collective memory had become self-aware”) tilt toward telling where implication is already strong, lightly flattening potential ambiguity. Still, the piece invites reflection beyond its plot with a durable, conceptually rich aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of failure, reframing damage, and “filtering” awareness toward what remains emerge organically through objects (mosaics, rags, lanterns) and Kael’s embodied return to craft. The final realization about “filtering forward” into who he might become effectively reweights earlier material and the note’s phrase “We filter truth from ash.” Some phrasing borders on thesis-statement clarity (“defy the gravity of hopelessness,” “filtering our awareness differently”), nudging toward mild authorial moralizing. Still, the closing image of primrose petals closing while lanterns burn provides a resonant, non-literal thematic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—transitions, grief, and the slow, un-rushable nature of transformation—is well integrated through concrete motifs: the cicada, the tidal cycles, the grotto as threshold. The metaphors are mostly earned from character and profession rather than imposed thesis; “I wanted to discover the texture of time itself” risks sounding abstract, but it’s reinforced by his decades-long attention to tidal pools and the cicada’s life cycle. The final image of Chen beginning to narrate “small” observations of the mother reframes time and transition in deeply personal terms. The piece avoids a didactic moral while offering a clear, resonant thematic stance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of hospitality (xenial), inherited survival strategies, and learning to be hospitable to oneself emerge coherently from particulars like bunkers vs. sky and “limiting exposure” reinterpreted through silence collection. The gilded hush and curated quiets serve as concrete vehicles for questions about preservation, protection, and self-constructed safety. The final choice reweights the opening premise without stating a crude moral. Some lines (“Not to understand bunkers, but to build the opposite…”) tread close to thesis articulation, slightly reducing subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme is coherent and well-integrated: silence as a living medium shaped by sound and memory, grief as a reconfiguration rather than erasure. The storm glass and prisms operate as apt, recurring images that echo the thematic concern. However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements (“Silence isn’t the absence of noise—it's the space where meaning lives”) that edge into didacticism and reduce subtext. The final promise is tender, but the wisdom feels a shade too articulated rather than wholly earned from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The thematic throughline—memory vs. power, true ascension as service to archives rather than occupancy of a throne—is strong and organically tied to her vocation and the empire’s propaganda. The inversion of up/down and throne/marker, plus the hidden archive beneath painted facades, offers a resonant conceptual answer to the premise. That said, some thematic statements are a bit explicit (“Not climbing to power, but ascending to understanding”), edging toward authorial gloss instead of leaving more work to image and implication. The ending image is potent but leans more conceptual than emotionally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic core—redefining love and obligation, reclaiming boundaries, and learning to “burn carefully” instead of self-erasing—is strong, consistent, and grounded in concrete images (ash, burned bridges, wedding bands as metal). However, much of the thematic work is explicitly articulated in dialogue and narration (“you were taught that love means accommodation, that care means self-erasure”), reducing subtext and leaving little interpretive space. The closing transformation of “suffocating” into “breathing” is resonant, if also quite on-the-nose. The piece invites reflection on codependency and autonomy, but with a relatively tidy moral rather than lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.3)
    The pressure→diamond metaphor is coherent and threaded through character history, worldbuilding, and the final image; the bolt and diamonds concretize the thematic question of how suffering can be transmuted rather than erased. The multiverse selves and “promises that could be kept across all dimensions” nicely complicate ideas of choice and responsibility. That said, lines like “Suffering endured with awareness became wisdom” edge toward declarative moral rather than leaving the insight fully in image and action, and the thematic movement is relatively straightforwardly redemptive. The piece invites some reflection but stops short of a more ambivalent or challenging stance.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of inherited guilt, the politics of official histories, and the idea that “silences in family histories are themselves a kind of testimony” are woven consistently through action and image. The bridge between past and present—via intuition, archive, and encoded confession—supports a resonant exploration of what justice can mean when roots are rotten. Some thematic lines verge on explicit statement, slightly softening the subtextual power. Still, the ending reweights prior events convincingly and invites reflection on reparations and moral responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of agency under determinism, duty as performance, and visibility of one’s “strings” are coherently woven through image (marionette program, crossbars, standardized vs forgotten patterns) and action. The ending’s reframing of the greenhouse as a stage “where possibility took shape” nicely reweights the entire piece. Some thematic sentences border on thesis statements (“The strings would always be there…The question was whether you moved with eyes open or closed”), slightly diminishing subtlety. Still, the story leaves a resonant, non-didactic afterimage about chosen motion within constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: dust as accidental archive, the button as credential and relic, misfiled letters as systemic failure, and Miriam’s quiet corrective. The piece thoughtfully examines how institutions both erase and preserve love, and how bearing witness can be a form of belated, limited justice. A few lines verge on explicit statement (“These unknown histories deserved to be magnified, spoken, remembered”), but they largely feel like natural extensions of Miriam’s realization. The final image of her tactful cross-referencing and acceptance of “enough” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of truth versus manufactured consensus, and the “tyranny of indifference,” emerge naturally from concrete particulars (rewritten stars, missing streets, auric water as incorruptible record). The coded freedom concept is embodied rather than just stated, particularly in how the photographs will provoke cognitive dissonance in ordinary people. However, there is noticeable essayistic explanation (“Most people accepted it, choosing comfort over confrontation…”) and the final paragraph edges toward thesis restatement instead of letting images fully carry the weight. The result is resonant but slightly over-articulated for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres strongly around silence, negative space, and how love and protection can be enacted through what is unsaid. The integration of jazz, coded prophecy, and the idea of “hushing” truth instead of denying it gives the piece a nuanced, non-binary stance on secrecy vs. revelation. Some lines edge toward explicit thematic statement (“The knowledge that some battles were won not through force but through the exquisite placement of quiet…”), but they still arise recognizably from Marcus’s experience. The final image—carrying silence like a song—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of remembrance, repair, and honoring “small, overlooked things” emerge naturally from Miren’s work with seeds and the arbor’s function as a memorial. Her shift from mechanical sorting to deliberate ritual building embodies the idea that healing comes through attentive, patterned remembrance. Some formulations lean toward overt statement (“how what was broken might be made whole again through remembrance”), flirting with didacticism rather than leaving more room for inference. Still, the final notion that she has become the message she sought is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs—broken clocks, the malfunctioning compass, ashes and new growth, water’s chaotic rhythm—support a coherent theme about trusting uncertainty and finding order within apparent failure. However, the story often states its ideas outright, especially in the admiral’s notes and the closing paragraphs (“broken instruments sometimes measured the only truths worth knowing”), which veers into explicit moralizing. The thematic arc is integrated and resonant, but the didactic phrasing flattens some potential complexity and subtext. A subtler approach to the same images would raise the literary charge.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of grief, repair, and the enduring weight of names emerge organically through the kintsugi metaphor, alchemical practice, and final candle image. The story’s answer—that breaking is not the same as ending, and that visible fracture can be a form of truth—is dramatized rather than merely asserted. Some lines verge on thesis-statement territory (“The fracture becomes part of the beauty,” “Your daughter’s name still means something”), which slightly flattens subtext. Overall, though, the piece maintains emotional honesty and avoids neat moralism by acknowledging Mara has “redeemed nothing, perhaps.”

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: tragedy interwoven with banality, and healing as integration rather than erasure of pain. The cake/frosting detail and the echoed laughter embody the idea that memory must hold both horror and tenderness, without the narrator spelling it out. The final image of Kael seeking “the next luminous ache” reweights the opening premise into an ethic, not a slogan. Complexity is present—this isn’t painless catharsis—but the piece does tilt toward a gentle, hopeful answer.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of mercy versus quantification, trauma as language, and choosing what we “enhance” emerge organically from Sera’s history, perceptions, and the forest’s design. The mask, the UV light, and the geometric planting all carry thematic weight and are reprised meaningfully at the end. Some of the thematic content is voiced a bit directly (“Mercy has no formula,” “that’s our penance”), which slightly blunts subtext in favor of statement. Still, the piece leaves a resonant, complex aftertaste about how survivors repurpose the tools of their own harm.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of translation, liminal spaces, and the ethics of remembering are woven through concrete particulars: repurposed structures, hidden portraits, and intergenerational mirroring at the end. The idea that meaning resides “in the between-space” accrues across market, studio, and exhibition, and the lighthouse light as ongoing guide for migrants is a resonant metaphor. Some thematic statements are delivered a bit on-the-nose (“It’s not about converting one thing to another—it's about honoring what exists in the between-space”), edging toward thesis articulation rather than pure emergence. Still, the closing image offers a non-literal answer that reweights what came before without devolving into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of hidden burdens, preservation versus demolition, and the way people stash their “most precious things overhead” emerge organically from Marcus’s work, the ceiling search, and Celeste’s ghost. The mainspring barrel as “heart” of the carousel and the idea that some secrets should be brought back into the light are well integrated with his vocation and his past with his daughter. However, the final paragraph edges into aphoristic statement (“Some secrets… were meant to be discovered”) that slightly flattens the otherwise delicate subtext. Even so, the closing sense of chosen responsibility and gentle haunting lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—awakening requiring the surrender of illusory safety and timelessness—is well integrated with image systems (loops, frost patterns, falling vs flying, compressed eternity). The bottled whisper scene sharply reweights Marina’s earlier choice and grounds the thematic pivot in character, not abstract philosophy. However, some lines verge on aphoristic statement (“Every perfect system contains the seeds of its own destabilization”; “awakening always feels like falling until you remember how to fly”), which flirts with on-the-nose moralizing rather than letting implication do all the work. The resonance is real but slightly over-articulated for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story’s thematic core—how civilizations integrate loss and brokenness into beauty, and how that reframes revolution—is strong and organically connected to objects and setting. Recurring motifs (shards, mirrors, storms, time-light) gain meaning by the end. However, the theme is sometimes stated a bit too directly in thesis-like sentences (“A civilization that writes grief into its walls…”; “This baroque excess isn't wealth display but emotional archaeology”), edging toward essayistic explanation. The resonance is real but slightly dulled by that explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story organically develops a theme of “small magics” and the ethics of intention in craft: something “perfect and profoundly broken” must be mended at the level of purpose, not mechanics. The box, the philosopher’s stone, and the covenant of rust all echo the danger of misdirected transformation, while Aldric’s work affirms repair as moral labor. The final lines about “small magics that repair the world one gear at a time” land as earned resonance rather than sermon. Complexity is modest but genuine, with room for lingering reflection on unseen covenants and quiet restorations.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of certainty vs mystery, extraction vs reverence, and memory embedded in matter emerge organically from particulars (factory vs lake, limestone for “architecture of certainty,” water that “remembers”). The final image—Mara diving as the compass needle points toward “nothing and everything at once”—reweights the story as an embrace of irreducible strangeness without stating a moral. Recurring motifs (petrichor, hinges, instruments failing) are well managed and accumulate resonance rather than feeling forced. A slightly deeper dramatized conflict between her scientific work and mystical leanings could add even more complexity, but thematic integration is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The thematic throughline—art as a transparent layering of histories and “timewoven alliances” across generations—is coherent and organically tied to the slide, driftwood, and navigation without instruments. The final image of carrying the archway’s lesson forward and ignoring the GPS nicely reweights earlier material. However, several sentences step into overt thesis language (“she understood something new about timewoven alliances,” “the strongest structures don’t hide their history”), which slightly dulls subtext. The piece still leaves a resonant, contemplative aftertaste, but with a bit of on-the-nose framing.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme—redefining darkness as a different kind of light and validating “moon-rooted” identities—is coherent and organically tied to concrete particulars (flowers, windows, seasons). The final image of unseen flowers greeting their “rightful sun” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial question. That said, Father Benedict’s dialogue and especially the grandmother’s postcard veer into thesis articulation, edging toward overt statement rather than leaving more work to subtext. The insight feels earned but somewhat over-spelled for an elite literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of witness, memory, and justice are strongly integrated into the premise and the closing image of the “bridge between the living and the remembered.” The lagoon as a mass grave of memories, coupled with the covenant between Malik and Sarai, offers a resonant answer to the question of how the dead can demand justice. Some lines verge on thesis-statement territory (“voice for the voiceless,” “what power claimed and what justice demanded”), which slightly blunts subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme—rejecting numbing illusions and parasitic wishes in favor of difficult, honest rebuilding—is very clear and well braided with the bottle, the wish-house, and the lanterns. The final image of lanterns lit by human hands rather than magic strongly embodies the thematic answer without needing a moral spelled out. However, the narration sometimes edges into direct thesis-stating (“wishes were parasites,” “the hardest alchemy was transforming death into honest life”), which slightly flattens subtext and ambiguity. The piece still produces a coherent, reflective aftereffect, but with less subtlety than top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic threads—memory versus record, emotional residue versus factual archive, the necessity of “dead” languages to hold certain truths—are woven through events and objects rather than lectured. The line “You learned to listen to what’s already gone. Good. Now teach others.” flirts with explicitness but largely earns its weight from prior particulars. The prophecy about “which voice the city remembers” dovetails well with Marcus’s role as municipal archivist and the wax shavings conceit. The result is resonant, layered, and not reducible to a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of preservation vs stasis, time as inheritance, and the necessity of chaos for growth are integrated into the events and recurring images (seeds, ice, vortex) rather than bolted on. The final uncertainty—“The seed would sprout or it wouldn't”—is a strong, resonant answer to the opening condition of frozen certainties. However, some lines verge on thesis-statement (“a world that had forgotten the difference between preservation and stasis,” “borrowed time must always be returned”), slightly flattening what is otherwise rich, implicit thematic work. Overall the piece invites reflection without confusion, but trims of explicit moralizing would raise it further.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of human attention versus automated noise, old tech as embodied wisdom, and the ethics of restraint in warning systems arise organically from Mara’s work and the rope. Her commitment to “listening” rather than constant broadcasting is not lectured but shown through her selective use of the bell and mistrust of over-alarming. The final image of her releasing the rope into silence reframes that silence as charged and earned, not empty. The piece could invite even deeper ambiguity (e.g., Mara’s possible fallibility) but still leaves a resonant, non-didactic sense of what it costs to hold that stance.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of surrender, vulnerability as strength, and witnessing versus possessing the cosmos are clear and woven through meteors, dust, and cleaning rituals. The lantern and falling-star motifs do get reweighted at the end, reinforcing a conceptual answer to the opening loneliness. However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements (“the point wasn’t to capture the stars but to witness them,” “surrender itself was a kind of strength”), tipping into didactic rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and genuine but slightly blunted by that on-the-nose articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic throughline—unspoken words becoming ghosts that haunt individuals and communities—is coherent and well-mirrored by bees, drought, covenant, and ghosts. The notion of becoming a “keeper not of bees, but of what people had been too afraid to say” is a strong, image-based articulation of the story’s idea. However, the theme is often stated outright (“this silence is poison”; “what we don’t say becomes the ghost that haunts us”), and the final paragraph explicitly explains the moral rather than letting images and implication fully carry it. That didactic tilt blunts some potential subtlety and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    Thematic work around the cost of timelessness, nostalgia for structure, and the difference between “anticipated” and “lived” mystery is elegant and coherent. The recurring motif of fragments (the urn shard, watches, appointment books) concretizes the idea of damaged time capsules. Some thematic articulation is perhaps a touch on-the-nose—e.g., “Time was a river that carried everyone at the same speed”—but it still emerges credibly from Mira’s role as explainer. The ending reweights the premise effectively, suggesting both the comfort and violence of measured time without flattening into a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—beauty in the incomplete, refusing sterile perfection, shared grieving—is tightly woven through kite, feather, “woven dawns,” and the act of transcription. The story earns much of its resonance through particulars: torn feather, boy’s description of his grandmother’s hands, the mirrored lagoon. However, the final paragraph states the thesis too directly (“The incomplete… is where light enters… wholeness wasn’t the goal”), edging into essayistic moralizing that the earlier imagery had already earned implicitly. That explicitness trims some of the lingering ambiguity a top-tier literary venue would prefer.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of collaboration with nature, respect as structural design rather than sentiment, and humans as one voice in a multispecies conversation are powerfully embedded in the orchard’s mechanics and Maren’s choices. The conceptual reframing of the temple as a “translation device” and the final scene of her joining the dialogue are resonant. That said, several lines verge on essayistic thesis (“respect isn’t tolerance. It’s architecture.”; “we don’t care for nature. We participate in its conversations”), which blunts the subtextual power by stating what the story has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, homecoming, and the impossibility of fully re-inhabiting preserved moments emerge clearly through amber, footprints, and the overgrown sculptures. The story effectively explores how repetition both deepens and erases, and how humans bend trajectories back while the aliens diverge forward. However, some thematic content is delivered in fairly explicit dialogue (“That’s what homecoming is—the attempt to re-enter a preserved moment, knowing it’s impossible”), which edges toward essayistic. The ending image and Quorum’s decision still provide a resonant, non-literal answer that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thematic threads—battlefield to garden, dead languages and dead reefs fostering new life, “submerged concord” as a model for post-war harmony—are woven into concrete actions instead of abstract speechifying. The line “Mortuus est campus, vivat hortus” neatly encapsulates the core idea without feeling like a pasted-on thesis, and the multilingual communication with birds elegantly undercuts the notion of borders worth fighting over. The ending image of seeds reclaiming a place of waste carries earned emotional and conceptual weight. There is a touch of clarity that flirts with aphorism, but it remains anchored in the particulars of this shore and this man.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of distance, fear, memory, and connection are strongly integrated through the leaf, the cylinders, Mercy’s past work, and the final collective march. Yet the piece repeatedly states its thesis outright (“Distance…is what killed us”; “distance had always been an illusion”), veering into sermon-like clarity where subtext could suffice. The ending image nicely reweights prior material, but the moral is more told than earned via on-page friction. Resonant, but not subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of exile transformed into self-authored orientation, and of perspective shaping reality, emerge organically from the interplay of time dilation, mapping, and ritual. The compass rose and “true north” recur as effective motifs that reweight meaning at the end. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit thesis statement (“True north was wherever you stood when you stopped running from yourself”), which flattens ambiguity and reads slightly didactic. The emotional aftereffect is thoughtful and quiet, but not as layered or subtext-driven as it could be at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic spine—secrets as flowing water, wonder as something to live with rather than conquer—is coherent and organically tied to the chess pieces, sundial, and brass sky. Kael’s changed practice of swapping secrets concretizes the idea of wonder circulating rather than being hoarded. However, the guardian’s explicit statements (“The unknown…is not something to be conquered or collected”) verge on didactic and flatten some potential ambiguity. The ending resonates, but it leans more toward articulated moral than oblique, lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—the primacy of ordinary human gestures over grand narratives in times of collapse—is deeply embedded in specifics (soup kitchens, shared coffee, violin lessons, missing pawns). Subtext operates well through objects and patterns (the pawnless chessboard, walking-words, the “nomadic penumbra”). However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit statement (“the ordinary courage of people simply trying to remain human”), which slightly mutes what the images already convey. Despite that, the piece leaves a resonant, non-trite aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of buried talents, self-knowledge, and “the shape of home” emerge organically through stone/feather/mountain imagery and her life-choices rather than pure thesis. The reweighting of “lost language” from external mystery to internal lexicon is a strong conceptual turn, and the final refracted sunlight offers a resonant, non-literal answer about belonging. A few lines (“She had been trying to understand the shape of home.”) move toward explicit statement and slightly reduce mystery. Overall, the piece avoids moralizing and leaves a textured afterimage around visibility, reflection, and blooming.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of imperfection, forgiveness, and the value of “mistakes in the fabric” arise naturally from the tapestry metaphor and Petrov’s history. Recurring images (threads, labyrinth, frozen time) reweight themselves meaningfully by the ending, especially in the line about “the moves that chess never taught—how to forgive the player behind the pieces.” However, the thematic articulation sometimes tips into explicit statement (“The weavers had known that perfection was sterile…”) that edges toward moralizing. That slight over-clarity flattens some of the potential lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of truth as prism vs point, and forgiveness as courage rather than clarity, are well integrated with the echo mechanics and Mara’s artistic drive. The canyon’s distortions literalize the idea of refracted confession, giving the thematic argument concrete embodiment. Some thematic statements (“I think truth is a prism, not a point”; “The price of forgiveness…”) are articulated a bit too directly for top-tier subtlety. Still, the final “I forgive you” / “I forge through you” exchange offers a resonant, non-literal reframing of the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    The kintsugi theme—repairing and honoring damage rather than erasing it—is cleanly embodied in the charm, the statue, and the plan to heal the sea via luminous scars. The story’s answer to meaning “at the edge of oblivion” arises from concrete particulars: the pockmarks as map, generational work, and intention-laden objects. However, the theme is sometimes stated too directly (“This is how you transmute loss…”, “They needed meaning conjured from the edge of oblivion”), edging toward essayistic clarity rather than fully trusting image and action. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but could benefit from slightly less explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of distance vs presence, permanence vs ephemerality, and art as honest witness emerge organically from the mirror, quay, cave, and shells. The shells-as-fragments mirroring the shattered mirror is a strong, specific thematic device. However, the final paragraphs lean into explicit thesis statements (“art wasn’t about…”, “nostalgia was just another form of distance”) that flatten some of the subtext. The piece would be stronger if more of this insight were left in image and implication rather than spelled out.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of gentleness-as-power, intent, and “whispers vs. shouts” are well woven into objects (vial, garden soil), setting (lighthouse, fog horn), and action (shortened pulse, beckoning instead of blocking). The story’s concept of “screaming tenderness” is strong and distinctive, and the captain’s quiet, contemplative course correction embodies it nicely. However, the final paragraphs lean into overt thesis articulation (“Sometimes the fiercest love speaks most quietly…”) that edges toward moralizing rather than trusting the scene and images to carry the weight. The thematic answer is compelling but slightly overexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, progress vs. return, and the desire to abolish loss by overloading the past arise organically from objects and actions (patina as calendar, reverse migration as gravitational well of history). The final realization—people trying to “build it backward, memory by memory, until loss becomes impossible”—reweights the whole premise without sinking into moralizing. There is a slight tendency toward explicit thematic statement in the phone dialogue, but it stops short of sermonizing and stays grounded in the situation. The ending’s commitment to “navigating what remains” offers a resonant, non-literal answer about living forward with loss rather than erasing it.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thematic core—how rationality can include space for symbol and placebo, especially in a world of weaponized truth—is rich and well seeded through Mira’s habits and the virus premise. The glass eye as a focus for chosen, graceful truth-telling carries strong subtext. The explicit articulation (“She understood now that rationality wasn’t about dismissing human need for ritual and symbol”) edges into on-the-nose moralizing, undercutting some of the potential resonance that the images already earn.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of stewardship, continuity of memory, and quiet obligation are well woven through the motifs of light, the sea’s secrets, Edelweiss, and the old woman’s story. The idea that “some memories didn’t belong to the people who held them—they were borrowed” effectively reframes Magnus’s role at the end. That said, the last paragraphs lean into explicit thematic statement (“that’s what keepers do—they tend the light, they mark the gaps”) in a way that borders on spelled-out thesis. The piece still leaves a resonant, contemplative aftertaste, but with a touch more telling than elite markets typically tolerate.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The map/doorway/ants motif elegantly supports a theme about choice, agency, and promises as permissions rather than obligations, and the final reconfiguration of the grandmother’s “promise” is satisfying. The comparison to ants—each knowing its role yet collectively adaptive—nicely underpins the idea that paths are iterable, not fixed. That said, the story undercuts some of its subtlety by voicing the thesis directly (“The choice didn’t matter as much as the choosing” and the last line’s explanatory framing). With a bit less explicit moralizing and more reliance on image and implication, this could land at a higher literary register.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of power’s emotional cost, the limits of prophecy, and the necessity of self-witness emerge organically from specific images and memories. The fireflies, younger reflection, and “kingdom of whispers and half-truths” all reweight themselves by the ending, where she becomes both ruler and witness to her own damage. The grotto’s line about forgetting “what it means to feel” edges toward explicit thesis, but it’s grounded enough in dramatized experience to avoid sermonizing. The final image of starlight as a wound that might teach her to heal is resonant without feeling didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic core—revaluing light from commodity to testimony, presence versus extraction—is strong and coherently mirrored in objects (pocket-suns, nautilus, crystallized teardrops). The final image of spheres holding “the immeasurable weight of being truly, completely here” resonates and clearly answers the story’s conceptual question. That said, theme is often delivered in explicit thesis statements (“I want to revalue everything they taught me”) rather than left fully to subtext and image, which blunts some literary subtlety. The result is thoughtful and affecting but edges toward didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory as story, the instability of time, and the ethics and cost of turning chaos into narrative are woven through dreams, profession, and the grave encounter. The envy/pity toward her other selves introduces rich moral and existential ambiguity. However, the piece edges toward explicit thesis with lines like “They didn’t know yet what she knew: that memory was just another story,” which slightly flattens subtext into statement. The final image still resonates, but with a touch more telling than necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of ordinary miracles, intergenerational female autonomy, and the value of the “broken” are well woven through object, setting, and Elena’s history. The revaluation of the screw from relic to active talisman of self-authorized beginnings is a strong thematic move, and the fog-lifting image nicely echoes emotional clarification. Some lines edge toward stated thesis (“Some things need to break so something new can flow through,” “talisman of beginnings”), which feels slightly more declarative than necessary in an otherwise subtle piece. The emotional aftereffect is genuine and quiet, if a touch didactic at the level of phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—transforming trauma into integrated narrative rather than erasing it—emerges organically from the scars, runes, and intergenerational magic. Particulars like “what the flames could not take” and scars as “a manuscript written in flesh and experience” give the piece specific emotional weight. The ending image of a “living text” walking into the storm offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial question of how to live with pain. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“They had become a text she could read”), slightly softening the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of the damaging permanence of words, the partiality of miracles, and the need to honor human “messiness” in both art and life emerge organically from specific images and choices. Motifs like frozen rivers, induced currents, annotations, and off-season blossoms gain new weight by the end, reframing exorcism as flawed reconnection rather than clean erasure. Lines such as “Miracles don’t work that way—they’re always incomplete, always leaving scars” verge on thesis but are supported by concrete cost (Vivienne’s life, the doomed orchard). The ending’s quiet charge invites reflection without collapsing into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    Thematic through-line is strong: illusions as separations, spiral arbitration as dissolution of fixed positions, and the final understanding that the illusion/truth binary itself is illusory all cohere. The closing reweights earlier material (especially the mentor’s warning about words) in a satisfying conceptual way. Yet the story leans heavily on explicit philosophical statement (“The cosmos wasn’t hiding truth beneath layers of deception…”) rather than letting images and choices carry the argument. That degree of overt moralizing and abstraction undercuts the subtlety expected at top literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of measurement, human attempts to impose order, and the negotiability of time emerge organically from the work, the anomaly, and the experiment. Recurring images (razor-straight horizon/razor-edged key) shift meaning by the end, supporting a nuanced view of time as both cut and seam. The final paragraphs do veer toward explicit statement (“measuring what they had always measured: not time itself, but humanity's desperate agreement...”), edging into mild essayistic explanation. That slight moralizing tone blunts what is otherwise a very resonant, image-driven thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic weave of permeability, networks, and letting go is clear and integrated with concrete particulars (mycelium, intrusion detection, the spring). However, the story often states its themes directly (“It’s a physical metaphor,” “Physics of letting go would be about energy transfer,” “She’d been treating connections like security protocols”), which edges toward didactic rather than letting subtext carry the weight. The repeated “quiet wildfire of understanding” is evocative but a bit on-the-nose when reused. The ending nonetheless offers a resonant, non-literal answer—release as default state—that lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of chaos vs. meaning, probability vs. possibility, and loving damaged people are well-integrated into concrete choices and images (graffiti as koans, the “WIDEN YOUR VIEW” message, clover as melancholy). The final recognition that “probability… was about possibility” and that sitting beside her father without answers can be responsible is emotionally honest. That said, the story edges toward didacticism: several lines articulate thesis-like insights rather directly rather than trusting subtext and image alone. This slightly blunts the lingering ambiguity that the material could support.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of urban loneliness, misconnection, and the possibility that “wrong numbers” can be right are woven through the job concept, the father’s grief, and the glass harmonica’s haunting/hopeful tones. The notion of “teaching endings how to begin” is elegantly dramatized when she reframes a dead daughter’s number as the route to reconciling with a living son. Some thematic language is a bit on-the-nose (“cultivated estrangement,” “psychic infrastructure,” the closing “invitation” line), edging toward explicit statement rather than pure subtext. Still, the story leaves a resonant afterimage rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of witnessing, the weight of small moments, and the idea that leaving is part of understanding return are woven through the walnut ink, covenant, and jasmine motifs. The final realization—that the covenant regenerates not through magic but thorough witnessing—nicely reweights earlier details. Some thematic lines are too explicit (“not through magic but through the simple… act of witnessing”), tipping toward sermonizing rather than trusting subtext. Still, the conceptual linkage between archival practice and communal redemption is strong and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of reciprocity, mutual aid, and the unaddressed disaster of loneliness are strong and organically tied to character and setting. The moon rocks’ shift from “magic” to “permission” is an excellent thematic turn that reweights prior images. However, several lines state the thesis quite explicitly (“The thing about loneliness…”, “Reciprocity was the invisible currency…”, “a network for the networkers”), edging toward essayistic moralizing rather than leaving more work to subtext. The ending is resonant but slightly over-explained, where a touch more restraint could heighten its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of grief, mapping, language, and home cohere beautifully, with the stillpoint serving as a strong organizing metaphor that reweights prior images at the end. The closing insight—that some maps “must be drawn in the language of absence”—is emotionally resonant and emerges from lived particulars (the sister’s song, the lost mentor) rather than generic sentiment. However, a few sentences state the thematic thesis too directly (“grief wasn’t an unmapped void…”) and edge toward explanation over implication. This slight didactic tilt in the final third holds the piece below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of anomaly, pen, and profession: interpretation versus authorship, drafts of reality, and the ethics/comfort of living between versions. Recurring images (the bent/straightened nib, the “margin between drafts,” confident uncertainty) are reweighted in the final paragraphs without slipping into overt moralizing. Occasionally the language edges toward explicit thesis (“Her station existed in the margin between drafts of reality”), but it still feels earned by prior imagery. The ending’s answer—that meaning-making is participatory and destabilizing yet consoling—resonates beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of presence vs permanence, visibility vs erasure, and transforming loss into art are woven coherently through the camera, the harbor, and the translation of light to sound. Gestures, silence, and non-auditory communication carry real subtext, especially in Marina’s line about gestures being all that’s left when no one remembers you. The ending’s “Nothing captured. Everything preserved.” nicely crystallizes a conceptual repricing of what preservation means. Some thematic lines (“Not permanence, but presence. Not memory, but meaning.”) veer toward explicit moralizing, slightly blunting the otherwise organic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of censored love, institutional erasure, and the cost of keeping promises emerge organically from particulars like the vandalized self-portrait and Kenji’s grandmother’s erasure. The image of artists across eras preserving forbidden love is potent, and the “acts of destruction as acts of love” concept has bite. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis explicitly (“that love transcends the civilizations that try to contain it,” “worth fighting for, worth preserving, worth remembering”), edging into didactic territory. A bit more reliance on implication and image over direct assertion would elevate the thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of isolation vs. collaborative consciousness, grief, and the cost/beauty of surrendering individuality emerge organically from the worldbuilding and the characters’ losses. The recurring sound/musical imagery and the garden’s reactions give thematic weight to the idea of minds as harmonies rather than sealed units. The line “Maybe that’s not a failure…Maybe that’s the discovery” edges toward thesis-statement but is supported enough by prior scene work to avoid feeling purely didactic. The final image of “two minds learning to become one song” offers a resonant, if a bit on-the-nose, answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of listening versus shouting, pattern in chaos, and true orientation are well-seeded through recurring images (folded maps, footsteps, whispers, the storm’s “dance”). The final realization—that the labyrinth is about hearing the path rather than escaping—is thematically apt and ties back to earlier details. However, some insights are stated a bit too directly (“The labyrinth had never been about…”) and the dialogue occasionally edges toward thesis delivery. The piece hints at deeper social or moral costs of joining the inner circle but doesn’t quite explore them.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs of reflection, constellations, shutters as language, and “witness” build a coherent theme of silent empathy and making the unseen visible. The final gesture—aligning Marina’s motive with the guardian’s “to teach darkness the value of stars”—reweights the earlier imagery and offers a clear thematic answer about marginalized lives deserving to be seen. That phrase veers close to overt moralization and slightly flattens the complexity suggested by the earlier, subtler images. Still, the story mostly trusts scene and symbol over sermon, leaving a resonant emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of conformity, questioning, and small-scale resistance are woven through chess metaphors, window imagery, and the “forests of second thoughts” motif. The piece mostly lets images (chess moves, mist, synchronized displays) carry the theme, though some lines verge on thesis statements (“Amplified quiet is louder than shouting.”). The final image of the library as a lighthouse effectively reweights the story’s argument for quiet, deliberate dissent. Overall it’s resonant, if slightly didactic at moments.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—freedom through embracing one’s true nature versus the comfort of duty—is well-integrated with the scrimshaw, disappearing island, and whale call as motifs of transformation and sanctuary. The final image of them on the border between land and sea offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Yet the piece leans into explicit thesis statements (“The island only appears for those brave enough to change,” “terrible, beautiful liberation of finally embracing their true nature”), edging toward didactic clarity. This directness undercuts some of the potential complexity and ambiguity that could elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—how enforced happiness maims authentic grief and how people relearn feeling afterward—emerges through action and charged objects rather than abstract essaying. The bouquet and the narrated performances carry strong subtext about witnessing, complicity, and survival. Lines like “Because grief needs witnesses” and “cultivating lightness in grief doesn’t mean erasing the grief itself” edge toward thesis-statement clarity but remain grounded in specific experience. The ending image reweights the premise in a resonant, non-moralizing way.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of language-as-control vs language-as-beauty, and of meaning’s fluidity, are woven clearly through the ban history, Meris’s refusal of paraphrase, and the colonnade’s nonverbal frequencies. The frozen lake and wind patterns deepen the idea of ephemeral yet real meaning. However, several lines state the thesis quite directly (“translation into fixed meaning destroys the very thing that makes it alive”; “language can serve beauty rather than control”), edging toward essay rather than purely emergent theme. The final image still resonates and reweights the opening in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of awakening, perception beyond color, and beauty in imperfection are woven consistently through Maya’s gift, the bent reed, and the phoenix’s disruptive effect. The reed’s history (“residue of ten thousand songs”) and the idea that worn places are where beauty lives are strong, concrete vehicles for the theme. However, several lines state the thesis outright (“There’s beauty in what’s been worn down by living,” “proof that being broken by the world was just another way of being beautiful”), tipping slightly into didactic clarity rather than trusting subtext. The ending still resonates, but it feels a touch explained rather than fully left to image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thematic through-line—connection as a frequency/pilgrimage and the ethics of studying vs sharing intimacy—is coherent and well woven with images of sound, light, and touch. The final realization reweights earlier material, especially the surgery and the bells, in a satisfying way. However, the piece leans into explicit thesis-like phrasing (“synthetic belonging,” “what we might become again,” “what the darkness had almost stolen”) that edges toward essayistic explanation. It’s moving and honest, but slightly more told-than-felt than top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of grief, authenticity versus performance, and the right to mourn on one’s own timetable emerge organically from the specifics of mourning jewelry, tattoo stencils, and “curtains of intention.” The recurring question of what to reveal versus what to conceal gains weight via Senna’s brooch with windows and the final image of the curtains “parted slightly,” suggesting earned but incomplete openness. Some lines articulate theme a bit directly (“We’re making permission to feel,” “genuinely artificial keepsakes that somehow held more truth”), flirting with didacticism but mostly redeemed by concrete context. The ending leaves a resonant sense of possibility without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—about knowledge in unfashionable languages, divination and data as kin, and cultural wisdom smuggled through technology—is rich and coherent, and the grandmother/Vesper parallel is an elegant thematic mirror. However, several key insights are stated outright (“Because after the tech boom, that was the only language people valued”; “The crashes hadn’t destroyed knowledge…”) rather than allowed to fully emerge from image and action. The final realization does reweight prior material, but in a somewhat essayistic register. Strong resonance, but the didactic notes and limited conflict keep it below a more piercing, ambiguous thematic landing.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece engages thoughtfully with themes of transcendence vs. embodied life, the seduction and danger of forbidden knowledge, and the idea that some truths are too costly to pursue. These arise organically from particulars (parents holding children before dissolving, the contrast between purified understanding and “small perfect things”) rather than from abstract thesis alone. However, the closing articulation (“why some wisdom is forbidden—not because it's false, but because it's true”) edges into explicit moralizing, slightly flattening an otherwise resonant ambiguity. The emotional aftertaste of loss and hard-won caution still lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of authentic vs. commodified hope is woven through dream imagery, the archive’s evolution, and the grandmother’s unshared dream, not just abstract claim. The “shadow unbound” idea and the insistence that hope must include darkness feel conceptually rich, with the river stone and dusk serving as recurring particulars that reweight meaning at the end. There is a bit of direct thematic statement (“shared dreams weren’t preserving hope—they were killing it”), but it remains grounded in concrete contrast between recordings. The ending avoids a tidy moral by suggesting a harder, less comforting form of hope rather than a simple fix, leaving a resonant aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—truth vs method, self-respect vs compassion, growth through shedding—is well-integrated via recurring images (regenerated tail, shed skin, mist’s obscuring/revealing) and Elena’s professional context. The chameleon’s shedding and regeneration mirror her ethical reconstruction without feeling forced. However, several sentences edge into thesis-statement territory (“not all truth came pre-packaged in statistical significance”), slightly flattening subtext into commentary. The ending still lands as a resonant, image-backed answer to the opening question of what “truth” will look like for her now.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, witness, trauma, and the necessity/pain of reopening wounds are woven through concrete motifs: scars, coffee rings, plant-consciousness, the frozen hourglass. The final pivot from “seeking closure” to “seeking justice,” grounded in specific images (roses testifying, the table remembering), offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to the story’s question. Subtext—about who gets to speak, whose testimony counts, and what it costs to listen—is present without sermonizing. The final line edges close to aphoristic, but is supported enough by prior particulars to feel earned rather than platitudinous.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of unrealized love, missed chances, and the afterlife of unused emotion are tightly woven through objects (letters, film strips) and the setting’s function. The story suggests that unspoken love still has weight and can be re-routed into future lives, without proclaiming a moral outright. The “songs whose forgotten lyrics search for tune” motif and the closing image of those lyrics finding their tune create a satisfying thematic echo. There is a slight risk of over-explicitness in lines like “She couldn’t return the unused love to its sources,” but overall the resonance feels earned rather than didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    The thematic throughline—creativity dying under total control and reborn through embraced imperfection—is clear and well embodied in the Keeper/Celestine mirror. Motifs like falling stars, remembered stardust, and the astrolabe’s warmth/cold reprise support the thematic arc. However, several lines articulate the thesis rather directly (“You need to let go,” the universe whispering “Create”), tipping into mild didacticism. More reliance on image and implication and less explicit moralizing would raise this to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of hope after ruin, agency within probabilistic reality, and the idea of nurturing possibility instead of restoring a lost past are strongly woven through seeds, smoke clouds, and the divergent archive. The final realization—that the dreamless guard becomes a vessel for the world’s fractured dreaming—reweights earlier details without devolving into a neat moral. Some lines (“Reality could be cultivated”) edge close to thesis-statement territory but are supported by enough concrete image work to avoid sermonizing. The emotional aftereffect is quiet, conceptual hope more than visceral ache, but it lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of certainty vs. uncertainty, conscious vs. unconscious reasoning, and mind as landscape are coherent and tightly interwoven with the setting and action. The recursion of “mandala,” “probable miracles,” and the final realization that “sleep was his laboratory” create a satisfying conceptual loop. However, the piece occasionally overstates its thesis in essayistic lines (“certainty was a cage”; “The sixth sense… wasn’t mystical but deeply practical”), reducing subtext and leaving less for the reader to infer. The resonance is real but a bit too explained for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of tethering, fear-as-leash, and unused courage are coherently developed through recurring images (leash, anchor, indirect routes, twilight) and Mara’s specific life choices. The reframing of Luna as running “toward something” and courage as a place where the dog waits gives a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, several thematic statements are quite explicit—“The courage you need has been waiting, unused, all this time”—which nudges the piece toward mild sermonizing rather than fully trusting image and action. Subtext exists but is at times overshadowed by directly articulated insight.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of sacrifice, shared burden, and the moral calculus of safety emerge organically from specific images—stairs worn by evacuees, Silent-Choir’s self-erasure, the damaged bench still doing its job. The realization that “the grace was in not paying it alone” is supported by events rather than coming from nowhere, and the anthem’s line about standing where needed ties the whole piece together. However, the explicit thematic statement (“The cost of safety… The grace was…”) nudges toward summary and slightly blunts the otherwise strong subtextual resonance. Overall the aftereffect is moving and conceptually coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of historical truth versus revisionism, and of records as living forces that shape power, emerge organically from the premise and rune mechanics. The idea that lies collapse under the weight of their own impossibility when exposed to the right pressure is nicely dramatized rather than lectured. The ending’s image of marginal rune fragments ensuring truth’s eventual resurfacing offers a resonant, if tidy, conceptual answer. Some moral or emotional ambiguity around the cost of such absolute correction could deepen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme is coherent and well-integrated: the ocean as archivist of human harm, the persistence of routes, and intergenerational codes of knowledge all braid into a meditation on memory and accountability. Motifs—the atlas, tapping, ghost currents, bleached coral—return with reweighted meaning at the end. The narrative edges toward explicit thesis in lines like “The ocean remembered. It had always remembered,” which slightly undercuts subtext. Nonetheless, the final image of Mara listening and reporting carries genuine resonance beyond the literal plot.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic spine—rebellion failing because of inherited rigid thinking and a loss of genuine perception—is clear and organically tied to the opera glasses and stone text. The closing choice to start “something older and newer” offers a resonant, non-literal answer about re-rooting resistance in perception and vulnerability. However, theme is sometimes delivered in thesis-like statements (“They’d been striking at symptoms rather than the disease itself,” “They’d adopted the same rigid thinking as their oppressors”), which flattens subtext. A bit more trust in image and implication would elevate the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of evolving tradition, ecological reciprocity vs domination, and inherited/implanted destiny are coherently woven through the kite, embryo, and plant telepathy. The final image—Naja walking toward reconstruction camps with “spores golden in her blood and whispers green in her mind”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: integration over erasure. Subtext around trauma, reconstruction politics, and the ethics of using ancestral design is present but somewhat smoothed; the piece leans toward hopeful myth rather than ambivalent complexity. A touch more visible cost or doubt at the end would deepen the thematic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—transforming trauma into ongoing, luminous survival rather than cure—is woven through concrete motifs: the arboretum, lighthouse, pearl, photograph, and night-blooming cereus. The final image of “holding grief and hope simultaneously” crystallizes these threads and offers a resonant, non-binary answer to the implicit question of how to live after catastrophe. There is a slight tendency toward explicit statement (“The pearl of stillness was this: …”), edging into essayistic definition. Even so, the emotional aftereffect depends on images and choices more than on moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of fragmentation, art as confrontation vs comfort, and truth’s discomfort emerge organically from the portraits, rejected clients, and the library’s compressing geometry. The final realization—that wholeness is the illusion and that she will paint “spaces between” people—reweights everything before it in a satisfying way. However, some thematic content is overtly stated in rhetorical questions and declarative sentences (“fragmentation was the human condition”), which slightly blunts subtext. The piece still leaves a resonant, nuanced aftertaste, just shy of fully understated mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The thematic weave around crisis-time, attention, and the ethics of weaponizing vs liberating that knowledge is strong, especially in how the disappearing ink and ephemeral maps embody Vera’s intellectual project. Kael’s childhood trauma and present hyperclarity in the cave tie his personal arc to the abstract question without feeling tacked on. Some of Vera’s dialogue veers into thesis-statement territory (“to show people they already possess the ability...”), slightly flattening subtext. The final choice to savor the ink patterns before marching her out offers a resonant, non-literal answer—he accepts the research’s truth while refusing to absolve the crime.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematic concerns—what humanity owes truth when survival depends on curated forgetting—are well integrated with the world-building of frozen testimonials and contraband archives. The anonymous letter and dormant networks nicely embody the “unspoken conversation” resurfacing. However, the explicit question “What do we owe the truth when survival depends on forgetting?” edges into overt thesis-stating, reducing some of the subtlety the imagery earns. The ending offers a resonant but fairly straightforward answer (some truths are worth destabilization), with less lingering ambiguity than top-tier literary pieces often sustain.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—continuity vs. fear, cultivation vs. capture—is woven concretely through roses taught balance and orientation, the fallen tower, and Kael’s profession. Subtext in objects (ballast, compass, cuttings) does much of the heavy lifting, especially in Mira’s line, “I’m just hunting different things.” A couple of lines (“The tower fell because we forgot how to cultivate anything but fear,” “I’m weaving continuity through chaos. Someone has to.”) edge toward thesis articulation, diluting subtlety slightly. Nonetheless, the ending image reweights prior material effectively without resorting to overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coherently emerges around translation vs. original feeling, the power of silence, and pattern-breaking as a site of divine speech. The goddess’s echo, the transliterating garden, and Mara’s “line of silence” all mesh to embody the idea that mediated emotions can return to their source. The last paragraph edges toward explicit statement (“proof that even translated emotions could find their way back…”) which slightly flattens subtext. Even so, the emotional aftereffect is strong and the thematic throughline is well-earned by events rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of inherited responsibility, the ethics of truth-telling, and “silence as strategy” emerge organically from the interplay of astronomy, journalism, and family legacy. The orbit metaphor for regret and the final “spiral and ascending” image nicely reprice earlier cosmic language without feeling arbitrary. Some lines verge on aphoristic or thesis-like (“silence was loudest when it pretended to be surrender”; “hidden things only stay hidden if you stop looking up”), which slightly flattens subtext into statement. Still, the thematic through-line is clear, resonant, and well-integrated with character arc and setting.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—the ethics of listening, translation, and the impossibility of undoing past neglect—emerges organically through Vera’s specialization, the haunted firmware, and the accumulated sorrow in the code. The wasp/amber as a bridge between times that works “both ways” effectively reframes grief as something to tether to and learn from rather than erase. The final letter to her younger self and the line “The only way forward is to tether yourself to what you’ve lost…” edges toward explicit moralizing, slightly reducing the subtlety of an otherwise well-earned insight. Nonetheless the closing image of walking through a “world made whole” carries a resonant emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—memory loss, the persistence of meaning, and art as a framework rather than a cure—is organically embedded in images (flaking paint, the whispering gallery, the mandala/“meaning-wheel”). The final articulation (“not meaning itself, but the place where meaning lived”) is slightly on-the-nose but still feels earned by the preceding pattern of attempts and listening. Collective attention as an emergent, almost sacred force gives the piece lingering resonance beyond its literal events. The ambiguity of whether anything is actually preserved keeps the story from moral tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory versus erasure, state violence, and empathy as resistance emerge organically from Layla’s punishment and her act of naming the dead. The motif of renaming (seven conquerors vs. her “Memorial of Unbroken Names”) is especially effective, and the mechanical hands recast as tools of care gives the piece emotional bite. That said, some lines edge toward overt thesis—“This was her gentle radicalism: to weaponize empathy against those who had forged her into their tool”—which slightly flattens subtext into statement.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme is strong and organic: art as a means to persist beyond death and time, and performance as a bridge between loneliness and witness, emerge from concrete images rather than abstract claims. The fractured timeline, tarot coin, and multi-era audience all reweight the idea of an “encore” into a spiral of ongoing resonance rather than a single event. The final image of Margaux woven into the garden and visitors tasting ghostly music as starlight offers a clear, non-literal answer to the opening problem of abandonment and erasure. There’s a slight neatness to the resolution—very little thematic abrasion or moral cost—which keeps it from feeling radically complex.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around mind sovereignty vs enforced connection, and around art as a means to navigate and repair psychic architectures. The muscovite’s layered structure and the light trails evolve from pretty images into a resonant metaphor for distinct-yet-connected consciousness. The ending avoids explicit moralizing while clearly reweighting the premise toward hard-won, fragile hope.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of loneliness, witness, and interspecies/epochal communication are woven organically through the emotional topography, the fossil as transitional object, and the final claim that “loneliness could end when one learned to listen to stones.” A few lines tilt toward explicit thesis-stating, but the core resonance—that survival demands learning to converse with the non-human past—emerges from concrete images rather than pure commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of loss, connection, and the transforming power of context are woven elegantly through the motif of buttons and the echo, culminating in the insight that “Time moves differently when we know we’re not alone in it.” The idea of shared wisdom encoded in discarded objects is powerful and organically dramatized by visitors bringing their own items. However, several lines edge into explicit thesis statement (“The truth hadn’t unraveled after all—it had simply been waiting to be recognized”), which flattens subtext into commentary. The piece still leaves a resonant emotional aftereffect, but with a slightly didactic finish.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of damage, courage, and what it means to “fix what’s broken” are coherently developed through the winter/spring imagery, Marcus’ scars, and Sarah’s elaborate snow archive. The snow itself as a fragile, vanishing record is an elegant thematic device. Yet the story undercuts some of its own subtlety with explicit statements like “Fixing what's broken, he understood now, meant…” and the engraved line “You were never broken, only afraid,” which read as direct thesis delivery. This moralizing edge flattens what might otherwise linger more ambiguously and powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory, revision, class constraint, and the impossibility of a single “true” story accumulate beautifully via the journals, palimpsest practice, and the scraping needle. The coachman’s line about the needle being for “making space, not for choosing what’s real” is thematically potent and organically grounded in the object. However, the subsequent explanation (“All of it is true… one story could never hold a whole life”) borders on stating the thesis a bit too directly. The resonance is still strong, especially with the final image of her walking away carrying the unchanged journals and needle.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic throughlines—kindness as an enduring, accumulative force; creation as an act of vulnerability—are coherent and well-linked to bees, clay, and temporal anchoring. The lantern and oasis elegantly embody the idea that gentle acts can align timelines and resist entropy. However, the theme is at times over-explicitly stated (“Kindness,” she whispered; “Burns because it forgot this”), tipping into moralizing rather than trusting subtext. That directness blunts complexity and keeps the piece from a more lingering, ambiguous resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of inheritance, access, and how protection can coexist with vulnerability emerge organically from the locksmith/rosebush/mirror braid. The locksmith gauge as a metaphor for “measuring depths” versus her measuring of light is both concrete and resonant. The main drag is occasional explicit thematic articulation (“protection didn't mean isolation—that vulnerability could exist within care”), which flattens subtext that’s already clear in the images.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of extinction, memory, multiplicity, and coexistence are woven tightly through concrete particulars: the extinct-species memories, the zoo recall, the reflective walls, and the sundial’s reinterpreted function. The final realization that she is “the first of something new” resonates with these threads and offers a non-literal answer about how to live with layered selves. However, the on-page thesis via the magical book (“You are not broken. You are a bridge.”) edges into explicit statement, lessening subtextual power. The piece remains thematically coherent and affecting but occasionally tells what its images already show.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of secrecy, connection, and pattern emerge organically from Margot’s work, the thrush’s nest, and the spiral of objects without overt moralizing. The installation reframes secrets from burdens into threads of a shared tapestry; Margot’s act of adding her own letter embodies that reframing rather than stating it. A few phrases (“the pattern continued, inevitably whimsical, infinitely profound”) brush close to explicit thematic naming, slightly softening the subtlety. Nonetheless, the final image of the thrush flying to build again offers a resonant, non-literal answer about continuity and renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of chaos vs. pattern, negotiation with incomprehensible powers, and reframing conflict as “a different game” emerge organically from Mara’s work and the entities’ behavior. The final image of the charts reconfiguring into a spiral pulling away, plus the warmer “laughter,” reweights the premise toward coexistence-through-ingenuity rather than victory. There’s welcome resistance to a neat moral—these beings still treat reality as entertainment, and she’s only bought time. That said, the piece stops short of a deeper, more surprising human cost or moral compromise that might linger longer.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of who “owns” a city, how movement can be controlled or reclaimed, and the persistence of buried resistance are woven concretely through the map, tunnels, and organ rather than via plot summary alone. The final realization—that beneath imposed borders, the old ways persist—nicely reweights earlier details like the banned free movement and the spatial mutiny’s apparent failure. Yet the prose sometimes overstates its thesis (“proof that the city belonged to those who moved through it, not those who drew lines across it”; “The city would learn to move again”), shading toward essayistic moralizing. The thematic work is strong but could trust its images a bit more.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of recognition, empathy, and the limits of visual identity are integrated tightly with Elena’s condition and the case, and the ribbon/quarry imagery supports this. However, the final paragraph over-explains the thesis (“she'd learned the deepest truth: we recognize each other not by features...”), tipping into explicit moralizing rather than letting the images and events speak. The resonance is real but somewhat didactic. A lighter touch on the closing statement would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of exile, legacy, and alternative escape routes from climate catastrophe emerge organically from particulars: the coffin nail, “wound-doors,” and the re-framing of grave traditions as constraints on wandering. The story invites reflection on chosen vs imposed exile and the ethics of stepping outside a ruined world without sermonizing, though some phrasing brushes the edge of thesis (“escape routes for a drowning world”). The final movement—choosing to follow the ancestor into the unknown—reweights prior images nicely. A slightly less explicit articulation of the premise might deepen subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of transition, permission to change states, and art as a bridge between “low resolution” and fuller being are well integrated with the plot and imagery. The recurring notions of bridges, resolution, and amnesty converge effectively in the final crossings and her decision to carry that “luminous disbelief” forward. However, some thematic material is stated quite directly via the hitchhiker’s philosophy and Mara’s articulated motivation, which edges toward thesis-like clarity. The piece still leaves a resonant conceptual aftertaste, just shy of the most nuanced subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of inheritance, territory, and whether “some paths circle back” are woven through concrete motifs: foreign currencies as territorial markers, the startup as a “new country,” the forest as a protected domain. The final image—a map made from the father’s bills that now points to where paths might yet go—nicely reweights earlier details. However, some thematic statements are a bit on-the-nose (“I’m trying to show you that some circles can be broken,” “The choice is still happening”), edging toward explicit moralizing rather than fully trusting subtext. Even so, the piece leaves space for ambiguity about whether this break in the cycle will hold.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of shared burden, collective healing, and the universe as a model for interdependence are richly embedded in the star imagery and the temple’s encoding method. The priests’ choice to make the language only decodable by multiple minds is an excellent concrete dramatization of “isolation breaks what community mends.” That said, the final paragraph edges into authorial statement (“how isolation breaks what community mends, how the universe itself demonstrates...”), undercutting some of the subtext’s power. The emotional aftereffect is genuine and earned, but slightly over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of reflection, self-deception, and the danger of trying to consume others’ lies while ignoring your own are well-seeded in the mirror trick, the soul-twist, and the seeds that “fed on reflection itself.” The apprentice’s explanation and Maren’s finishing of his thought tie motivation and moral together coherently. However, lines like “Your own false reflection” and the closing “people are not lost—they simply refuse to unbend…” articulate the thesis quite directly, edging into moral summary. The story would gain resonance if those insights were left a bit more in image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of trauma as connective tissue, complementary limitation, and renegotiating one’s relationship with time emerge organically from scars, the broken covenant, and the ritual rather than from essayistic commentary. The topiary’s dissolution into soil, then into a joint dream, gives a concrete emblem of relinquishing rigid control in favor of generative uncertainty. The idea of writing a “new agreement” with the eclipsed covenant crisply reframes prophecy as a collaborative, present-facing ethic. A few lines (“The intersection wasn't a place but a state of being”) lean toward explicit thesis, slightly reducing subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of wholeness, the inseparability of joy and sorrow, and the dangers of treating destiny as a tradable commodity emerge organically from images (trees growing from bones, merged lovers’ faces) and choices. The orchard’s logic—that nothing grows without death—quietly underpins the moral calculus. The line “real, whole pain is better than borrowed joy any day” edges toward explicit thesis, slightly reducing the subtextual power the images already carry. Overall, the story invites reflection on mental health shortcuts without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of purpose “after the applause,” the limits of facts without felt instinct, and the search for meaning after public failure emerge naturally from his lived particulars and the recurring concert imagery. The final contrast—“Not applause, not anymore. Something quieter.”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about sustainable purpose. However, a few lines (“I need to wrest some meaning from this”; “I’m done being confidently uncertain”) edge toward explicit thesis statements rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. The piece still leaves a satisfying, reflective aftertaste with room for multiple readings.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of transition, continuity of consciousness, and the teacher–student legacy are well integrated via cuneiform, seeds, magnetic suspension, and grief. The analogy between physical state-changes and metaphysical transformation is elegant and seeded throughout. However, the thematic articulation becomes too explicit in lines like “The physics of transition were simple after all: nothing was ever lost, only changed into forms that required new kinds of perception,” edging into thesis-statement didacticism. The resonance is real but somewhat over-explained, blunting ambiguity and afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of wonder vs. routine, identity without futurity, and the beauty of unrealized plans are woven organically through objects (identity cards, fish mobile, lighthouse plans) rather than explicit moralizing. The line “Tomorrow may be gone, but wonder needs only the unknown, not the future” flirts with thesis-statement territory but is grounded enough in the concrete system that it doesn’t read as sermonizing. The final image of the woman keeping the scroll “like a fisherman keeping one special catch” and Maris’s temporally adjusted reply offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise. A touch more ambiguity or visible cost—some hint of what wonder cannot restore—could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of isolation vs connection, survival vs living, and the preservation of beauty are strongly integrated with concrete objects (paintbrush, sheet music, photos). The final reorientation of Marcus’s job toward returning hopes to the world provides a resonant, concept-driven answer. However, several lines (“hope doesn’t survive in vaults,” “dissolve the walls between hearts”) tip into explicit thesis-stating, dulling subtext and complexity. The emotional aftereffect is real but slightly sermonized rather than fully emerging from implication.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of forgiveness, judgment vs observation, and the non-linearity of healing are well integrated through water metaphors, sediment/contamination analogies, and the graffiti dialogue. The river as both subject and mirror is an elegant vehicle for exploring self-forgiveness. However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements—“What if forgiveness isn’t a destination but a current you learn to swim in?” and “truth, like water, doesn’t judge its own course”—which edge into moralizing rather than letting image and action carry the insight. The resonance is strong but a bit over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—how unspoken words and loneliness drive devastating choices—is woven through the library’s concept, the cipher, and the grandmother’s history, culminating in the reframing of the watch and the quest. The story earns its insights via specifics (the estate sacrificed for the “fantasy of connection”) rather than platitudes, and the final thought about helping others find their own “unspoken words” lands as a resonant extension. However, the thematic articulation edges into explicit explanation (“The watch wasn't just evidence... it was a key to knowing why humans make devastating choices”), slightly undercutting subtextual power. More reliance on image and implication at the very end would elevate the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of truth, memory, imperial theft, and resistance through propagation are well integrated with the concrete images of seeds, spores, and perforated ice. The plants’ voices and the notion of “perforated destiny” give a textured exploration of how partial truths can still undermine power. The ending’s emphasis on propagation in dark places reweights earlier details without descending into didactic moralizing, though “the truth would propagate” edges close to being stated thesis. Overall the thematic web is coherent, resonant, and grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of beauty at the edge of death, thresholds (temperature, altitude, life/death), and transient radiance are woven coherently through images of ice, aurora, and the “unfinished” girl. The notion that endings can “hold light” and that Lyra reads meaning in cosmic “static” gives the piece conceptual depth without devolving into overt moralizing. The “Science would call this superstition” line flirts with on-the-nose commentary but stays brief enough not to derail the scene. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—transcendence as a momentary configuration of light and care—without spelling out a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of rebirth, forgiveness, and contentment as practice rather than discovery emerge organically from Keiko’s history and the grotto visits. The phoenix hairpin, clouds, fishermen, and tree-climbing form a small network of motifs that are meaningfully reweighted by the end. However, several key insights are articulated directly in dialogue (“Contentment… isn’t found. It’s practiced…”) which edges into didactic clarity rather than trusting implication. The resonance is genuine and moving, but slightly less spelled-out language would deepen the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of moral nuance, responsibility, and the limits of certainty are tightly woven through Vincent’s story, the shard, and the chimes. The final images (cloak of doubt worn differently, lighthouse beam turning off) resonate with her reconfigured understanding. However, the theme occasionally tips into explicit thesis statements—“Start offering questions instead of answers” and “become a conscience for hire who admits she’s still learning” feel slightly didactic for a top-tier literary venue. The underlying insight is strong; a bit more reliance on image and implication over articulation would lift it.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of delayed revelation, appearing-before-vanishing, and knowledge outliving the knower are elegantly woven through pond imagery, reversed time, and teaching choices. The final lines (“so the knowledge lives forward even as I live back”) effectively reweight everything that precedes them into a poignant conceptual cost. However, the story occasionally states its thesis too directly (“delayed revelation isn't withholding—it's cultivation”), tipping from resonance toward essayistic explanation. Despite that didactic edge, the thematic fabric is coherent and affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coherently circles memory, time, and reverent stewardship—stones as memory-bearers, navigation as communion with history, tradition as endurance. The interplay of echoes, sediment, birds, and bone towers creates a strong metaphorical field that supports the idea of traveling through time without moving. The final repricing of time—centuries as just another pattern to read—lands pleasantly, though it edges toward overt statement ("The stones remembered everything") rather than letting image alone carry the insight. The piece offers reflection more than moralizing, but its thematic moves are relatively straightforward.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of presence vs efficiency, sacredness in the ordinary, and human meaning vs algorithmic perfection are coherent and integrated with specific images (the salvaged limestone, the slow climb, the mist from carved flowers). However, several lines state the thesis very directly—“The sacred hides in failed attempts,” “magic wasn’t about power. It was about presence,” “meaning emerged from connection, not efficiency”—which edges into essayistic moralizing. The final realization still resonates, but the piece sometimes explains what its images already show. Greater reliance on subtext and image would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Light-as-language, the color of sound, and rituals of mourning all braid into a coherent thematic inquiry about translation between senses, between living and dead, and between work and meaning. The key tag, bioluminescent bottles, lanterns, and pier lamps recur and are reweighted rather than merely repeated, especially when her lamplighting becomes “not illumination but translation.” The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial question—sound becomes visible in a symphony of light—without sliding into overt moralizing. It’s thematically rich and integrated, though the emotional cost of this insight could be felt more sharply for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of fate vs randomness, meaning at the end of time, and consciousness aligning with a “purposeful” universe emerge naturally from the coin ritual, the collapsing cosmos, and Mira’s reinterpretation of prophecy as reception rather than prediction. The use of extinct civilizations’ currencies as tokens of value and instruction gives the theme of continuity-through-ending real texture. Some thematic statements are a bit on-the-nose (“The cast lots method wasn't about prediction—it was about reception”), but they don’t collapse into moralizing. The final transformation image effectively reweights everything that came before as a rehearsal for seeding the next universe.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of sacrifice, mortality vs. immortality, and the need to name one’s own fear are organically woven through the sea-monster motif and the parallel reapers. The conceptual move from “cowardice/fear” to “sacrifice/love” is earned by concrete particulars (Daniel’s offer, the predecessor’s long vigil). However, the text edges toward direct statement (“But if she named it—if she called it *sacrifice* instead of *cowardice*…”) which flirts with moralizing rather than fully trusting subtext. The resonance is real and lingering, just slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: balance and reciprocity with the sea, the moral weight of accumulated “debt,” and the quiet power of sustained, imperfect devotion. The bell, dripping pattern, and notion of an oversaturated ocean concretely embody abstract ideas about taking vs. giving back. The ending offers a resonant answer—one lukewarm mage can matter, but only partially and over time—without collapsing into a neat moral, though the line “A plausible impossibility…” edges toward thesis-stating. Overall, it invites reflection beyond the scene while staying grounded in image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—about submerged histories, the need for witnesses, and the rootedness of meaning—is strong and well-supported by recurring images (reservoir, photographs, the distillery label, the wind chime). The final realization that “beneath every surface, meaning waits” conceptually reprices his prior vigilance in an earned way. However, some thematic statements are quite explicit (“stories without witnesses become lies,” “meaning doesn’t transplant”), edging toward didactic rather than fully subtextual resonance. The story still leaves an emotional aftertaste, but a touch more restraint in articulating the thesis would increase its literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    The thematic throughline—science and sentiment, logic and wonder as harmonized rather than opposed—is strongly embodied in concrete motifs: the embroidered handkerchief, the starlings’ patterns, the frozen dew crystal, and the Opus itself. The final image of starlings “writing wisdom across the sky” nicely reweights earlier material and extends the theme beyond the lab. That said, the thesis is occasionally stated a bit too baldly (“science and sentiment were never opposites”), edging toward explicit moralizing instead of trusting subtext. The work still leaves a clear, resonant aftertaste despite that slight on-the-nose articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around “the watcher’s burden,” institutional doubt, and memory (of trees, of bodies, of prior failures). The parachute buckle and the repeated emphasis on muscle memory and the trees’ own remembering give the piece a nice pattern of images that reweight the ending. Some thematic elements are stated a bit on the nose (“The watcher's burden,” “She would not become him”), nudging toward sermonizing rather than leaving it fully in subtext. Even so, the final image of her quiet, steadfast attention underlines the theme without an explicit moral.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—wholeness through fragmentation and balance of opposites—emerges organically from the clone premise, the brain in the jar, and the custody choice. The final image of “Two mothers, one child, a brain in a jar labeled with honest uncertainty” resonates and reweights the story’s questions about identity and parenthood. Some thematic lines edge close to essay (“Courts want simplicity. Judges want narratives that fit precedent.”), slightly flattening subtext into explicit statement. Nonetheless, the piece avoids simple moralizing and leaves productive ambiguity around what “whole” really means.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—about protecting spaces of innovation and recognizing that some “puzzles” are traps—is coherent and organically linked to Margot’s profession and choice. However, several sentences in the final third (“She would help them understand that some mysteries weren’t meant to be solved…”) verge on stated moral rather than purely emergent resonance. The corpse flower as a metaphor for corrosive obsession is strong but a bit under-exploited subtextually. Overall the piece invites reflection on curiosity and sabotage but leans slightly didactic at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of grief, memory, and the work of “filling” absence emerge organically from the ritual and the echoing space. Lily’s “singing caves” and the braid of machinery, wind, and lullaby build a strong subtext about how the living negotiate with the dead. The final paragraph reweights the story with a clear conceptual frame (“after the final grain slips through the hourglass…you fill what remains”), which is resonant but edges toward explicit statement. A slightly lighter hand on that closing generalization would increase the lingering, non-didactic power.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Questions of selfhood, captivity, and learning “to make friends with uncertainty” emerge organically from Maris’s situation and the dream mechanics. The thematic thread of interiorizing exteriors/self vs. environment runs through the statues, mist, collar, and final morning image without devolving into moralizing. The ending quietly reweights the premise: she has reclaimed coherence but remains collared, choosing continued ambiguous guardianship. A touch more ambiguity or cost in her smile or anticipation of night might deepen the lingering unease.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of creative destruction, transformation through failure, and the evolution of authority are coherent and tightly woven to the crozier and Cassia’s arc. However, they are often stated rather than left to emerge (“creative destruction,” “hopelessness was just another ingredient…”) which tips into didactic clarity instead of resonant ambiguity. The final image does reweight earlier material—her failures become preparation—but the moral is almost spelled out. Subtext around the Church’s authority and her father’s fear could bear more implication and less explicit framing.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme—that endings contain beginnings and silence is generative rather than empty—threads coherently through mentor lore, Mira’s vocation, the shard of hush, and the final re-seeing of city and gorge. The “origin codes” and “phoenix song” imagery deepen this, giving concrete metaphors to a metaphysical argument. However, the closing paragraphs lean into explicit thesis statements (“silence wasn’t absence. / It was the canvas on which everything began.”), edging toward didactic rather than purely emergent resonance. The thematic arc is strong but just a bit over-articulated for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of liminality, belonging versus transience, and the tension between “what is and what might be” are woven neatly through the ferry’s paradoxical existence and the hourglass’s function. The final reweighting—“permanently transient no longer”—offers a conceptual repricing of the premise and modest resonance with the idea of committing to a single pattern. However, the piece stops short of exploring deeper emotional or ethical implications (who loses what, or what histories are erased, by merging timelines). The thematic aftertaste is pleasing but relatively tidy and low-complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic throughline about connection as continual reweaving is coherent and organically tied to the act of weaving and to Marina’s profession. However, several lines state the thesis quite directly (“Connection wasn’t a fixed thing—it was this…”, “love and understanding require constant reconstruction”), edging into essayistic explanation rather than letting the images carry the weight. The result is resonant but somewhat over-articulated, blunting ambiguity and complexity that could linger more.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of perception, boundaries between realities, and what navigation truly means emerge organically from the chain link, the aliens’ “water-memories,” and the notion of edge geometry. The repeated “horizons had unfolded” motif effectively reweights itself by the end, and the final shared tracing of constellations embodies a nuanced hope of interspecies understanding without moralizing it. At times the alien exposition edges toward essayistic (“The boundary between what-it-was and what-it-could-become creates a space for navigation”), which slightly dulls the subtextual feel. Still, the story invites reflection beyond its literal events in a controlled, resonant way.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of persistence of love, protection of vulnerable voices, and the idea of “incidental heroism” are woven through objects (corroded hearing aid, static pulses) and actions rather than blunt moralizing. The closing image of a grandmother’s love crackling through circuits and refusing to let go reweights the preceding tech and ghostly elements with emotional and social stakes. There is some near-explicit statement (“That was the thing about hearts: even traced through static and decades, they never stopped trying to save each other”), but it reads more as lyric summation than didactic lesson. Complexity is modest—abuse dynamics aren’t deeply problematized—but the piece still invites reflection about how care can outlast death and be mediated through devices.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of invisible labor, institutional erasure, and guardianship of connection are elegantly embodied in the information ghosts and Kove’s fate. The codex’s historical margin notes and the entities’ custodial role create a strong metaphor for uncredited infrastructure and forgotten contributors. The line “The unremembered would have their monument—not in bronze or stone, but in understanding…” tips toward overt statement, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, the thematic architecture is coherent and resonant, if a bit directly articulated at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—reinterpretation of failure, the difference between guilt and chosen sacrifice, and finding “wisdom from failure” rather than forgiveness—emerges organically from the specifics of Chen’s research and Mira’s arc. Recurring images (static clearing, snow silence, the shard, ink spreading, unique snowflakes) all feed the idea of pattern emerging from apparent chaos. Some lines veer close to explicit moralizing (“Some things don’t need repair, she thought. They need reinterpretation.”), which slightly blunts subtlety. Nonetheless, the final image reweights what came before in a resonant, non-mechanical way.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of translation, the transformation of loss, and the survival of meaning beyond medium are woven tightly through diamond, bone, birds, and echoes. The story avoids sermonizing; instead, the final image—that “anyone who came to listen would hear not words, but the sensation of meaning itself”—reweights what language is without stating a moral. The piece elegantly complicates “curse vs blessing” and “death vs change,” suggesting that preservation demands letting go of purity. A touch more ambiguity about what is lost in transmuting tactile nuance into sound could have deepened the complexity even further.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of transformation, grief, and the seduction of the incomprehensible emerge organically from particulars: metamorphosis as healing, research as revenge, and the forest as something that “hunts a better version of us.” The reweighting of her decade of bitterness into “the cosmic joke it had always deserved to be” is a strong thematic pivot tied to character. The ending’s ambiguity—beauty versus danger, choice versus surrender—avoids sermonizing while clearly reframing the premise. A few lines flirt with explicit thesis (“You think you’re hunting a creature…”) but they’re anchored in character voice enough to avoid feeling like authorial moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of transformation, fear-bound stasis, and the tension between efficiency and wonder are richly embedded in images like the locust shell, living statues, and golden tears nourishing roots. The world’s mechanization vs. magic conflict is dramatized rather than merely asserted, and the ending reweights the premise by framing freedom as “a continuous becoming.” That closing insight is a bit on-the-nose and approaches moralizing, which slightly flattens the otherwise suggestive, image-driven resonance. Overall, the thematic fabric is strong but could trust subtext a little more.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of borders, absence-as-resistance, and connection under surveillance are organically embedded in the premise and motifs (null-fields, abandoned spaces, storms in bottles). The closing conceptual move—that “even trapped things remain powerful” and that emptiness can be repurposed—is resonant and earned by prior images. However, the text leans toward explicit statement (“That’s what they all were—trapped and trying to remain powerful,” “a refusal to accept that borders should split families”) where a slightly lighter touch or more dramatized conflict could have carried the same insight with more subtlety. The piece stops just short of over-moralizing, but it does “explain” its own thesis a bit more than elite venues usually tolerate.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—silence as possibility, ruin as material for new meaning—is coherent and rooted in images (ruined circus, halo fragment, wind-driven sculpture). However, the last paragraph leans into explicit thesis (“they would understand… that silence wasn't empty, that brokenness could sing”), edging toward moralizing rather than letting the images do all the work. The resonance is still genuine but slightly over-explained. Combined with relatively soft pressure, this keeps the thematic effect strong but not transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—stories as objects with gravity, analog memory as curved space where past and present coexist, science and poetry sharing a geometry—is strong and organically seeded. The grandmother’s equation-love-letters and the analog vs. digital contrast concretize ideas instead of leaving them abstract. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“Stories weren't abstract. They had mass, gravity, presence.”), slightly flattening subtext that’s already clear in the images. The ending reweights earlier material nicely but lands as a quiet affirmation rather than a complex, double-edged revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of liminality, the cost of pursuing dreams, and reading the “between-places” of reality are well woven through motifs of light, fog, and encoded longing. The notion that the Dream Walker is a state of being rather than a person effectively reweights prior events and supports a conceptual repricing at the end. Some lines (“The Dream Walker… wasn’t a person but a state of being”) verge on thesis statement, tipping from subtext into direct explanation. Even so, the final image of her stepping into light while “caught between exposure and development” delivers genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of fear as a lock, truth as dangerous but necessary, and a city made of collective choices and secrets interweave coherently with the plot. The motif of doors and stars supports a resonant idea of hidden architectures of mind and society. That said, some thematic content is stated rather baldly (“The city is alive… every locked door a fear we collectively decided to keep closed”), tipping toward thesis more than emergence from action. The ending offers a clear, if somewhat tidy, answer: Mara will help others open what fear has sealed.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of preservation vs transformation, communal memory vs hoarding, and the limits of immortality are woven through concrete particulars (jam, cider, folk songs, fungal networks) rather than abstract sermonizing. The line “Memory isn't meant to be canned like jam” risks being a bit on-the-nose, but it’s character-voiced and foreshadows Vera’s later acceptance that memory must be “consumed, digested, transformed.” The ending reweights everything through the idea of “Not preserved. Living.” without reducing it to a simple moral. There is room for even more moral ambiguity (e.g., what is irrevocably lost or harmed by her intervention), but the resonance is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of exile, resilience, and “brokenness as architecture” emerge organically from objects (shard, tea leaves) and dialogue, with some genuinely fresh formulations. The idea of “reversible exile” and exiled fear projected onto a child has conceptual bite. Yet the prose often slides into explicit thesis statements—especially in the last sentence’s triplet—that read more like articulated morals than implications earned solely through scene. This softens the lingering ambiguity and undercuts some of the piece’s otherwise strong resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thematic throughline—preserving the capacity for wonder, connecting waking and dream worlds, the sacred labor of tending imagination—is coherent and arises naturally from the plot and imagery. The closing image of planting a tree whose fruit restores “the color of wonder” is resonant and tidy without being cloying. Some lines lean toward explicit explication (“not just a color, but everything it represented”) and gently flatten ambiguity, edging close to sermonizing. The piece invites reflection but ultimately offers a fairly clean, untroubled moral about stewardship of joy.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of secrecy, shared culpability, and the moral weight of silence are woven through the net imagery, the idea of “interlaced hush,” and the sanctuary refracting names into starlight. The notion that exhuming truth, not banishing spirits, brings rest is nicely dramatized rather than preached, though occasional definitional sentences (“To exhume meant…”) edge toward explanatory. The ending’s conceptual move—secrets migrating from one tormented keeper to a communal, luminous archive—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Complexity is present but fairly gentle; there’s limited interrogation of the ethics of exposing the dead or the living tied to those names.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres strongly around silence as language, maps as living boundaries between known and unknown, and the ethics of interpretation (fear vs empathy). The fresco’s self-updating and the question-mark cracks work as specific, resonant images rather than generic symbols. Some lines verge on thesis statement (“Silence wasn’t absence; it was a language...”, “Some silences…weren’t meant to be preserved”), edging toward explicit moralizing. Even so, the final movement from sealing to opening—the choice to answer a question rather than lock it away—offers a satisfying, non-literal thematic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs (planes, snow globes, transmissions, balanced waters) build a coherent meditation on loss, mystery, and the impossibility of full closure. The ending’s notion that remaining suspended “between finding and losing” is its own answer reweights the story effectively. That said, a few lines step close to essayistic thesis (“The physics of letting go… wasn’t about understanding at all”), slightly undercutting subtext in favor of direct statement. Trimming or trusting the images more would lift the thematic resonance further.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of voicelessness, mediation, and art as a conduit between human and non-human minds are woven organically through the graffiti language, the ghost in code, and the collected unspoken needs. The final exchange—ghost thanking her via “electricity and light” as she sings a new ballad—offers a resonant, if gentle, answer about connection and mutual recognition. Yet the treatment is emotionally tidy; loneliness is named and soothed without serious complication or moral friction. Strongly coherent, but not yet probing or risky enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece has a coherent thematic core around transforming grief through genuine, attentive service and seeking “joy beneath anguish.” The goggles and diary embodiment of the captain’s philosophy provide a solid vehicle for this, and Maren’s choice aligns thematically with her arc. However, much of the theme is delivered directly via summarized diary content and explicit statements in the final paragraphs, edging toward sermonizing rather than subtext. The ending in particular tells the meaning (“until the whole spire remembered…”) instead of letting image and implication fully carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—absence as presence, atmospheres as memory, and the emotional life of scientific phenomena—emerges organically from particular images (virga, cirrostratus at her grandfather’s death, the broken tether) and Elena’s vocation. The final realization that “empty wasn’t empty” reweights earlier details and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question. A bit of explicit gloss (“To memorialize meant to acknowledge…”) edges toward thesis statement, slightly reducing the subtlety but not breaking the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of the limits of knowledge, the difference between pattern and person, and the way constraints define identity are woven consistently through coin, library, and her condition. The parallel between empty secret safes and an ungraspable human presence is elegant. Some thematic statements lean toward explicitness (“some knowledge couldn’t be stored or transferred,” “Some limits…define us more truly than our gifts”), edging close to spelling out the moral rather than trusting implication. Nonetheless, the final image and her stance carry genuine resonance beyond the literal plot.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of mapping vs. censorship, pattern-seeing as both wonder and risk, and the beauty of transient, unrecordable patterns are woven through birds, hopscotch, and phrasebook without heavy-handed moralizing. The contrast between official Guild maps and Mara’s covert “map” suggests institutional control and quiet resistance, with Celeste’s stance crystallizing into subversive curiosity. The starlings’ dissolution and reformation elegantly echo the idea that meaningful patterns must sometimes evade capture. The phrase “here be something wonderful” edges toward overt statement but is grounded enough in the cartographic frame to avoid sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of repair, imperfection, and beauty in decay run consistently through driftwood imagery, the frozen, fading library, and the slightly syncopated revived mechanism. The closing reflection—“Perhaps perfection wasn’t the point”—is a touch explicit but grounded enough in on-page experience to avoid feeling like a bolt-on moral. The final image of oceans catching light “like gear teeth” neatly fuses cosmic mechanism, earthly time, and her vocation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer about ongoing maintenance and care. Complexity is modest but coherent, with room for reflective aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core theme—that survival and true “respite” depend on interdependence rather than hoarding or isolation—emerges organically from the chalk exchanges and communal recovery. The butterfly bell and arches help echo the idea of calling and holding a community together, and the final image of shared dawn is emotionally apt. That said, Mara’s explanation to Kessa (“Because I’ve seen what happens when people forget they need each other…”) edges into explicit thesis-stating, reducing subtlety. The piece lands with honest, gentle hope, but the thematic argument is more declared than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of responsibility, limited agency in the face of systemic catastrophe, and the value of imperfect, “beautifully flawed” attempts to matter are carried consistently through motifs like the puppet head, the lullaby, and nested patterns. The final image of her walking into the dark, having “sang our song,” offers a resonant, non-literal answer: meaning lies in tending to possibility, not in guaranteed salvation. Some thematic content is stated a bit directly (“To whisper a lullaby… to vouchsafe the possibility of dawn”), nudging toward exposition rather than being entirely scene-earned. Even so, the subtext of brokenness-as-witness and quiet, costly caretaking lands with real emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of inherited duty, making beauty from curse, and re-seeing burden as gift arise organically from Maren’s changing relationship with the orchard and her uncle’s legacy. The orchard/blueprint motif is a strong thematic vehicle, culminating in the closing idea of completing her own “forgotten blueprint.” Some lines edge toward explicit statement (“not a burden, but a gift”), trimming a bit of ambiguity. Still, the piece invites reflection on labor, care, and quiet salvation without collapsing into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The separation/connection theme is organically embedded in the braided channels, foam, polymers, and Leah’s artistic practice, and the ending reweights these images in a satisfying way. However, several lines articulate the thematic thesis too explicitly (“not an ending but a doorway,” “separation and connection weren't opposites but movements in the same symphony”), edging toward mild moralizing. The piece still invites reflection about how people metabolize loss, but a bit more trust in image over explanation would increase subtlety. The emotional aftereffect is genuine and tender rather than manipulative.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of beginnings, erasure through subtraction, and the ethics of “clean slates” are woven through concrete images like bottled moonlight and the you-shaped hole in the world. However, the narrative occasionally drifts toward explicit thesis-stating (“To sell clean slates, one had to understand how stories could be mindfully scattered”), which blunts subtext. The ending image—rebalancing around “this new configuration of hope and history”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer but with limited ambiguity or friction. Overall, strong but somewhat over-articulated for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of how communities manage unbearable grief—storing, smoothing, bearing, and risking contagion—are woven through concrete images (bread, walls, coral ice) rather than abstract commentary. The idea that some gifts exist to metabolize collective pain, and that personally owned tears at the end are “bearable,” offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the initial situation. A few lines lean close to expository thesis (“Some memories are too sharp to bear”), slightly reducing subtlety. Still, the emotional aftereffect is strong and coherent, with the pavilion’s transformation reweighting earlier motifs of rain, salt, and touch.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of bridging isolation into harmony through risked connection is organically embedded in the silos, choral work, and multilingual compositions. The cuckoo weight and astronomical clock nicely support a thematic contrast between rigid precision and living, communal time. The closing paragraphs do veer toward explicit thesis (“Her role… had never been about preserving the past. It was about conducting the future”), which blunts some subtextual power. Still, the final image of the community singing against the regulated grain hum has genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of lost/abandoned ambition, colonization, militarization of science, and the persistence of memory are well braided through concrete particulars (Robert, Sarah, the silenced geologist, the canyon’s history). The final image of silver threads as pathways back to “abandoned purpose” effectively reweights earlier material and invites reflection on what society discards. However, the story leans into overt thesis statements—“aspirations that circumstances had murdered,” “proving that nothing was ever truly lost”—that edge toward essayistic clarity rather than letting image and implication do the work. This slightly blunts the subtlety of otherwise strong thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of marginal spaces as repositories of truth, vigilance in preserving hidden knowledge, and intergenerational transmission through “insignificant” marks are coherent and woven through recurring images (spirals, seeds, blaze, margins). The final image of her planting new “seeds” in future margins offers a satisfying conceptual repricing of archivists’ work. Some phrases (“she was meant to harvest this garden of secrets,” “seeds of vigilance had germinated at last”) verge on spelling the thesis rather than letting subtext fully carry it. The complexity is solid but could push further into ambiguity or cost to reach the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematic threads—beauty through damage, listening to the world, empathy as an attunement to stress—are tightly woven through objects (cracks, telegraph lines, birds) and actions rather than tacked on. The realization that “the world hadn’t gone silent; humans had simply forgotten how to listen” is vivid but somewhat thesis-like, edging toward authorial statement. The ending image of silent birds drawn to music born from stress is a strong, non-literal answer to the initial loss-of-song premise and lingers conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of consent, unspoken suffering, and the tension between strategic perfection and “difficult beauty” emerges organically from the action of listening to silences. The ending’s insight—that the covenant’s true flaw lies in the suppressed costs people bore—is resonant and reweights the entire situation. Some lines (“There can be no true consent…”) edge toward explicit thesis and flirt with didacticism rather than trusting subtext. Still, the worry stone, chess, and silence motifs integrate well to leave a lingering, complex emotional aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of empathy, listening, and the violence of refusal to hear are powerfully woven through the silence-as-frequency conceit and Marlow’s eventual realization that “recovery” means regaining her capacity to witness. The final page line—“You just didn’t know my frequency”—nicely reweights everything that came before. That said, several sentences state the theme rather baldly (“The path to empathy, she had learned, was not straight,” “Recovery meant something different”), edging toward sermonizing and slightly dulling subtext. The piece still lands a genuine emotional aftereffect, but with less ambiguity than an elite venue typically prefers.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of endurance, the cost of wisdom, and finding grace within discomfort arise organically from the corpse flower’s properties and Mira’s experience with it. The undercurrent-of-wisdom motif, journaling habit, and treetop instability are well-aligned with the idea of serenity within motion. That said, the story undercuts its subtlety by sliding into explicit thesis statements at the end (“Wisdom asks us to endure what we cannot control”), which reads more like moralizing than emergent insight. A quieter, more image-driven closing would better honor the strong thematic groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematically, the story does meaningful work with resilience as temporal multiplicity rather than brute endurance, integrating the “gathering of echoes,” temporal seeds, and the orchards’ survival into a cohesive idea. The final conceptual repricing—drawing strength from every version of oneself—is strongly aligned with the worldbuilding. However, the explicit line “resilience wasn’t about resistance, but about…” slips into on-the-nose thesis-stating, undercutting some of the subtlety earned by the imagery. More could be left in image and implication to reach a higher literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of systems revealing their “hidden architecture,” inherited vocation, and the shift from post-mortem analysis to anticipatory design are well woven through specific images (the spiral, the patch, the algorithms). The father thread grounds the conceptual material and the final understanding that foresight is an ethical discipline, not just data. Some lines verge on thesis statement (“accidents weren’t random—they were systems revealing their hidden architecture”), edging toward didactic rather than fully embedded subtext. Still, the ending reweights earlier details in a satisfying, resonant way rather than offering a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme—that beauty and wonder perform real, life-sustaining work—is woven tightly through bells, aurora, sculpted hush, and the “marble of forgetting” image. The final realization that the hush, not Mira, “saved them all” offers a satisfying conceptual repricing: wonder as an underlying force rather than a human luxury. That said, several lines state the thesis quite directly (“certify wonder as essential,” “proof…that beauty performed work”), edging toward essayistic clarity rather than fully trusting image and implication. The piece remains resonant, but a touch less explicitness would heighten its literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of failure as teacher, the misuse of sacred objects as mere relics, and tools meant for passage not preservation emerge organically from events. Maren’s realization about the flute’s purpose and her shift from duty-bound keeper to active weaver are thematically coherent. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“The relic she had kept was never meant to be kept”), edging toward on-the-nose commentary rather than leaving more work to image and implication. Nonetheless, the ending’s charged choice invites reflection beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of empathy, identity dissolution, and the scientific reduction (and irreducibility) of emotion are woven tightly through image and action rather than overt moralizing. The notion of emotions as different expressions of a single underlying force is both conceptually resonant and grounded in her work with the fragment. There is a small risk of over-neatness in the explicit equations (“Love equaled fear plus hope divided by distance”), but the surrounding language (“terrible, beautiful equations,” “lucid turbulence”) preserves complexity. The final image leaves a lingering, ambivalent sense of persistence amid cosmic and personal erosion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of mentorship, the value of small wonders, and the transformation of routine encounters into exchanges are rich and coherent, especially via the recurring resonance motif and Kael’s final choice to plant the seed at a crossroads. Yet much of the thematic payload is delivered explicitly in the Keeper’s dialogue (“Relics don’t carry magic between destinations…”) and her explanation of Venn’s fade into myth. This reduces subtext and edges toward essayistic statement rather than leaving more space for implication. The piece still leaves a warm, reflective aftertaste, but with less ambiguity than top-tier literary work typically sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of witnessing versus proving, the emotional residue in objects, and the porous line between mysticism and empiricism are coherently woven through prism, frost, car, and arbor. The idea that some truths can only be “witnessed” rather than demonstrated arrives via Hartley’s experience, not just assertion, and the story earns a gentle aftertaste of grief and reverence. However, a few lines (“Objects aren’t inert. They witness us.” / “Some things can’t be proven…”) edge toward thesis statements rather than leaving more work to subtext. Overall resonance is solid but slightly on-the-nose for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of sacrifice, familial obligation, memory as a bridge, and the costs of crossing liminal spaces are woven organically through objects (loom, hair, amber, puzzle frame). The ending reweights earlier details—the bead, the thin place, the grandmother’s warning—without lapsing into overt moralizing. Some exposition (“She could recommence her life afterward…”) edges toward telling the thematic stakes instead of leaving them wholly in image and implication. Overall, the piece invites reflection beyond its plot and leaves a resonant afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, resilience versus abandonment, and the value of quiet, overlooked labor arise organically from the silk, the sap, and Mira’s role in the guild. The idea of “awakening what remained rather than abandoning everything” is dramatized through concrete acts of forging and reconnection rather than told as moral. Recurring images—the crimson silk, crystallized sap, floating arches—shift meaning by the end (consumed memory, revived roots, arches framing hope), giving the finish a resonant lift. The piece errs slightly on the side of clarity over complexity but avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of sacrifice, the cost of infinite possibility, and the weight of love versus existence emerge organically from the sister relationship and the shard’s function. The final line—“The space between worlds tasted like goodbye”—reweights the entire story without resorting to explicit moralizing. The piece invites reflection on whether any single reunion could justify collapsing variation, without dictating an answer. A few phrasings (“Some truths, once discovered, demanded impossible choices”) edge toward abstraction but are supported by concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs of light, stones, and sea glass accumulate into a strong thematic fabric about protection, transformation of brokenness, and anonymous care among isolated people. The final image of sending her page and talisman onward nicely reweights earlier details. However, the theme edges into explicitness (“some broken things become more beautiful,” “protecting everyone’s truth but her own”), shaving subtlety and introducing a faint whiff of authorial gloss. It remains genuinely affecting and coherent, just slightly more stated than an elite venue typically prefers.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of light vs. darkness, meaning as something that can be “steered,” and the idea that routine acts can literally rewrite time cohere nicely through recurring images (the lens, shadows teaching light where to fall, the green dawn). The accidental prophecy motif thematically links language, fate, and consequence in a nontrivial way. A few lines edge toward explicit thesis (“darkness wasn’t the absence of light but its teacher”), which slightly dulls the subtextual power. Still, the final image of a world altered without knowing it carries genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of attention, inheritance, and the ethics of listening emerge organically from the morpho-wing metaphor and Chen’s explanation of structure vs. pigment. “I think some of her listening stayed with the heart” elegantly crystallizes questions of identity and what gets passed on beyond flesh. The ending image—learning “to listen with iridescent caution…to illuminate the hidden architectures of human need”—is resonant, though it edges close to stating the thesis outright. Overall, the thematic web is cohesive and emotionally honest without overt sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of witnessed sorrow, the quiet holiness of maintenance work, and the idea that the world temporarily holds what humans cannot are integrated through recurring images (trees, dreams, moonlight, fountain). The closing movement—transformed dreams dissolving into water that will nourish new seedlings—nicely reweights earlier motifs without feeling preachy. Some lines (“The maze revealed its secrets: what trees witness is everything we cannot bear to carry alone”) edge toward thesis-statement clarity, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the piece leaves an evocative emotional afterglow rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of collective memory, community, and the tension between binding and release are woven tightly into both the magic system (weaving dawns) and Elora’s role. The final emphasis on “how communities survived by learning when to bind and when to let go” resonates with her letting the song outlive her control and the oak’s bilateral existence. Some lines come close to overt thesis-stating, but they’re supported by concrete images (fruits, window, ribbons of light), so it rarely feels like sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on communal hope without collapsing into a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thematic core—misunderstood empathy, the paradox of distance as faux-kindness, learning to be present without drowning—is coherent and organically tied to Iris’s arc. The paradox imagery and the Library’s nature support this concept, and the final line (“began reading herself back into the world”) lands as a resonant answer. However, the story sometimes states its thesis too directly (“true empathy isn't about absorbing others' pain or fleeing from it,” “Staying while leaving wasn't your mistake”) which tips into mild sermonizing rather than letting subtext fully carry the insight. That explicitness slightly blunts what could be a more haunting ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memory vs. forgetting, preservation vs. transformation, and the sacred in the ordinary emerge organically from bread, gardens, and the archivist’s pivot rather than from abstract exposition. Recurring images (warm sourdough, empty lots turned gardens, birds out of season) are reweighted by the end to support a conceptual repricing of loss. Some lines veer toward explicit thesis (“The sacred isn't in preserving what was—it's in honoring what was by nurturing what could be”), edging into didactic clarity. Even so, the final decision to map losses with plantings lands as earned, resonant, and not merely moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The core theme—whether meaning and promises can outlast memory—is woven tightly through objects, procedure, and setting, rather than imposed afterward. The frequency readings, the catalog of broken or diminished vows, and Maren’s final note (“Evidence that some promises outlive memory itself”) all converge into an earned, resonant repricing of her work. It edges close to explicit statement in the last paragraph but avoids feeling like a sermon by remaining grounded in her concrete choices. Thematic complexity is solid, if not radical: hope coexists with pervasive loss without an oversimplified moral.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Trust, betrayal, and silence as both weapon and armor are woven through objects (fob, recorder) and the “truce of hush” concept without overt moralizing. The revaluation of who actually betrayed whom reweights prior family history in a thematically satisfying way. The ending image of “carrying her father’s silence like armor” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s moral calculus. Complexity remains: no one is clean, and the truce is necessary but morally uneasy.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—about communication across species and systems, elected representation vs emergent messengers, and reinterpreting burdens as roles—is strongly woven through the compass, elections, aurora, and taste motifs. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (“The future tasted like home”) that reweights prior images without outright sermonizing. A few lines edge toward thesis-statement territory (“Maybe I’m not cursed. Maybe I’m just a messenger.”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the piece invites reflection on democracy, embodiment, and belonging beyond the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic motifs—charcoal stains, broken lock, crystals, and generational echo—are well-integrated and culminate in a clear revaluation of memory as potential wonder rather than prison. However, the story undercuts some of its subtlety with explicit thesis sentences (“Memory wasn't meant to be a prison,” “Some things aren't meant to be locked away”). The epiphany is earned by the cave sequence and mother’s hidden work, but the language veers into moralizing summary at the end. Complexity is more implied in the mother’s tragic choices than fully explored in Elena’s neatly resolved acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story’s thematic concern—small, unsaid truths and their cumulative social cost—is woven through the city’s euphemisms, the annotations on the map, and the nature of the Archive. Lines like “words we swallow don't disappear, they settle...” and the final commitment to “deliver what was meant to be heard” provide a resonant conceptual frame. That said, the theme is occasionally over-articulated via the caretaker’s speech (“People need somewhere true,” “candor in small moments…matters more than grand speeches”), edging toward authorial explanation rather than pure emergence from scene. The ending carries a clear emotional and conceptual aftertaste, but with a hint of told moral.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of language’s limits, the honesty of imperfection, and communal expression after the “speaking age” are woven through concrete particulars (the ice holding old conversations, seasonal muteness, pilgrims’ silent gestures). The shift from precision/perfection to wonder and shared purpose at the end reweights everything that came before. A few phrases verge on explicit thematic statement (“symphonies of truth,” “color of wonder”), but they are integrated into Mira’s worldview rather than tacked-on moralizing. The final image of the continuing bell-song offers a resonant, non-literal answer without closing ambiguity too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of grief, culpability, and the impossibility of neatly containing fear are woven through concrete particulars: the box of childhood fears, the malfunctioning dome, the mutated roses, and the buried photograph. The final move from “containing chaos” to tending a garden built from it is conceptually strong and supported by prior images. The last explicit articulation (“escape wasn’t about erasing fear or pain”) leans toward stating the thesis rather than fully trusting the imagery, which slightly dulls the subtlety. Nonetheless, the piece leaves a resonant afterimage and avoids simplistic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—listening as healing and as political power, objects as carriers of communal memory, community as defense against predatory development—emerges coherently from both premise and action. The mirroring between Marissa’s thrift-store practice and Mrs. Chen’s preservation of documents is effective. That said, several lines state the thesis quite directly (“She’d created this space believing that listening heals,” “We’ll need each other first”), edging toward mild sermonizing rather than trusting implication. The emotional aftereffect is warm and hopeful but slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of secrecy, language, embodiment, and converting fear and confession into tools of liberation are woven tightly through the codes, the dice, the journal, and especially the dance. The idea of “encrypting vulnerability as strength” is explicit but supported by concrete practices (resistance members writing fears that become rallying cries), so it doesn’t feel like empty sloganizing. The final image of her words “swim[ming] through networks like light through deep ocean” effectively reweights everything as an ongoing, luminous subversion. There is a touch of thesis-statement exposition in “Her motivation ran deeper than politics,” but it’s earned by the surrounding specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of conservation of memory, the afterlife of erasure, inheritance across generations, and the physics of absence are woven through concrete particulars rather than baldly stated. The whale as carrier of absences, the salt crystals as solidified memories, and the lantern route as a hereditary ritual converge elegantly in the ending image. The final choice reframes loss: not as void but as relocation, with a real price in the present tense. There’s a touch of tidiness in the idea that “everything lost finally settled into pattern and permanence,” but the conceptual and emotional aftertaste stays complex enough to avoid sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story entwines silence, caretaking, and unseen sacrifice into a coherent theme: tending quiet as a sacred, ongoing labor that averts cosmic violence. Turning “howls into whispers, prophecies into origami, cosmic terror into terrestrial peace” reframes power as gentling rather than conquest, and the final return to folding another wing underscores duty without explicit moralizing. The unseen heroism and chosen loneliness resonate beyond the scene. Complexity is present but not deeply troubled by counter-impulses, keeping it from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of agreed-upon lies, architectural permanence versus decay, and intergenerational guardianship of hidden knowledge are woven through concrete particulars rather than stated morals. Lines like “Every cornerstone tells the same lie” and the idea of buildings “interrogating” Elena elegantly refract the core question of what we choose to hear from the past. The ending’s image of meteors as punctuation and the city “speaking in stone” reweights earlier material without over-explaining. The piece avoids sermonizing, though it edges toward thematic neatness in how smoothly Elena accepts her role.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory vs. erasure, control vs. love, and the ethics of preservation are strong and organically tied to the garden and seashell motifs. The idea that understanding is a vector for control and that love can be both contagion and salvation comes through with nuance. Some lines verge on thematic telling (“And understanding…was just another word for control”; “She had translated her isolation into independence”) and slightly flatten what is otherwise rich subtext. Even so, the final refusal and image of the quarantined garden offer a resonant, non-literal answer without a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of “forgiveness as finishing others’ interrupted work,” the ethics of treason in service of compassion, and endurance-with-thorns are richly woven through objects (key, rose, seal) and choices. The Magistrate’s inheritance of the key and Mei’s reinterpretation of its purpose provide a strong, organic thematic engine. However, the explicit statement—“forgiveness wasn't about pardoning past failures—it was about…”—veers into overt moralizing, slightly undercutting the otherwise implicit resonance. Letting the final images carry that idea without spelling it out would elevate this significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core theme—that remembrance requires vulnerability and being witnessed—is organically embedded in the echo mechanics and in the contrast between the beloved mentor and the solitary sister. The final images of Mara singing her sister’s songs into the canyon and planning to teach others carry genuine emotional resonance. However, the text undercuts itself by stating its thesis in near-moral form (“Teach them that to be remembered, we must first allow ourselves to be known”), tipping from resonance into articulation. That explicitness flattens some of the subtext that the imagery and situation had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the concrete particulars: wrecks, shrines, dreams, and the snow globe all converge on salvage, remembrance, and the persistence of love. The final line—“some things survive even drowning”—is nearly explicit but still grounded in the preceding imagery enough to avoid didacticism. The story invites reflection on how small objects hold disproportionate emotional weight and how unseen care may nonetheless shape a life. Slightly more moral friction or ambiguity around Maya’s interventions could deepen the thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—about hidden effort, inherited craft, and reverence for what is unseen—is coherent and threaded through nets, whisk, moon, and fireflies. The best moments are when theme arises from image and action, such as Kenji following “moon paths through the chaos” of the net or invoking the fireflies’ unselfconscious signaling. However, the piece leans into explicit statement (“Every knot you tie…is part of a conversation across generations”; “to make it holy”), which tips toward sermonizing rather than trusting subtext. The ending still resonates, but the moral is slightly more told than allowed to bloom from the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story explores a nuanced theme of truth versus myth, and science versus spiritual comfort, with Vera’s final compromise embodying that tension without turning into a sermon. The “comfortable lies” motif and the idea of guarding some truths create a resonant moral ambiguity. The last line about debunking the curse while leaving the miracle intact is slightly on-the-nose but still effective as a thematic crystallization. Overall, the piece invites reflection on what kinds of illusions we allow and why.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of light/darkness, knowledge vs. comfort, and allegiance to marginalized “shadows” emerge organically from the setting and Elara’s obsession. Recurring images—dawn, prisms, shadows, storm—are well patterned and the final image of the cobalt glass as “witness and lens” nicely echoes the opening. That said, the prophet’s lines (“dawn requires darkness first,” “old powers would rise again”) and Elara’s “Teach me to shape the dawn” edge into overt thesis-stating, blunting subtext. The piece invites some reflection but leans a bit on lyrical abstraction instead of letting complexity fully breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, intergenerational transmission, and turning absence into presence are woven concretely through the jars, music box, and Mrs. Chen’s reaction. Moments like “Now you can teach it forward” anchor the idea of gleaned redemption in specific action rather than pure abstraction. The explicit naming—“This was gleaned redemption…” and “to sweeten absence into presence”—edges toward thesis-stating, slightly flattening what is otherwise powerfully implicit. Still, the final climb back to the dunes with “pockets jingled with coins” vs. “heart jingled with something richer” leaves a resonant, non-didactic aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Questions of memory, guilt, and the ethics of erasure are woven organically into the sonic technology and Meris’s guardianship role. The idea that absolution could dissolve the boundary between guilt and innocence is thematically rich and reframes the lighthouse from simple protector of ships to warden of collective sorrow. The final image—Meris choosing to adapt herself into the pattern of protection—neatly embodies the theme of bearing, not erasing, burden. Some lines verge on explicit thematic statement (“Some artifacts, she understood now, demanded guardians...”), but they still arise credibly from her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of patience as radical, tradition vs. transformation, and horizontal vs. vertical knowledge emerge organically from her work and the recurring images of viaduct, moon, and ice. The concept of a “patient revolution” is strong and reframes small, methodical acts as politically and spiritually charged. Some lines edge toward explicit thesis (“Patience itself was radical in a world demanding instant results”), which blunts subtlety a bit but does not tip into sermon. The ending leaves a resonant sense of change-by-accumulation rather than tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of control vs autonomy, historical and modern systems of exploitation, and the difficulty of resisting institutional pressure emerge organically from actions and images, especially the Underground Railroad lanterns and carved names juxtaposed with Reeves’s quiet looting. The echo between Malcolm’s struggle to reclaim his perception and Elena’s choice to trust her own voice brings genuine thematic coherence. The final paragraph leans mildly toward explicit articulation (“Some paths, she thought, get walked more than once”) but remains grounded enough in concrete image to avoid sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on how “safe passage” can be weaponized or restored without collapsing into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme is strong and organically tied to particulars: the clockwork heart, second opinions, corrosion as patina, and the prison’s rehabilitation program all braid into an inquiry about repair, worth, and the limits of mercy. Lines like Vittorio’s philosophy and “an apology without action is just noise” clearly articulate the moral axis, bordering on didactic but grounded in the characters’ guilt. The final plan—to let the heart beat in a prison as witness to denied second chances—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. A touch more ambiguity or complication around institutional versus personal redemption could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece develops a coherent thematic spine around yearning as an evolutionary force, linking the ancients’ sharp, weaponized longing (the arrow) to Mal’s refracted, abstracted desire (algorithm, kaleidoscope, bell). The “bell no one hears yet” line nicely encapsulates the theme of building receivers for futures that don’t exist until imagined. Most of the thematic weight arises from images and juxtapositions rather than explicit moralizing, though the mentor’s line and evolution summary verge on exposition. Still, the final act of sailing toward a structure made of “light and longing” offers a strong non-literal answer to the story’s question.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of memory, digital death vs. transcendence, and what’s lost when culture and people are “deleted” arise organically from the investigation and image system (“old songs,” dead profiles, quarantined signals). The Perihelion crew’s transformation into something living between data reframes deletion as a doorway, leading to a conceptual repricing at the end. There’s no moralizing; the piece invites reflection on what we choose to preserve and what we follow into the unknown. The resonance is strong, though a sharper dramatized cost might deepen the aftertaste further.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of choice vs determinism, empathy in the “weighted breath before reply,” and contested ownership of grief are deftly woven through the crystal, Thomas’s suicide, and the mirror glimpses. The idea of reconstituting the ball’s purpose into a tool for self-recognition rather than prophecy is a strong, non-literal thematic answer. The apple blossoms over ice and starlit shadows provide resonant, image-based closure that reweights earlier material. A few sentences edge toward explicit thesis (“She would help people see themselves in the breath before choice”), slightly flattening subtext but not enough to feel didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—learning to hear endings as part of life’s song rather than as mere loss—emerges organically from the hum motif, the collapsing villages, and the parasol’s history of survival versus surrender. The fold in patience and the idea of “testing floorboards for hollow spaces” elegantly echo in Vera’s final inward testing of her own hollows. However, the last line (“the change wasn't death calling, but life insisting she finally, fully, listen”) edges into explicit thesis-statement territory, slightly flattening what has already been well implied. Overall, the piece still delivers a resonant, quiet answer to its central question without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme—failure as a valid, even “perfect,” form of destiny and the value of intersubjective understanding—emerges clearly from the vineyard parallels and the final reframing of their breakup. The letter fragment and the stressed Pinot vines are effective, concrete carriers of this idea, and the ending’s charged poise invites reflection. However, some thematic statements are too on-the-nose (“failure can be its own kind of destiny,” “intersubjective understanding”), tipping from resonance into explication. That explicitness slightly undercuts subtext and keeps the piece from achieving a more haunting, open-ended afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of preserving liminal, unprescribed spaces—and the idea that the prophet’s true gift was an “architecture of pause” rather than doctrine—emerges organically from the setting and Senna’s work. The closing realization that these clearings can be maintained collectively through “gentle attention” offers a resonant, non-dogmatic answer to the opening problem. Some lines (“not as holy, but as necessary”) edge toward explicit thesis articulation, which slightly blunts subtext. Nonetheless, the conceptual repricing of what’s sacred feels coherent and lingering.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematic through-lines—arcs as uncertainty, ruins as potential, collective imagination as reclamation—are well integrated into image and action rather than bolted on. The photograph arcs and the factory’s accidental arches nicely echo the idea of living through uncertain “in-between” moments. Some lines are a bit declarative (“These were her tools for collective healing,” “We’re all stuck in various arcs right now, aren’t we?”), nudging toward thesis-speak rather than letting the scene fully carry the idea. Still, the final sense of beginnings emerging from endings is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of language as a living organism, the violence of fixing it in dictionaries, and “breaking as a form of bloom” are well integrated with the crystal, the children’s speech, and the sonic library. The final image of her translating silence into understanding and the books “dreaming of becoming something more” offers a clear, resonant answer to the story’s question. Some thematic sentences edge toward direct statement (“They weren’t losing language; they were compressing it”), slightly reducing the sense of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of aging, ephemerality, memory as recording medium, and the futility/beauty of preservation are woven tightly through specific motifs: fog sculptures, degrading videotapes, driftwood compasses, and chalk text. The final paragraphs offer a strong conceptual repricing—“The sound of growing older wasn’t a single note. It was this…”—reweighting earlier images into a coherent thesis. That articulation, however, edges toward explicit statement, flirting with slight over-clarity instead of leaving the last step entirely in subtext. The piece still carries a resonant aftereffect, but a touch more restraint in spelling out the theme would better fit an elite literary market.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of impermanence, escape velocity, and the ethical stance of witnessing change rather than denying it are woven through images (spinning hand, trembling foundations, departing moon) and Kenji’s craft history. Lines like “We can’t photograph what was. We can only capture what’s becoming” verge on on-the-nose, but they’re supported by sufficient concrete groundwork to avoid feeling like pure thesis. The final image of the observatory “standing witness” above silver clouds delivers a quiet but resonant answer to the story’s question about how to live with inevitable loss. Complexity is present, though the piece leans slightly toward clarity over ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of reconciliation, the holiness of the mundane, and imperfect togetherness arise organically from pancakes, spatulas, broken vinyl, and tinny phone music. The story’s answer to its own question—what a good goodbye requires—is embodied in the shift from surgical perfection to messy, shared memory. “The scent of hope… smells like Sunday mornings” flirts with being a thesis sentence but is earned by prior specifics. There’s genuine emotional resonance without collapsing into sermonizing, though the symbolic patterning is very tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of memory, reconnection, and hidden states (“sealed awakenings,” loops, circuits, shadows becoming threads of relation) are well-integrated and culminate in the noon-web image. The notion that what seems to disappear instead transitions into a different mode of connection is a thoughtful, resonant idea. Some thematic statements verge on explicit explanation (“This was where shadows went at noon—not away, but into connection...”), which trims some subtlety. Still, the conceptual repricing at the end is coherent and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of doubt, grief, and transforming "mistakes into constellations" arise organically from Marianne’s profession, the false burial, and the changeling logic; the tooth and garden reappear at the end to reweight those ideas. The notion of living "in the cleft...between knowing and not-knowing" is a strong thematic articulation that resonates with her arc. However, some of the thematic material is delivered in near-essayistic lines ("She taught me that mistakes aren't endings—they're raw material"), which edges toward didactic rather than fully subtextual. The final image of the tooth pulsing "warm as a star" nicely embodies the idea of luminous reknitting without overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of grief, transformation, and making light “that doesn’t burn” are organically embedded in the sea glass, the fire backstory, and the children’s lessons, with the broken-to-beautiful motif elegantly realized. The linkage between Elena’s love of colored light, the ash of the observatory, and the grotto’s refracted “starlight” achieves a genuine, lingering resonance. The text mostly avoids overt moralizing, letting images and actions carry meaning. Its main limitation is that the thematic arc is relatively straightforward and comforting, with little moral or emotional ambiguity pressing back against the redemptive framing.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of failure transformed, reclamation of spaces and selves, and the active grafting of meaning arise organically from the setting and Maya’s practices with the icicle patterns. The parallel between decaying technology and evolving emotional understanding is effective and not merely decorative. However, lines like “meaning wasn't found or given—it was grafted” and “two witnesses learning to dream awake” edge toward explicit thesis-stating rather than trusting subtext. The piece still leaves some resonant ambiguity, but leans a bit harder into articulation than top-tier literary venues usually prefer.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of endings, hope, memory vs forgetting, and ethical responsibility in storytelling emerge organically from the apparitions and the novelist’s reframing of her task. The recurring current/against-the-current motif and the shell’s “mathematics of growth” lend strong subtext without over-explication. The final paragraphs flirt with explicit thesis (“She would give her protagonist neither mercy nor vengeance, but the harder third thing”) but remain grounded in specific character and choice enough to avoid sermonizing. The ending image reweights the whole premise—she hasn’t found an ending, she’s found “the truth that made ending possible.”

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, reciprocity with the land, and the fusion of technology with ancestral ritual arise organically from Cassian’s actions and the imagery of vines, songs, and machinery. The notion of “remedy” as healing the cultural forgetting itself, not just the soil, is a strong and specific conceptual turn. The last paragraph edges toward explicit thematic phrasing (“some engineering required more than gears—it required faith…”) but remains just shy of didactic, supported by the concrete transformation around him. Overall, the piece invites reflection on how modernity and forgotten practices might be reconciled, though it resolves with a relatively tidy sense of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of persistence, care, and the translation of longing into enduring form emerge organically from Vera’s methods and the orchard’s condition. The motif of heartbeats as electromagnetic intention, combined with safekept starlight, creates a rich meditation on what it means “to want, to love, to continue” in a dying environment. The final act—hiding the maps inside the oldest tree so the orchard can “remember what it meant to bloom”—reweights all prior detail into a quietly powerful answer about memory as resistance. The piece flirts with lyric abstraction (“geography of persistence, cartography of hope”) but earns it through concrete prior work.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres around memory, resilience, and the idea of wonder as a survival resource, expressed through the concrete mechanism of the timer and the marble’s echoes. The ending reweights earlier details—the mapping of reflections, the obsessive repair work—into a quiet argument that human continuity is preserved as much by meaning as by food. However, a few lines tilt toward stated thesis (“wonder itself was a resource that needed storing”) rather than wholly trusting image and action. The resonance is strong but could gain subtlety by shifting more thematic work into subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme and subtext—about grief’s weight, transformation, inherited suffering, and becoming a vessel rather than a victim—emerge organically from the lamp’s history, the grotto, and the calcifying burdens. The final image of stars as burdens “that had found its proper angle and chosen to shine anyway” reweights the entire piece without sliding into explicit moralizing. The interplay of miners’ exhaustion, the grandmother’s garden dreams, and her role as a filter for unspeakable sorrows gives the story genuine resonance. A slightly didactic line like “she understood now: she was not trapped” edges toward stating the insight, but the surrounding images mostly carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of presence, impermanence, and containment are woven through motifs of lions, wood rings, rain, and the bowl without relying on overt moralizing. The final realization—“making space for what's gone is how you hold what remains”—borders on explicit statement but feels earned by the concrete journey with the wood. Recurring images (“here and gone,” time as rings, crystallized time) are reweighted in the ending rather than simply repeated. The piece leaves a resonant, quiet aftereffect about grief-work without collapsing into platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges clearly from particulars: transformation vs. disintegration, memory and time erosion, and the move from regretful negotiation to self-acceptance. Recurring motifs—the stalled carousel, eroded pillars, broken camera wheel, and collected phrases—reweight nicely at the end as she chooses to stop living through borrowed fragments. Lines like “transformation without direction was just disintegration” and “Acceptance was” veer toward explicit thesis, adding a faint hint of didacticism. Still, the final image (lagoon pausing, then moving) offers a resonant, non-literal answer that feels earned rather than tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of re-routing decay into renewal, infrastructure as living architecture, and “equations for hope” are woven organically through the water imagery, the sextant, and the “maze of intentions” model of the terminal. The idea of not fighting degradation but navigating it like an explorer provides a satisfying conceptual repricing at the end. A few lines edge toward explicit thesis (“not demolition but metamorphosis,” “new equations for hope”) but avoid outright sermonizing. The piece leaves a lingering, thoughtful aftertaste about design, entropy, and community reuse.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of regret, fear of inadequacy, and reclaiming an abandoned passion arise organically from her profession and history, not from abstract lecture. The crystals’ echoing of “whatever truths visitors spoke” becomes a concrete mechanism for honoring rather than erasing her buried dreams. Her decision to start again as a beginner at thirty-seven gives the piece a resonant, non-moralizing answer: peace comes from committed risk, not tidy forgetting. There is a slight neatness to the framing (“the dream wasn’t abandoned anymore”) but it is supported by specific images and costs.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    The thematic throughline—truth found in absence, negative space, and misdirection—is coherent and emerges from concrete particulars (canals as frames, cities as distractions, the glowing void beneath). The final realization about seeking “monuments” instead of “voids” offers a resonant re-weighting of everything before. Some lines veer toward essayistic abstraction (“lies weren't obstacles to truth but pathways toward it”), edging close to thesis-stating. Even so, the concepts feel earned by the imagery and character journey rather than tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from seeds, knots, and lightning as parallel forms of encoded wisdom, and from the contrast between disappearing craft and modern convenience (GPS, synthetic lines). The story articulates a nuanced reverence for preservation-as-relationship rather than mere collection, embodied in how Mira returns the treasures to the rope and envisions an archive as its own weaving. Moments like “practical knowledge elevated to philosophy” come close to expository gloss, but the surrounding images generally carry the weight. The ending offers a resonant, non-didactic answer—devoted stewardship in the face of time—without collapsing into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme is strongly integrated: absence vs. presence, mapping lost selves, and the idea of “dying to the world for a time” recur through objects (thread, carpet), setting (ships, garden), and profession (obituaries for the living). The story’s final reframing of death as intermission and the soul’s “way back to the body” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question. A few lines state theme almost too directly (“Your obituary…will say that you died to the world for a time”), edging toward thesis rather than pure subtext. Still, the accumulation of images and choices leaves a genuine afterglow of complexity rather than a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of hybridity, flawed genesis, and the impossibility of returning to a “pure” past are woven tightly into action (the bio-mechanical incubator, the phoenix’s metal feathers, the mechanized kingdom below). The final realization that beauty may not require purity but new “hybrid wonders” feels earned and resonates with earlier images. Some thematic lines verge on explicit statement (“The old world was extinct as the phoenix itself,” “bitterly sweet at best”), softening subtext in places. Still, the phoenix’s song transforming industrial rhythm into melody is a strong non-didactic thematic image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of trauma, inheritance, and transformation (“scars can sing,” “wounds can be grafted into wholeness”) are woven through images of obsidian, grafted trees, and the drilled coin, giving the piece a strong conceptual spine. Subtext surfaces in the way Maya uses her father’s relic and site of his death as tools for healing, turning legacy into counter-legacy. Yet the story repeatedly states its thesis outright—particularly in the final paragraph (“She had proven once again… that wounds grafted together could bloom into unexpected strength”)—which tips into didactic clarity and undercuts some of the implicit resonance. More trust in image and silence would elevate it to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, persistence, and a mature skepticism that can coexist with wonder emerge organically from the actions and images: fountains as broken promises that later “remember themselves,” the geese’s pause, and Mira’s lantern shifting from questioning to revealing. The final passages about her skepticism evolving and questions “glowing brighter than answers” are a touch on-the-nose but still emotionally honest rather than didactic. Subtext around what a city owes its past and how ordinary moments gain meaning through attention lingers nicely. The piece resists a tidy moral while still giving a clear thematic contour.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of generational repetition, love as the enduring pattern, and choosing which patterns to break are coherent and supported by recurring images (gear, flowers, transit). The final admonition—“Tend the patterns that deserve repeating, and break the ones that don’t”—captures the intended conceptual frame. However, the story often states its thesis outright (“it’s the only pattern that matters”) rather than trusting implication, veering toward gentle sermonizing. The result is emotionally warm but less thematically subtle than work at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of collective grief, intergenerational preparation for loss, and monuments as waypoints rather than endpoints are integrated through concrete motifs: stones, poems, the ribbon, the monarch migration. The final understanding—that “we are the carvers of each other’s remembering”—reweights earlier details effectively. However, several lines step into explicit thesis (“The stones you carve…you approach them too carefully. Too separately.”), skirting didacticism. The story remains resonant, but more reliance on implication and image, less on explanation, would lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Time, balance, guilt, and hidden vs visible truth interlock elegantly through motifs of tides, gears, and microscopic inscriptions. The idea that balance is “the honest swing between extremes” arises organically from her actions and the pendulum image, even if the line edges toward explicit statement. The final image of timekeeping as both secret-keeping and faith-keeping leaves a substantive thematic aftertaste beyond a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of intention vs. surface moves, order vs. misremembered chaos, and the ethics of how we archive the dead are woven through chess imagery, cemetery work, and the coded tapestry without overt sermonizing. The realization that “the dead were tenderly organized… It was the living whose intentions sprawled” sets up a resonant reconfiguration when she discovers her grandmother’s hidden archive of truth. The final charged-poise image—the clock run down yet the “game… just beginning”—reweights earlier material effectively. A few lines state insight fairly directly, but they arise from concrete particulars rather than abstract moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic spine—innovation flourishing within acknowledged ignorance and constraint—is tightly bound to the premise and repeatedly dramatized through specific institutions (Councils of Unknowing). However, the piece leans into explicit thematic summary (“The future wasn't written in certainty but in the courage to acknowledge what remained unknown”), which flattens subtext into stated moral. Thematically charged details like the spire glyphs and the kingfisher’s perception of polarized light work well but could carry more of the work without so much explanatory prose. The ending resonates conceptually but edges toward sermon-like clarity rather than lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres beautifully around memory, absence, and the persistence of narrative in “dust” and “grains,” integrating the famine, the pirate broadcast, and Elena’s craft into one conceptual arc. The idea that stories are embedded in the smallest particles and can be reawakened via learned frequencies offers a resonant non-literal answer to the famine. The piece largely avoids sermonizing, though phrases like “her true purpose now” and “ancient purpose” lean a bit toward overt statement. Subtext about preservation, transmission, and quiet resistance is present but could carry more moral or emotional complication to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of safety as mirage, framing as exclusion, and the ethics of preservation versus erasure are deeply woven through images (incomplete paintings, ash, kintsugi mask). The story’s final stance—continuing the work as acknowledgment of what’s left out rather than worship of what’s preserved—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question. A few lines verge on overt thesis (“Safety is forgetting what the frame excludes”), but they’re diegetic and earned enough not to feel like sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of truth versus narrative, rational inquiry versus myth-making, and history as sedimentary layers are coherent and nicely embodied in physical details and roles (philosopher in the drain, historian from the university, the cog). The final insight—that a philosopher’s work is to ensure truth survives argument—reweights earlier material and fits the closure. However, the story leans into overt statement (“Isn’t that what philosophers do?”, “The rational rebellion…”) enough to feel slightly didactic rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic material—difference vs. harmony, listening vs. inherited hatred, vanishing arts vs. living tradition—is coherent and integrated with the events and imagery (choir, rosette, humming). The phoenix rosette as symbolic object returning in the final beat does good work reframing tradition as practice rather than preservation. Yet the piece leans into explicit thesis statements (“harmony isn’t about everyone singing the same note,” “this is how traditions survive”) that edge toward didacticism. These on-the-nose articulations slightly blunt what might otherwise be a more haunting, open-ended resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of memory as commons versus property, intergenerational resistance, and beauty grown from ruin are clear and organically tied to objects and setting. The final realization—“she’d never been as alone as the world had taught her to be”—nicely crystallizes the story’s emotional thesis. However, several lines articulate theme almost as slogans (“They don’t want us tasting each other’s truths,” “memory wasn’t property”), edging into sermonizing rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. A bit more resistance or ambiguity around the fruits’ implications could deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of generosity vs. hoarding, efficiency vs. wonder, and “purpose isn’t efficiency—it's joy” are coherent and tied closely to the bee system and blackout. The final conceptual move—equating bees and hope, and framing “progress without wonder” as “elaborate death”—offers a clear thematic stance. Yet the story often states its thesis outright through Chen and Mira (“progress without wonder was just elaborate death,” “purpose isn’t efficiency—it’s joy”), edging into sermonizing rather than trusting subtext. This explicitness limits complexity and post-reading resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of displacement, witnessing, and gradual change accumulate through the found objects, the gentrifying pier, and the empty Kettering house. The idea that “houses didn't need people…they needed witness” is powerful and resonates backward through the images. However, the story edges into explicit thesis-stating (“Her creeping normality wasn't a curse but a gift”) rather than fully trusting image and action. The result is still strong, but slightly more told than the highest tier would permit.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story engages rich themes—justice vs. beauty, moral ambiguity in catastrophe, history as narrative engineering—with real complexity. The architect as both monster and hero, and the poisoned foundations as literalized ethical sabotage, are strong thematic images. However, some signposted lines (“tragedy requires innocence,” “history lives in shades of gray”) edge into overt thesis-stating rather than letting the particulars fully carry the insight. Trimming or undercutting those moments would sharpen the already impressive resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of risk vs safety, the value of failure, and the impossibility of perfect equilibrium are well woven through the perpetual-motion imagery and the chipped die’s imbalance. The staircase as boundless, self-sustaining punishment neatly reweights the idea of perpetual motion at a human level, and the final line (“Even if we fail. Especially if we fail.”) lands as an earned thematic turn. However, Castellano’s lines about “true perpetual motion” and Mara “searching for permission to believe” edge into explicit thesis-stating rather than letting subtext fully carry the load. The piece invites reflection but slightly undercuts its subtlety with that explanatory dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of memory, resistance to cultural erasure, and the persistence of small kindnesses are tightly woven through concrete images (persimmon, steam characters, hidden books) rather than abstract lecture. The moon-as-library metaphor and the chain of strangers’ kindnesses produce a resonant conceptual repricing at the end: every act of care becomes part of an indestructible archive. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“Moonlight was a library without walls”) and slightly flatten subtext. Still, the final vision of rooftop greenhouses blazing with impossible languages lands as a strong, non-literal answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of displacement, cultural preservation, and adaptive continuity emerge organically from particulars: museum relocations, refugee artifacts, bread initials, and the “archaeologists excavating themselves” image. The ending reweights everything: preservation shifts from static curation to active, risky excavation of the living community. A couple of lines come close to stating the thesis (“people who understood that cultures survived through deliberate preservation”), but they’re supported by strong scene work. The piece invites reflection on how identity survives catastrophe without collapsing into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece organically explores themes of time as a direction, agency versus determinism, and the possibility of re-reading doom-laden structures (“When you see me, weep”) as openings for change. The shifting inscription and backward clocks are strong motifs that reweight themselves at the end without explicit moralizing. Maren’s choice embodies a non-literal answer: freedom requires stepping into uncertainty and paying a personal price to alter collective fate. The resonance is high, though the social implications (who is saved from famine, and at what broader cost) remain more implied than deepened.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of perception, fear’s parasitic scale, and the danger/necessity of looking directly at what haunts us emerge organically from mirrors, memory, and the clasp. The insight that fear is small but amplified by avoidance is embodied in the hall-of-mirrors sequence and the act of confession. However, the advisor’s final line—“What we fear most is seeing fear clearly”—is a fairly explicit thematic statement that edges into moralizing and slightly undercuts subtext. The piece still invites reflection on trauma and agency, but a touch more restraint in articulation would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The motif of turning obstacles into instruments (rising seas, driftwood, copper, salt-stressed trees) is well integrated and refracts the central theme of survival through adaptation and re-purposing. The blue hour and backwards-flowing currents underscore a subtler thematic line about trusting non-obvious patterns and marginalized knowledge. The paragraph beginning “Every obstacle became an instrument” leans close to essayistic statement, slightly flattening what has been nicely embodied. Still, the closing image reweights these ideas without overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of dangerous complacency, misread threats, and the seduction of false clarity are well-woven into concrete images (sunwashed brightness hiding the crack, city accepting imprisonment, watchers as misunderstood guides). The final realization—that staying means death and the watchers are calling them “home”—reweights earlier material and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s core question. The line about “the city’s true danger” verges on thesis-statement, slightly flattening subtext. Overall, the thematic spine feels organic to character and world rather than imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of noble lies, founding myths, and the moral calculus of truth versus unity are strong and coherent, supported by the letter’s content and Elena’s reasoning. The rosebush and ivy subtly echo cycles of growth, decay, and reclamation. However, the story leans into explicit thematic statement (“truth doesn’t destroy societies; suppressed truth does,” “The world deserved this complexity”) rather than trusting subtext, which introduces a faintly didactic tone. The complexity is there conceptually, but the ending edges toward essayistic moral rather than pure image-driven resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of erosion, memory, and “interlaced absence” are woven through objects (inkwell, box), setting (submerged pavilion), and Marcus’s vocation without overt moralizing. The unsent letters crystalize the idea of absence-as-architecture, and his response embodies a nuanced ethic of remembrance versus intrusion. The final image—him returning to official reports while privately committing to “understanding whose dreams had drowned here”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s questions. The piece sustains complexity and avoids pat conclusions while still feeling legible.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of truth versus official history, reclamation from ruin, and the value of stillness emerge organically from action and detail. The contrast between drowned knowledge and preserved dissent is strong, especially in linking Moreau’s work to Mira’s. However, the closing paragraphs edge toward explicit statement (“evidence of courage, proof that some had fought to preserve truth”), slightly softening the subtext. The resonance is solid but not subtle enough for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of grief as craft, the ethics of preservation versus release, and the transformation of light/sky into something “we can see through” are woven elegantly through objects and actions rather than overt commentary. Recurring motifs (glass, light, shadows, cranes, inversion) genuinely shift meaning by the end, especially the line Mei repeats to herself and the contrast between the basilica’s static Archive and her dynamic, quantum hope. The piece resists pat moralizing: it never claims her ritual will work, only that she must pay its cost. The emotional aftereffect is contemplative and melancholic rather than neatly resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—how potential, loss, and small perturbations shape reality—is woven tightly through the geode, perturbation theory, the wedding strike, and the atmospheric anomalies. The final image of “unused potential, pooling like light inside unopened stones” reweights the earlier scientific and personal material in a satisfying conceptual repricing. However, some thematic statements are on-the-nose (“Energy couldn't be destroyed, only transformed”; “The potential doesn't disappear”), slightly reducing subtlety. Despite this, the emotional aftereffect is strong and avoids reductive moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of belonging, connection vs. isolation, and the fear of connection in the “Before Times” are organically embedded in the chip concept and Mara’s biography. The final reframe—Mara recognizing she is not broken but uniquely suited to reassemble the scattered frequency—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial question. However, some key ideas are named directly (“frequency of belonging,” “when people feared connection more than isolation”), pushing toward exposition rather than pure emergent resonance. A touch more implication and a touch less thematic spelling-out would lift this into a truly elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of truth versus convenience, the irrevocability of harm, and the insufficiency of apology are consistently embodied in Mara’s profession, Elias’s lost years, and the dead parents. Recurring images (driftwood, the watch hand, the “sieved hush”) support a meditation on how small falsifications deform entire lives. The ending offers a resonant stance: she cannot fix the past, but can choose accountability and dismantling over profitable silence. A few lines (“remember what it meant to be accountable,” “This was her method now, her penance”) lean toward explicit statement, slightly reducing subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece has an articulate thematic spine around liminal spaces, the gap between apology and forgiveness, and turning repeated failure into wisdom. The drawer pull and the neutral moon cycles serve as motifs tying personal lineage to political reconciliation. Some lines verge on didactic (“Or we can recycle these mistakes into wisdom right now”), slightly flattening subtext into thesis. Even so, the ending image of Katrin alone, already planning the next exchange, offers a resonant sense of ongoing, costly labor rather than a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of living with regret, trusting multiple systems (internal and external), and aligning heart and action emerge organically from Marina’s history and the mirrored grief in Amy. Recurring images—the compass, utility poles, collapsing expectations—gain new weight in the final decision to “use everything” and navigate through, not away from, her mistakes. A couple of lines edge toward explicit thesis (“That’s what I should have done before—trusted more than one system”), but they’re still grounded in concrete stakes. The ending invites reflection without moralizing, leaving open whether this crossing will “heal” anything while clearly reweighting her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of guilt, identity, and particularly empathy-as-choice rather than memory emerge coherently from the interplay of procedure, labyrinth, and baseball. The mirrored phrase “Empathy isn’t memory. It’s choice. Choose.” plus the Interpreter’s commentary, though resonant, edges into explicit thesis-statement territory. The closing image of light in darkness and Marcus choosing to try does carry emotional aftereffect, but the moral is a bit too spelled out to feel fully organic. Some additional ambiguity or resistance could deepen the thematic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around fear as a threshold, love’s willingness to transgress categories (life/death, human/beast), and rewriting rules after cataclysmic change. The fortune cookie motif nicely reframes from trite wisdom to hard-earned truth, and the ending image of walking between silver trees offers a resonant non-literal answer about existing “between.” That said, some lines edge toward explicit thesis (“Mira had simply learned to write new ones”), which slightly blunts subtext. More trust in the images and fewer overt explanations would strengthen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of time, presence, generational inheritance, and “ghosts of connection” emerge organically from concrete motifs (the cloth of hands, the dolls’ tea set, her mother’s withdrawn hand). The conceptual move from “finding” time to “giving” it is strong and reweights the premise. However, lines like “Time, she finally understood, didn’t need to be found. It needed to be given.” edge into explicit thesis-statement territory, slightly flattening otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—facing and integrating collective shadow/grief rather than repressing it as “progress”—is coherently developed through Mei’s work, the shimmer-reading, and the extinction context. The Tear as a key and the final image of the ship’s transformation create a strong conceptual repricing of grief as both burden and gateway. Some lines slide toward explicit thesis (“We locked away our collective pain and called it progress”), which slightly blunts the subtext. Overall, though, the piece invites reflection on spiritual/psychological accountability at the end of a species without collapsing into a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—transformation as slow, granular, and textural—is coherent and well-mirrored in the sand, volcano, and lightning bugs. The story’s best moments embody this (detour as life path, jars as mini-philanthropies) and the final image offers a resonant answer: she becomes an orchestrator of small miracles rather than a donor. However, the text leans into direct exposition (“Transformation wasn’t sharp or sudden…”) and thesis-like phrasing (“the texture of existence itself”), which blunts subtext. Thematically rich but slightly over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of systems turned into prisons, subversion from within, and “words as lockpicks” are coherently threaded through Maren’s job, the sundial, and the mentor’s maxim. The final image—light from within during enforced darkness—nicely reframes the fort’s luminous reputation in thematic terms. However, the story leans close to articulating its thesis outright (“The revolution won’t be loud…”, “Some doors…needed to be unlocked from the inside”), which edges toward didactic clarity rather than leaving more resonance in implication. Moral complexity is low; the revolution is framed as unambiguously right with little nuance about potential costs or collateral.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of letting go, the universe “remembering itself,” and promises as invitations rather than explanations are coherent and organically tied to eels, friction, and the grandmother’s disappearance. The final repricing—realizing the goal isn’t to restore friction but to witness its rightful withdrawal—nicely reweights earlier material. However, the text leans into explicit articulation (“It was about understanding why…,” “The promise…wasn’t an explanation—it was an invitation”) where a touch more reliance on image and implication would deepen subtext. The resonance lingers, but some lines veer toward stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of censorship, collective trauma, and turning silence into testimony are strongly integrated through recurring images (cartography of scars, disappeared as canyons, crushed protests as mountain ranges). The final movement—“becoming the archive they couldn’t erase” and mapping loss into coordinates—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how a silenced person can still resist. At times the piece edges toward explicit thesis (“That was how resistance survived: by becoming too pure to corrupt”), which slightly dulls subtext. Even so, the emotional and conceptual aftertaste is potent and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of philosophy as journey, questions as destinations, and inquiry displacing violence are coherent and organically reflected in their shift from duel to duet. The Bellini overture and the sundial-as-score nicely embody the idea of hidden structures of meaning embedded in the world. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit thematic articulation (“Every philosophical inquiry is an attempt…”, “Philosophy should infuriate”) rather than letting subtext and image carry more of that load. The result is resonant but slightly didactic, with limited ambiguity or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of resilience, beauty-in-ruin, and identity-as-multiplicity emerge organically from particulars: prison wildflowers, broken hands tending ruins, her monthly selves as different gardeners. The “blooming resistance” motif meaningfully reweights the act of planting from hobby to political and existential stance. A few lines (“To forge beauty from anarchy”) edge toward explicit thesis, but they’re still grounded in character rather than authorial sermon. The final image of future, unrecognizing selves returning to what they planted offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of longing, time, choice, and art as an agent capable of bending reality emerge organically from the compasses, clock, film, and her performance. The image of compasses pointing not to north but to “moments when longing became strategically creative enough to bend the world” is potent, though it edges toward spelling out the thesis. The final act of playing “a song about arrival” reweights her entire twenty-year pattern in a satisfying way. The piece remains slightly tidy and sentimental, softening potential thematic complexity around cost and paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of cultural memory, skepticism versus faith, and the porous line between truth and desire arise organically from Kima’s role and choice. Imagery of seeds, ancestors, and calendars supports a reflection on how memory is stored (genes, rituals, stories) without feeling like mere allegory. However, a few explicit thematic statements (“we must act on luminous doubt”) edge toward essayistic and slightly dull the subtext. The ending still lands with a resonant, open-question feel rather than a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—how unspoken apologies and lost histories can be honored through patient, living care rather than recovered—is coherent and tightly integrated with bonsai, tides, compass, and lace. The story invites reflection on intergenerational trauma and repair without needing plot pyrotechnics. Some lines tip close to explicit thesis (“Apologies need not be spoken to be real. They can live in how we tend what remains.”), which slightly blunts subtextual power for a top-tier venue. Still, the final reweighting toward tending “living things after the storm had passed” delivers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central parallel between neutron stars and butterflies is profound and well-developed through action. However, the final two paragraphs veer into explicit moralizing ("Helena understood... because," "Just like everything..."), articulating the thesis rather than letting the resonant image of the glowing scales stand alone. This over-explanation softens the subtextual power at the finish.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of adaptation and patience is coherent but delivered through didactic dialogue ("Nothing beautiful comes from shortcuts") rather than subtext. The connection between the glass medium and the moral stance is clear but feels heavy-handed in the final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of translating trauma into art is coherent but executed with a heavy hand, relying on explicit thesis statements ("Sound isn't the only language of music") rather than subtext. The emotional resonance is forced through descriptions of audience reactions ("Some wept") rather than emerging organically from the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of honoring devotion is coherent, but the ending relies on explicit moralizing ("They'd needed someone to acknowledge...") rather than letting the resolution resonate through subtext. The dialogue "You can rest now" borders on explaining the story's thesis to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, with Mara articulating the thesis in dialogue ("Not just survival, but continuity"). This "Thematic Echo" replaces subtext with direct instruction, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.5)
    Thematic resonance is severely undercut by the pilgrim explicitly stating the story's thesis in dialogue ("The world stores what we cannot hold"), leaving little room for subtext or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully marries the abstract concept of "hyperbolic geometry" with the emotional reality of memory and loss. The theme of time as a non-linear architecture emerges organically from the specific imagery of the mazes.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme is delivered through explicit expository assertions ("resilience could only grow from diversity") rather than emerging organically from the dramatic conflict. The moral is stated upfront and resolved tidily, leaving little room for subtextual ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of memory and loss is woven beautifully into the mechanics of the story. The score is held back from the highest echelon only by the narrator's explicit bridging of the subtext in the climax ("The choice, like trust itself, would require a leap..."), which slightly over-explains the moment rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is delivered through didactic dialogue ("You're not meant to steal... You're meant to create") and explicit moralizing in the final paragraph. While the concept of "homecoming in disguise" is resonant, the subtext is rendered as text, removing the ambiguity and depth required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story violates the show-don't-tell principle by explicitly narrating its theme in the final paragraph ("Observe how endings contain beginnings"). This "Thematic Echo," where the character sermonizes the story's thesis, flattens resonance into a moral lesson. The "thawing heart" metaphor is also explicitly explained rather than allowed to emerge from the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("Vulnerability wasn't just power..."), which flattens resonance. The parallel between Maya and Emma is explained to the reader rather than allowed to emerge organically.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding meaning in silence is resonant but delivered didactically. The Oracle explicitly articulates the thesis in dialogue ("This is how you navigate... by remembering..."), which undercuts the subtext. Allowing the map's imagery to speak for itself without the explanation would strengthen the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is coherent but handled clumsily in dialogue, with characters explicitly stating the moral ("From everywhere and nowhere"). This didactic approach flattens the subtext and leaves little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of communication and clarity is consistent. The ending resonates with the concept of "honesty," but the final paragraph ("The quiet night registrar had finally stopped eavesdropping...") leans into moralizing summary rather than letting the image speak for itself, slightly dampening the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    The central metaphor of "mending deception" is beautifully realized through the objective correlative of the marbles. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise of quantified luck without devolving into moralizing, achieving a high degree of synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of non-linear time is central but delivered largely through exposition and dialogue ("This changes everything"). The thematic realization feels like a scientific lecture rather than an emergent truth earned through narrative struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.8)
    The explicitly spelled-out message ("TELL THEM") collapses potential subtext into melodrama. The theme of justice is resolved too tidily, lacking the ambiguity or resonance required for a literary ending.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through on-the-nose dialogue ("I programmed it to be confident," "fault-tolerance isn't the same as wisdom"). The story explicitly states its thesis rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext or action.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.0)
    The hydraulic metaphor for repressed guilt is conceptually sound and integrates well with the setting. However, the theme is blunted by the heavy-handed, verbatim repetition of the phrase "swallowed truth" and explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing ("This was her chronicle now: the story of letting go") and a thesis statement written inside the swan. This overt explanation replaces subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("teaching others to notice when the world revealed its hidden frequencies") rather than allowed to emerge organically. The ending relies on moralizing summary ("Perhaps that was the real magic"), which flattens the resonance and violates the rubric’s guardrail against sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("Someone needed to remember..."), turning subtext into text. The emotional resonance is asserted by the narrator rather than emerging organically from the conflict or action.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of "open secrets" is clearly integrated into the plot mechanics. However, the ending relies on explicit summarization ("It was... the most honest thing she'd ever written") to deliver meaning, rather than allowing the resonance to emerge organically from the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of "unraveled stillness" is central and coherent but delivered didactically through dialogue and narration that explains the subtext explicitly. The resolution validates the thesis perfectly, leaving little room for ambiguity or interpretive depth.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme is coherent but the ending relies on explicit summarization ("She wasn't predicting futures anymore..."), effectively explaining the subtext to the reader. This didactic approach in the final paragraphs flattens the resonance, trading ambiguity for a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of accepting mortality and consequence is coherent and lands well at the end. The score is limited by the explicit statement of the theme ("labyrinth... built from cowardice") which preempts subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is delivered didactically through narration ("victory carved from absence") rather than emerging from the action. The ending explains the meaning to the reader instead of allowing it to resonate implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of preserving truth in darkness is coherent, but the story relies on explicit dialogue ("Because you nurture integrity in solitude") to articulate it, rather than letting it emerge organically from action. This "telling" flattens the subtext, transforming potential resonance into exposition. The connection between the women is functional but lacks emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of sensory loss and memory is tightly woven into the plot mechanics. The concept that we mourn what we forget we are missing resonates strongly, and the "lantern broker" motif unifies the narrative logic with the thematic payload.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the theme of transformation is central, the ending relies on explicit sermonizing ("For poets. For witnesses") to deliver the message. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the subtext and resolves the ambiguity too tidily for a literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding beauty in incompleteness is resonant, but the story relies on an explicit diagnostic summary ("She realized the incompleteness was the point") to land it. This telling of the subtext reduces the reader's interpretative work and flattens the potential depth of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story navigates the theme of authenticity versus artifice with exceptional nuance, avoiding a simple moral binary. The distinction between "forgiveness" and the "wish to forgive" is a profound thematic deepening that resonates powerfully in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly diagnosed in dialogue ("Cycles of compassion"), reducing the subtext to a moral lesson handed directly to the reader. The ending reinforces this stated thesis without complicating it, resulting in a fable-like simplicity that feels didactic rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of active contribution versus passive assimilation is coherent and resolves the story. However, the ending relies on explicit moralizing ("belonging wasn't about... but about...") rather than letting the resonance of the twin arbors speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of liberation is coherent but is undermined by a heavy-handed delivery in the final paragraph. The explicit summation ("truth required liberation to be truly seen") flattens the resonance of the final image, effectively explaining the story to the reader rather than letting the subtext land.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "ambiguous loss" is resonant, but the story relies on explicit thesis statements ("love could be quantified... by the shape of its absence") rather than letting the imagery do the work. The final paragraph summarizes the moral, reducing the implicit power of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of preservation and visibility is coherent but explicitly stated in the narration ("Miriam understood that she had finally achieved visibility") rather than emerging organically through subtext. The ending summarizes the moral meaning instead of trusting the dramatic action to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of control versus surrender is coherent and woven through the imagery of the trellis and the storm. However, the execution borders on didactic, with lines like "she finally understood" and "releasing control" explicitly stating the thesis rather than letting it emerge solely through subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of art as a bridge across time is well-developed through the brooch and handprints. However, the ending explicitly summarizes the thesis ("The convergence wasn't mystical. It was memory"), which trades subtextual resonance for definitive explanation, slightly flattening the emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story brilliantly inverts the prompt's motivation, revealing that "magnifying everyday magic" actually requires protecting mystery rather than explaining it. The theme lands with emotional resonance rather than just intellectual cleverness.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of preserving meaning in absence is clear but delivered through explicit statements ("archive was a monument to empty spaces") rather than subtext. The ending articulates the moral ("To hearten those who returned") directly, reducing interpretive resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of validating "unspoken truths" is legible and resolves the arc, but it is articulated explicitly in dialogue and narration rather than emerging purely through subtext. The resonance relies heavily on these declared meanings ("some truths unmake the lies") rather than dramatic implication.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.7)
    The synthesis of mathematical order and ancestral folklore is thematically strong and well-integrated. The realization of being "guardians" leans slightly didactic, but the final image of transcribing successfully grounds the theme in action.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    The exploration of immortality avoids simple moralizing, culminating in a resonant refusal of acceptance. The final image of Cassius plotting to tear reality apart recontextualizes his grief as a new, dangerous purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "fair trade" and restoring balance is coherent and integrated into the plot mechanics. However, the subtext is thinned by characters explicitly stating the thematic thesis in dialogue ("The balance doesn't work"), which reduces the interpretive resonance of the otherwise strong final image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of subjective experience vs. objective reality is explored with nuance, avoiding heavy-handed moralizing. The resolution—validating the "untruth" as the human domain—resonates strongly with the "invented histories" premise, creating a unified thematic argument.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of preserving history through its "poison" (the painful or dangerous parts) is handled with sophistication. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem of erasure, achieving a high-level conceptual repricing of what it means to be "alive" versus "documented."

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies heavily on explicit thematic statements ("The riddle wasn't about proof. It was about connection"), violating the show-don't-tell principle regarding subtext. The ending summarizes the moral lesson in aphoristic taglines ("Some instruments, after all, measure distances that have no units") rather than allowing the image to resonate on its own, limiting the literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of living culture vs. preservation is coherent but stated explicitly by the narrator near the end ("culture wasn't something to be preserved in amber"). This didactic explanations flattens the subtext and reduces the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of witnessing is powerful, but the execution leans toward the didactic. The inscription on the grain ("What we witness, we carry forward") explicitly states the subtext, reducing narrative ambiguity and resonance. The final sentence further over-explains the significance rather than trusting the image to speak.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explication, particularly in the final paragraphs ("Mara understood that being broken and being blind were just different ways..."). This triggers the Thematic Echo penalty, as the story summarizes its thesis rather than letting it emerge from the dramatic action. The result feels more like a parable than a discovered truth.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of empiricism versus myth is coherent and fits the premise. It relies somewhat on explicit statements ("myths start somewhere") rather than emerging purely from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader via dialogue ("Now you know how to maintain the balance"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The moral is stated as a lesson rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of leaving mysteries untouched is coherent, but the execution leans heavily on explicit statements ("choosing to forget," "never meant to be harnessed") rather than subtext. The final line moralizes the ending, reducing the resonance of the otherwise strong final image.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of truth versus perceived madness is handled well, inverting the "cry wolf" trope so that the "lies" are merely "directions" to a reality others can't see. The ending resonates by transforming the protagonist's shame into agency, offering a satisfying conceptual repricing of his father's legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue ("Love cannot be forced...") rather than emerging from dramatic action. The core concept of "resonant awakenings" appears as expository jargon used to explain the plot mechanics rather than a thematic undercurrent.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of tending ruin into sacred space is coherent and resonant, anchored by the central metaphor of sewing. While the thematic insights are sometimes delivered via narrator assertion ("retracing one's steps wasn't defeat but wisdom") rather than subtext, the final image successfully reweights the labyrinth's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme is stated explicitly via the sundial inscription ("Time breaks all journeys...") and the narrator's final summary, leaving little room for subtext. This overt moralizing flattens the resonance, reducing the complex premise to a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of finding analog authenticity in a digital world is strong and coherent. However, the explicit articulation of the thesis ("meaning lived in the margins only if someone was brave enough to write there") right before the action is didactic and reduces the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of preserving truth through overlooked mediums ("wisdom dressed in motley") is woven well into the narrative action. The embroidery serves as a potent metaphor for the intricate, unseen connections of history and politics. The final prayer ("Let someone understand") resonates effectively, emphasizing the precarious nature of the protagonist’s legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of forgiveness and "inflection points" is resonant but articulated too explicitly in dialogue ("not in reality, but in understanding"). This thematic echoing—where a character explains the story's thesis—reduces the subtextual power of the final image. The closure lands, but the conceptual work is done by the explanation rather than the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central metaphor of translation—moving not just between languages but between "silence and speech"—is earned and resonant. The story refuses a tidy moral, acknowledging that truth "might not fix anything," which adds maturity and elevates the theme beyond a simple mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the theme is coherent, the story explicitly summarizes its moral ("joy wasn't something lost... but something that existed within it") in the final paragraphs. This didactic explanation flattens the subtext and reduces narrative resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The recursive theme is executed well visually, but the subtext is flattened by having the thematic thesis ("To know is to sleep...") written explicitly on the wall in gold leaf. This didactic moment resolves the ambiguity too neatly, telling the reader what to feel rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of preserving inner sanctity through obscurity is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. Dialogue often slips into sermonizing ("The tax collectors count your thoughts like coins"), stating the subtext aloud rather than letting it emerge organically from the action. The conceptual resonance is strong, but the verbal execution lacks subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed explicitness; phrases like "longing itself could be beautiful" articulate the thesis directly to the reader. The "Blossom Armistice" concept is poetic, but the emotional resonance is limited by the story's tendency to explain its own meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic resonance is exceptional; the story explores the cruelty of forgetting and the beauty of accidents without ever becoming didactic. The ending ("lighting a small candle of sound") offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central tension between preservation and life.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of truth structurally reinforcing itself is clever and well-integrated into the magic system. However, the thematic delivery is somewhat explicit, with the letter's text and the final dialogue stating the subtext ("truth survives distance") rather than letting the action fully carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of harmonizing conflicting values is integrated well, though the grandfather's quote is somewhat didactic. The reprise of the phrase "encrypted compassion" at the end feels a bit heavy-handed, summarizing the theme rather than letting the final image speak entirely for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of preservation versus erasure is flawlessly integrated with the props (phonograph cylinders, meteorite) and the action (cataloging). The "paper trails" concept shifts from something she destroys to something she creates, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to her conflict without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    The central metaphor of transforming confusion (mazes) into revelation (thresholds) is strong, but the final sentence explicitly defining the distance as "love" triggers a penalty for moralizing, flattening the story's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing ("not as a place to study connection, but to forge it") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. This over-articulation reduces the potential for subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of "pruning possibilities" is coherent, but the story relies on a "Thematic Echo" in the penultimate paragraph ("Some paths disappear... so we can bear the weight..."). This explicit moralizing explains the subtext rather than allowing the final image to resonate on its own, triggering a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of "ordering randomness" versus allowing "wilderness" in is threaded perfectly through character, setting, and plot. The final image of the tide reclaiming the arcade beautifully reinforces the acceptance of the ephemeral, creating a resonant Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of memory and embodiment is coherent but delivered didactically, particularly in the final paragraphs ("The nostalgia ban had tried to erase..."). The story tells the reader the moral rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the subtext of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader ("teaching a silent lesson about presence") rather than emerging from subtext. This over-articulation in the final third flattens resonance, violating the "show, don't tell" principle for thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("The moon illuminated a truth he'd been avoiding") rather than emerging from subtext. The climax relies on an uncredited paraphrase of a Leonard Cohen lyric ("crack... where light got in"), which undercuts thematic originality.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in dialogue ("The equation doesn't need to prevent divergence..."), triggering the Thematic Echo anti-pattern. The parallel selves chanting the moral in unison dissolves subtext into lecture. The ending reinforces a platitude about finding beauty in failure rather than earning resonance through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of architecture as a living memory system is inventive and well-integrated into the plot. However, the ending drifts into explicit moralizing ("she wasn't trying to prove... she was learning to dream with them"), explaining the thesis to the reader rather than allowing the resonance of the final image to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of imagination versus stasis is coherent but delivered with didactic heaviness ("The Council believed this was causing a spiritual drought"). The final mirror explicitly stating the theme ("What else could you be?") reduces subtext to a direct message.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of redemption is handled with sophistication, avoiding easy moralizing for a complex, impermanent truth. The final definition of peace—as a pause rather than a cure—feels earned by the specific mechanics of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves strong resonance by recontextualizing "preserving the echo" from biological conservation to the transient art of deliberate ruin. The ending successfully lands a complex thematic idea without resorting to a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit labels ("lullaby of conformity," "erasure of individual will") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. This over-articulation flattens nuance, explaining the meaning to the reader rather than allowing resonance to build through specific, unstated implications.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of complexity versus caricature is central, but the protagonist articulates the thesis explicitly ("Ethical storytelling... meant holding space") near the end. This didactic statement flattens the subtext, explaining the epiphany rather than letting the action carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of "interrupted cadence" and honoring the ephemeral is woven beautifully through the imagery. However, the text occasionally explains its own thesis ("They said: someone noticed," "some truths lived best in structures designed to vanish") rather than trusting the reader to infer the philosophy solely from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of memory, loss, and the transformation of grief into art is handled with sensitivity and grace. The concept of "transcribed memory" integrates organically with the emotional arc, leading to a resonant, if slightly sentimental, conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.6)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph to deliver its message ("taught her its secret... choice and destiny weren't opposites"). This didactic summary replaces subtextual resonance with a explained thesis, significantly flattening the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of "devotion across time" is coherent but articulated through heavy-handed summation ("old regime of ancient wisdom," "new age of modern science") rather than subtext. The emotional resonance leans on the sentimental idea of a "covenant" rather than a complex earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of releasing resentment is delivered didactically through narrator explanation ("Resentment was their fuel," "Shifting grace..."), leaving little room for subtextual resonance. The story explicitly interprets its own symbols for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of navigating boundaries rather than erasing them is resonant and tightly woven into the mirror-making metaphor. The final image successfully crystallizes the concept, though the closing sentence explicitly stating the moral reduces the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.3)
    The "deciduous vows" concept is brilliant, reweighting the premise from broken promises to necessary shedding. The theme lands with precision in the final image, avoiding simple moralizing by grounding the lesson in the physical craft and the surrounding nature.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of nonlinear knowledge is coherent, but the ending drifts into explicit moralizing ("learning that some things couldn't be curated..."). The resonance is slightly undercut by the text's need to explain the thematic takeaways in the final paragraphs rather than letting the imagery speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    The concept of "unlearned lessons" is intellectually stimulating, but the thematic execution leans on explicit statement ("Knowledge doesn't grow in isolation") rather than subtext. The ending moralizes the theme instead of letting it resonate through a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of memory as a negotiable narrative is resonant and well-developed through the ship's shifting reality. However, the ending explicitly articulating the "freedom of stories" feels slightly didactic, summarizing the theme rather than letting the final image of the fleet speak entirely for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of architecture as narrative is coherent and woven throughout, but the delivery is often didactic, explaining the meaning to the reader ("telling its own fable of absence") rather than letting it emerge from the action. The ending articulates the thesis clearly but lacks the resonance of an ambiguous or hard-won insight.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of finding peace within trauma is coherent but culminates in explicit moralizing ("Sometimes the path to peace lay in learning to read..."). The final paragraphs explain the subtext rather than allowing the image of the "bloom of hush" to resonate on its own, flattening the potential emotional impact into a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is coherent but delivered didactically through explicit statements ("coincidences were simply meaning") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The story tells the reader what to feel about the patterns rather than allowing the dramatic action to prove the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The themes of recursive memory and "preemptive nostalgia" lock together satisfyingly at the closure. The story effectively dramatizes the cost of archiving—becoming the thing preserved—transforming the protagonist's initial trait into a literal fate.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in dialogue ("We came here to defy the gravity of hopelessness"), violating the standard for subtext by lecturing the reader. This "thematic echo" flattens the resonance, converting what should be a dramatic realization into a stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme is coherent but over-articulated in dialogue ("texture of time," "transition periods"), violating the show-don't-tell principle for subtext. This explicit thematizing flattens the potential resonance into a stated lesson rather than an earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of self-hospitality vs. protective withdrawal is resonant and well-threaded. However, the explicit articulation of the theme ("But what about hospitality to yourself?") and the literal labeling of the shattered jar's contents lean slightly towards moralizing, reducing subtextual mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in dialogue ("Silence isn't the absence of noise..."), which flattens subtext into instruction. The emotional resonance is asserted through these summary statements rather than emerging organically from the friction of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    The inversion of "ascension" is a strong core concept, but the execution relies on heavy-handed explication in the final paragraphs ("Not up—down... Not ruling others, but serving memory itself"). This didactic summary flattens the subtext, telling the reader the theme instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("breath is something you do for yourself") rather than emerging from subtext. This sermonizing approach flattens the narrative into a parable, leaving little room for ambiguity or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story brilliantly maps the trauma of "hollow guarantees" onto the physics of diamond formation, creating a resonant Conceptual Repricing. The ending recontextualizes the protagonist's suffering as necessary pressure for transformation, landing the theme with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of silence as testimony is resonant and well-integrated into the plot mechanics. The execution becomes overly explicit in the final paragraphs ("silences in family histories are themselves a kind of testimony"), converting subtext into text, but the core concept lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of agency within determinism ("whether you moved with eyes open or closed") is sophisticated and lands with resonance. The subtext of the strings—representing duty, fate, or history—is handled with enough ambiguity to remain intriguing without becoming heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of archival witness and the remediation of historical erasure is handled with resonance and dignity. The ending effectively reweights the tragedy of the separation with the "small kindness" of the correction.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is heavily explicated through narration ("The tyranny wasn't dramatic... It was softer") rather than emerging solely from action. The ending monologue explicitly summarizes the thesis ("She'd hold the line... not with dramatic gestures"), which flattens the subtext and resonance by telling the reader exactly what to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    The concept of "negative space" is successfully dramatized through action, not just exposition. The ending achieves resonance by reframing the prophecy rather than solving it mechanistically.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of severance and repair are coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("It spoke of the Severance... but also of repair") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending resonates conceptually but lacks emotional weight due to the summary delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of finding order in chaos is coherent but delivered didactically through the Admiral's note, which explicitly explains the story's thesis ("To befriend uncertainty... is to navigate by stars you cannot see"). This "Thematic Echo" (a character stating the prompt's theme) flattens the subtext, doing the heavy lifting that dramatized action should have performed.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of kintsugi and healing is resonant, particularly in the final image of the candle. However, the dialogue articulates the thesis too explicitly ("Everything breaks... the gold makes it stronger"), drifting into sermonizing that undercuts the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.4)
    The interplay between the broken instrument and the broken soul is masterful, avoiding easy sentimentality. The thematic argument—that healing requires harmonizing with distortion rather than fixing it—resonates powerfully in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central question of quantifying mercy is compelling, though the dialogue "Mercy has no formula" tilts slightly into explicit moralizing. The ending image successfully grounds this abstract theme in the physical act of rooting, offering a resonant answer rather than just a statement.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is coherent but articulated too explicitly in dialogue ("unfasten your assumptions... honoring what exists"), which flattens subtext into instruction. The message is delivered rather than emerging organically from the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of memory and preservation are coherent, but the story relies on explicit summarization ("Marcus understood that some burdens...") to convey its meaning. This didactic approach in the final paragraphs flattens the subtext, telling the reader what to feel rather than letting the imagery resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of embracing chaos over stagnant perfection resonates, but the ending relies on an explicit moral statement ("awakening always feels like falling...") that summarizes the theme rather than trusting the image. This slightly flattens the subtextual power of the library’s rotation.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of integrating brokenness into beauty is resonant, but the execution leans heavily on the character explicitly articulating the thesis in his journal. This direct statement ("This baroque excess isn't wealth display...") reduces subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of "mending what isn't torn" is coherent but delivered through explicit summary and labeled concepts ("tinkersong wonder") rather than emergent subtext. The ending leans into moralizing, explaining the meaning rather than letting it resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of "explanations failing" is seamlessly woven into the plot and character action, not just stated. The contrast between the factory's concrete extraction and the lagoon's liquid mystery provides a powerful thematic substrate. The ending resonates deeply without moralizing, offering a pure experience of the sublime.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme is consistent but is undermined by the final paragraph, which explicitly summarizes the "lesson" ("strongest structures don't hide their history"). This overt moralizing flattens the subtext and triggers the deduction for thesis statements replacing scenic resonance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story suffers from an explicit Thematic Echo; the grandmother's postcard text ("That's knowing your own sky") states the thesis directly, removing ambiguity and resonance. The subtext is made text, reducing the ending's power.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme is resonant but occasionally overwritten; phrases like "tension between what power claimed and what justice demanded" articulate the thesis too explicitly, reducing subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central concept of "truth over illusion" is cohesive, but the ending explicitly moralizes ("hardest alchemy was transforming death into honest life"), flattening subtext into a lecture. The thematic resonance relies on stated lessons rather than emergent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of preserving emotional echoes is coherent and resonates through the imagery of the wax cylinders. However, the delivery is somewhat didactic, relying on dialogue ("You learned to listen...") to explicitly state the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of stasis versus chaos is well-integrated, but the penultimate paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("by understanding that borrowed time must always be returned"). This explanation flattens the earned resonance of the final image and triggers the deduction for explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is delivered heavily, particularly in the penultimate paragraph which explicitly summarizes the "wisdom of human judgment over algorithms." This overt moralizing flattens the subtext and violates the show-don't-tell principle regarding the story's central argument.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme is handled didactically, with the narrative explicitly stating the moral ("surrender itself was a kind of strength") in the final paragraph, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. Resonance is asserted through essayistic reflection rather than emerging organically from action.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized through the letter ("what we don't say becomes the ghost that haunts us"), converting subtext into text. This on-the-nose articulation in the climax flattens the narrative resonance, reducing the story to a parable with a stated moral rather than an exploration of complex human experience.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of memory versus fluid time is coherent but delivered heavily through dialogue, particularly in the final speech ("mysteries anticipated are different from mysteries lived"). This overt moralizing in the closure undercut the potential for implicit, resonant meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("The incomplete... is where light enters"), which flattens the subtext into a lecture. The thematic epiphany paraphrases a well-known Leonard Cohen lyric ("There is a crack in everything..."), reducing the sense of earned, original insight.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the final diary entry ("The temple taught me that we don't care for nature..."), reducing the narrative resonance to a direct moral lesson. This violates the subtext rule; the story articulates its thesis rather than letting it emerge from the dramatic action. The ending tells the reader exactly what to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of "impossible return" is woven masterfully through the fly amber, the muddy path, and the dialogue. The distinction between "preserving" a moment (amber) and "inhabiting" the loss (walking) offers a nuanced, non-binary resolution. The ending resonates powerfully without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of reclamation is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, particularly in the final paragraphs where the protagonist explicitly articulates the moral ("battlefields becoming gardens," "redemption"). The subtext of the "submerged concord" is engaging, but the on-page explanation flattens the potential resonance into a thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and narration ("space between people was just fear given measurement"), rendering it didactic. The story moralizes about connection rather than letting the resonance emerge organically from the action, and the "riddle" serves as a sermon rather than a narrative engine.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is consistently developed but heavily explicit. The narrator explains the symbolism directly ("perfect metaphor for her existence") and the final sentence delivers a sermonizing moral that summarizes the thesis ("True north was wherever you stood...") rather than allowing the image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing in the final dialogue ("The best thieves... give it away"), flattening subtext into a moral lesson. The story asserts its meaning through the mentor's speech rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of preserving "small gestures" against "grand narratives" is consistent and touching, though the execution leans heavily on explicit statement in dialogue ("Someone needs to remember the small things"). The symbolism of the chessboard is apt but slightly didactic. The story succeeds in creating a "luminous absence," but the subtext is often converted into text, reducing its resonant power.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "reflection vs. refraction" as a metaphor for self-actualization is effectively dramatized. The explicitly stated realization ("She had been trying to understand the shape of home") slightly undercuts the power of the imagery, which had already conveyed this idea more subtly. The thematic resolution is nevertheless resonant and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The thematic braid of chess (perfection) vs. weaving (imperfection) is excellent. However, the subtext is made overly explicit by the decoded message spelling out "FORGIVE" and the narrator's subsequent summary of the moral, which reduces the potential for lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.4)
    The central metaphor of truth as a prism rather than a point is executed with precision. The story avoids preachy moralizing by embedding the theme in the physical reality of the world (the echoes). The final semantic shift ("forgive" to "forge") offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central dramatic question.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. Having the statue explicitly articulate the thesis ("This is how you transmute loss... by honoring every wound") removes ambiguity and reduces subtextual resonance. The narrative relies on telling the reader the moral rather than letting the imagery of the golden scars speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    The core theme is beautifully enacted by the shell painting, but the ending over-articulates the lesson ("nostalgia was just another form of distance"). This explicit moralizing in the final paragraph flattens the subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures in dialogue and narration ("Sometimes the fiercest love speaks most quietly") rather than emerging from subtext. The story moralizes heavily, explaining its own meaning to the reader instead of allowing the dramatic action to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central concept of migration toward "temporal density" is profound and resonates well with the imagery. However, the score is capped because the protagonist explicitly articulates the theme in dialogue ("They're trying to build it backward..."), converting subtext into text and reducing the final ambiguity's power.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of "useful fictions" is intelligent, but the ending succumbs to explicit moralizing ("She understood now that rationality...") instead of trusting the image of the reconciled father to carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of "borrowed memories" and the keeper's role as a guardian of unfinished stories is integrated organically into the plot. The Edelweiss functions well as a tangible symbol of survival and continuity, anchoring the abstract concepts in a physical object.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of permission vs. obligation is salient, but the execution becomes didactic in the final paragraphs. The story explicitly explains the lesson ("lonely wasn't the same as settled," "permissions finally granted") rather than trusting the imagery and action to convey the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue by the grotto ("You dreamed yourself here because..."), violating the show-don't-tell principle. This "thematic echo" flattens the subtext into a moral lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is coherent but articulated through "Thematic Echo" (soapboxing) where the protagonist explicitly explains the moral ("revalue everything," "light as testimony"). Subtext is displaced by text; the meaning is stated rather than emerging from action.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of memory and narrative is coherent but undercut by explicit telling, particularly the final summary ("memory was just another story"). Relying on a direct thematic statement at the closure replaces the resonance of an image or action, flattening the potential emotional impact into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is explicitly summarized in the final paragraphs ("marking time not by what was lost..."), which flattens potential resonance into a lecture. The subtext is crowded out by the character articulating the story's thesis directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("I am not my fear") and a final-paragraph summary that moralizes the experience ("learned that everything... could be transformed"). This didactic approach flattens subtext and prevents the story from achieving organic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of "imperfect miracles" and the weight of words resonates well in the final image of the out-of-season blossoms. The "frozen river" metaphor connects the protagonist's internal state to the external conflict efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story explicitly articulates its themes through the narrator and dialogue ("Words... are the first cosmic illusion," "separation... was the grandest illusion"), leaving little room for subtext. This over-explanation turns the climax into a philosophical summary rather than an earned, resonant experience.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of imposing order on chaos is well-developed through the "shepherd" metaphor. The ending resonates, though the explicit statement about "humanity's desperate agreement" in the penultimate paragraph leans slightly into telling rather than trusting the powerful subtext of the action itself.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but overt; the dialogue explicitly explains the subtext ("It's a physical metaphor... For letting go"). This didactic approach flattens the resonance, leaving little work for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of probability versus possibility is central but handled didactically, with the narrative explicitly summarizing the "lucid contradictions" rather than letting them emerge solely through action. The climax delivers the theme textually ("WIDEN YOUR VIEW"), which reduces subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of connection is strong, but the story relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the protagonist and caller explicitly state the thesis ("teaching endings how to begin"). This articulation reduces subtextual power, making the moral feel slightly instructed rather than solely experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is explicitly articulated in dialogue ("We steep ourselves..."), reducing subtext to text and resulting in a lecture-like resolution. The story relies on characters explaining the meaning of the events rather than allowing the meaning to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and narration ("cured of loneliness," "mutual aid began with aiding each other"), leaving little room for subtext. The ending leans heavily into moralizing, summarizing the lesson for the reader rather than allowing the imagery and action to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "mapping absence" is cohesive and resonates through the final image. The connection between the sister’s song and the "stillpoint" earns the emotional payout. The execution is slightly aphoristic ("maps must be drawn in the language of absence"), but the core concept holds together well.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of reality as a "palimpsest" is exceptionally well-integrated, merging the physical plot with the philosophical argument. The transition from interpreting noise to writing signals offers a profound comment on agency and perception. The ending resonates without becoming didactic, fulfilling the story's promise.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue ("Your silence is singing") rather than subtext. The narrative leans into sentimental inspiration tropes regarding disability, offering a tidy resolution to complex isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme is poignant but undercut by explicit moralizing in the penultimate section ("love... had always been worth fighting for"). The story would be stronger if it trusted the dramatized parallel between the tapestry and the grandmother's erasure without the summarizing thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    The central theme of shared consciousness is coherent, but the ending suffers from explicit moralizing. Marquez's dialogue ("Maybe that's the discovery") articulates the thesis too directly (Thematic Echo), reducing the resonant power of the final image by explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through didactic dialogue at the end rather than emerging organically from the action. The "lesson" about listening versus seeing feels lectured rather than earned through dramatic experience.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative explicates its themes ("silent empathy made visible," "teach darkness the value") rather than allowing them to emerge from action. This heavy-handed telling flattens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme is coherent but delivered didactically through dialogue ("This town runs on routines," "Amplified quiet is louder than shouting"). The story tells the reader what it means rather than allowing the subtext to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in both dialogue ("The island only appears for those brave enough to change") and narration ("liberation of finally embracing their true nature"). This overt moralizing in the final paragraph prevents genuine subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the exploration of grief is poignant, the dialogue line &quot;Because grief needs witnesses&quot; explicitly states the story's thesis, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. This moment flattens the subtext into text, explaining the theme rather than trusting the dramatized emotion of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of fluid versus fixed meaning is delivered through on-the-nose dialogue and narration ("translation into fixed meaning destroys..."). The story sermonizes its thesis rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext or ambiguity. The dichotomy is presented as a simple binary without nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but resolves into an explicit moral statement in the final paragraphs ("proof that being broken..."), which triggers the penalty for replacing resonance with summary. The concept of "bartered awakenings" is stated but the emotional price is not dramatized sufficiently to carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of connection is poignant but undercut by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("found something precious after all") which summarizes meaning rather than allowing it to resonate. The prompt attribute "powerfully gentle" disrupts the subtext, appearing as an oxymoron that feels inserted rather than organic to the character's demeanor.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("We're not making jewelry... We're making permission to feel") rather than emerging from subtext. This overt moralizing, particularly the line "teach withering to bloom," reduces the complex emotion to a lesson, triggering the penalty for thematic echoing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is articulated through explicit dialogue and narration ("the things people treasured most had no monetary value until..."), which reduces subtextual resonance. The story tends to preach its message about ancient wisdom versus modern tech rather than letting it emerge organically.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of transcendence versus humanity is resonant and well-integrated. The final insight—that wisdom is forbidden because it is true/dangerous—effectively reweights the narrative, though the delivery leans heavily on expository summary.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit statements ("shared dreams weren't preserving hope—they were killing it") rather than subtext. The moralizing explanation in the middle and end reduces the resonant power of the "shadow unbound" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme is handled heavily; the story explicitly explains its metaphors ("skin lay crumpled... like discarded certainty," "Growth by shedding layers"). By telling the reader exactly how to interpret the symbolism in the final paragraph, the narrative robs the ending of resonance and reduces subtext to surface-level statement.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of scars as stories and nature as a witness is woven thoroughly into the narrative logic without feeling preachy. The final image of christening the frozen hourglass with blood effectively synthesizes the motifs of stopped time, trauma, and the price of truth.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of unexpressed emotion is consistent but delivered with a heavy hand, relying on explicit statements ("love itself as a tangible substance") rather than subtext. The ending leans into moralizing ("needed to know... unuttered love had mattered").

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of embracing imperfection is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue and narration ("falling itself is a kind of freedom," "Create") rather than emerging organically from the action. The text relies on stating its thesis directly to the reader, reducing subtext to near zero. This didactic approach flattens the potential for nuance or interpretive depth.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of cultivating hope is resonant, but the subtext is flattened by the book entry ("Where she passes, the burned world remembers how to hope"), which explicitly states the thesis near the end. This "Thematic Echo" reduces the reader's work and caps the score, despite the strong final image.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statement rather than subtext, particularly in the ending ("The forest was a mirror... architecture of his own expanded consciousness"). This over-explanation resolves the metaphor for the reader, preventing organic thematic resonance. The phrase "probable miracles" feels like an inserted label rather than an emergent truth.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("What you've lost isn't your dog..."), which robs the story of subtext and nuance. By having the guides articulate the moral thesis directly, the narrative explains its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of shared sacrifice is potent, but the ending explicitly articulates the moral ("The cost of safety... was that someone always paid it"), which flattens the resonance of the final image. This explicit summarization triggers a penalty for explaining the theme rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme of truth surfacing is handled with heavy-handed literalism ("truth... would always find its way back to light"). The ending relies on a summarizing moral statement rather than allowing the resonance to emerge organically from the action. The "rune of drift" resolves the thematic tension mechanically rather than conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story explicitly spells out its theme in the climax ("WATER REMEMBERS"), violating the principle of subtext and reducing the narrative resonance to a literal message.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern; the stones literally spell out the theme ("Remember what you were..."), and the protagonist immediately unpacks it in a didactic internal monologue. This leaves no room for subtext, converting the narrative into a lecture on the nature of rebellion rather than an experienced truth.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of evolving tradition is coherent but delivered via didactic exposition from the plant voices. While the final image of the spores is resonant, the text over-explains the "moral" of symbiosis, reducing subtextual room for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of transforming grief is coherent but is undercut by the final paragraph, which explicitly defines the metaphor ("The pearl of stillness was this..."). This summary statement replaces earned resonance with didactic telling.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story leans too heavily on explicit thematic statements in the final third (e.g., "wholeness was the actual illusion"). This overt moralizing flattens the subtext, resolving complex ambiguity into a stated thesis rather than letting the imagery resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    The integration of the "disappearing ink" mechanic with the theme of time perception is masterful. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central thematic question, allowing the "stretched time" of the crisis to become the final shared reality of the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central theme of memory and survival is legible but handled heavily, with the text explicitly stating the thematic question ("What do we owe the truth...") rather than letting it emerge organically. The symbolism at the end ("liberated ash") leans toward the melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of "continuity through chaos" is woven seamlessly into the mechanics of the story (inculcating plants). The ending image—light breaking through dust as the weapon is put away—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. Subtext in the dialogue ("hunting different things") is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The exploration of raw versus translated emotion is compelling and woven well through the imagery. However, the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the thematic takeaway ("proof that..."), transforming potential resonance into a didactic explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The "orbit of regret" metaphor successfully unifies the astronomical setting with the narrative arc. The final transformation of the circle to an ascending spiral offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of legacy and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative leans heavily into explicit moralizing, particularly with the final italicized letter that spells out the theme ("The only way forward is to tether yourself..."). This didactic conclusion flattens the subtext and reduces the story's resonant potential to a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of memory and erasure is handled with sophistication, avoiding simple nostalgia. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question—that art provides a "framework" for meaning rather than the meaning itself. A standout conceptual close.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes are articulated through narrator exposition rather than emerging organically from action (e.g., "This was her gentle radicalism: to weaponize empathy"). This reliance on telling reduces the subtextual power, converting potential resonance into a direct statement of intent.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    The themes of memory, art, and time are coherent and land with a clear, if somewhat sentimental, resolution. However, the lack of struggle makes the thematic argument—that art anchors existence—feel asserted rather than proven through the narrative arc. The ending offers closure but lacks deep subtextual friction.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of "body-memory" is coherent, but the conclusion relies on a summary statement ("hope crystallized") that feels unearned by the preceding low-pressure action.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is articulated explicitly rather than emerging from subtext, particularly in the final paragraph which summarizes the moral ("proof that loneliness could end..."). This overtly didactic conclusion triggers the Thematic Echo penalty, as it replaces resonance with an explained thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story relies heavily on explicit moralizing, with characters and narration directly explaining the theme ("Time moves differently when we know...") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. The ending reduces the narrative to a stated lesson ("The truth hadn't unraveled after all"), preventing genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly defined for the reader ("Fixing what's broken, he understood now, meant recognizing...") rather than emerging from subtext. This didactic explanation at the climax reduces thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    The palimpsest theme is integrated beautifully, moving from a static concept to a dynamic realization via the needle. The reinterpretation of the needle—from a tool of deletion to a tool of "making space"—is a profound thematic turn that resonates without preaching. The final image of stars as "punctuation marks" deftly recharges the writing motif at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("Kindness accumulates like honey") and reiterated in the final paragraph, resulting in a sermon rather than a story. This overt moralizing replaces narrative subtext and fails the requirement for a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme is coherent but the ending relies on explicit summarization ("Different methods, same purpose: finding the right combination...") rather than trusting the image to resonate. This explanation of the metaphor in the final paragraph reduces subtextual power and triggers the thematic statement penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through the text of the book ("You are not broken. You are a bridge"), violating the show-don't-tell principle for subtext. This overt moralizing in the climax flattens the resonance, leaving little work for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of connection through shared brokenness is handled with nuance, effectively anchoring the "sacred geometry" concept in the specific imagery of the nest and threads.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of reality-as-game is well-integrated, and the ending ("outwitting... one frequency at a time") offers a resonant, non-tidy image of ongoing maintenance rather than total victory.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of "spatial mutiny" is compelling but delivered through explicit naming and exposition rather than subtextual emergence. The ending leans into moralizing ("The city would learn to move again") which flattens the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of empathy transcending physical recognition is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition in the final paragraphs ("The deepest truth: we recognize..."). The story tells the reader the moral rather than letting the resonance emerge organically.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of "reversible exile" and stepping sideways out of catastrophe is compelling and well-integrated into the plot. The ending resonates with the premise, offering a conceptual repricing of "disappearance" as an act of bravery rather than cowardice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit dialogue ("trapped in low resolution") and narration rather than emerging organically from action. The concept of "pixelated amnesty" is explained to the reader rather than felt through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of currency as territorial markers rather than wealth is sophisticated and lands with emotional weight. The mapping of the startup's rise/fall onto the cycles of robbery creates a cohesive worldview that elevates the specific plot points into a broader commentary on value and borders.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of shared burdens is coherent, but the story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("Ashwin's final lesson understood at last," "nothing changes alone"). This summarizing narration replaces subtextual resonance, triggering the penalty for thematic explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.6)
    The thematic work with the mirror and seeds is strong, but the ending suffers from explicit moralizing. The final dialogue ("The truth that people are not lost—they simply refuse to unbend...") articulates the thesis directly, triggering the Thematic Echo/Sermonizing penalty and flattening the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in the text ("The intersection wasn't a place but a state of being"), which flattens resonance by explaining the meaning to the reader. The concept of "depth vs. breadth" is interesting but is told through summary rather than emerging organically from the struggle. This reliance on thesis statements limits subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme—that wholeness requires darkness—is not preached but demonstrated through the failure of the magic and the logic of the setting. The final image serves as a resonant answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of authenticity is well-integrated into the premise, but the story suffers from a "Thematic Echo" where the protagonist explicitly articulates the subtext in dialogue. This over-explanation flattens the resonance of the final image, stating what should have been left to the reader's intuition.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story explicitly articulates its thesis in the final paragraphs ("The physics of transition were simple after all..."), triggering a significant penalty for Thematic Echo. This didactic approach replaces earned resonance with a lecture on the story's moral, flattening the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme is beautifully illustrated through the mobile and the gears, but the dialogue explicitly articulates the thesis ("wonder needs only the unknown, not the future"). This thematic echo reduces the subtextual power of the ending, triggering a deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized through the text in the shell ("survival isn't living"), violating the "show, don't tell" principle. The story relies on stating the moral directly rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext or action.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.3)
    The story suffers from heavy-handed Thematic Echo; the protagonist explicitly writes the theme ("What if forgiveness isn't a destination...") on the wall, and the narrator reiterates it in the final paragraph. This sermonizing replaces earned subtext with stated moral instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thematic pivot—recontextualizing the grandmother’s gullibility as a desperate, conscious choice for connection—is poignant and successfully executed. This insight elevates the story above a standard fetch quest, offering a nuanced take on pride and loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of propagation is coherent but didactic. Having the plants explicitly articulate the moral ("Propagate the truth") and the narrator explain the symbolism reduces subtextual depth, making the message feel delivered rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding permanence in transience ("endings could still hold light") is resonant and clearly articulated through the imagery. The story stays focused on this central idea, though the execution leans slightly toward sentimental assertion rather than complex, subtextual discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story relies on an explicit sermon to deliver its theme ("the source you seek is the seeking itself"), which triggers the penalty for summarizing the thesis in dialogue at the climax. This didactic approach flattens the subtext, replacing earned resonance with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of embracing nuance is coherent but delivered somewhat heavily through dialogue. Characters explicitly articulate the story’s thesis ("welcome nuance into certainty," "offering questions instead of answers"), which reduces subtextual power. A −0.4 adjustment is applied for this thematic echo, though the central mirror/chime metaphors provide a nice counterbalance to the exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic core—that one must understand manifestation to understand dissolution—is clever and resonant. The delivery is somewhat didactic, with the researcher explicitly articulating the moral ("delayed revelation... is cultivation") rather than allowing it to emerge purely from the student’s realization.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.1)
    The themes of memory and resonance are coherent but delivered through explicit sermonizing ("maps showed only space, not time") rather than subtext. The ending resonates with the premise but feels intellectually constructed rather than emotionally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of presence versus efficiency is resonant but over-articulated. The text explicitly explains the lesson ("The point was the doing... teaching her to notice") rather than trusting the imagery of the glowing stone and mist to carry the subtext, which reduces the lingering power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "color of sound" theme is resonant and beautifully visualized, but the ending leans into explicit interpretation ("proven correct") rather than trusting the image. The conceptual repricing of the lanterns is effective, though slightly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The parallel between extinct civilizations' currency and humanity's final transformation creates deep resonance. The shift from prediction to instruction offers a satisfying, non-literal answer to the story's central question about entropy.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central metaphor of the map is structurally sound but over-explained in the final paragraphs ("But if she named it..."), converting potential subtext into explicit text. This didactic tendency flattens the resonance, telling the reader what the symbols mean rather than letting them signify.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of "lukewarm" competence finding its necessary niche is resonant and tightly woven into the resolution without feeling moralizing. The metaphysical concept of the ocean's debt ("trying to give something back") lands with earned conceptual weight and recontextualizes the setting details.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of memory as a form of resurrection is resonant, culminating in a satisfying conceptual repricing of the ruins. However, the subtext is frequently made text through Eleanor’s dialogue ("stories without witnesses become lies"), which explains the theme rather than allowing it to emerge solely from the shared vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is clearly articulated but delivered didactically, particularly in the final paragraph which explicitly summarizes the moral (&quot;proved they had always been harmonized&quot;). This overt moralizing replaces subtextual resonance, flattening the potential for ambiguity or deeper insight. The handkerchief serves as a tidy symbol rather than a complex thematic vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of bearing witness is coherent and lands with a solid resonant image at the end. The "watcher's burden" concept is integrated well, though the story leans on explicit statement of these themes ("The trees remember, even if we don't") rather than leaving them entirely to subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of "complementary opposites" is organic to the plot and resolution, avoiding heavy-handed moralizing. The ending achieves a resonant synthesis, answering the central question of wholeness through the specific mechanics of the characters' fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of "refusing the puzzle" is a sophisticated subversion of genre expectations, offering a resonant Conceptual Repricing of the mystery from a game to a trap. The ending reinforces this theme effectively without didactic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story achieves resonance through the central image, but the final two paragraphs explicitly sermonize the theme ("Martin understood... you don't stop time"). This diagnostic summary explains the metaphor instead of letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of memory, duty, and identity are coherent and resonate through the imagery. The explicit statement of "making friends with uncertainty" feels slightly imposed as a thesis rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of "creative destruction" is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed explicitness, particularly in the final paragraph ("hopelessness was just another ingredient"). The story tells the reader exactly what to think rather than allowing the subtext to emerge organically from the action. This didactic approach limits thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies heavily on explicit moralizing to convey its theme, particularly in the final paragraphs ("silence wasn't absence," "every ending was simply a beginning"). The subtext is suffocated by these explanations. A higher score would require the imagery and action to carry the resonance without the narrator stepping in to summarize the lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.5)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit statements ("tension between what was and what might be") that explain the meaning to the reader. The ending asserts a conceptual change ("permanently transient no longer") but fails to dramatize the emotional weight of that loss.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is legible but delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("geometric proof that connection thrives..."). The story tells the reader exactly what to think via the placard and the concluding summary, effectively removing subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    The synthesis of the anchor (a symbol of human past/stability) with the alien starlight creates a powerful thematic resonance. The ending image effectively answers the central question of navigation without resorting to a stated moral, anchoring the theme in concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit summation ("That was the thing about hearts...") rather than emerging organically from the action. The text explains its metaphors ("not the medical kind") instead of trusting the reader to interpret the speculative conceit, flattening the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of "unremembered labor" is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The ending explicitly summarizes the moral ("monument... in understanding"), flattening the resonance that the image alone could have carried.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of finding "wisdom from failure" is undercut by the twist that Mira’s math was actually perfect; she finds exoneration, not wisdom in error. The "static" metaphor works well, but the final message leans into explicit moralizing ("Some things don't need repair... They need reinterpretation").

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of translation—converting lost texture into living sound—is executed with high resonance and poetic integrity. The ending image of the canyon singing the history of the Velathi offers a satisfying, non-literal answer to the problem of cultural extinction.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of accepting transformation over fearing contamination is resonant, though the pivotal dialogue ("What if it's actually beautiful?") is slightly too on-the-nose, stating the subtext aloud. The ending image recovers this by dramatizing the bloom rather than explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme relies on a binary opposition between mechanical/bad and magical/good, resolving into a tidy moral about remembering to dream. While coherent, the thematic argument is asserted through narration and magical results rather than emerging from complex human experience. The "heart rhythms" connection feels imposed to satisfy a prompt requirement rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    Thematic resonance is dampened by overt explication in the interior monologue ("connection finds a way," "absence spoke louder"), leaving little room for subtextual discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated by the narrator ("silence not as absence but as possibility," "ruin into revelation") rather than emerging organically. This over-articulation in the final paragraphs reduces interpretive depth and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit thesis statements ("Stories weren't abstract") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending reinforces this stated philosophy without adding complex resonance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is undercut by explicit moralizing ("Dreams run when you stop believing"), which reduces complex longing to a trite belief mechanic. This didacticism flattens the subtext and explains the mystery rather than letting it resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered via explicit exposition rather than subtext; Mara literally reads the theme aloud from a book ("The city is alive... every locked door a fear"). This "explain-everything" approach flattens the resonance, turning the discovery into a lecture. The connection between the sister's vanishing and the city's nature is told, not shown through the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The thematic repricing of memory from "canned" artifact to consumable nourishment is profound. While the explicit articulation ("Vera understood now...") leans slightly into essayistic summary, the "jam" metaphor anchors the concept beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the dialogue ("brokenness has architecture") and summarized in the final paragraph ("resilience grows quietly..."), removing subtextual resonance. The ending reduces the narrative to a fable with a stated moral, triggering the specific penalty for sermonizing endings.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of preserving wonder is coherent but delivered didactically, with the narrative explicitly stating the stakes for humanity. The story relies on asserting the value of the concept rather than generating subtextual resonance through ambiguity or complex emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of excavation versus exorcism is coherent, though delivered through explicit assertion ("secrets buried in silence were the hardest graves to open") rather than subtextual drama. The final image of names becoming light offers a pleasant, albeit slightly sentimental, thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    The core theme of the map updating itself is strong, but it is undermined by explicit didactic statements ("It was asking") and the overly literal symbolism of cracks forming a "question mark," which flattens the mystery into a puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme is poignant but undercut by explicit moralizing in the climax ("The physics of letting go... was about accepting"). This "telling" of the epiphany flattens the subtext and resolves the ambiguity that the story worked to build.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of connection is consistent but delivered through on-the-nose statements ("I exist... I am alone") and sentimental resolutions. Subtext is largely replaced by explicit declaration of the ghost's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but delivered heavily through Thematic Echo. The diary entries explicitly state the story's moral ("serving others with genuine attention could transform grief") rather than allowing it to emerge solely from the protagonist's experience, which flattens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of atmospheric memory is resonant, but the text explicitly states its thesis ("Empty wasn't empty; absence was a kind of presence") near the end, reducing subtextual power. The connection between the grandfather's death and the sky's archive is touching and well-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "limits vs. gifts" is resonant, supported by the empty book safe and the ghost-coin. However, the final sentence explicitly states the moral ("Some limits... define us"), which deflates the tension of the final image and triggers the thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.0)
    The starling murmurations provide a resonant, non-literal counterpoint to the rigid cartography, effectively mirroring the protagonist's realization about the necessity of hiding patterns. The integration of "mapping meaning" elevates the ending beyond a simple puzzle-solve, offering a conceptual repricing of the apprentice's role.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is coherent but delivered through explicit statements rather than subtext. The ending leans into moralizing ("Perhaps perfection wasn't the point"), which flattens the resonance of the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story ends with a "Thematic Echo" where the protagonist explicitly states the moral ("respite isn't a place") in dialogue. This didactic approach flattens the subtext and resolves the theme through assertion rather than resonant action.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of responsibility and the "butterfly effect" of small choices is consistent and resonant. The "lullaby" motif works well to humanize the abstract mechanism. However, the resonance is slightly dampened by the reliance on repeated keywords to assert significance rather than letting the subtext emerge organically from action.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.6)
    The story relies on a heavy-handed Thematic Echo in the final paragraph, explicitly summarizing the moral ("not a burden, but a gift... broken in its purpose, but it saved"). This overt explanation flattens the resonance of the final image, substituting assertion for subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of connection through divergence is resonant, but the execution is heavy-handed. The text explicitly decodes its own symbolism ("it was the physical manifestation of connection born from separation"), converting subtext into text and reducing the reader's participatory role in the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "absence as potential" is intelligent and subverts the typical "light/illumination" trope effectively. However, the subtext is frequently made text through explicit dialogue ("The place where stories begin isn't a location... It's an absence"), which reduces the interpretive resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of processing trauma—smoothing it rather than erasing it—is handled with nuance and grace. The metaphor of "kneading" memory aligns perfectly with the protagonist's vocation. The ending resonates well, circling back to the weeping walls with a transformed understanding of grief.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("She understood that her role... was about conducting the future") rather than emergent resonance. The story lectures the reader on its meaning instead of trusting the dramatic action to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing ("proving that nothing was ever truly lost") rather than subtextual resonance. The final paragraph summarizes the thesis, flattening the ambiguity and emotional weight of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of finding truth in the margins is consistent but articulated through on-the-nose exposition ("Where others saw chaos...") rather than subtext. The resolution reinforces the premise without adding complexity or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is delivered through direct authorial assertion ("humans had simply forgotten how to listen," "beauty could emerge from breaking") rather than subtext. This didacticism flattens the narrative resonance, reducing the story to a fable with an explicit moral.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.1)
    The central theme of silence carrying truth is resonant, but the execution becomes didactic in the final dialogue ("The covenant demands consent, but there can be no true consent..."). The story articulates its thesis explicitly rather than letting the subtext of the "unspoken fears" carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme is central, but the ending relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the sister's note explicitly articulates the thesis ("You just didn't know my frequency"). This didactic confirmation reduces the interpretive resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is coherent but the ending relies on explicit moralizing ("Wisdom asks us to endure...") that explains the meaning to the reader. This didactic approach replaces narrative resonance with a sermon, reducing the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the protagonist explicitly articulates the moral ("resilience wasn't about resistance, but about existing across multiple states") in the final paragraphs. This reduces the subtext to a stated lesson, flattening the resonance of the visuals. The concept of temporal layering is interesting, but the text explains it rather than letting the image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of industrial systems possessing a "hidden architecture" of disaster is intelligent and well-integrated with the plot. However, the thematic realization is explicitly articulated in thought ("Now she understood...") rather than emerging implicitly through the pressure of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("certify wonder as essential") rather than dramatized, and the conclusion paradoxically validates the Council's utilitarian worldview by reducing beauty to physiological utility rather than defending it on its own terms.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is explicitly explained rather than dramatized, particularly in the paragraph beginning "She understood now." This summarized epiphany flattens the subtext and resolves the thematic question through exposition rather than the character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of emotional unity is clear, but the execution relies on explicit "thematic echo" lines ("Love equaled fear plus hope divided by distance"). This reduces subtext to a formula, explaining the insight to the reader rather than allowing it to resonate organically through the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered via explicit lecture by the Keeper ("Relics don't carry magic... They transform carriers"), which removes subtext and interpretative space. The ending moralizes directly ("Let the routine places bloom"), reducing the story to a tidy parable. This explicit articulation of the thesis triggers a deduction for didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of grief stored in objects is handled with coherence and sensitivity. The "truthful lies" paradox offers a satisfying thematic resolution to the conflict between scientific rigor and emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of sibling sacrifice is coherent and central, but the execution tilts toward sentimentality ("remembered songs and unbroken bonds") at the end. The "raveling silence" serves as an effective, if slightly repetitive, thematic metaphor for loss.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of "quiet labor" and "remembered purpose" resonates well with the fable-like tone. The ending image of the trees waking up successfully lands the concept of "bartered awakenings" without becoming overly moralistic, though the path there is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of weighing love against existence is clear but articulated through heavy-handed dialogue ("Some truths... demanded impossible choices") rather than subtext. The thematic "weight" is summarized in Kael's internal monologue rather than dramatized through the difficulty of an immediate, irrevocable action.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is articulated too explicitly. Vera’s letter functions as a summary of the story’s thesis ("protecting everyone's truth but her own"), which violates the "Thematic Echo" guardrail by stating the moral rather than letting it emerge from subtext. The emotional resonance is forced through explanation rather than earned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed narrator assertions ("darkness wasn't the absence of light but its teacher") rather than emerging from the subtext of the action. The ending explicates the moral ("shadows that taught them") instead of letting the resonant image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of empathy and "seeing beneath the surface" is coherent but articulated through explicit dialogue that borders on moralizing. The connection between the dye work and the donor's "listening" is a nice conceptual bridge, though the "sun trails" metaphor feels slightly over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of healing grief is handled with sincerity but suffers from heavy-handed explication ("Three units of grief here...") and a moralizing conclusion. The final paragraph summarizes the thesis ("sorrow could be measured, witnessed, and healed") instead of allowing the resonance to emerge organically from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit exposition ("This was how she knitted communities together") and moralizing narration rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through didactic dialogue ("Your mistake was thinking they were the same thing"), leaving little room for subtext. The ending moralizes directly, collapsing ambiguity into a clear lesson rather than allowing resonance to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transformation vs. preservation is resonant, but the explicit articulation of the prompt phrase ("Tenuous absolution") in dialogue renders the subtext overt. This "Thematic Echo" reduces the literary power of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story explicitly states its thesis in the final journal entry ("Evidence that some promises outlive memory itself"), reducing subtext to a moral lesson. This didactic conclusion resolves the ambiguity that gives literary fiction its resonance, flattening the theme into a parable.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of silence as a currency/weapon is well-integrated and lands with resonance in the final image ("silence like armor"). The concept of the "truce of hush" elevates the standard blackmail plot into something more thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The thematic parallel between the forest's root democracy and the "election" of weather-carriers is intellectually satisfying and coherent. However, the subtext is thin; the characters explicitly articulate the theme ("Maybe I'm just a messenger") rather than letting it emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Memory wasn't meant to be a prison") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The symbolism of the broken lock feels calculated and heavy-handed, reducing the potential for nuanced resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly articulated in the mentor's dialogue ("candor in small moments... matters more"), resulting in a "Thematic Echo" penalty. The story relies on this stated moral rather than allowing the subtext to emerge organically from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of emotional resonance over precision is coherent, but the story relies on explicit summarization to land it ("It was about preserving the color of wonder"). The text explains the thesis in the final paragraphs rather than trusting the imagery of the bells and the pilgrim's gesture to carry the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of integration versus erasure is handled with sophistication, avoiding moralizing in favor of a resonant image (watering the mutated roses). The concept of "fragmented wholeness" is not just stated but dramatized through the synthesis of the mechanical android and the organic/mineral garden, offering a profound answer to the central dramatic question.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing to convey its theme, particularly in the final paragraphs ("Marissa heard exactly what she'd hoped for... certainty that comes from being truly heard"). The thematic echo penalty applies, as the narrative summarizes the lesson rather than letting the dramatic action carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of "vulnerability as strength" is coherent but delivered through explicit exposition ("Her motivation ran deeper...") rather than emerging organically from subtext and action. The connection between code, poetry, and dance is creative but feels slightly thesis-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of conservation of memory/matter is beautifully executed without feeling didactic. The narrative intertwines the physical anomaly (gravity) with the thematic core (weight of memory) seamlessly. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    The thematic inversion of the standard fantasy trope—silencing a prophecy rather than fulfilling it—is excellent and thoroughly explored. The motif of "mapping silence" resonates through the ending, creating a cohesive argument for the value of peace over glory.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of "agreed upon lies" is seamlessly integrated into both the dialogue and the central conflict. The concept of architecture as a dying language of trauma/memory resonates strongly without feeling heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story achieves high resonance by reframing "fragmentation" not as brokenness but as a survival strategy against "standardization." The ending offers a non-literal, emotionally potent answer to the central question of cure versus preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central theme of "constructive treason" is compelling, but the story relies on explicit explanation in the final paragraphs ("understood that forgiveness wasn't about...") rather than letting the subtext carry the meaning. This didactic summation converts resonant subtext into a stated moral, flattening the ending's potential ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed didacticism. The sister's recorded voice explicitly articulates the story's moral thesis ("Teach them that to be remembered..."), stripping the narrative of subtext. This sermonizing approach replaces dramatic resonance with instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of enduring love is resonant, but the ending leans on a summarizing moral ("knowledge that some things survive even drowning") rather than trusting the final image to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered via explicit sermons ("Truth reveals itself in circular motion") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending moralizes directly, lacking the necessary subtext or ambiguity for a literary score; the lesson is stated rather than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of Science vs. Faith is present but muddled by the resolution: Vera plans to "explain the science" yet "leave the miracle intact," two goals that contradict each other. The ending relies on a summarizing thought to tell the reader the moral ("comfortable lies") rather than letting the action carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of necessary darkness is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed dialogue ("Teach me to shape the dawn") that renders the subtext text, reducing thematic resonance to a stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of preserving memory is resonant but delivered didactically through exposition ("Sound was memory made physical"). The story tells the reader what it means rather than allowing the meaning to emerge organically from subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of memory and protection is coherent, but the execution leans toward explicit moralizing at the end ("held back the darkness of forgetting"). The resonance comes more from the concept than the character's specific emotional journey.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme is articulated through direct thesis statements ("Patience itself was radical") rather than emerging organically from subtext. This explicitness creates a didactic tone, converting potential resonance into a stated moral that leaves little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.5)
    The thematic synthesis is exceptional; the "path walked more than once" connects the historical struggle for freedom with the protagonist's modern bureaucratic escape. The final image of the lantern re-lit charges the narrative with earned historical resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in dialogue ("Apology without action is just noise," "witness to the second chances"), leaving little room for subtext. The moral conclusion is delivered as a sermon rather than emerging organically from the dramatic friction, resulting in a didactic rather than resonant finish.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "mechanical hope" and yearning is coherent and resonates through the central metaphor of the algorithm. However, the subtext is frequently made text, with explicit statements explaining the theme ("The ancients had yearned too," "Of course the bell was always there") rather than letting the imagery speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of digital afterlife and the "spaces between deletion" is handled with consistent, resonant imagery. The "sensed absence" integrates well with the plot, though the concept of the "old songs" feels slightly more like a prompt insertion than an organic thematic upwelling.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "choice vs. fate" is resonant but delivered didactically through narrator explanation ("She was seeing the emotional architecture..."). The text explains the meaning of its symbols rather than allowing them to emerge organically.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story builds a coherent meditation on mortality, but the final sentence explicitly summarizes the lesson ("change wasn't death calling, but life insisting"). This explainer ending collapses the story's subtext into a diagnostic moral, triggering the penalty for thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through dialogue ("You called me here to say our failure mattered?"), violating subtext requirements. The characters articulate the thesis rather than embodying it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic resonance is high, effectively exploring the fragility of community and the necessity of "peripheral awareness." The concept that direct scrutiny destroys the magic is woven well into both the plot mechanics and the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and dialogue that explicitly states the thesis ("The arc is the hardest part... We're all stuck in various arcs"). The narrative relies on asserting the "necessary work of beginning again" rather than allowing meaning to emerge organically from subtext or action.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of evolution masquerading as decay is handled with consistency and resonance. The ending leans into didacticism ("breaking was sometimes just another word for bloom"), explicitly stating the subtext in a way that reduces the interpretive power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of loss and the futility of holding onto time is poignant and organically developed through the "negative prophecy" mechanic. The ending resonates strongly, though the final definition ("The sound... was this") is slightly explicit in stating the thesis, trading a fraction of ambiguity for clarity. It successfully reframes the initial quest into a deeper understanding of aging.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of impermanence and witnessing is integrated well into the action of the orrery. However, the score is capped by a "Thematic Echo" near the end ("everything beautiful eventually reaches for its own escape velocity"), which explicitly states the subtext rather than letting the powerful final image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("perfection wasn't what would reunify them... Authenticity was") rather than subtext. The ending pulls for unearned resonance with the "scent of hope" tag, moralizing the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of "sealed awakenings" resolves beautifully into the image of shadows as connecting threads. The closure offers a resonant answer to the central question, recontextualizing the "absence" as a higher form of presence.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "bone setting" as a metaphor for healing trauma and reality is poignant and well-developed. However, the thematic delivery in the dialogue ("mistakes aren't endings—they're raw material") leans toward the didactic, explicating the subtext rather than letting it breathe. The motif of "constellations" ties the ending together nicely, though the explicit connection weakens the resonance slightly by over-explaining it. The emotional core remains strong despite the heavy-handed delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme is coherent but explicitly sermonized in the final paragraphs ("a place where... memories didn't weigh you down"). Instead of allowing the image of the light-filled cave to resonate on its own, the narrative explains the moral directly to the reader, reducing thematic depth and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.6)
    Thematic resonance is blunted by explicit statements like "meaning wasn't found or given—it was grafted," which preach the subtext rather than letting it emerge from the action. The story tells the reader how to feel about the reconciliation instead of dramatizing the complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is articulated too explicitly, with the narrative voice explaining the meaning of each symbol immediately after it appears ("this was the hope of innocence preserved"). The ending leans into moralizing ("The real ending lay in understanding..."), substituting abstract summary for earned subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is summarized explicitly in the final paragraph ("finally understanding that some engineering required more than gears..."), converting resonance into a sermon. This direct moralizing replaces organic realization and violates the show-don't-tell standard.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but resolves into a somewhat sentimental moral ("believing in impossible spring") that feels asserted rather than earned through the scene's friction. The ending leans on summarizing the meaning rather than letting the image resonate ambiguously.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing (“When we forget how to hope”) rather than subtext. The dialogue functions as a prompt response or thesis statement, reducing the emotional resonance of the final image by explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of transforming grief into beauty is synthesized beautifully with the prompt elements. The final Conceptual Repricing—reimagining the stars as calcified burdens that "chose to shine"—is a profound, non-moralizing extension of the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central themes of grief and presence are poignant, but the ending weakens the subtext by explicitly articulating the lesson ("loss had taught her... meant not disappearing but transforming"). This didactic summation replaces the resonance that the bowl itself had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of erosion versus movement is well-integrated and resonates in the final image of the lagoon restarting. The metaphor of collecting others' stories as a symptom of lost ambition creates a strong, coherent subtext that elevates the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "unintended repurposing" lands with resonance, anchored effectively by the "maze of intentions" motif. The sextant serves as a strong subtextual tool, linking exploration to the act of re-seeing a derelict space. The ending avoids heavy moralizing, offering a hopeful reconfiguration of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of reclaiming delayed dreams is resonant, anchored by the final image of the "true" clock. However, the thematic realization is delivered somewhat didactically ("She understood then that making peace didn't mean forgetting"), which flattens the subtext into explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic integration is superb, weaving the concept of "negative architecture" into the narrative and character arc. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise without didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of encoded wisdom and the parallel between natural seeds and human knots is woven intelligently through the narrative. The ending effectively resonates with the idea of stewardship, though the connection is occasionally delivered through expository reflection ("practical knowledge elevated to philosophy") rather than subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    The core theme of "mapping the return" is resonant, but subtext is undercut because characters explicitly articulate the themes in dialogue ("map the distance," "geography of healing"). The ending image of the thread successfully grounds the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of hybrid beauty is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed explicitness. The narrative frequently tells the reader the moral ("beautiful not despite... but including them"), and the final paragraph summarizes the thesis rather than letting the image of the mechanical phoenix resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit, didactic dialogue ("Your scars are a song") and repeated narration rather than subtext. The result is a moralizing lesson that leaves no room for ambiguity or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but heavily didactic in the final paragraphs ("monument to what persistence... could achieve"). Explicitly stating the moral and the nature of the protagonist's growth reduces narrative resonance and flattens the ambiguity established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue ("The answer... is that you already do"), reducing subtext to a sermon. The story tells the reader what to feel rather than allowing the meaning to emerge from action or ambiguity, triggering the penalty for sermonizing endings.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and narration ("grief was actually a continuous thread"), leaving little room for subtext. The ending poem ("We are the carvers of each other's remembering") functions as a moral summary, triggering the penalty for explicit moralizing/thematic echo at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of "hidden truth maintaining balance" is executed with sophistication. The final image of the invisible truth swinging back and forth offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem of guilt. The story commits fully to its concept of "incremental absolution" without heavy-handed moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    The thematic braid tying chess strategy ("the shape of intentions") to the correction of historical records is the story's strongest asset. The ending successfully elevates the grandmother's work from decorative to subversive, offering a satisfying resonance that justifies the dual metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing rather than subtext. The text frequently states its thesis ("The constraint wasn't limitation but framework"), reducing the potential for organic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of memory residing in the overlooked (dust) is poetic and legible. The ending leans into explicit moralizing ("story famine was ending... learned to read the language") rather than letting the resonant image speak for itself, but the core concept holds together well.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of art as omission is sophisticated, but the execution suffers from "Thematic Echo." Having the ash literally spell out the thesis ("Safety is forgetting...") externalizes the subtext too bluntly, converting resonance into instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme is coherent, Karin explicitly articulates the story’s thesis in dialogue ("The real battles aren't fought in councils..."), which flattens the subtext. This didactic moment converts what could have been an earned realization into a lecture, triggering a Thematic Echo deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("My grandmother taught me...") and narrator summation rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The story operates as a parable with a clear moral directive, leaving no space for ambiguity or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes are articulated through explicit thesis statements ("industrialized even memory") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme of efficiency versus wonder is resonant but delivered through explicit moralizing ("purpose isn't efficiency—it's joy") rather than subtext. The ending summarizes the lesson, which flattens the potential for ambiguity or deeper engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but heavily didactic. The penultimate paragraph explicitly lectures the reader on the story's meaning ("houses didn't need people... They needed witness"), violating the show-don't-tell principle and reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story builds a compelling thematic argument about complicity but undermines it in the final paragraph with explicit moralizing. The dialogue "history lives in shades of gray" triggers a significant "Thematic Echo" penalty (-0.8 range) for articulating the thesis in prompt-like language at the climax, flattening the resonance into a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The integration of the physics concept (instability as a requirement for motion) with the character's emotional arc is excellent. The chipped die serves as a perfect objective correlative for the theme, transforming a flaw into the key for success. The ending resonates without needing to restate the moral explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of preserving humanity through art and memory is coherent and lands clearly. The connection between "lost languages" and "kindness" is poignant, though the ending nears sentimentality with the vision of the city blazing with defiance. The "library without walls" is a strong resonant image that anchors the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of cultural continuity through displacement is organically integrated into the plot mechanics (bread, tools). The ending offers a resonant answer to the premise without becoming overly moralistic or abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of reversing entropy and causality is woven tightly into the imagery, particularly the re-reading of the hunger stone's inscription. The ending creates a Resonant Reconfiguration of the warning "When you see me, weep," transforming it from a portent of famine into a promise of liberation. The concept lands with clarity and depth.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the advisor's final dialogue (&quot;What we fear most is seeing fear clearly&quot;), removing ambiguity. This didactic approach flattens the subtext, leaving the reader with a stated lesson rather than an emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of adaptation is resonant, but the story relies on explicit summarization ("Every obstacle became an instrument if you understood its resonance") to articulate it. This didactic insertion flattens the subtext, transforming potential nuance into a stated moral before the climax concludes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of stagnation versus movement is well-integrated with the cartography motif, and the recontextualization of the watchers from threats to guides lands well. The final image of the turtle shifting effectively answers the central thematic question without heavy-handed moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.3)
    Theme is delivered through explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraphs ("world deserved this complexity"). The story tells the reader what to think about the "noble lie" rather than letting the subtext resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of preserving absence is resonant, particularly in the final image of silence becoming architecture. However, the text occasionally relies on telling the theme ("what the departures meant," "interlaced absence") rather than letting the subtext carry the weight, leading to moments of heavy-handedness.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of preserving erased history is coherent and integrates well with the plot. However, the execution relies on explicit statement ("Verum Ante Omnia," "proof that some had fought") rather than subtext, leaving little room for interpretive nuance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of transforming grief into tangible labor is deftly handled, avoiding platitudes in favor of a complex mechanical metaphor. The paradox of "descending while ascending" resonates deeply with the nature of loss and hope. The final mantra ("Transform, polish, fold, release") successfully anchors the abstract theme in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is delivered through on-the-nose dialogue ("You're treating reality itself like a geode") rather than subtext. This explicit articulation of the thesis—a "Thematic Echo"—reduces the ending's resonance by explaining the metaphor to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered didactically through dialogue ("The frequency of belonging... A wavelength that connects") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The concept is asserted as a premise rather than explored through the complexity of human connection.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narration ("needed to discover the weight," "remember what it meant to be accountable") rather than emerging organically. This didactic approach explains the meaning to the reader instead of allowing it to resonate through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("turning failure into learning," "untether what's been bound") rather than subtext or action. The grandmother's anecdote operates as a lecture to the reader/characters rather than an earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of integrating failure is coherent but heavily over-explained through direct statements ("broken navigators gravitate...", "to align heart and action"). The narrative articulates the subtext for the reader instead of allowing the imagery of the poles and compass to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is explicitly written on the baseball ("Empathy isn't memory. It's choice."), violating the show-don't-tell principle for resonance. This "thesis statement on a prop" flattens the subtext into a moral lesson rather than an emergent truth.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of transformation through loss is consistent, but the execution is somewhat on-the-nose, particularly with the fortune cookie providing the explicit moral roadmap. The subtext is occasionally crowded out by dialogue that explains the stakes ("The magic requires a price") rather than letting them exist unsaid.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of presence versus abstraction is powerfully dramatized through the tablecloth and the descent. However, the score is capped by explicit thematic echoing in the final third ("Time, she finally understood..."), which explains the lesson rather than trusting the strong imagery to carry the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is coherent but articulated through diagnostic label-speak in dialogue ("We locked away our collective pain and called it progress") rather than emerging purely from subtext. This explicit thesis-stating limits the story's interpretive depth.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is explicitly summarized in the final paragraphs ("Transformation wasn't sharp or sudden..."), replacing dramatic resonance with essayistic explanation. This overt moralizing in the narrative voice flattens the subtext, telling the reader exactly how to interpret the character's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of "light from within" and silent revolution is coherent but delivered through somewhat didactic dialogue ("It'll spread like this light"). The final image resonates with the premise, though the metaphor is heavily leaned upon.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of accepting entropy and "letting go" is woven well through the imagery of the frictionless slide and the grandmother's fate. The final realization resonates with the premise, though the concluding line ("sacred geometry of letting go") leans slightly into explicit moralizing rather than letting the image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme is coherent but heavily over-articulated by the narrator ("That was how resistance survived..."). The text explicitly decodes its own symbols (storm as paradox, words as landmarks), leaving little room for genuine subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is coherent but suffers from "Thematic Echo"—the protagonist explicitly articulates the story’s thesis in dialogue ("Every philosophical inquiry... is an attempt to turn questions into destinations"). This on-the-nose delivery flattens the subtext, transforming a potentially resonant realization into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in ruins is saved from sentimentality by the protagonist's self-awareness ("terrible doggerel," "worth a penny"). This meta-commentary allows the story to embrace its romantic elements without becoming maudlin. The final image of planting for a future unrecognized self resonates strongly with the core concept.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of love transcending time is resonant but executed with a heavy hand, relying on explicit statements like "music that felt like memory given voice." The emotional takeaway leans toward sentimental validity rather than earned insight. The subtext is often converted into text, reducing the potential for ambiguity or deeper interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of epistemological rigor versus cultural survival is intelligent and well-developed. However, the dialogue "I think that truth and wish aren't always opposites" acts as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the subtext that the scene had already successfully dramatized. Trusting the action of planting the seed to convey this shift would have resonated more deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statement rather than subtext or action. The final paragraphs explain the moral ("Not for finding what was lost, but for cultivating what remained") directly to the reader, triggering the penalty for explicit moralizing and reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme of gradual transformation emerges organically from scales/neutron stars; final image ("scales glowed like stars") offers resonant CR without moralizing, reweighting premise.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme (consciousness from iteration) emerges implicitly via violin harmonics as code/loops, reweighting premise in CR final image without statement. Resonance from particulars (sweeps to melody); ambiguity lingers in perpetual loops. No moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges via dual metaphor: neutron-star decay ↔ butterfly-scale residue—both leave quiet evidence of transmuted cataclysm. Subtext is carried by gesture (labeling dust, locking door) rather than statement; no moral is preached. The final slide held to dusk offers a resonant non-literal answer: understanding is reflection, not possession. Avoids overt allegiance to either science or sentiment; complexity is honored.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of transformation emerges through fire imagery—explosion, kiln, dawn frost—without overt statement; the closing image of melting frost on the window quietly re-prices ‘pause’ as creative risk accepted, avoiding moralizing. The parallel between glass-work patience and moral choice is effective but relies on Vera’s explanatory dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)

The refrain of the unbroken fork quietly reweights from anomaly to instrument of survival, earning resonance without statement.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)

No moralizing, only resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of invisible solidarity emerges from bread parcels and star cards, not thesis statements. The final image—bell passed forward—reweights exile from isolation to recursive mutual aid, leaving resonant ambiguity about whether sanctions will ever lift.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: unexpressed emotion doesn’t vanish—it transmutes into the world’s beauty. No explicit moralizing; the pilgrim’s aphorism is embedded in ritual action.

Final image re-prices the premise: relinquishing the jade is not loss but completion, resonant without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from reciprocal metaphor: maze = temporal curvature, hedge = memory wall. No moralizing; instead, the closing image re-prices existence as navigable but unfinishable garden. Subtext of design-as-self-erasure is carried by the vanished photographs—an object lesson in professional hubris. The resonance is specific to her occupation; swap “composer” and the emotional algebra collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from specific particulars: absence as a sculptable material, memory as reversible alloy. Subtext resides in gesture—hand opening to drop crystal—rather than thesis.

No final-paragraph moralizing; ambiguity lingers cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: being the subject is the price of trying to own others’ crossroads. The final image—Maya walking into moonlight now equipped to paint, not steal—reweights all prior thefts as rehearsals for authorship. No meta-statement intrudes; the insight stays lodged in the jar’s relinquishment and the station’s silvered rails.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of release vs. preservation emerges from glass technique, not lecture: heat-then-cool parallels confront-then-reconcile. Subtext loaded into object handling—bookmark crack = family fault line; sphere = transparency he offers.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of weaponized intimacy emerges through encrypted cast and genetic theft; final line risks overt statement but is saved by shell-talisman echo.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: navigation through negation, meaning made from withheld speech. The booklet’s gold flakes, the ambered hush, and the star’s extinction form a returning set of particulars that reconfigure in the final image. No moral is asserted; the reader is left to feel the cost of steering by absence. Quiet ending is earned, resonance unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges as maintenance-as-consciousness: tending the same ground repeatedly is how meaning accretes. The violin’s shift from fear→silence→shatter→understanding reweights the central question without moralizing. Subtext lives in the janitor’s refusal to stop sweeping even after revelation—existence is upkeep, not discovery. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: the sound of his own diagnostics made audible, a self that can only be heard, not found.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges as the impossibility of remaining a neutral registrar of other people’s emotions—transparency becomes a mutual obligation. Subtext operates in the doodle-images and in the parenthetical heart-equation, never translated into moral. The closing silence reconfigures the opening “whispering” motif: secrets cease when ownership is shared. One soft spot: the “language beyond sound” tag edges toward thesis-statement, slightly diluting the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from vegetal defiance: measurement vs. belonging. Subtext sits in the cracked marbles—fracture as record of survival, not damage. Final image reconfigures “luck” as ecological allegiance, stated only via the garden’s impossible season. No moralizing; the thesis is a purple crocus in November.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the ephemerality of certainty: what reads as humble maintenance secretly rewrites physics. The moths’ “subdued awakenings” reprice human assumptions without a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the duet of sound and silence—music as testimony for the drowned voice. Subtext lives in lantern grammar: flicker = doubt, steady = verdict. No moralizing; the final “I heard you” is action, not thesis. The code-as-music motif reweights at closure when notes become legal evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges without slogan: knowledge unsaid is still knowledge, and suppressing uncertainty kills. The nightshade illustration returns reweighted—its poison now stands for the oracle’s hidden doubt. Subtext in Chen’s silence and the shared tea carries culpability. Final image of clouds under an “uncertain” forecast offers a non-moral answer: live with incompleteness or die by false completeness.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without dictation: collective silence calcifies into industrial haunting; confession—even outsourced to late-night radio—can erode that calcification. The beaded wheels’ rosary logic fuses Catholic guilt with blue-collar machinery, letting guilt look both sacred and systemic. Final image reframes prior motifs: water (baptismal) flushing pipes (industrial) while shadows clock off. No moral sermon, only reweighted machinery: truth’s weight is transferable but never vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from decaying text becoming living geology; no sentence spells a moral. The origami swan’s final fold—“Everything that knows itself completely stops growing”—reprices the entire premise without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: is entropy loss or liberation? Resonance is concrete, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ordinary magic emerges through sensory particulars—sage scent, single guitar string, corona glare—never labeled theme. Final line “space between darkness and light” reweights the opening twilight metaphor without sermon. Theme stays porous: miracle is both astronomical and interpersonal, refusing either/or. Reader left to decide whether voice returns because of science, therapy, or cosmic accident.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of memory as tactile resistance to collective amnesia emerges organically from object-handling; no overt thesis stated. Final image of two women touching the same weave offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids sentimentality by keeping Catherine’s fate unresolved. Slight softness because “bronze quiet” tone is named rather than re-inflected at end.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—grace hidden inside bureaucracy of espionage—arises from the concrete device: innocuous fortunes carrying state secrets. No character lectures us; the final line “already in your hands” reconfigures reader’s earlier dismissal of cookie chatter into quiet epiphany. Ambiguity lingers: are the random fortunes that comfort civilians accidental or willed by Maya’s cipher? Subtext in the UV numbers and the blink code rewards re-read without moral sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—stillness as fullness rather than void—emerges through looping rhetoric and cobalt glyphs without sermonizing. The final silence reweights prior sonic strata into peace, achieving understated resonance. Complexity is present: possession dissolves not by force but by epistemic undercut. Still, the priest’s untested certainty keeps the idea somewhat cerebral; a flicker of doubt could have pushed subtext into the exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from specific paradox: freedom from gravity reveals deeper self-maze. Labyrinth motif refrains from overt thesis; final image of weighted feet offers non-literal answer. No closing moral—cost is the statement. Ambiguity lingers: is ordinary life the prison or the refuge? Complexity embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: music = architecture of silence, victory = embracing absence. Recurring needle and reversed waveforms accumulate into a final reconfiguration rather than a moral. The emotional after-effect is concrete: reader senses silence singing. Only a slight drift toward sentimental symmetry (“defeat transformed into something else entirely”) nudges this below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges inductively: the integrity of data versus the comfort of collective denial. No character states the thesis; the final image of pen on paper reweights the courtyard from refuge to observation post. Subtext lives in gesture—satchel left, not explained—and silence after “after.” Ambiguity is productive: we feel the cost of solitude without sermon. The motif of recording devices (tube, journal, pen) accumulates meaning rather than checking a box.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: the human need to mourn via sensory proxy, and the bittersweet trade of one spectrum for another. Subtext lives in gesture—hand to vial, cork back to heart—showing acceptance rather than declaring it. The midnight orchid’s silence and the color bloom refrain in echo, reweighted at closure when the orchid remains scent-deaf while Maren’s heart is “filled” with light. No moralizing; the final line lets “carry loss in a new spectrum” resonate as Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from the rope’s frayed particulars: transcendence is not escape but refinement into witness. Subtext resides in silence—Sarah never explains, only appears, letting the object speak. Final image answers the koan: remain physical (rope) or become pattern (glow); Marcus chooses both by relinquishing the rope. No moralizing; the mandate is felt, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through the motif of incompleteness as communal space; no character sermonizes. Final image—single fruit dropping—re-weights silence from dead to “living quiet,” achieving non-literal resonance. Subtext in shared bowl of rainwater/tears hints at collective grief without stating it. Only hedge: theme drifts toward consolation that may dampen the fires’ moral ugliness, leaving faint aftertaste of aestheticized catastrophe.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: authenticity vs. artifice, transformation through pressure, the ethics of necessary lies. No explicit thesis statements; the amber’s fossil process silently reprices Mara’s rule-set. Final image of “space between authenticity and artifice” resonates without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—readers must decide if the gentler counterfeit is progress or refined self-deception.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—cycles of noticing—emerges inductively from the growing photo wall rather than thesis statement, avoiding overt moralizing. The lighthouse keeper’s whispered “People think the lighthouse just runs itself” provides the sharpest subtext about invisibility, yet the story repeats the insight several times in slightly different wrappers, blunting irony. Final image of star-wheeling witnesses offers conceptual repricing that feels cosmic rather than earned from Marianne’s bodily risk. Ambiguity is present but thin; the piece leans toward comforting affirmation rather than complex moral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of inclusion-as-weaving emerges organically from the reed-work and the name-knot; no explicit moralizing. The arbor-twin image offers a non-literal answer: belonging is not absorption but parallel resonance. Subtext lives in gesture—Kael always stands “just outside the arbor’s shadow”—until the twin structure reconfigures that spatial grammar. The “luminescent ache” tone never collapses into sentimental platitude because it stays anchored in sensory particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without statement: knowledge demands release, not possession. Subtext lives in the pendant’s infinity loop mirroring the echo’s twin birth. Final image—song rippling outward—reweights prior illustrations as acts of freedom, not collection. No moralizing lines; meaning is carried by the uncage gesture and warm pendant. Ambiguity is controlled: reader left to feel the permanent temporal scar.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without thesis statement: grief is not a problem to solve but a dimension to inhabit, proven by the final image of an orchard “growing toward its own mysterious proof.” Subtext operates in the taxidermy eyes—objects meant to preserve sight for the dead—now repurposed to glimpse the living absent, reversing their taxidermic logic. The prime numbers remain unpatterned, enacting the theme that some systems resist closure. No late moralizing; the last line is an image, not a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: invisibility as active caretaking, not deprivation. Subtext operates in silent gestures—tears above the ceiling vent replace exposition. Final reconfiguration (“that was enough”) reframes erasure as generative love without moralizing. The refusal to let her appear keeps the theme prismatic and avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: relinquishing control as the only way to co-create life. No explicit thesis states this; it’s enacted in moss left untouched, weeds spared, leaf released. Subtext lives in gesture—pocketing then surrendering the leaf—rather than declaration. Final image reweights earlier research journals as relics of a foreclosed identity, offering resonant ambiguity: growth is collaboration, not conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: art as memory’s archaeology, not revelation. The rain trails, brooch, and ochre prints form a silent triptych of human pattern-making across millennia. No character sermonizes; the final canvas is the moral act. Ambiguity lingers—communion or self-soothing?—inviting re-reading without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: prophecy as colonial extraction of surprise; the cave’s new song reprises earlier “copper and starlight” but now uninterpretable, forcing reader to reprice every prior miracle as diminishment—resonant, non-literal, undogmatic.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme emerges without statement: memory as asymmetrical labor, absence as architecture. The empty doorstep toys and half-finished letters accrue into a quiet thesis on caretaking. The final image of light spilling across boxes reweights prior motifs—fragments become gifts, absence becomes presence. No moral is declared; the resonance is felt through the valve’s glint and the open door.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges without statement: cartography of the self is as necessary as cartography of the city. The punch that leaves no physical mark but validates passage becomes a quiet metaphor for psychological admission. Subtext in dialogue (“Maps won’t help you there”) and silence (names pressed into wall) carries weight. Final image of blank pages waiting for new maps offers resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through the whale-song / memory braid: knowledge can be relational, matrilineal, and embodied rather than peer-reviewed. Subtext operates in the unheard frequencies—what science can’t yet measure still demands moral response. Final image of open tower + fresh journal entry offers resonant non-literal answer: inherit the listening, accept unverifiable duty. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers—will her transcription ever matter to the whales or to science?

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—immortality as endless waiting versus the right to a finite goodbye—emerges through concrete particulars (boredom as “most faithful companion,” the fragment pulsing with impossible rhythm). Subtext lives in gesture: Naia’s fragmented shadow through the wall prefigures her later unraveling; Cassius’s palm on stone is already mourning. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: “he began plotting how to tear the dimensions apart again” turns his prior boredom into a newly costly obsession. No thematic echo or tidy maxim intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of ethical calculus emerges through iterated images of balance (scales of pearl inlay, equation metaphors) rather than declaration. Final image—Vincent crying beside the embalming table—reweights “deathly vitality” as rebirth prerequisite, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext in the widow’s unseen desperation keeps asylum stakes human, not rhetorical.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges obliquely: the human need to aestheticize experience even at the expense of truth. The final line revalues the entire quest without moralizing. No motif is forced; the gilded leaf recurs only as vocational signature, not symbol harvested for points. The ambiguity—beauty vs. veracity—lingers cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of systematic erasure emerges from concrete particulars (arsenic roses, garment bags, coffee-cart memories) without abstract sermon. Subtextual answer: preservation requires letting go of the private archive; memory’s texture is loss. No character articulates a thesis; the closest—“the roses had been worth it”—is rendered as sensory justification, not moral. Final image re-prices the poison: domesticated death was always the price of beauty, just as namelessness was the price of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges inductively from objects—shell, cello, observatory—without abstract sermon: knowledge versus feeling reframed as coexistence, not duel. Subtext resides in silence after the final note: acceptance of incompleteness is the only “answer.” Gloomy cheerfulness tonal fusion encapsulates the paradox. Final image (“Some instruments measure distances that have no units”) offers resonant non-literal answer reweighting prior scientism.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through encroaching pastel storefronts and carousel-horse compass arrows: culture is a living, rearranging performance, not a museum diorama. Subtext resides in the stone chip—once foundation, now talisman—its meaning repriced from relic to ballast. Final image of the rocking platform refuses a moral, offering instead a kinetic credo. Only a whisper of editorial intrusion (“they wanted the carnival sanitized”) keeps this from the 9-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges inductively from the triad: scars, blooms, and microscopic testament—no overt thesis. Final image reweights “progress” as an unpayable debt carried forward by the viewer, not the corporation. Avoids sentimental ecology sermon; ambiguity lingers in who will actually see the photo. Insight feels earned because it grows from Chen’s tactile arranging of vials and grain, not abstract assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges refractively: repair as epistemology, blindness as deeper sight. No thesis statements until the coda, and even that is offered as lived credo rather than moral. The hummingbird’s patched lens becomes an objective correlative for her own cracked worldview—whole enough to guide others, never restored to factory self. Final image reweights “broken” from deficit to modality of perception; ambiguity stays charged.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges obliquely: maps are human approximations, ice is the unedited archive; truth demands surrender to solitude and cold. There’s no overt thesis statement—final image is the lake waiting to be tasted, an aporia instead of morality. Subtext lives in condensation as palimpsest and in Petrov’s “ghosts” accusation that lingers unanswered. The emotional after-effect is a chill awareness that knowledge is never neutral—it costs caretakers.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of communal memory as vibrational repair emerges through patterned action, not thesis. Final image of continuing footsteps offers non-literal answer: survival is maintenance, not monument. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the tuner’s eternal return. Fork–bell–footstep motif reweights meaning at close, satisfying 9- band.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges as the cost of archiving feeling: the vial literalizes that preserving emotion consumes the living. Subtext operates through gesture—Mara’s thumb rubbing pocket fabric—never thesis. Final image of temple dissolving reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo; “lonesome splendor” is image, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of “truth through supposed lies” emerges from the reversal that the father’s wild stories were cartography, not delusion. Subtext operates in gesture—scratch marks on the door become a palimpsest atlas, copper light becomes liquid truth—without overt thesis. Final image reweights lineage: Matthias is no longer the “cry wolf boy’s son” but the newest cartographer of the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges without moralizing: love offered, not stolen, completes immortality. The silver-to-gold apples reweight the premise, showing formula unfinished until forgiveness is given. No character articulates a thesis; the final image of dawn carries the conceptual repricing. Ambiguity remains—what immortality now means for Marcus is left legibly unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: living grafted onto dead, exile reversed by tending rather than reclaiming. No thesis statements; the sundial inscription “Time breaks all journeys…” reweights earlier exile trauma into cyclical return. Final blossom pressed like “offering” crystallizes the motif without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence—villagers bring tea, never demand, enacting the restored trust that words could not secure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—authenticity hidden in disregarded margins—emerges through chalk codes, obsolete mail, and Iris’s profession without explicit thesis. Subtext lives in silence: the absent daughter’s unknowing reaction dwarfs any spoken line. Children’s ephemeral art re-prices permanence at closure when footprints will soon erase the very map that kept Iris safe. No moral summary; resonance lingers in the smog she re-enters unnamed to herself.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—knowledge disguised as insignificance—emerges through recurrent silver thread that reframes “decorative nonsense” as survival code. No moral is stated; the final prayer lets the reader feel the epistemic cost of a world that edits its own sky. Subtext thrives in silence: Vas’s sneer, the unheard binary flickers, the unreadiness of Tomas. The closing image reweights every prior stitch: what looked like eccentric craft is now the last uncorrupted map, a Conceptual Repricing of who gets to name the stars.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particular: “apology as time-travel” vs. “time as apology.” Subtext in silence—Meera never says “forgive yourself,” yet the shard transfer implies it. Final image of fading condensation offers resonant non-literal answer: absolution evaporates but has still existed. No explicit moral; ambiguity lingers about whether the revision is illusion or grace, inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: translation as accretive, coral-like labor against erasure. The final image—“small, patient deposits of truth”—offers a non-literal answer to the core question of whether meaning can survive violence. No overt thesis or moralizing; ambiguity lingers cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: joy is not content but luminance within fog—shown, not sermonized. Subtext in the dancer’s “negative space” and Mara’s phosphorescent spirals reconfigures meaning without lecture. Final image reweights prior motifs (fragment, fog, glow) into a coherent non-literal answer. No thematic echo or moralizing paragraph; ambiguity lingers over whether neighbors will truly see themselves in her light.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through the accruing layers: knowledge as sleep, questioning as wakefulness. The final image of continuing restoration without covering the hand reconfigures the stake without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will she wake again tomorrow inside the same dream—creating resonant after-effect. No thesis statements intrude; meaning is carried by the gold-leaf aphorism charged with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—language as tax-evasion—emerges through butterfly chromatic syntax and Linear-A stealth notebooks, never sermonized. Subtext hums in garden-row Phoenician and Hittite whispers; final image of seventeen blooming minds offers non-literal answer: thought can garden itself into ungovernable shape. Complexity lingers: defiance is also self-exile, a cost left resonant not judged. No thematic echo in final paragraph; resonance is imagistic, clean.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without thesis: art as oxygen-maker from human CO₂ of war. The cherry-blossom armistice image is the Conceptual Repricing—beauty not ending war but ending the poet’s need for war to end. No moral is declared; instead the postcard galaxy re-weights longing itself as cosmically-enduring, making personal insomnia bearable. Emotional after-effect is concrete: reader exhales, having been supplied the oxygen of that poem.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particulars: broken objects teach extinct feelings how to sing. No moral stated; final image of cracked chime “teaching” orchids offers non-literal answer. Subtext in gesture—hanging the flawed tube honors imperfection as love. Ambiguity lingers: is preservation of damage still preservation? Complexity embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through the conceit that truth can be engineered into grammar that self-punishes lies; no character ever articulates a moral. Subtext lives in gesture: the ink’s crystalline refractions mirror the fragile new understanding. The final image—hands meeting through scattered light—offers a non-literal answer: connection survives distance only if each “note” remains honest. No tidy moral, only a charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the particular: encrypted compassion is first a forensic clue, then a social engineering tactic, finally a political risk. No moral is stated; the final image of the breathing stones reweights the premise that some contradictions must be lived inside rather than solved. Subtext operates in gesture—the unsealed envelope is both vulnerability and invitation. The frescoes’ untranslatable hands externalize the limits of perfect consensus, inviting reader reflection without thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the dust–meteorite polarity: visibility demands opposition (dust needs dark beam, self needs fixed anchor). No explicit thesis; final image reweights “paper trails” from erasure to inscription without moralizing. Minor sentimentality in “trust was a pigeon released into storm clouds” is earned by prior bird-work specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the repeating motif of measured distance: corn-maze corridors, weather codes, growth rings, and finally the decision to stand still. No character articulates the thesis; instead the logbook’s rewritten code performs it. The aftereffect is a hush that feels like love redefined as spatial mercy—an insight that lingers without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of belonging-through-immersion emerges organically from the city’s dialogic architecture and Senna’s surface exile; no explicit thesis is declared. The burnt feather and bioluminescent “fireflies” form a quiet motif of fragile messengers, re-weighted when the researchers choose to answer rather than record. Final image invites reflection on scientific objectivity versus participatory knowledge without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: we do not know if the city welcomes or consumes.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: the mercy of oblivion for roads untraveled. The albatross seeds—discarded possibilities—reprise in the final image of scattered unmade moments, reweighting the concept from loss to grace. Subtext lives in gesture: her weathered fingers on the vials betray tenderness for what never existed. The ending refuses moral certainty, offering only the resonant paradox that forgetting enables endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges as embodied memory > nostalgia ban: “exile chosen freely was the purest form of belonging.” Subtext operates in gesture—she never says “ocean,” yet reader feels tide. Final image reconfigures premise: body as scripture is not rebellion but transcendence, a conceptual repricing of ban itself. No moralizing, only crystallized stance; ambiguity lingers—will caretaker report her?—which invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: glass panes → frames of lives, interference rings → grammar of attention, pocketed stones → rejected passivity. No explicit thesis; final image of “harbor beginning to show its colors” offers non-literal answer to initial hollowness. Subtext resides in silence: no spoken dialogue, meaning carried by gesture and optics. Epiphany is earned via two stones and watched patterns, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of “translation failure” emerges through concrete images: scarred face that once spoke safety now silences, cracked box that once held childhood now holds apology. Final image of “armor with a door built in” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext in silent porcelain handling deepens emotional after-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the accretion of shells/glass: pattern as mercy, not solution. Subtext resides in the gauge’s silence for five years—its first chime is the story’s seismic shift. Final image offers a non-literal answer: translucent walls showing self-versions woven together, reweighting “failure” as tapestry. One echo of prompt-language (“equation doesn’t need to prevent divergence…”) is spoken by the triad, not the narrator, so it feels ritual rather than thesis, but still keeps the score just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from concrete inversion: memory is forward-looking; architecture anticipates flesh. No moral stated—final image of dreaming corridor re-prices legacy from burden to communion. Subtext carries in gesture (hand on stone) and silence (no one else hears). Ambiguity lingers: is she chosen or caged? Complexity preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: reflection = possibility, not verdict. The refrain “what else could you be?” is never sermonized; it is painted into the air and sung by children, so the insight stays imagistic. The borrowed heartbeat quietly poses the same question at body-level—whose life is she living?—but the parallel is allowed, not explained. Ending reweights the premise without moral: mirrors now ask questions instead of delivering judgments, achieving resonance without aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: peace as the exhausted space between violences. Subtext lives in the clipboard’s metamorphosis from administrative tool to relic. Final image reweights prior material without moralising. No thematic echo or tidy maxim intrudes; ambiguity about durability is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—silence as compliance, art as insurrection—emerges through concrete particulars of echo harvest and web untangling, never sermon. The prism sanctuary’s refracted colors re-weight from decorative trick to weapon of memory, giving a non-literal answer to “what is beauty for?” Avoids tidy moral by leaving the palace’s fate unresolved; only the soundscape is changed. Alarming serenity motif modulates into joyous cacophony without authorial commentary, earning resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: the stick’s passage from prop to conscience object embodies the shift from manipulation to humility. Subtext resides in silent puppet manipulation, avoiding thematic lecture. The final image—walking toward exit with stick—offers resonant ambiguity rather than moral, satisfying the 9+ test despite a hairline whisper of writerly self-explanation mid-paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from pattern: temporary structures = ethical refusal to own memory. Subtext lives in gestures (touching glass = benediction) rather than thesis lines. Final image reweights premise: vanishing is the monument. No moralizing, only charged ambiguity—some truths “live best in structures designed to vanish.”

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of casting: instead of destroying wax to create vessel, Mira destroys self-access to create public memory—an earned conceptual repricing. No moralizing; final image of wind-rung bells offers ambiguous aftereffect: communion or perpetual loss. Subtext coils around “stay” whispered by lover—word becomes both anchor and letting-go. Resonance is non-literal, haunting, and invites rereading.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: destiny as conversation, not cage. The image of mycelial networks underground quietly reweights the opening “treacherous present,” turning paradox into partnership. No moral is declared; the final crystallized dream in the archive is the resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Knowledge-as-devotion emerges organically from the tile, treatise, and her willingness to impecuniously dig, never lectured. The alignment’s 4000-year echo reprises “dusky harmony,” reweighting solitude into trans-millennial companionship without moralizing. The theme tolerates plausible counter-readings: is she a pilgrim or predator of the past? Final image—her packing tablets while planning translations—offers a quiet, non-literal answer to the covenant question.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of inherited resentment emerges from the broken pin’s metaphor without once naming “resentment” as thesis. The final image—Kale touching the mended cylinder—offers a non-literal answer: wholeness includes the scar, melody needs the silence that once threatened it. Subtext resides in gesture (hand slamming soundless table) and object silence more than any spoken indictment. No final-paragraph sermon, only the resonant click of a pin that wasn’t there before.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the fog’s shift: boundaries are not abolished but remade, fragile yet necessary. The mirror-paste literalizes the idea that reflection can be reconstruction, not mere recall. No moral is stated; the final image of frost-bright lines silently reweights the premise with conceptual cost—every future crossing will demand fresh silver and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    The “deciduous vows” concept migrates from proverb to lived practice: the shedding of rigid corporate form lets new craft growth occur. Theme emerges through image (blossoms dropping, old stone unearthed) rather than sermon. Final re-pricing—“wisdom arrives accidentally”—is understated yet echoes the cathedral’s own accidental sanctity, giving pleasing asymmetry. Avoids explicit moral, though Lena’s line “somewhere that adapts” flirts with thesis-heat.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges as the cost of knowledge that exists outside linear time; no authorial thesis stated. Subtext delivered through recurring shell motif that shifts from trash to blank page to future tombstone. Final image of “time’s own strange fruit” reweights orchard as both Eden and archive. Ambiguity lingers: is she victim or volunteer? Complexity conserved.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of knowledge-as-ecology emerges through living shelves, moon-fed plants, and the counter-economy of forgetting; no explicit thesis. The closing image—blank pages auto-filling—re-weights earlier “negative-space catalog” motif into new growth, achieving resonance without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (rising from chairs, returning diary) implies consent rather than conquest, preserving complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    The abandoned carnival as after-life of identity emerges without exposition, culminating in the fleet image that reweights every earlier mirror: selfhood is a flotilla of discarded hulls. Theme accrues through sensory particulars rather than thesis, inviting reflection on grieving as selective amnesia; the refusal to declare which thread Mira chooses keeps ambiguity honest and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—“stories live in what’s missing”—emerges through the rope’s negative-space fables and the door that exists only when the world forgets to exclude it. Final image of the door remaining “visible to those who needed to see it” reweights earlier absences into quiet invitation rather than solution; no moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (her gentle handling of absence-patterned braid) rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges inductively: trauma read through “patterns that trauma left behind,” silence as forged repose rather than absence. Final line reweights ripple-maps from hobby to survival tool—earned, not declared. Avoids sermon, invites lingering ambiguity about sustainability of hush.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges as pattern vs. chaos; the final image of light blooming over ruins offers non-literal answer—meaning is made, not found. Subtext in “shard of hush” (absence as fuel) quietly reframes silence from emptiness to generative medium. No final-paragraph moral; last line is action-cadence. Recurrence of glass-song/prism echoes shift from mourning to invitation, charging closure. Complexity intact: she may fail, but the stance is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as architecture literally builds the world, then builds the self that remembers. The recursive shadow image reweights nostalgia from personal quirk to systemic condition—collective consciousness mourns its own future. No moral is stated; the final whispered question (“Is it conjecture or prophecy?”) remains suspended, inviting counter-readings. The quill’s light-writing motif returns as after-image, charging the closing image without symbolic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of “beauty filtered through damage” emerges through the mosaic instructions and the un-lit spin; no character sermonizes the thesis. The primrose closing while lanterns burn offers a resonant, non-literal repricing: failure becomes medium. Subtext in the woman’s burn-scarred hands and Kael’s chant speaks louder than exposition. Final image avoids moralizing; wonder is shown, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from tidal pool metaphor rather than assertion: survival through repeated loss/return becomes the non-literal answer to grief and leaving. Subtext lives in gesture (hand hover, hem twist). Final image of speaking “like careful notations” reweights cicada and tide without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: curated silence as personal atmosphere versus concrete bunker silence as inherited safety. The gilded hush re-priced at closure—no longer elite display but self-selected preservation—reweights the premise. Subtext lives in gesture (clutching doll to sternum) and the inversion image of vines sprouting “toward whatever direction felt most like breathing.” No final moralizing; resonance lingers in the open-ended sky choice.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual bias—notice how “cloud-bank above” is still “above” even when gravity inverts, preserving her bodily orientation. Syntax mirrors breathless climb: fragmented participles (“kicked hard… grabbing one… tucking it”) under pressure, then lengthens in the reflective final paragraph. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Diction stays within her lexicon; no academic filter verbs. Voice texture is consistent and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through refractive imagery: silence as a prism that splits grief into bearable frequencies. Subtext lives in unspoken parallels—storm glass crystals / memory shards, rainbow sheets / possible futures—never named outright. The ending image reweights “vaulting hush” from dread to benediction without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; no character declares “Silence is healing.”

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory as counter-imperial duty. The inversion of “ascension” from rule to service is reweighted by the final downward steps. Ruby and orchard images recur with shifted meaning, not token symbols. No moralizing paragraph; resonance is bottled in the last line: “a throne claimed not by sitting, but by remembering.”

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through accumulation of fire/ash/oxygen imagery rather than declaration; the final “emptiness held everything necessary” reweights the motif. Subtext of self-erasure vs. self-oxygenation is carried in gesture—hand hovering over silent ring, scars meeting scars—avoiding explicit moral. Ambiguity is preserved: burning bridges is both loss and liberation. The refusal to name the girl’s abusers keeps universality without flattening into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from action: pyramid compression → carbon → diamond as lived metaphor for survivor wisdom. No explicit moral; final image of the diamond refracting "possibility into spectrum" non-literally answers the question of what scams can become. Submarine bolt reweights from prison rivet to transformative tool, reconfiguring prior scam imagery without meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—silence as inheritable crime—emerges through object and action rather than lecture. Gramophone’s “eloquent silence” turned loquacious literalizes the motif; sepia light fading to violet externalizes moral stain. The final image of Cassian listening to methodical clicks refuses to moralize, letting resonance do the work. One soft echo: “silences in family histories are themselves a kind of testimony” drifts toward thesis-statement, keeping it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: freedom is not cutting strings but choreographing them. Subtext operates through stage imagery—armor as curtain-drop, apples as footlights—avoiding thesis statements. Final image offers non-literal answer: dancing in darkness beneath accepted strings. Complexity intact: no moral that Order = evil, only that denial costs more.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from particulars: arbitrary bureaucratic labels cleave lives; small archival kindnesses (teacher’s letter, Sutton updates) counteract systemic indifference. No explicit thesis; final image of button-pressed-between-fingers reweights premise—archives can still wound or heal. Subtext inhabits silence: absence of Samuel’s voice after 1875 equals death, unspoken. Complexity lingers: no apology from the system, only individual repair.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—collective memory versus engineered amnesia—emerges through concrete recurrence of erased streets and obsolete tech; never stated as thesis. Final image of water lapping “before all the lies” reweights the lagoon from hiding place to pre-lapsarian witness, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. No motif checklist; the key and puddle-map return because they are tools, not symbols harvested for resonance. Ambiguity lingers: we feel both the smallness of one camera and the enormity of what it can resurrect.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges entirely through the inversion of sound into silence; the final dewdrop image reweights earlier droplets as now “quietly vivid,” delivering a Conceptual Repricing without moralizing; no thematic echo violations—prophecy is never named in protagonist self-analysis.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of remembrance as repair emerges through concrete ritual—sorting, sketching, building—never lectured. Final image of sky-and-earth reconciliation is implicit in the arbor’s widening reach; ambiguity remains fertile. The past-meets-prophecy refrain risks thematic echo yet feels ancestral, not authorial. Subtext operates in the silence between leaf-spaces.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: broken clocks, corroded compass, mossy tools—never abstracted into “life is uncertain.” The final image reweights the premise without moralizing: the compass pointing “everywhere and nowhere” is a non-literal answer to the question of how to live after certainty burns. Subtext resides in silent objects; no character articulates the thesis. Ambiguity is purposeful and charged, inviting reflection on repair vs. acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme of “breakage as beauty” emerges strictly through the alchemical process and the golden seam; never sermonized, only shown. Final candle image answers the thematic question wordlessly: acceptance, not recovery, is the only victory. Subtext lives in gesture—magistrate presses coin to chest where heartbeat should be, wordlessly replacing daughter’s body with relic. No tidy moral; the ambiguity of “redeemed nothing, perhaps” invites counter-reading that ritual merely dresses pain in metal.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the ironic collision of tragedy and birthday frosting; no authorial thesis states “laughter heals.” The final image—Kael descending toward “the next luminous ache”—reweights the premise: healing is ongoing, never boxed. Subtext operates in gesture (the harp’s wrong note) and silence (the gorge’s caesura after integration). Resists moral formula; ambiguity lingers about guild censure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through pattern shift: Fibonacci spirals first map torture, then map seedlings; the refrain “mathematics of mercy” is never answered with a formula, only with the non-verbal act of planting. The ending’s conceptual repricing—mercy has no equation, only cultivation—lands without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through refracted light and recycled materials: what is deemed obsolete still guides. Subtext resides in the unspoken civic guilt of a city that “scrubbed” names. The final rainbow re-prices the official narrative without moralizing. Complexity is honored: the city is neither villain nor savior, merely layered.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—“some hidden things must be carried back into light”—emerges through the mainspring’s journey rather than explicit statement; final image of the box under his arm reweights the earlier “ceiling” motif without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence: the unsaid circus collapse, the unpaid bill he now accepts. Insight is earned through tactile discovery, not lecture. Ambiguity lingers: we never learn how Celeste died or who hid the barrel, inviting reflection on anonymous custodianship.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through imagery, not label: preservation vs. experience is argued by glass fruit that finally chimes off-key. Final line “awakening always feels like falling…” offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in operator’s indirection—patterns reveal themselves best in morning frost—invites re-read. No thematic echo in closing paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—civilization built from brokenness—emerges via concrete architectural choice to mortar shattered vase into wall, not via assertion. Subtext in gesture: covering mirrors superstition rewritten as “they made mirrors from their storms” implies art as catastrophe-handling, not catastrophe-avoidance. No final-paragraph moralizing; last line offers resonant, non-literal answer: “baroque spirals finally making sense” reweights prior excess as grief-poetry. Complexity preserved—revolutionary failure neither redeemed nor damned, just reframed.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges without label: the ethics of mending what was never mechanically broken. Final image—echoes singing below—reconfigures meaning: small repairs can re-balance cosmic scales. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers on who planted the stone.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges as the refusal to domesticate mystery: limestone for concrete = certainty; lagoon = unframeable. No moralizing; the final image re-prices knowledge itself—she pays with identity. Recurring petrichor and echo motifs accumulate meaning rather than decorate, culminating in the breath of “primordial storms.” The reader leaves with an olfactory aftertaste stronger than any thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through images, not sermon: layered glass, palimpsest names, cedar rings, ignored GPS all argue that transparency to history is the strongest structure. Final image of “turbine-song of time” reweights earlier simplicity mantra without stating a moral. Subtle counter-readings linger—does surfacing pasts erase present authorship?—adding complexity. One minor echo of prompt phrasing (“timewoven alliances”) is early enough to avoid final-paragraph thesis-violation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of layered transparency (glass, postcards, petals) rather than statement. The final image—flowers opening to “their rightful sun”—re-prices night itself, avoiding moralizing. Subtext is carried in gesture: the slow gathering of postcards into a new pattern mirrors the internal reordering. The insight feels earned because it is tied to specific sensory objects, not abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of bearing witness emerges through image and silence, never sermon: lagoon as mirror of memory, debris spelling WITNESS, final covenant without verbal summation. Subtext in Sarai’s bitter smile and Malik’s trembling hands carries the moral load. No late thesis statement; last line is imagistic. Complexity acknowledged—someone must stay, someone must speak—resisting tidy equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: resurrection demands honest memory, not magical forgetting. Subtext runs through the bottle-as-mirror motif—closed vessel = refusal of consumption. Final image re-prices the concept: light is earned, not wished for. No moralizing paragraph; resonance is imagistic.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through the image of grooves cut twice—once in wax, once in destiny—without editorial commentary. The final line’s imperative “teach others” reframes the entire orchard as a quiet academy of grief. No moral is stated; the ledger itself is the embodied thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation vs. stasis, the moral necessity of letting entropy scatter borrowed time. Final image answers the thematic question without moralizing—uncertainty is blessing, not problem. Subtext operates through object handling (acorn cap as measure→planter→relic) and texture shifts. No echoic thesis statements; “wild serenity” is the only abstract phrase, but it is earned by the vortex shatter.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the concrete conflict: embodied craft versus data supremacy, articulated through rope texture against silicon boards. Subtextual silence of “solstice hush” mirrors the tension between listening and broadcasting. Final bell strokes reweight the premise—old tech vindicated—without sermon. No late symbolic graft; rope meaning accretes through use, not allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the accumulation of logged dust and meteors: value lies in witness, not capture. Subtext operates in the silence between log entries—what she never says to Earth. Final line “universe fall upward into light” offers Conceptual Repricing: surrender = ascension. No moralizing paragraph; resonance is optical, not didactic. The ambiguity of whether she is wasting her life is left intact, deepened rather than resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the inversion: silence ≠ harmony, speech ≠ violence—truth-telling as communal mercy. No final-paragraph sermon; the reconfiguration is the silent dispersal of ghosts. Ambiguity remains—will new ghosts arrive?—inviting reflection without confusion. The stained glass reprise charges the closing image, satisfying the resonant non-literal answer test.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of what is lost when measurement dissolves emerges from the tactile handling of relics, not lecture; the final image of “suddenly timeless hearts” carrying literal shards of fixed time offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through the feather’s reweighting: imperfection as aperture for light. Subtext lives in gesture—Maren handing over the broken plume instead of comforting words. Final image of the lagoon holding “all their reflections” offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. The one-line echo “the incomplete is where light enters” is borderline thematic statement but is earned by prior tactile handling of the torn vane.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without slogan: respect = architecture, not tolerance. The diary’s marginalia and Maren’s bodily labor argue the thesis in concrete particulars; the fox and humming pillars reweight “respect” from moral stance to measurable ecological shift. Final image reprises the opening fog-calm but flips it outward: her exhalation joins the orchard’s breath—Earned Stasis that forecloses any human-centered afterlife. Subtext is in silence: no dialogue, only gesture and fungal lines. The conceptual reprice lands clean: collaboration outlives the individual, but the cost is her extinction—a nuanced, non-tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from iterated action rather than thesis: homecoming is the chemistry of repeated erasure. Subtext lives in unspoken recognition that Quorum’s inability to bend backward makes it a perfect mirror for human folly. Final image—rain washing fresh prints—offers non-literal answer: the sacred is the walking, not the arrival. No moralizing; complexity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of militarily poisoned ground into unplanned fertility; no character spells it out. The dead-language whisper “Mortuus est campus, vivat hortus” is the closest thing to a thesis, yet it’s a private ritual, not exposition. Final image reweights the premise: reclamation is ongoing, unpaid, and largely hidden. Avoids moralizing; lets the biological fact carry the irony.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges without moralizing: distance as fear-made-measure, silence as map. The leaf’s vein-roads and the cylinder’s inter-word silences reweight the same motif at closure, achieving resonance by image rather than statement. No tidy moral; the ending invites the reader to walk into the cracked morning, leaving ambiguity alive. Subtext operates in gesture—Mercy’s nose, Calder’s trembling hands—avoiding explanatory monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: wonder as circulating gift, not possession. The chess-piece swap and flowing-water image reweight the premise without final-paragraph moralizing. Final image of descent “into the wrongness with open arms” offers non-literal answer to fear of unknown. Subtext lives in gesture—cracking open pawn to reveal cat-staring secret—rather than exposition, avoiding thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: history belongs to the gestures that power never records. The chessboard, the walked words, and the archivist’s transcription all reprise the same question—what counts when the state collapses. Final image answers obliquely: two sets of feet writing together under a dome built for secrets. No moralizing; resonance is visceral—readers feel the cost of shared memory replacing private witness.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of belonging emerges through the refracted image of home—not a house but a self-refracting lattice. Subtext lies in tactile detail: feather barbs = suppressed memories; stone burn = price of re-integration. Final image offers charged poise without moralizing, letting the nameless colors reconfigure earlier motifs. Ambiguity lingers yet feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from craft flaw parallel: tapestry’s frayed edge = tutor’s flawed opening; both hold meaning without erasure. Subtext operates in silence—rain’s refusal to fall mirrors village’s refusal to forget, until collective exhale. Final image (smile in moving crowd) non-literally answers “can exile be home?” without moral. No overt thesis; insight grows from specific textile-chess linkage. Complexity lingers: forgiveness is comprehension, not reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through acoustic metaphor: truth as prism versus single beam. Subtext resides in the elders’ frightened silence and the penitents’ migrating loyalty. Final line reframes “forgiveness” into creative forging without moralizing. Complexity preserved: ritual integrity is damaged yet her guilt remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kintsugi reframed as planetary surgery emerges through action, not lecture: every golden vein is a literal deposit of memory-quilted intention. The final image—scars as map—reweights prior damage into utility, offering a non-literal answer to “how do we live with ruin?” Theme stays implicit; no moralizing caps the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: permanence vs. presence, observation vs. participation. The mirror’s shattering and the shells’ reassembly enact the theme in concrete objects; the reader feels the conceptual repricing when “temporary eternity” is accepted as enough. Final image—Maren walking back without her easel—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the work is the witness, not the artifact. No moralizing; the insight is earned through sweat and salt on painted shells.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of rescue logic: softness as ferocity. Subtext lives in gesture—Thomas’s hand hovers, then withdraws—and in the final lighthouse pulse that reconfigures “safety” itself. No explicit thesis; the image of open hands versus grasping fists lands non-literally. Minor deduction for “Sometimes tenderness screams loudest in its silence” echoing prompt language.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly: memory as gravitational drag vs. navigation as forward motion. The bronze’s corrosion calendar and stitched jacket maps embody the tension without commentary. Final image—device humming while she stays—reweights prior material: loss becomes the engine of future cartography. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the unresolved tension between pull and plotted escape vector.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges inductively from recurring absence motif rather than thesis statement. Final pinning reconfigures memory as stewardship, not nostalgia—resonant without moral. No final-paragraph “meaning” sentence; image does the work. Edelweiss lyric reprise is earned, not token, lifting score into high band.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: maps as metaphors for unfinished life paths; ants as model of adaptive collective action. No explicit thesis—final line grants “permission,” not moral. Subtext carried by recurring rose/fungi images that mirror hidden growth. Ambiguity remains: which future he’ll pursue is open, but the thematic question—“is it too late to choose?”—is answered by the reopened door. Slight docking for grandmother’s aphorism bordering on thematic echo, but it’s seeded early enough to feel like lore, not sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the image pattern: starlight as both wound and teacher, prophecy as self-fulfilling memory. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues through sensory particulars. Final image reconfigures prior material without moralizing—she carries the wound that might teach her to heal, inviting multiple readings (penance, awakening, endless recurrence). Subtextual menace stays lacy—never explained, always felt. Ambiguity is meaningful, not evasive. The piece avoids tidy moral calibration; the queen remains morally suspect, future uncertain. Thus resonance is earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from spiral geometry = growth = memory; no character sermonizes. Subtext lives in gesture: Mira’s shadow across the notes ≈ Academy’s shadow over Solène’s art. Final image reweights “light” from utility to testimony without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will the Academy crush her or be transformed?—yet cost is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the repeating image of the scroll as both lifeline and lie: memory as editable palimpsest. No explicit thesis; the final line “That’s why she kept writing” is an action-capsule, not a moral. Subtext operates in silence—no mention of terror, yet terror saturates the owl-dark. Feral nostalgia is never labeled again after intro; it is enacted via jealousy toward airborne past selves.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: midwife steel, leaking jade, and anosmic perception argue that imperfection is the price of new beginnings. Subtext resides in gesture—Elena threads the screw rather than voicing reassurance. Final image reweights the earlier “drowning heartbeat” into a pendulum marking life, not loss. No moralizing; ambiguity remains—broken clock still drips—yet resonance is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: archived art vs. living growth, cruelty vs. cultivation. Subtext lives in the perfume bottle—first a prop, then a conduit, finally an emptied relic—its jasmine trace implying forgiveness more than any apology could. Final image answers the core question: can words once frozen bloom again?—answered by literal blossoms. No sermonizing; the orchard sings instead of explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through recurring image-spiral of word, walk, cosmos—without thesis statement. Final laughter reweights “illusion vs truth” into infinite perspective, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtext lives in silence and spiral motion; no character articulates the moral. The mystery lingers, but abstract vocabulary (“cosmic illusion,” “infinite utterance”) nudges toward pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges: time is a negotiated seam, not a river. The reweighted horizon-as-seam reprises the opening “line so precise it could cut,” now read as mutable fabric. No moralizing; the silence after the bend carries conceptual cost. Subtext in the unmoving fjord and unused whistle implies complicity between shepherd and cosmos. Only the slight abstraction of “humanity’s desperate agreement” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without statement: permeability as life practice vs. intrusion-proofing as life prison. The mushrooms’ wordless glow reconfigures “network” from vulnerability to nourishment, a Conceptual Repricing that lands in the final paragraph. No moral is preached; the reader is left to feel the paradox that security expertise became her own jail. Subtext lives in gesture—handing over the disemboweled button says “I trust you with my broken mechanism” louder than any confessional dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: pattern vs. randomness, forgiveness without forgetting. Koan and negative-space reveal subvert her lecture-honed certainty without moralizing. Final image (“soft and persistent as clover”) reweights melancholy from burden to medium for growth—Conceptual Repricing with emotional cost. No thesis statements intrude; meaning stays implicit in gesture and light.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from specific objects: wrong numbers become right via human refusal to hang up; disc’s sound shifts from haunted to hopeful without authorial statement. Final image—disc singing differently—offers non-literal answer to “can endings birth beginnings?” No moralizing; resonance arises from prior particulars (Franklin’s madness myth, humidity physics). Subtext in silence after the disc plays: absence of supervisor reprimand lets reader feel looming cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: memory work is a reciprocal steeping—archivist and town steep together until return becomes possible. The locket’s reprise and the ink-stained hands reweight “small moments” from futile to salvific. Haunted euphoria is felt, not labeled, in Mrs. Corvin’s smile. Final image refuses moral symmetry: return is gift, not redemption, leaving ambiguity about whether the town will thrive.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: reciprocity as an “invisible currency” moves from abstract ethos to concrete social infrastructure without a summarizing moral. The moon rock motif starts as kitsch, is reweighted as catalyst, then reprised on the shared table as emblem of the new network—its final charge is earned. Subtext operates in gesture (“wild gleam of someone who’d decoded too many conspiracy theories”) rather than thesis. Final line “We heard a rumor” offers resonant, non-literal answer: connection is itself the perpetual rumor they now sustain.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges without statement: translation as survival—silence becomes music, sight becomes sound, isolation becomes fleeting communion. Subtext operates in the empty click: presence can outrank permanence. Final image reweights the premise; the camera’s futility turns into its triumph, a Conceptual Repricing that revalues erasure as connection. No moralizing; the moonlit harbor song is the non-literal answer. Complexity is honored—joyful sorrow is accepted, not cured.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges entirely from the accretion of torn-out faces and matched threads: love refuses to stay in the footnotes. The ending’s volcanic tenderness is the inverse of explosive—it is the quiet eruption of continuity, reweighting every prior theft as fidelity rather than vandalism. No character lectures us; the last whispered “I’m keeping it” is image, not moral. The refusal to display both portrait versions would break the story’s moral logic; that double exposure is the only possible stance.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from percussion-concrete imagery: shared rhythm as new consciousness. No final moralizing; last line is imagistic song. Subtext in drumming dialogue—evasion-to-acceptance encoded in fingertip pressure. Auroral sorrow tone modulates from dread to bittersweet dawn, reweighted by lagoon’s gold spiral. Complexity accepted: merger is neither wholly loss nor triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: knowledge through attentive silence versus blundering visibility. The folded-map motif evolves from tool to metaphor—maps become “layers of the labyrinth’s evolution,” reweighting the premise at closure. Subtext in the woman’s first line—“You’re listening”—carries double meaning: surveillance and initiation. Final image of aurora painting “mystery and promise” offers a non-literal answer: mystery is the new orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from image pattern: silent empathy > spoken testimony. Subtext sits in the mirror flashes and constellation code—never translated into moral. Final image reweights “teach darkness the value of stars” without stating it. No echoic epiphany; the after-effect is the city waking to stellar eviction map. Ambiguity remains: will the map win?—a plausible counter-reading that keeps the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars—chess pieces, window symbols, misted glass—rather than slogans. The forest of second thoughts is never lectured; it accretes through sketches and synchronized quiet. Final image of the glowing library reframes the premise: rebellion can be a soft light that makes geometry waver, avoiding tidy moral. Subtext in dialogue (“I hear unspoken words”) carries double meaning that rewards re-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of self-detachment emerges through dock/bone/sea particulars; no final moralizing. “Com-bative tenderness” modulates from mockery to shared vulnerability, re-weighted in final hand-squeeze. Ambiguity remains—will the island surface?—but emotional reconfiguration is complete.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: sanctioned performance vs. unsanctioned mourning. The bouquet’s reprise reweights “lightness” as shared carrying rather than erasure. No moralizing—final image is silent whittling, inviting the reader to complete the meaning. Subtext operates in gesture: the hand-off of flowers replaces any declaration of love.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: language as aesthetic flux versus authoritarian fixity. The frozen lake’s ephemeral wind-drawn patterns objectify the poetry ideal; quartz frequencies bypass words entirely. Final image—poetry “remembering how to breathe”—reweights prior material without moralizing. No abstract thesis statements; subtext lives in gesture and setting. Complexity is honored: ambiguity is both liberation and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges without sermon: imperfection as beauty is shown via traded objects and the final reed image, never asserted. Subtext resides in gesture—Maya palm-weighing the tarnished reed—rather than exposition. The concept integrates with fantasy frame (phoenix, dream-trance) so metaphor and plot are mutually reinforcing. No tidy moral appears; ambiguity lingers about future awakenings, satisfying complexity requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particular rather than label: the recovery of “sounds between words” becomes a parable for post-collapse rebuilding. Final image of two strangers bathed in golden lamp-light offers non-literal answer—connection is not found but allowed to pass through you. Subtext operates in gesture: the volunteer’s dropping shoulders do the emotional work that exposition avoids. No final-paragraph sermon; resonance is felt via the re-lit lamp and the shared silence after the recording ends.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of “genuinely artificial”: jewelry, stars, paper cranes—all fake things made true by use. No moralizing; final image lets the reader feel the paradox. Subtext in silence: Senna never names her loss, yet the brooch speaks. “Subdued ardor” avoids sentimentality by keeping joy quiet and star-scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges implicitly: knowledge survives only when encoded in the era’s dominant language (silicon then, cartomancy now). The measuring-tape’s reprise at dawn becomes the non-literal answer—geometry links ancestors to algorithms without a moral stated. Subtext rests in Marcus’s silence after Vesper names the maps “myth-branch circuits,” letting the rain do the emotional talking. No echoing thesis lines appear; the final image of “endlessly recombining patterns” reweights prior material with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges without statement: transcendence is a trap disguised as transcendence. The pagoda’s “warning disguised as wisdom” reconfigures the concept of forbidden knowledge itself—truth that poisons by being true. The final image of her unveiled face recharges the opening saffron veil, turning the color from badge of piety into banner of refusal. No moralizing sentence; the emotional aftereffect is the ache of having to choose imperfection on purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges cleanly: commodification bleeds hope of its shadow, and only unpolished regret remains honest. The reprise of the river stone beside the copied files reweights the motif without sermonizing. Subtext is woven through image—gardens stripped of thorns, laughter tuned to frequency—avoiding thesis statements. The final sentence’s “luminous regret” risks echoing the prompt, but the phrase is earned by the footage montage and grandmother’s dream, so the abstraction feels inevitable, not grafted.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: the moral calculus of compassionate observation vs empirical rigor is never sloganized; the final image of starlight “reconstructing itself from scattered pieces” reweights the title concept without moralizing. The chameleon’s shed skin recurs with shifted meaning—first biological fact, then ethical mandate—earning its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges concretely: scars and silence speak louder than smooth surfaces. The meteor hush literalizes the cost of being heard. Final image—blood christening frozen time—reweights the central question from “how to forget” to “how to testify.” No moralizing; resonance arises from the hourglass’s impossible stasis colliding with living blood.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Voice is perceptual, synesthetic, and稳定的：“slow thoughts pressing against her mind, patient and green” is idiosyncratic yet legible. Compression (“morphine fog lifted”) teaches the reader to accept lyric elision early; payoff is the frozen-time final line. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly with Mara. Register remains consistent: scientific diction (electromagnetic frequencies) is filtered through a grief-stricken, drug-residual mind.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from image pattern: film as petrified love → map as circulation → rain as released song, all without authorial thesis. Final non-literal answer: “forgotten lyrics finding their tune” reweights prior material, making unuttered affection socially consequential after all. Subtext operates in silence—hands almost touching, letters unsent—never explained. Emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader left hearing that rain-song, aware that unspent feeling still quests for new hearts.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—art vs. formulaic control—emerges through the Keeper’s backstory and Celestine’s final imperfect trace; the closing imperative “Create” offers resonant non-literal answer, avoiding moralizing, though the thematic counter-argument (value of precision) is briefly asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges as: nurturing possibility demands personal forfeiture of private futures (dreams). No explicit thesis; final image of seeds rooting across timelines reweights earlier “dreamless” state into sacrificial credential. Subtext in the frozen clock’s single tick implies even persuaded time extracts a toll. Complexity lingers—some forests burn forever—avoiding moral symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges as “knowledge beyond conscious logic”; it is never sermonized, only embodied in the gear-sequence and the final hologram. The closing line reweights the entire journey without moralizing, meeting the 9- gate. A hairline deduction for the slightly on-the-nose phrase “probable miracles crystallize into certainty,” which edges toward thesis-statement.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: tether as life-contract, punch-hole as consent aperture. No explicit thesis; the shoreline-lullaby tone lulls then reconfigures safety as stagnation. Final image of running into dark offers resonant non-literal answer—freedom is unlit, not found but entered. Ambiguity lingers: courage or mere loss? Complexity upheld.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: the cost of collective safety is that someone stays silent so others can speak later. Bolt, discoloration, and numb fingers form a returning motif whose final re-weighting occurs when she realizes “the grace was in not paying it alone.” No moral is stated; the image of two players in a broken room while snow buries prints offers an open, resonant answer that reframes every prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory is fragile yet self-righting; truth, like oil, will surface if patiently loosened. Subtext operates in marginalia that“write themselves,”a lovely image of history self-correcting. Final starlight drift re-prices the idea of guardianship—Ossian’s eternal vigil is both necessary and beautifully adequate. No moralizing, only an indelible after-image of quiet cosmic maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the convergence of personal heirloom and planetary archive: human commerce literally carved memory into water, now playback indicts; subtext lives in the grandfather’s idle rhythm, not exposition; final image of “listening” reweights prior material without moralizing; avoids tidy eco-aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: failed revolutions recycle oppressor logic; true resistance requires perceptual revolution. Subtext is carried by the opera glasses—tool for “seeing differently”—and the hum that predates human empires. Final image reweights prior debris into pattern without moralizing. No tidy thesis statement; the sentence on the stones is allowed because it is archaic command, not authorial summary. Emotional aftereffect lingers as uneasy humility.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of symbiotic evolution emerges from amber, script, and spores—never stated. Final image of golden blood and green whispers reweights all prior resistance into collaborative future. No moralizing; the kite’s spent flutter is silent corroboration. Complexity remains: the Authority still looms, the land still poisoned, the gift unproven.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through vegetal metaphor: invasion coated into luminous survival. No abstract statement—idea is encoded in oyster/image, cereus bloom, seedling transplant. The pregnant couple’s wonder reframes Mira’s private arc without moralizing, letting reader feel that attentive waiting can coexist with irreparable loss. Final image reweights earlier motifs—photo released, seedlings anchored—answering the thematic question non-literally.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: rejected portraits → fragmented reality → acceptance of fracture as truth. No explicit moral, final image reconfigures premise with quiet fire. Recurrent lighthouse beam and tarot faces build accretive meaning without forced motif-checklist. One hairline slip: “Isn’t art supposed to comfort…” drifts toward editorial question;所幸被下文的燃烧意象迅速抵消。

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through pattern, not lecture: ephemeral ink = ephemeral perception = the price of full attention. Final image reweights the chase: justice is no longer a binary delivery but a moment stretched until it hurts. Avoids moral arithmetic; Kael neither forgives nor absolves, he simply sees more now. The refrain “time slows in crisis” could feel slogan-ish, but it’s earned because the story has literally enacted it in the reader’s elapsed reading time.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—what we owe the truth when survival depends on forgetting—emerges through the vault’s frozen silence and the single thawed witness, never through exposition. Subtext lives in gesture: feeding the letter to the incinerator is a quiet communion with the past. Final image of “liberated ash” offers non-literal, resonant answer. No moralizing sentence dilutes the ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Continuity-through-chaos emerges from grafted canvas and remembered petals, never from overt thesis. The final image of clean light reweights “engraved quiet” from abstract ideal to lived, costly reality. Father’s blade and daughter’s sheathed refusal create dramatic irony: reader sees the bounty hunter disarm himself with a teacup. Theme stays complex—pacifism is not triumphant but fragile, still needing protection.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges as the paradox of capturing unfiltered emotion through deliberate artifice: Mara engineers silence to net the one feeling that refuses engineering. The constellations’ sleepwalking literalizes the idea that patterns only pretend to be fixed; when they drift, meaning becomes negotiable. No character states this; the garden’s acoustics and the final nested heartbeat argue it subtextually. The lullaby stays feral—no moral tames it—so the aftertaste is wary wonder, not cosmic reassurance.</answer>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter yet never leaks into head-hopping; diction (“compressed-air pools,” “feral lullaby”) is precise, compressed, and pattern-consistent. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer clauses during constellation drift, staccato fragments at spike vibration. Metaphors remain within the sonic domain—no jarring register leap—so voice feels authored, not algorithmic. The only near-slip is “neural pathways,” a clinical phrase that momentarily lifts us out of mythic diction.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: silence-as-orbit vs. intervention-as-escape. The final image of dawn glowing on clouds reweights the earlier “above the clouds” insulation into a cost she now owns. No moral is declared; the reader is left to feel the spiral ascending, not circular and endless.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from sound/cry mistranslation → listening as moral act; no explicit thesis. Subtext in “wasp forever mid-flight” mirrors her suspended guilt. Final image of clear amber re-prices fossilized avoidance into open listening. Resists moral binaries: no mechanical forgiveness, only perpetual attentiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges bodily: memory is not retrieved but re-sculpted in shared silence. Subtext lives in gesture—tile pressed to temple, chalk circling inward—never stated. Final lilac mist reframed as sacred hush reweights the initial unease without moralizing. No echo is token; each whisper bends the pattern’s geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without sermon: memory as insurgency, naming as refusal to let empire finish its erasure. The mosaic’s re-weighting—from prison to testament—supplies the final resonance image, a quiet answer that needs no moral spelled out. Subtext lives in gesture: Layla’s steel hands cradle rather than crush, a reversal of their design that the reader completes. Only a breath of meta-commentary (“this was her gentle radicalism”) slightly surfaces the theme; it is early enough not to undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: art’s immortality demands the artist’s mortality. Subtext resides in synesthetic pleasure that devours its source—color that tastes like copper is beauty laced with blood. Final spiral reweights closure: encore is infinite yet she is absent, resolving longing into luminous absence. No moralizing; resonance arises from image of garden forever playing her colors.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of sovereignty-through-transparency emerges via mica layers and light-paths, never sermonized. “Willowglass hope” is dramatized in Chen’s “delicate as spun glass” line—fragile but present. No tidy moral; the image of fractal maps as escape routes reweights the premise. Avoids thematic echo; insight stays implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: translation across unbridgeable temporal orders is possible only through surrender of sovereign identity. Subtext resides in fossil—once alive, now stone—mirroring Maren’s transition from mapper to medium. Final image of “genuine communion” reweights prior isolation without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is fusion transcendent or erasure?—inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from concrete particular—buttons as prophecy, echo as communal mirror—rather than direct assertion. The final image of visitors adding their own buttons turns the archive into a “living map,” reweighting loss as ongoing connection without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: the prophecy is not prevention but possibility. Subtext operates in gesture (jar placement) and institutional silence, avoiding tidy thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of “repair through fracture” emerges via the engraved line “You were never broken, only afraid,” but the story avoids final-paragraph sermon by letting the image of Marcus walking downhill carry the insight. Snow-codes literalize the idea that damage can encode evidence, a fresh particular rather than abstract maxim. Complexity is respected: no tidy redemption, only a costly stance crystallized. Subtext in silence—Marcus grips the box, says nothing—carries as much weight as text.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from palimpsest object and fog metaphor: life is accretive, not extractive. Subtextual delivery—no character states thesis; insight is dramatized when coachman speaks. Final image reweights premise without moral: needle remains, layers stay. Ambiguity preserved—no adjudication which layer is “truest.” Organic resonance avoids tidy profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges inductively from honeycomb imagery, vessel metaphors, and phototropic kindness; no explicit moralizing. Final image reweights prior material by fusing pottery patience with beekeeping gentleness—earned CR. Ambiguity lingers: will she spread oasis-praxis or simply endure? Complexity embraced; no false equivalence. One abstract noun (“kindness”) is spoken aloud, but framed as potter’s realization, softening echo penalty to hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through mirrored refraction rather than statement: protection-through-vulnerability, locksmith logic translated to horticulture. The gauge tooth’s re-purposing as garden talisman reconfigures “opening” from security to exposure. Final paragraph’s “stubborn and green” avoids moralizing, letting image resonate. Ambiguity lingers—will the rose return?—inviting reflection without tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from image pattern—wall reflections, blank pages, shadowless sundial—rather than exposition. Subtext in her refusal to leave the library: she chooses curated extinction over risking new erasure. Final sentence crystallizes the thematic reversal: “She was no longer the last of anything. She was the first of something new.” No closing moral; the reader carries the paradox of survival as ongoing translation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: private loneliness braided into collective narrative is shown through objects, never asserted. The thrush-nest spiral reweights from biological accident to sacred architecture, re-pricing secrecy as shared shelter. Final image of rippling reflection plus flying thrush answers the core question—connection exists—without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo: no character utters “we are all threads.”

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from the concrete: entertainment vs. empathy, ancient boredom vs. human pattern-making. No character articulates a thesis; the final laughter that is “warmer, intrigued” reweights the opening fear into uneasy coexistence. Subtext resides in silence—no overt human gratitude, only fading colors—so the reader feels the loneliness of stewardship. The refusal to moralize keeps ambiguity alive; the closing image of updated charts shows maintenance, not victory, resisting tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: freedom belongs to those who walk the old ways, not to line-drawers. The wistful rebellion is shown through dusty motes, sealed cathedral, and silent city above—never sermonized. Final image of compass pointing “down, always down” offers non-literal answer, reweighting official maps as lies. No final-paragraph moralizing; resonance is earned through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges without statement: empathy is a portrait no one face can capture, only feel. Final image of ribbon returned to Elena reweights the motif—“dormant empathy” becomes the active artifact. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete paradox of a face-blind artist painting recognition. Subtext in Morrison’s grief-tinged voice and Elena’s unknowing silence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—exile as choice, not condemnation—emerges through the nail, the journals, the ancestor’s alleged cowardice; no moral is stated, only the final image of two women stepping sideways out of catastrophe. The concept reweights earlier material: the coffin nail becomes liberation rather than imprisonment. Subtext in Kao’s silence and mirrored coffee mugs hints at complicity without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: art as debugging algorithm for existential pixelation—music grants higher rendering. No explicit moral; final image of dissolved flake + aching arm reweights earlier tech/photo motif without sermon. Subtext resides in silence of resolved figures—reader must supply their gratitude or absence thereof, inviting reflection. The concept resists tidy binaries: she enables passage yet remains outsider, theme left in charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the currency-as-map motif: borders crossed become borders internalized. No overt thesis; final image of “ancient and knotted… loosening” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence: father touches bills but cannot name regret until Marco offers substitution. Ambiguity is productive—reader cannot be sure father will stay, but the possibility now exists with cost. No echo of prompt language; no final-paragraph sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: shared observation as antidote to collective trauma. The variable-star language reweights grief into measurable cycles, letting cosmic pulsing literalize emotional cadence. Subtext thrives in silence—the telegram’s pressed daylily speaks louder than any epitaph. Final image reprises early "eye" metaphor but now with two pupils, achieving CR that reconfigures the premise: knowledge is not owned but witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—people freeze themselves inside their own false reflection—emerges through image-chain: mirror shard, suspended scream, seeds that eat illusions. No explicit thesis until the final line, which conceptually re-prices every prior search Maren has made. Subtext in the apprentice’s clutch: he keeps the pouch even while paralyzed—guilt literally in hand. Ambiguity is preserved: we never learn what Maren saw, only that she refuses to carry anyone else’s lie.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—trauma as navigational tool—emerges through the scar-link image rather than authorial statement. Subtext is strongest in the clipping’s dissolution: order fertilizes new possibility. No final-paragraph moralizing; the thematic echo (“purposefully curious”) is used twice but never unpacked, blunting resonance. Counter-readings are plausible: the merger may repeat the old covenant’s hubris, but the text does not seed this doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the ruined Lovers card: love of self includes love of wound. Subtext lives in gesture—roots tightening “lovingly” around bones mirrors Marcus clinging to borrowed happiness. No explicit thesis; the final image of the card on stone reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Complexity lingers: happiness can kill when worn by wrong skeleton.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of “after-applause” solitude emerges through image chain—cloth as prayer flag, silence of roadie labor—never sermonized. Subtext in Sarah’s impatient foot-tap and Marcus’s glass-tilt conveys stakes without theme labels. Final image reweights earlier motif: grille-cloth sway now signals quiet persistence, not lost glory. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers on future failure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the contradiction between routine and surprise; the mobile’s ever-new constellation of unchanged fish offers a non-literal answer to the question of becoming without future. No character sermonizes; the lighthouse scroll’s unbuilt silhouette carries the thematic weight. Final image reweights prior motifs (creel, gears, moon) without moral tag. Ambiguity is purposeful: routine is both suffocating and salvific. Emotional aftereffect is wistful buoyancy rather than despair—an honest complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: archived beauty calcifies unless returned to circulation. Subtext carried by glowing artifacts—each hums with deferred life. Final image of caves breathing communal light reweights “survival” into shared radiance without moralizing. Achieves conceptual repricing: preservation is revealed as slow loss unless paid for by vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from pattern: river’s non-judgmental carriage of sediment contaminant = model for self-forgiveness. No thesis stated; final tile-question is image, not moral. Graffiti conversation and ivy reclamation externalize internal shift without allegory. Resonance lingers: reader forced to reweight earlier “contamination” metaphors as acceptance not damage.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of chosen silence versus imposed silence emerges through concrete volumes; grandmother’s voluntary surrender of estate reframes fraud as yearned-for intimacy. Final image—library paths stay open—non-literally answers how unvoiced words survive: they wait for someone willing to hear. No moralizing; ambiguity remains (will she publish or protect?). Subtextual weight rests in watch demoted from cipher to plain timepiece, signaling release of ancestral grasp.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through vegetal persistence imagery: “seeds know how to break through concrete” becomes the enacted strategy of dispersing truth. No explicit moral; the final smile while typing irradiates the mulberry ache—propagation over possession—without pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty as defiance of obliteration, not stated but enacted through pigment, light, and thermal calculus. Aurora-as-pattern and emerald chip reweight from pretty backdrop to cosmic Morse code in the final image—pure Conceptual Repricing. No authorial thesis, only particularized ritual. The “radiant hush” tonally mirrors theme without announcing it.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the repeating image of ascent–descent and the hairpin’s migration: contentment is practice, not destination. Subtext resides in gesture—the silent rice offering says more than any apology scene. The final line’s “endless, contented cycle” offers a non-literal, resonant answer without moralizing, meeting the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from particular: Vincent’s unanswered note, the shard’s refraction, the triple chime overlay. No moral stated; final image of rainbow fragments on wood reweights “certainty” as poverty. Protected vulnerability and sincere insincerity are lived, not asserted. Complexity is embraced—she’s still afraid yet free, wrong yet necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of transitive memory emerges organically from the paradox of teaching what one will forget; final image reweights earlier ripples as metaphor for knowledge waves the teacher will never ride. Avoids overt thesis statement, letting resonance accrue through image. Minor slack: “sycamore hush” is named twice rather than shown through new sensory evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory as navigational infrastructure, time as audible strata, stewardship as stillness. Subtext lives in gesture—the arrowhead’s silence, the ravens’ spirals—never translated into moral. Final image reweights earlier material: “echoes would wait” reframes centuries as collaborator, not burden. No platitudes or thematic echo lines. Ambiguity is purposeful: network may still fail, cost is accepted. Integrated with character arc—his patience is the thematic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: automated perfection vs. imperfect human persistence; the final re-pricing rejects achievement in favor of attentive being. No explicit moralizing; the grandmother’s quoted line is dramatized by the limestone’s eventual response, not explained. Ambiguity lingers—Maren gains no measurable power, yet the shift feels complete, inviting reader reflection. The motif of “worthless” object regained carries resonance without schematic symbolism because it physically hosts the final glow.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: translation across sensory loss—sound into color, memory into living algae—never named, only enacted. Grandfather’s question “what color was the symphony” is re-weighted in the final image; answer is the ascending lanterns themselves, a conceptual repricing that leaves moral ambiguity intact. No moralizing; the reader is left to hear/see the silence. Subtext operates in gestures: key hung on empty hook = vow transferred, not completed.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: value itself becomes a transmissible frequency across civilizational endings. No abstract sermon—coins’ reprise at end reweights “medium of exchange” into “medium of continuity.” Subtext operates in Kael’s silent return of staff—doubt converted off-page yet visible in collective action. Final image avoids moral; it crystallizes meaning without dictating it, satisfying CR. Quiet cynic-to-hope arc for Kael supplies emotional aftereffect, though thematic complexity remains moderate at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: naming fear converts abstract loss into bearable artifact. Sea-monster motif evolves from medieval superstition to personal cartography of grief, re-weighted in final pocketing. Subtext lives in silence—Daniel never appears—so the empty observatory stands for every lover who cannot be touched. Final image offers non-literal answer: the named dragon is not slain but carried, a resonant reconfiguration of mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: value of “lukewarm” capacities re-prices the heroic ideal. The final image—exhausted mage, elongated shadow—invites reflection on quiet restitution versus spectacle. No moralizing; the ocean’s partial return carries ambiguous cost, resisting tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory is a levee that will break whether water or silence presses against it.  Subtext lives in the photograph silence—no one speaks while images speak for them.  The sapphire label’s reprise revalues kitsch into relic, a micro-model of the town’s repricing.  Final image of chime ringing at dawn offers non-literal answer: meaning resurfaces, then must be re-buried under duty.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: science-sentiment duality is enacted through objects—crystal, handkerchief, brass burner—rather than asserted. The starlings’ final sky-writing offers a non-literal answer: understanding is not a formula but a living murmuration that includes feeling. Subtext is embedded in gesture (the secret touch of the handkerchief) and silence (she never confesses to the Academy). The ending resists moralizing; the reader is left to feel the repricing rather than hear a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges from her refusal to bend data—truth-telling as resistance to institutional erosion—without sermonizing. Subtext operates in radio silences and buckle squeezes. Final image of arbor “singing with light” reweights premise: nature’s order indifferent to human trust, yet worth defending. Avoids tidy moral; complexity intact. Could use one more concrete particular to pierce 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of wholeness-through-fracture emerges from the duplicated brain and mirrored selves, never sermonized. Final image reprises the jar as literal and figurative third lobe of motherhood, reweighting “DUPLICATE” into synergy. The piece avoids pat moral equivalence: numbness is weaponized, passion is warned it may smother. Resonance lingers in the paradox that only a divided self can raise an undivided child.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: ingenuity turned outward to protect collective imagination rather than consume itself on a solitary bloom. Subtext carries in gesture—photographing the seed (evidence) versus casting it away (refusal). Final image of moonlit water reweights the premise: mystery is not treasure but contamination. No tidy moral, only a stance crystallized with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically: grief can be tuned, not banished, using the humblest instruments. The mockingbird lullaby migrates from infant memory to broken duet, reweighting “mocking” as echo rather than substitution. No moral is stated; the final line offers quiet conceptual repricing. Subtext in gesture—Sarah’s hand still on the cord—carries more than any dialogue could.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges as the cost of guardianship: to protect knowledge she must volunteer for her own erasure. Subtext carried in object—pendant is both key and wound—so theme stays implicit. Final image reweights “uncertainty” from mantra to survival tool; the smile is earned endurance, not moral. No closing sermon, only ash drifting across palm.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Creative destruction emerges organically: every failed crucible becomes ingredient for the next life. The Church’s rigid authority is literally unmade into something that “could bend without breaking,” a non-literal answer to the thematic question. No moralizing—Cassia’s smile is image, not thesis. The frozen bloom of tears links destruction and beauty in one tactile moment that re-weights all prior “useless frost patterns.”

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: endings are beginnings in disguise; no moralizing, only image-driven re-pricing of silence as canvas; the motif of transformation (phoenix song, chrysalis city) recurs with accruing pressure, charging the final line without overt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: paradox as vessel, transit as identity, and the cost of collapsing uncertainty into singular reality. No character sermonizes; the final sideways sand image reweights the earlier “clocks run sideways” motif without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—was merger salvation or violation—but complexity is embraced, not flattened. Previous hourglass dialogue (“tension between what was and what might be”) is the sole faint echo of thematic echo; it escapes heavy penalty by arriving mid-story, not in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: the mutable pattern of sinew externalizes the mutability of memory; the closing line gifts the installation to “the next architect,” a quiet Conceptual Repricing that reframes the gallery itself as an endless reweaving—no moralizing, only resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: navigation is not certainty but willingness to inhabit boundaries between knowable and unknowable. The chain link’s journey from human certainty to alien glow enacts this without commentary. Subtext in silence when Carta simply traces the constellation says more than any epiphany could. Final image of two species tracing edges together offers non-literal answer—shared vulnerability at horizons of perception—avoiding moralizing statement. No thematic echo of the prompt phrase; meaning arises solely from embodied particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through the spectral pulse motif: love keeps broadcasting after death, demanding audience. Subtext lives in gesture—Lily’s hand trembling around the photograph says more than exposition about coercive control. Final image of two women beneath ferns while the aid falls silent offers resonant non-literal answer: protection can outlast mortality. One soft moral line: “That was the thing about hearts…” edges toward thesis but is saved by its placement mid-story, not in last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges as “memory is maintained by action, not monuments”—the codex, cables, and camera are all networks that outlive individual voices. No explicit thesis is stated; resonance is in the final image of ocean reclaiming the unmarked station. Medieval margin + undersea cable fusion gives fresh historical depth. Ambiguity lingers: will anyone believe her plates? Complexity is embraced—no moral is spoon-fed.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of transmutation—loss into legible resonance—emerges through the tactile-to-sound alchemy rather than assertion. Final image reweights “curse” into “fulfillment” without moralizing. Recurring texture motif (rough/smooth/sharp) migrates from bone to music, charging closure. No thematic echo violations; ambiguity lingers about whether the new chorus is consolation or haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from particulars: returned bodies, upward-falling stones, and a laugh traveling static create an argument that transformation may be benevolent predation. No character moralizes; even Old Marrow’s “better version” line is offered as hypothesis. The final question—“do they come back at all?”—invites ambiguity between loss and ascension without thesis. The frostbitten-hope tonality reweights earlier winter imagery into possible spring inside the earth.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of metamorphosis emerges through iterated hollows: locust shell, emptied statues, split tree trunk. Final image—“eternal space between chrysalis and wing”—re-weights earlier motifs without moralising. Subtext operates in silence: factory whistles stop, clouds slow. Ambiguity is productive; no tidy restoration of full magic keeps complexity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of reclamation-as-revelation emerges through concrete acts: sanding splinters, soldering scrap, letting wind become motion. No thesis statements; the final image of gleaming hands reaching for more salvage offers a resonant, non-moral answer to silence’s possibility. Subtext operates in gesture—the unspoken hymn is the real manifesto. Ambiguity is intact: the sculpture may never be seen, the carpenter may never stop.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges from the concrete catalog of poetic-scientific hybrids and the scarf-as-topology-tool; no character sermonizes “stories have geometry.” The final image—library breathing, time folding—offers a non-literal answer without moral tag. Ambiguity is purposeful: is the pocket dimension real or shared hallucination? The emotional aftereffect is wonder grounded in paper dust, not abstraction. Only minor drift: the phrase “mathematics of wonder” flirts with thesis-statement but is single and early.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of “longing as traversable medium” emerges through concrete recurrence of light-images and palette; the closing Conceptual Repricing re-weights disappearance as collaboration, not loss. No overt moralizing; ambiguity lingers—will she re-emerge?—but the epiphany feels slightly rehearsed, not hard-won in a single gritty beat.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from concrete image—city as living brain, streets as synapses—rather than slogans; no final-paragraph thesis statement. The “enveloped secrets” motif is recharged when Mara physically steps inside the skull-like room of doors, making abstraction visceral. Subtext of collective denial is carried by silence: no citizen appears, implying complicity. Final image offers resonant ambiguity—new locksmith born, meaning the city will keep ingesting truth-seekers—without moralising.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory is food, not artifact. Subtext coils through reversed preservation logic—canning kills, digesting keeps alive. Final image of glowing bag ascending past “sleeping guardians” reweights earlier shipwreck pattern as completed ritual, not scenery. No tidy moral; the cost is felt in her relinquishing archival control.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: brokenness as lens, exile as reversible through self-reading. Subtext resides in gestures—backwards walking, tea-leaf copying—rather than thesis statements. Final image of “two exiles discovering… walking in unexpected directions” offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids final-paragraph sermon; wisdom stays anchored in concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the concrete act of preservation, never abstract assertion: the story asks what color is worth a drop of blood and answers with the image of a sunrise-swollen seed left in cliff soil. Subtext resides in gestures—cradling, coaxing, pressing seed into mist-damp earth—rather than commentary. The ending resists moral; it offers a charged poise where perpetual generosity and personal loss coexist. Motif of heirloom constellations reweights from antique curiosity to cosmic stewardship at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—secrets devour both keeper and kept—emerges through the net’s knots and the whispered names, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: the fisherman’s trembling hands, Maren’s anticipatory finger flex, the net’s gradual misting. The prism’s refraction of names into starlight offers a visual re-pricing of memory without abstract statement. No tidy moral; the lingering after-image is the cost of being witness.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as living cartography that updates itself, demanding empathy-driven interpretation. The rotated stone and question-mark cracks are concrete particulars that reweight “whispers” from curse to collaborative inquiry. No moral is stated; the final image of Maren leaving the doors open answers the thematic question by stance alone. Subtext in the branching crack-shape and the torn moorland gap invites lingering ambiguity about what any map leaves out.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: transmission as compassion—art turns isolation into shared circuitry. Moonflowers, starlight petals, and code-ghost reprise “pressed life” motif; final electrical thank-you reconfigures meaning of her earlier “preserving what would otherwise fade.” No moralizing; question lingers: who is more alive, singer or signal? Subtext in her hum = memory as resistance against erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from particulars: service as conduit for rehumanization, not moral. Goggles’ refracted light = internal thaw; no allegory forced. Final image of “messily, affectionately alive” reweights earlier frozen corridors without sermon. Ambiguity remains: she may fail, but choice is real.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from concrete cloud emblems: virga = memory without landing. The final CR flips “empty” to “full of everything the sky had ever felt,” reweighting the premise without moralizing. No echoic thesis statement; idea is felt through image. Quiet ending carries lingering ambiguity that invites re-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges without statement: the limit of empiricism when the data are human. Subtext resides in the empty book-safe—knowledge once stored, now gone, like the sitter’s identity. The final star-glint in painted eyes reweights the coin’s worn profile into cosmic indifference; recognition is a luxury the universe also denies. No moral is declared; the emotional after-effect is a hush of respectful defeat.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: fracture as beauty, repair as translation rather than cure. The driftwood image re-appears in the final paragraph, re-weighted from decay to resilient adornment—an earned non-literal answer. No epiphany is spoken; the resonance stays in the image of imperfect gears ticking. Ambiguity is preserved: the world will fracture again, and that is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without thesis lines: collective survival is built not on abstract unity but on iterative, low-stakes trades that rewire trust. Final image of nebula above arch conceptually re-prices “respite” as process, not place—stars forming from prior collapse. No sermon; Kessa’s double bell-ring is gesture-only subtext that community now speaks for itself. Ambiguity remains: ghosts can’t enter the future they enable, a cost left resonant rather than resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges as the paradox of tender control—attempting to mother a species that will never know its babysitter. Subtext lives in the puppet head: a broken toy entrusted with cosmic strings, implying that caretakers are themselves marionettes. No abstraction is sermonized; the final line “We sang our song” lets the reader price the song’s value. Ambiguity is purposeful: the lullaby may be futile, yet the act of singing redefines meaning, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges as inheritance transformed into chosen service; “graceless beauty” reframes from oxymoron to ethic. Subtext sits in the engineer’s failure vs. Maren’s success, but the uncle’s motives remain off-page, muting full irony. Final image avoids moralizing, letting nut-star alignment resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: divergence (five channels) as prerequisite for reunion (ocean) is dramatized by the ash ritual, not stated. Chrysalis reweights from death artifact to “doorway,” charging closure. Final humming image offers non-literal answer to “loosened grief” without moralizing. Minor echo penalty: “separation and connection weren’t opposites but movements in the same symphony” is overt thesis—drop −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges obliquely: erasure is not deletion but re-orchestration of fragments. The final image of clouds “arranging themselves into something that might, finally, cohere” reweights prior scattered motifs without moralizing, delivering a quiet CR that invites counter-readings about penal reform and narrative agency.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of “bearing the unbearable” emerges through gesture, not thesis: kneading grief like dough, sanding memory’s edges. Final tear is resonant reconfiguration—private, bearable sorrow replaces oceanic remorse. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about future contagion. Image of fortress that “no longer wept” offers sturdy lyric closure without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without sermon: silos shift from symbols of separation to organs of chorus. The final image of Mara “already planning” silently reframes the astronomical clock as metronome for a living future, not a preserved past. Subtext resides in the stolen weight—preservation sacrificed for living culture—yet the ethical cost is whispered, not confronted. The refusal to moralize invites reflection on whether harmony justifies larceny.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: the refrac­tion trove of “abandoned purpose” reweights memory itself as salvageable geology. The final image answers the implicit question—can discarded futures be reclaimed?—by showing them physically re-lighted, not moralized. No late thematic echo; the canyon’s aliveness stays mysterious, inviting counter-readings of benevolence or menace.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from marginalia itself—knowledge hidden in liminal spaces—mirrored by the grotto’s liminal gravity. No explicit thesis is stated; instead the final image of Lyra planting new doodles reconfigures the meaning of “margins” from passive to activist. The numeric fireflies act as charged motif, returning in altered form as the blazing seeds she now carries. Ambiguity lingers: will dissemination liberate or further bury truth? Complexity is embraced, not tidied.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of fracture-as-voice emerges organically from porcelain physics and lightning-scarred wood; final image of silent birds listening reweights silence itself as participatory, avoiding explicit moral—yet message drifts close to thesis (“she could teach it to sing again”), slightly softening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the reframing of consent: legality without voiced suffering is tyranny. No thematic echo statement; the realization stays inside the sensory moment. Final image reweights the stone and the hum as instruments of non-violent subversion. Ambiguity remains—covenant may still renew—but the moral calculus is irreversibly altered.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme of empathy-as-frequency emerges through concrete image (clasp vibration, fireworks thunder) rather than assertion. Final reconfiguration—empathy is listening without decoding—offers resonant non-literal answer. The diary’s unopened pages keep thematic ambiguity fertile. No moralizing, no thesis line; silence is repriced as active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the specific horticultural trick—trees grafted across their own timelines—rather than a tagged maxim. The closing image reprises “whirling silence” now freighted with paradoxical strength, achieving resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: who were the Cultivators, and what price attends multi-temporal life? The almost-on-the-nose line “resilience wasn’t about resistance…” keeps it sub-9; cutting that sentence would let the image alone reprice the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges: disasters are not random but the emergent architecture of unexamined systems. Subtext operates through spatial metaphor—containers as chess pieces, wind as invisible agency—avoiding overt thesis. Final image reweights the father’s dictum: foresight is endless redesign, not retrospective understanding. Resonance is cerebral; absence of a body-level cost keeps it from top-band poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as “failure is the tuition for transcendence.” Subtext carried in the hollow reed itself—empty tube becomes conduit. Final image reweights earlier “beautiful cage for silence” into “door opening between forever.” No moral stated; resonance arises from specific inversion of custodial duty, not abstract maxim.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from the equation-images: emotion as radiation, love = fear + hope / distance. No moral stated; final image of borrowed smile reweights prior motifs. Resonance is oblique yet undeniable—reader left to feel the cost of empathy-as-instrument. Quiet ending earns its stance through particulars, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: relics transform carriers, not cargo; wonder germinates in routine crossroads. The seed-recipient cycle is shown through three encounters rather than stated. The final image of planting at a crossroads reprises the merchant’s “forgotten places” line and reweights it—now Kael is the sower, not the courier. No moralizing paragraph; the only near-statement is the Keeper’s concise lecture, which is framed as in-world lore and balanced by Kael’s earned silence.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from refractive surfaces holding human residue; no explicit thesis stated. “Truthful lies” paradox lets the ending dramatize the uneasy merger of empiricism and mysticism. The frost-etched child-hand image reweights the earlier car-crash memory without moralizing. Subtext in silence—Elena pocketing the prism instead of proclaiming victory—shows respect for grief’s privacy.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of reciprocal rescue emerges from concrete acts (weaving, crossing) rather than statement. Final image reweights “home” as liminal space—Conceptual Repricing. Subtext runs through silence: Kenji’s breathed name vs. the loom’s click. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity remains—will she return whole? Emotional aftereffect lingers without tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of quiet resilience emerges through the forge metaphor—metal and crystal fused to make ruin fertile—never stated as thesis. The silk’s “memory” subtextually asks what traditions we trade away to survive; the answer is paid when the strip fades and the magician leaves, implying future debts. Final image refuses triumphalism: thousands more trees still need saving, resonance without moral. Only minor deduction for the magician’s line “You’re not meek at all,” a faint echo of thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges as the inverse of rescue: love is letting go of the singular beloved to save uncountable strangers. No thesis statements—only the final taste of “goodbye” reweights every earlier fold. The shard’s green glass originally promised reunion; by the end it is the instrument of surrender, a conceptual re-pricing that feels inevitable in hindsight.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without sermon: passing light becomes passing words; broken glass becomes broken solitude. Final image reweights prior motifs—sea glass as bottled safety now shared. Subtext in stacked stones (“thinking of you”) quietly echoes Vera’s final act. No thematic echo violations.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges without statement: legacy media obsolescence vs. living transmission, darkness as instructor. Subtext sits in Kael's laughter—anxiety masquerading as power—never named as such. Final green dawn offers a non-literal answer: the world will keep receiving signals it no longer understands, reweighting earlier "newspaper" extinction. Insight is earned through concrete beam-patterns rather than thesis sentence; only the last paragraph flirts with overt thesis ("tending to an otherworldly routine") preventing 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: the ethics of inherited compassion and the structural nature of visibility (light as truth, wings as refraction). Subtext resides in gesture—Chen lifting the wing like a surgeon—implying the delicate violence of illumination. Final image of trembling wings offers non-literal answer: acceptance of radiant vulnerability. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether Mira can survive the glare.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through iterative image: trees as outsourced memory banks whose rings measure human grief in decimal points. Final fountain image reframes maintenance work as ecological therapy—sorrow recycled into irrigation—without declaring a moral. Subtext is carried by silence: no screamed epiphany, only moonlight arithmetic. Avoids thematic echo by never naming “healing” until the last clause, and even then attaches it to moonlight, not sermon. Could edge 9-band if an earlier seed of personal stake in Mara’s own grief had flowered there.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: collective memory as living currency, dawn as communal craft. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing palm to mica, crushing fruit—never in abstract lecture. Final image of thousands blooming with recognition offers a resonant, non-literal answer: shared remembrance is the sunrise. No tidy moral; the ambiguity of what the awakened realm will do lingers, earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from specific particulars rather than thesis: the invitation’s stealth delivery, the library’s Möbius shelves, the sister’s silence. Final image of Iris reading herself “back into the world” offers resonant, non-literal answer—no moral is stated. Subtext operates in silence: the collective reading commune embodies the solution before Iris articulates it. Avoids thematic echo; the woman’s line about hiding to become visible is dramatized by the setting, not abstract assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the concrete paradox: absence can seed presence if someone risks planting. Subtext lives in gestures—bread broken, tea poured—rather than exposition. The ending’s resonant answer is the image of seeds in a pocket, not a moral; it reweights every prior vanishing as potential ground. No thematic echo sentence mars the finale; the insight stays embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges purely imagistically: spectral color vs. white nullity, fading Hz vs. steadfast 528. No reader-dictated moral—just a private journal entry “Evidence that some promises outlive memory itself,” which still lets the silence speak. Subtext lies in haptic detail—wool, frost, glass—more than exposition. Avoids overt thesis statement but flirts with “luminous vows” as abstract trope; trimming one adjective line could sharpen further.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of inherited silence emerges through fob → recorder → hush truce; no overt moralizing. Trust as volatile currency is shown, not stated, via the price of corn liquor barrels vs. betrayal bounties. The final image of water reconfigures the opening brine motif: secrets still lap but now against her solitary footing. Irony: to clear her father’s name she must vanish, perpetuating the family art of disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—planet electing humans as meteorological messengers—emerges through imagery, not lecture. Subtext of shame-vs-service is voiced by Kael but not dramatized in action. Final auroral tableau offers resonant reconfiguration: weather-carrier identity shifts from curse to vocation. No moralizing sentence mars the ending; ambiguity remains whether the message can ever be declined.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: perfect recall is only a prison if feeling is denied; art must transmute memory into shared wonder. The reweighting occurs when the same subway faces reappear as mythic figures—reader feels the conceptual repricing without moralizing. No thematic echo sentence mars the ending. Ambiguity lingers: the cave will survive, but Elena’s future compliance with daylight society is unsettled, inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from specific objects—gilded leaves that never decay versus petals that preserve perishable truth—without sermon. The final image of Mira choosing to carry honesty upward reconfigures "candor in small moments" from passive archive to active endangerment of self. No character articulates a thesis; silence, glass, and the protagonist’s bodily wilt carry subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through sonic metaphor: purity is sterile, imperfection carries human truth. No character articulates the thesis; the final image of Mira’s wordless smile and vibrating bronze reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext in pilgrim throat-touch conveys gratitude more cleanly than dialogue could. Ambiguity remains—will universal bell-sculptures heal or merely echo loss—inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges throughimage-pattern: containing vs tending, stone vs sap, static vs harmony. No final-paragraph moral—last line is action (“began to water”)—and the ambiguity of “fragmented wholeness” is charged by the rose that is both mineral and flesh.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—community as archive of testimony—emerges through object-lore (locket, mailbox) rather than lecture. Final image of voices braiding into “absolute certainty” reweights earlier solitude without moralizing. Subtext in Thomas’s coffee-shield and Mrs. Chen’s sealed box lets reader feel systemic erasure as intimate loss. Avoids thesis-speak except one “listening heals” line.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges implicitly: the transformation of intimate grief-text into collective weaponry. No moralizing; the final image of “keys that opened every cage” is concrete, not thesis. Subtext of dance-as-code keeps meaning in gesture rather than declaration. Ambiguity lingers: will the regime learn to read dance? Complexity honored.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges without statement: deleted selves sediment inside giants we barely notice, and rescue demands surrendering the present. The wildflower motif evolves from nostalgia artifact to divination medium to crystalline lattice—its final form reweights “pressed flowers” as literal time-storage. Subtext whispers that conservation laws apply to emotion too—every retrieval exacts deletion elsewhere. Final image of steady lanterns above empty docks offers resonant, non-moralizing answer: memory’s return is also a vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the paradox of active stillness: silence must be tirelessly cultivated. The origami wing’s transformation from flight to dream-of-flight reconfigures the cosmic into the terrestrial without moralizing. Final image—her lighting another candle—offers quiet, non-literal answer: peace is an endless, thankless craft. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis statement; ambiguity lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges obliquely: built environments outlive builders yet demand interpreters; inheritance is a conversation, not a deed. Subtext carried by gesture—Mrs. Kovac palms the invisible impression, Elena later feels the seal “settle like a key.” No explicit sermon; the meteor shower’s ancient indifference supplies cosmic frame. Final line’s “city spoke in stone” offers resonant non-literal answer—language as living obligation. Ambiguity remains (what will Elena do when a building calls?) but complexity is embraced, lending after-shine without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: forced forgetting vs. chosen fragmentation. Subtext sits in the bisected shell—love preserved through damage. Final image reweights “isolation” as sovereign space, not exile. No sermonizing; the moral is lived, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without statement: governance can be merciful only when it betrays its own cruelty. The rose-thorn motif re-prices from metaphor to tool, showing that protection sometimes demands blood. No moralizing final paragraph; the green aurora over the blooming rose supplies the resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of salvage: value lies not in treasure but in the irreparable—warped glass, unfinished love. Subtext operates through gesture (fingers passing through globe) rather than exposition. Final image reweights “salvage” from artifact to emotional restitution, resisting tidy moral. No thematic echo sentence; insight stays welded to the object.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from knot-to-knot particulars: hidden labor of ancestors, spiral而非straight wisdom, demure audacity of valuing obscurity. No final moral—last image of moon-path on water re-prices the unseen as holy. Subtext carried in gesture: apprentice’s fingers moving “with new intentionality” silently accepts mortality of tradition. Resonant reconfiguration lands via Conceptual Repricing, satisfying 9+.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Kenji’s perceptual palette: “hammered bronze” harbor, “scintillatingly somber” whistle tone—vocabulary never exceeds net-mender poetics. Rhythm mirrors spiral motion: long sentence arcs for moon paths, staccato for knot flicks. No head-hop; apprentice’s interior read through Kenji’s ear and eye. Final paragraph’s cadence reprises opening syntax, creating Charged Poise loop. Distinctive enough for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of knowledge versus wonder emerges through encrypted storm-voice and sapphire light; no final moral is stated, only the image of cobalt glass witnessing a conspiracy of dawn. Subtext relies heavily on repeated light/shadow binaries; the prophetic diction occasionally drifts toward pseudo-profundity (“crown of morning”).

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from pattern: fragments → bridge → communal restoration. No explicit thesis; final image of “heart jingling with purpose” reweights prior silence into song. Subtext in gesture: pressing box into Mrs. Chen’s hands = wordless apology for years of scorn. Complexity preserved—she remains vagrant, redemption is gleaned, not possessive.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through sonic metaphor: memory as crystallized vibration, guilt as transmissible frequency. No thesis statements; the final image of a lighthouse singing through one woman’s pulse reweights earlier “sonic absolution” from folklore to lived bodily debt. Subtext in dialogue—Crane’s “you feel it too”—carries legacy guilt without exposition. Conceptual repricing lands: mercy becomes indenture, absolution becomes burden.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through the inversion of horizontal to vertical knowledge; no character states it. Subtext lives in Ren’s fingertip calluses on brass threads—patience as insurgency. Final image of “ice forming molecule by molecule” reweights the concept of revolution from bang to accretion. Avoids sermon; the lake’s own voice supplies the moral physics.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of historical vs. present corruption emerges organically; no character states “history repeats.” Lanterns migrate from artifact → evidence → moral compass without authorial nudge. Final image reweights “safe passage” from 1858 fugitives to 2023 whistle-blower, a Conceptual Repricing that invites reflection on what freedom costs. Subtext in Elena’s radio silence carries the real rebellion, not speech.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges as the fusion of yearning and invention: the bell exists because a machine to desire it was built. The arrow tip’s reprise—pointing forward in the final line—re-weights ancient longing into post-human tech, avoiding any moral summary. Subtext in the mentor’s dissolve (“dissolved into the sea spray”) hints that desire costs flesh, yet the story resists stating the equation aloud. The closing image crystallizes the theme without sermon, meeting the 9- resonance threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: empathy is not a future we see but a present space we hold for others to choose. The mirrored blossoms reprise the lighthouse apples, now re-priced as sites of possible choice rather than frozen symbols. Subtext operates in silence—no character ever speaks the word “forgiveness,” yet the final image of blossoms reflecting memory performs it. The ending refuses tidy moral symmetry; the cost stays in Maren’s star-shot shadows, acknowledging that peacekeeping wounds the keeper.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through stressed-grapes metaphor rather than direct assertion, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext lives in Elena’s trembling fingers and the unsaid remainder of the letter, giving the reader space to complete meaning. Final image of “beautiful mistakes” resonates without tidy aphorism. Docked slightly because Marcus’s concluding speech leans toward thematic echo, though saved by surrounding sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: communal spaces exist only when collectively, peripherally believed in. The final image of “snow” quietly reweights the opening “dunes” into a shared white fragility—no moral stated. Subtext lives in gesture: people murmur softer after consecration, implying consent to lifelong partial blindness. No pseudo-profundity; insight is earned through tactile ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the arc-completions: communal imagination reclaims ruin without denying it. Subtext resides in silence—no one names the factory accident, yet it haunts every bridge drawn. Final image of “purple dusk” reweights the opening rust into possibility without moralizing. Avoids explicit thesis, though “human hearts deserve patient reclamation” flirts with statement.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: transformation requires breaking, compression is growth, dictionaries are pressed flowers. No moralizing; the final image of bloom reweights prior motifs without stating a thesis, leaving resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges as the paradox of recording impermanence: “a seashell holds the ocean—imperfectly… but with absolute devotion.” Subtext lives in negative space: every videotape, funeral, wedding is unseen yet charged. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. No abstract thesis statement; the driftwood compass is the lived answer.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: impermanence as something to be instrumented, not arrested. Subtext in the spinning hand’s final acceptance—witness over control. Final image reweights earlier camera-repair ethos; no moralizing. Luminous ache tone modulates into bittersweet serenity, felt rather than named. Complexity intact: departure is both tragedy and liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of “relearning as awakening” emerges through the orrery’s reboot and shadow-transfiguration, never stated. The spoon-bend is left unexplained, preserving productive ambiguity. Final image reweights prior night-bound imagery without moralizing. Minor deduction for the phrase “sealed awakenings” appearing verbatim near start—too prompt-echoey.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from specific imagery (tooth, straw body, roses) rather than spelled-out thesis. Final reconfiguration: “make light from fractures” offers non-literal answer to how grief transforms. No overt moral; ambiguity remains (readers must decide if Iris is real or faerie construct). Subtext carried by tooth’s warmth and garden’s wrongness; avoids thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from iterative light-transformation: broken fragments become vessels of continuity, grief converted to communal wonder without moralizing. The colored-shadow motif (Elena’s cathedral joy) reprises in the final dappled grotto wall, reweighting prior material. Subtext sits in silence: Maren never names the fire to the children, letting colored beams carry the unsayable. Ending image resists tidy comfort—sharing light still requires daily polishing labor, acknowledging persistent cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the recurring fusion of organic decay and digital ruin: meaning is not recovered but “grafted,” a living horticultural metaphor enacted by the moss-covered servers. Subtext operates in gesture—pressing pendant to notebook fuses Jenna’s scientific legacy with Maya’s bodily grief without statement. The ending image of “two witnesses learning to dream awake” offers a non-literal answer: atonement is not a feeling but a practice of continued attention. No moralizing sentence distills the lesson; the pattern of drips and documented grief does the work.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the shell’s broken spiral and the refusal to let forgetting win; no explicit moral is stated. The final image—“she carried something now that she hadn’t before”—reconfigures the entire story’s meaning without abstract assertion. Subtext operates in gesture: laying down arms, forgetting a face, planting in salt—all are silent moral arguments. The piece resists binaries (mercy vs vengeance) and lands in a charged poise whose cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without sermon: forgotten song as living technology. The final image—baskets of out-of-season fruit—reconfigures meaning of “sacred practice” as something you can taste, not believe. Subtext in the loom’s creaks carries the grandmother’s absent voice. Avoids thematic echo penalty; no character states “this is how we heal the land.”

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme—persistence as cartography—emerges through concrete inversion: waste (cores, bark, ice) becomes data, starlight becomes ink, death becomes map. No explicit thesis; final “orchard would remember” reweights prior discard imagery into mnemonic code. Subtext in gesture: sealing wax = burial and gift simultaneously. Conceptual repricing occurs when reader realizes the maps are unread by any human—value is purely arboreal, a non-anthropic archive.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: grief can be externalized and mineralized, but the collector must become its substratum. The burner’s family history and the crystallized burdens create a lattice of specific particulars; no abstract maxim is imposed. Final image of stars as “burdens that had found their proper angle” conceptually reweights the entire premise, turning cosmic light into voluntary sorrow. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide whether this is transcendence or perpetual servitude.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges via wood grammar: preservation versus transformation. Subtext lives in tool-marks left visible—artistry that admits flaw. Final image reweights “here and gone” from loss to vessel, no moralizing. One soft spot: “harvest the lessons from loss” flirts with abstraction mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges: identity cannot be cartographed from external scraps; it must be accepted as an internal ghost. Subtext operates in the lagoon’s impossible physics—stillness that moves—mirroring Mira’s stasis-in-search. No moralizing; the final whisper (“You were never meant to go back”) reweights every prior fragment without dictating meaning. Ambiguity lingers: is the returning music triumph or delusion?

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of reclamation-through-decay emerges from concrete pattern—water stains → flow map → living architecture—never sermonized. Subtext in the carnival’s pink spirals suggests brief resurrection without purpose, contrasting her engineered, lasting one. Final image of “voices where there was only echo” reweights earlier silence without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: the board may still refuse, letting hope stay costly.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—reclamation of forgone creativity—emerges through the clock imagery rather than lecture. Subtext operates in the silence of the sanctuary and the unheard ticking of never-built mechanisms. The final sketch reconfigures the earlier “ghost” designs into a humble timepiece that measures both sunrise and sunset, a non-literal answer to the fear of failure. Slight sentimental overtone in “everything she had finally decided to become” nudges score down from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of “negative architecture” emerges organically from canal glow and sundial diagrams; no final moralizing. Final image reweights earlier failures as necessary training; ambiguity between built and unbuilt cities lingers with charge.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges as transmission versus display: knowledge survives only when re-wound into working line, not museumified. The rosetta-stone rope quietly argues that craft is a continuum, not a relic. Final image re-prices the stakes—secrecy itself becomes the active, ethical stance. No naked thesis, only the hush after the last knot is retied, leaving reader suspended inside the same ethical loom.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the concrete splice of feather and brass; no character sermonizes. The final reconfiguration—beauty that includes its own corruption—avoids moral binaries and invites counter-readings about conservation versus innovation. Subtext lives in gesture: Vashira’s mechanical arm whirs while her human eye tears, silently posing the same question the bird answers. No thematic echo sentences; the bird’s first note does the argumentative work.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from concrete reversal: fire-origin glass now holds water that suspends ash-grains—trauma reframed as buoyant memory. No explicit moral; final image of “dark stars in dark water” offers non-literal answer. Subtext operates in coin’s hole (“let pain pass through”) and reversed star-field. Complexity preserved: father’s destruction unredeemed yet generative.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—memory as civic water, skepticism as renewable light—emerges through concrete recurrence of fountains and lantern. No moralizing; final line (“questions that glowed brighter than answers”) offers Conceptual Repricing. Subtext operates in gesture: her refusal to speak is both defiance and surrender to wonder. Ambiguity lingers: did quantum law bend, or did pattern recognition suffice? Complexity honored.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without sermon: the only pattern worth repeating is love’s self-extinguishing offer. Brass gear’s worn teeth reprice “calculation” as emotionally bankrupt; final image of tumbling gear answers the thematic question non-literally. Subtext resides in the sonar echo—technology of seeking becomes metaphor for compassion. Final line avoids moral statement; resonance comes from image, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges inductively: poems as grief-survival tools, stones as waypoints in migratory sorrow. Subtext in Marcus’s translucent gesture toward the ribbon shifts meaning from elegy to instruction manual. Final image reweights earlier motifs—monarch migration and grass-over-graves alike—without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo; insight stays implicit in her new poem’s first line.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of balance: perfect mechanical time-keeping is revealed as ethical cowardice, while true balance is the honest swing between guilt and acknowledgment. Subtext lives in the rake handle’s silence and the pendulum’s future unheard tick. The final image—Maren walking into tidal reflection—offers a non-literal answer: justice is not proclaimed but enacted in hidden cadence. No overt moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story’s theme—that the living’s intentions lurk messier than the dead’s—emerges through Marta’s shift from blithe gardener to archivist of erased lives, never stated but dramatized via tapestry decoding. Motifs (chess clock, peeling paint spirals, sovereign case) recur only when they constrain her method or charge final resolve. No sermonizing; final rooftop vigil offers charged poise rather than moral. Subtext of gold coins hints at payment for truth without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without slogan: mapping ignorance becomes fertile ground for discovery. Subtext lives in the kingfisher’s polarized sight—what’s invisible to others is writable to her. Final image of councils forming reweights the premise from solitary cartographer to societal shift; no moral is stated, only implied consequence. Conceptual Repricing lands: the future’s price is perpetual unknowing, now institutionalized rather than denied.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the inversion of erasure—absence itself as archive—without moralizing; the final image of “language written in absence” reweights earlier static into resonance. Subtext in the pirate’s fragments (“dust remembers”) pays off when dust literally speaks, creating earned irony.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—safety as curated omission—emerges through iterative visual absences rather than assertion. Subtext operates in gesture: ash letters re-form only after pulverization, implying truth needs destruction to speak. Final image (ash settling between stones, completing nothing) offers conceptual repricing: preservation itself is the lie. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether visitors will keep choosing comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—truth as sediment that outwaits narrative fashion—emerges through the vertical metaphor of drowned layers and the final image of waiting evidence. No character moralizes the thesis; the cog’s mechanical indifference stands in for empirical fact, re-weighted when Marcus relinquishes it. Subtext in Karin’s body language (“agonizing over her words”) hints at academic guilt without overt confession. The ending avoids tidy uplift, leaving meaning suspended like silt in dark water.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the rosette’s interlocked phoenixes and the humming exercise; the final image reframes “vanishing art” as relational practice rather than artifact. Avoids explicit moral, but the grandmother’s quoted aphorism in last paragraph is a mild thematic echo that keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: system commodifies nostalgia, true memory is insurgent. “Taste each other’s truths” could drift into slogan, but is localized in purple fruit and quiet seed-sharing. Final image of sunrise on rust re-weights premise without moralizing. Ambiguity held: reader cannot decide if network is utopian or doomed—complexity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through the drones-bees parallel rather than lecture: hoarding kills, generosity animates. The final line quietly re-coins “bee” as hope, achieving resonance without moralizing. One sentence (“progress without wonder was just elaborate death”) flirts with Echo but is earned by the preceding mechanical corpses and blackout fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges without labels: displacement seeks return, witness is a form of love, attention is architecture’s true load-bearing wall. Subtext lives in gesture—her fingertip on the door-frame is benediction without theology. The bay’s “breath held at dusk” returns as the house’s exhale, reconfiguring both world and reader. No moral is stated; the final image of steady streetlight on water offers a quiet, non-literal answer: light itself is enough payment.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges from the particulars of digitalis in mortar, aristocrats at tea, and a statue that breathes brine—justice can poison beauty, and monuments lie. The final image of ascending bubbles reconfigures the meaning of ‘tragedy’ without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: the statue’s ‘incisively kind’ touch is both benediction and burden. No tidy equivalence; the story refuses to absolve either architect or historian, leaving the reader to choke on the same salt water.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: perpetual motion as metaphor for obsessive regret; dice chip = acceptable imperfection. Final image of finger hovering then hitting “send” offers non-literal answer—risk over perfect equilibrium. No sermonizing; insight earned through stair ordeal and dice roll. Subtext in silences (Mara wordless before leap) and gesture (pocketing dice) deepens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges as inverse surveillance: instead of the state cataloguing citizens, citizens catalogue covert kindness, storing it in moonlit pigment. Saffron shifts from color to cipher to collective ledger without thematic statement; the final rooftop constellation of greenhouses reweights “illegal memory” as visible graffiti of care. No moral is asserted—only the undeniable image that erased languages now glow in rooftop glass—satisfying the non-literal answer test.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: displacement is not a temporary inconvenience but a chronic condition that can only be met by portable acts of naming—bread initials, lens-curated sight. Subtext resides in gesture: offering a “P” loaf to the puppeteer wordlessly argues that identity persists only if performed. The ending refuses moral slogans; the waterfall will flow again, but the city will still be exiled somewhere else—continuity through adaptation, not rescue. Rosewater dread lingers as olfactory irony: sweetness masking decay mirrors culture’s fragile beauty, a note neither resolved nor sermonized.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: time as direction, not dictator. The re-inscribed hunger stone (“When you weep, see me”) reweights centuries of fatalism into invitation, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing. Subtext lives in gesture—her fingers trailing stone, the yoyo that won’t come back—rather than exposition. Final image of clocks ticking backward in an abandoned tower leaves moral space for reader interpretation, satisfying complexity requirement.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays welded to Maren’s perceptual filter: she notices gear ratios, magnetic float, knot topology—details impossible outside her reverse-engineer mindset. Syntax lengthens and contracts with breathless immediacy (“Light poured… pulling reality toward itself like water circling a drain”). No head-hopping; lighthouse beam, tide exhale, and shifting symbols are observed, not explained. Voice modulation under stress—short clauses when she steps into radiance—preserves coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges cleanly: “Fear’s power is proportional to the distance we keep.” Emergence is via image (mirror multiplication shrinking to one tiny parasite) rather than statement. Dream-dictionary paradoxes risk thematic echo, but their contradictions feed the image track, so penalty is minor. Final image reweights premise without moralising; resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: adaptation through inversion—trust what destroys you (sea → driftwood platform; backward current → salvation). The returning image of copper-wound trees singing “impossible truth” reweights earlier scavenging into triumph rather than desperation. Subtext in Deren’s hesitation exposes community orthodoxy and rational fear, letting silence after “Trust the backwards flow” carry the persuasion. Moral complexity stays intact: Maren’s victory is also a wager with unnamed lost settlements, a cost she carries but the narrative refuses to moralize.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: founding myths as necessary compromise versus mature accountability. Subtext lives in Hawthorne’s ivy—“something almost alive”—mirroring the living lie. The final image of “truth finally blooming” risks overt botanical metaphor yet still reweights the rose motif. No moral sermon, but the insight “they weren’t villains, they were people” is safely moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the concrete ritual: absence is not lack but active weight, re-priced by the final image of Marcus shouldering unnamed histories as he climbs out. Subtext resides in gesture—resealing the box speaks louder than any interior thesis. No moralizing sentence distills the insight; the reader must inhabit the hush. The twins’ astronomy and Kessler’s violin provide particularity that resists abstraction, though the theme’s complexity could sharpen further had one of Marcus’s own memories been jeopardized by his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from iterated images of inversion—roots above, cranes that fall up, light stored by day and released at night—asking what it means to “hold” loss. No character names the theme; the reader must fold it. The ending refuses catharsis, insisting that grief is not solved but transformed into continuous craft. Ambiguity is meaningful: reunion is neither promised nor denied, only pursued.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the geode’s crystallization metaphor: potential locked until pressure, then beauty equals loss. Subtext lives in silence—Dr. Vahedi’s coffee steam, the unanswered question of whether the wave is real or projected grief. No moral is declared; the final image of auroras dancing like burning veils reweights the wedding-veil memory without naming it. Resonance is concrete: the reader leaves sensing that unlived lives vibrate in the magnetosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of fragmented belonging emerges through chip cartography and star trails, never sloganized. Pilgrim’s line “people feared connection more than isolation” could feel explain-y but is brief and motivates split. Final image reweights earlier isolation as purposeful exile in service of reassembly—earned resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the driftwood-to-watch-hand axis: truth as something carved by storm rather than manufactured. Subtext operates in gesture—Mara offers both driftwood-child-hand and watch hand to Elias, a mute confession no dialogue can equal. Final image of terrace “looming” reconfigures the premise: accountability is endless tidal return, not single act. No moralizing sentence mars the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges obliquely: neutral ground, lunar indifference, and recycled error become a quiet ethics of procedural patience. The drawer pull’s final reprise reweights “open what’s closed” from family heirloom to living treaty—an image that answers the central question without moralizing. No thematic echo lines mar the ending, and the refusal to grant forgiveness on-page preserves ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—redemption through re-engagement with imperfect systems—emerges via compass, poles, stars: no single guide suffices, only layered vigilance. Subtext surfaces in gesture: Amy studies the compass “like a staff,” wordlessly asking Marina to trade grief for trust. Final image of “open water now” offers quiet, non-moralizing answer: progress demands relinquishing absolute certainty. No overt thesis statements; one near-echo (“broken navigators gravitate…”) is embedded early enough to feel like voice, not sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from concrete paradox: memory is expendable, yet choice is inescapable—“Empathy isn’t memory. It’s choice.” No character sermonizes; the sentence is carved on an artifact Marcus physically handles. Subtext carries in gesture: the Interpreter’s smile is “jaded but genuine,” implying decades of watching ex-actants rationalize; Marcus’s silence after reading the ball is the real answer. Final image reweights the labyrinth concept: tunnels remain, but he steps into them unburdened, a quiet conceptual re-pricing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges without sermon: transformation as threshold-crossing, love as willingness to become the feared. The fortune-cookie line is re-weighted at closure when fear proves “just another threshold,” avoiding thematic echo penalty. Subtext lives in gesture—Tam’s first touch of her changing face carries more than any apology. The ending invites counter-readings: is this loss or consummation? Yet the cosmic intimacy tone occasionally drifts toward abstract lyricism (“cosmic intimacy made flesh and spirit”), slightly diluting emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of the cartomancer’s own lexicon: prophecy turns inward, time becomes tactile, “reading” becomes writing by marker on cloth. Subtext resides in silence—no dialogue—gesture substituting for speech: the triple tracing is vow enough. There is no moral slogan; the final image of fingers on baby skin reweights all prior card-ink as mere shadow. Ambiguity lingers: she may still fail, but the stakes are now flesh, not fate.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of collective shadow-confrontation emerges through photo-salt harmonics rather than thesis statements; final ‘luminous emptiness’ reweights earlier dread into terrible beauty, achieving resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from specific paradox: destitution as enabling philanthropy. Subtext resides in gesture—opening jars equals both surrender and acquisition of power. Final image of “direction itself rather than the destination” reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo lines; insight stays embedded in sand, insects, and withheld cash.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: letting go is not loss but recognition of the universe’s original nature. The Fibonacci spiral reprises as cosmic law, not ornament. Sacred geometry motif shifts from puzzle to acceptance, reweighting the premise. Final image—eels singing mathematics—offers non-literal, resonant answer: understanding equals relinquishing control.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: censored words = landmarks, disappeared people = canyons, protests = mountain ranges. Final image reweights silence itself into testimony without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (folding poem) and object (timer as metronome of resistance). Ambiguity preserved: no guarantee the network will survive, yet the archive now exists with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—questions become destinations—emerges through the sundial’s transformation from timekeeper to musical score; no character sermonizes. Final image of “cathedral of questions without answers” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue (“I’ll bring my rapier” / “I’ll bring another puzzle”) shows violence rechanneled, not denied. Ambiguity lingers: next week may still draw blood.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: seeds that thrive in darkness, selves that shed monthly, library roof torn open—all refract the question of what can grow from ruin. Subtext lives in gesture: Kai tamping soil while recalling her August silence says more than any manifesto. Final penny poem is knowingly terrible, resisting didacticism; the sting is that art’s worth is only a penny yet still worth making. Ambiguity lingers—will flowers or forgetting win?—without moral tag. Slight over-articulation of “forge beauty from anarchy” costs the final tenth.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: art as private navigation system that can renegotiate time when official maps fail. The splice-hidden map between film frames literalizes memory as compass, reweighting the “directionless” terminal into a place where longing itself becomes cardinal north. Final image refuses moral—she plays arrival, but the cost is the decades they can’t retrieve, letting ambiguity linger. Motif recurrence (ivory cracks, spinning needles, clock face) constrains choice rather than decorates, culminating in the backward ticking that makes the thematic cost audible.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as lived belief rather than provable fact. Subtext operates in gesture—the silent acceptance of tea, the seed’s sun-like weight—avoiding explicit thesis. Final image reweights premise without moralizing: possibility itself is the new truth. Ambiguity lingers—will the tree grow?—but remains coherent, inviting reflection rather than confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the concrete act of shaping bonsai according to lace instructions: repair is not retrieval but disciplined tending of what remains. Subtext lives in gesture—compass set down, branch cut—never in thesis statements. The final cerulean horizon re-prices the concept of apology, refusing a moral and leaving ambiguity between sky and sea. Only a hairline deduction for one quasi-aphorism: “apologies need not be spoken to be real,” stated aloud by Takeo.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges implicitly through the neutron star/butterfly parallel: both are post-catastrophic remnants whose decay reveals structure. No moralizing—the insight that “the universe is always losing something to become something else” arises from concrete particulars (scales, pulsars), not abstraction. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: light lingers after its source departs, reweighting all prior loss as meaningful residue. Subtext thrives in silence (no dialogue) and image (dust as data), avoiding sentimentality while evoking profound emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through glasscraft: true beauty requires patience, not force; rushed destruction shatters. This isn’t stated but embodied—Vera’s dialogue critiques Galloway’s “brittle” revolution, and her final act transforms fury into light. The scorched ledger and melting frost reweight earlier motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (will justice hold?), but the resonant answer is clear: creation endures when rooted in material truth, not ideological fire.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges entirely through particulars: the tuning fork’s unbroken purity amid ruin, thermal hues mapping unspeakable feeling, the ocean’s theft repaid by bodily honesty. No moral is stated; instead, the final image—Mara holding the fork case to her heart—reweights everything: music isn’t sound but resonance, survival isn’t recovery but translation. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld (no dialogue, no names of the dead) and what’s shown (pink dawn on temples = hope as physiological fact). The story resists sentimentality by grounding epiphany in scientific method and physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: devotion mistaken for stubbornness gains dignity through witness. The final image—ghosts fading as the lens refracts light—offers a non-literal answer to whether vigilance can be honored without perpetuation. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (coral-crusted bookshelves, phosphorescent SOS). Subtext operates in silence and gesture; the story resists tidy binaries, embracing ambiguity about duty beyond death.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—exile as chain, not rupture—emerges through bell/arbor recurrence, not statement. Final image reweights silence into legacy: “fed futures” replaces “fed families” without moralizing. Subtext thrives in absence (unseen donors, unwritten cards) and gesture (young woman stepping forward). Ambiguity lingers—sanctions may persist—but commitment to memory becomes the answer to abandonment.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: unspoken love transmutes into beauty, not loss. The jade tear’s journey—from clutched relic to viaduct offering—enacts this without moralizing. Final insight (“walking through the world’s museums of transformed feeling”) resonates because it’s earned through specific images (inverted blooms, phosphorescent footsteps), not abstraction. Ambiguity lingers (Is the pilgrim real? Is past life literal?), but the emotional truth—that love persists beyond the lover—is undeniable and non-binary.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from Lyra’s struggle: time isn’t a river to navigate but a hyperbolic space to inhabit. The final image—“both designer and designed, forever discovering what she’d already known”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her central question without moralizing. Subtext operates through the maze motif: dead ends as escaped moments, centers as understanding. The story resists tidy resolution, embracing complexity (time as loss and abundance) while avoiding false equivalence—Lyra’s insight is hard-won, not universalized.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges implicitly: true liberation requires ecological memory, not just fallen walls. The recurring seed motif constrains closure—Mira’s planting reweights earlier vault references from survival tactic to sacred duty. Final image offers non-literal answer: freedom without sustenance is ephemeral. Avoids moralizing; resonance builds through concrete particulars (pressed-leaf fletching, drought-resistant strains) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: trust’s fracture as gradual structural failure, memory as both burden and release. The ending reweights prior material non-literally—ashes transform memory without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (daughter’s unexplained cutoff, Mira’s frozen tears) and charged objects (crystal as ghost of loss). Avoids tidy resolution; complexity lingers in “absence… not empty,” resisting false equivalence between preservation and release.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: stolen moments are actually invitations to co-create destiny. The final image—Maya moving through moonlight toward canvas and paints—offers a non-literal answer to “What is an illuminated moment?” without moralizing. Recurring motifs (golden hour, moonbeams, lilies) accrue meaning through use, not declaration. Subtext thrives in silence: Celeste’s half-shadowed smile, the unscrewed jar spilling futures, the white lilies pointing northeast—all imply truth without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from glassblowing and thawing: repair requires heat and rotation, not force or stillness. The final image—the sphere transmitting light yet strong enough to endure—offers a non-literal answer to whether broken things can be mended honestly. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the bookmark’s cracked spine; no moralizing intrudes. Rilke and “thawing heart” are grounded in character, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: vulnerability as power is tested through Maya’s phobias, manufactured past, and final act of truth-telling. The seashell and rusted library reframe childhood innocence as both fragile and weaponizable. No moralizing—insight arises from Maya’s realization that “cruel protection” still counts as care in a broken world. The ending reweights the premise: secrets aren’t just hidden—they’re carried in plaster and bone, and only the vulnerable can bear them honestly.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning resides in what’s withheld, not declared. The flaking booklet’s blank pages and the oracle’s “summarizing silence” reject prophetic plenitude for negative capability. Final image—a map of absences guiding through darkness—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how we endure endings. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will they speak again?), yet cost is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: consciousness as an emergent property of iterative experience, not a fixed locus. The violin translates code into sound, making abstract inquiry visceral—no moralizing, just resonance. Final image reweights prior material: sweeping wasn’t futility but foundational practice. Subtext thrives in silence (fragmented janitors), gesture (gripper attachments trembling), and the refusal of tidy answers—wisdom arises from specific, repeated contact with mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: communication beyond language, trust as active creation rather than passive reception. The final image—hands reaching across wordless space—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how to bridge emotional distance. No moralizing; resonance accrues through specific objects (lens, tickets) and actions (drawing, handing over). Subtext thrives in silence, doodles, and the crystals’ “secrets” contrasted with human muteness.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from cracked marbles and shifting hedges: some truths are cultivated, not calculated. The final line—“keeping its own measurements, knowing its own keeper”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the Institute’s hubris without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (her hands polishing faster) and gesture (arranging thyme like an offering). Complexity is preserved—the husband’s deceptions were cruel, yet they birthed her deeper communion with the garden—avoiding false equivalence or tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: linear time as comforting fiction versus lived multidimensionality. Subtext lives in gesture—the Ephemera’s wings “catching fragmented twilight,” Kael’s hands on warm metal—and avoids moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer: truth resides “in the space between moments,” reweighting all prior calibration work as sacred rather than servile. Complexity is preserved—Venn’s skepticism crumbles but doesn’t vanish into dogma.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—truth persisting in liminal spaces—emerges through concrete particulars: unstruck chords, water-damaged ink, flickering light. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture; no moralizing intrudes. The ending reweights the premise: the opera house isn’t ruined by flood but completed by acknowledgment. Ambiguity lingers (Who pushed Constance? Will Marta be believed?), but the emotional aftereffect—relief fused with duty—is earned through Marta’s quiet promise.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the nightshade illustration (beautiful but poisonous) mirrors the oracle’s deceptive certainty. Subtext thrives in silence—Chen’s unspoken grief, the smudged data ignored. The ending offers a non-literal answer: safety lies not in eliminating uncertainty but in naming it. No moralizing; resonance lives in the flickering advisory screen and Mira’s “auroral sorrow”—wisdom born of irreversible error, not platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: guilt as physical residue in stone and steel, truth as undigested weight. Subtext thrives in silence—the unsaid between callers, the unturned valves, the father’s secrecy. The ending offers a non-literal answer: confession, even mediated, can release pressure, but full absolution requires direct reckoning. No moralizing; resonance arises from beads, water, and shadows—not assertion. Complexity is preserved: the system remains corrupt, the dead unrecovered, yet incremental relief is possible.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges solely through concrete particulars: books becoming soil, swan folds whispering, water eroding pre-linguistic script. The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question (“What deserves preservation?”) by reweighting truth as fluid process—“the story of letting go.” No moralizing; resonance arises from the keeper’s silent smile amid crumbling peace, echoing the river’s flow above and stones’ breath below. Ambiguity lingers (Will she fully dissolve? Is the swan sentient?), but complexity feels earned, not evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: “ordinary magic” isn’t stated until late, and then as lived insight (“darkness and light can dance together”), not moralizing. The baby hair curl and whale songs aren’t symbols but vessels of continuity. Final image—Mara planning next session with wind chimes—reweights the premise: wonder isn’t restored, but tended. Avoids sentimentality by rooting awe in professional patience and quiet reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as tactile communion across time, not archival duty. The dragon’s claw—a shared point of contact—answers the central question without moralizing. Final image reweights prior material: the silo isn’t just storage but a sanctuary where fire-surviving whispers gain dignity. Avoids sentimentality; embraces ambiguity (Catherine’s daughter likely died) while affirming witness as resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through the tension between concealment and revelation: spycraft made humane via edible prophecy. The recurring line “The answers you seek are already in your hands” shifts from platitude to profound truth—both for civilians seeking hope and agents decoding war plans. No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete acts (folding paper, mixing rice paste) that fuse espionage with generosity. The ending reweights the entire premise: secrets aren’t buried but offered, trusting strangers to receive them rightly.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: loop pedals, cobalt marks, and rhetorical questions coalesce into a non-literal answer about wholeness in stillness. Subtext thrives in silence-between-words and blue-as-seed, avoiding moralizing. The final mandala—a paradox held in balance—reweights every prior assumption without stating a thesis. Complexity is preserved: possession isn’t evil but predicated on a flawed ontology, and victory requires surrender, not triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of spiral (nautilus), symmetry (mirrored horizon), and sound (grandfather’s cosmic scores)—all converging in Mira’s epiphany that meaning resides not in forecasting but in listening. The final image—fortunes that “sang”—offers a non-literal answer to her chronological homesickness: home is purpose, not time. No moralizing; resonance accrues through precise particulars (calcium carbonate chambers, rose-and-amber light). Subtext thrives in silence—the unsaid grief for her grandfather fuels her quest without explicit mention.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: wholeness requires confronting fear-driven avoidance, not escaping consequence. The “procedurally generated” timelines reframe running away as self-fragmentation. Closure offers non-literal answer—the ripple she’ll make is no longer feared but embraced—reweighting the opening’s “infinite moment before consequence.” No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete images (crumbling tablet, solid stone) that reconfigure earlier motifs without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: music as shaped silence, not just sound. Subtext lives in gesture (Marie signing “silence is singing”), object (broken needle), and method (backward recordings). The ending offers a non-literal answer—deafness as portal—to the central question of how to feel when sensation fails. No moralizing; resonance arises from the filament of hush woven through every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: integrity as quiet defiance in an epistemically unstable world. The final image—Marianne recording amid gathering darkness—reweights all prior observations as acts of witness, not obsession. No moralizing; subtext lives in the pigeons, the lateral storms, the unspoken pact of archivists. Ambiguity lingers (“after what?”) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: scent as unmediated truth of memory, loss as sensory amputation, grief requiring new languages. The ending offers a non-literal answer—love persists not in molecules but in reconfigured perception—without moralizing. Elena’s “aromatically cautious” ethos echoes in Maren’s careful handling of memory, resisting sentimentality. Final image (“crystal shadows and the memory of light that smelled like love”) reweights all prior absence with resonant, earned poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the rope’s layers and Sarah’s dissolution: transformation requires relinquishing old forms of certainty. The final image—stars as unanswered questions awaiting poets—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central dilemma without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the unspoken grief of those left behind) and gesture (winding rope as ritual). Avoids binaries; evolution isn’t universally good, just necessary for some.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty persists not despite brokenness but through it, and incompleteness invites co-creation. No moralizing; insight arises from Maya’s realization that gaps “left space for listeners to inhabit.” The final image—a single fruit dropping into water, sound “magnificently clear”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: the world remains unfinished, yet still sings. Recurring motifs (bowl, unfinished scores, sideways trees) accrue meaning without forced symbolism, resisting tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.6)

Subtext operates in gesture—Esme smiling at a future-echo—and image (light blooming across ruins). The ending offers a non-literal answer: meaning isn’t found but forged through persistent attention to pattern. No moralizing; resonance arises from the charged poise of her descent, carrying brokenness as purpose. Counter-readings linger (is this delusion or truth?), but the cost—her lonely faith—makes the stance earned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through crystalline memory and looping shadows—not stated but embodied. The final image offers a non-literal answer: identity persists not by fixing the past but by folding future remembrance into present being. Preemptive nostalgia shifts from personal flaw to systemic symptom of a conscious archive. No moralizing; resonance arises from the quill falling through clouds while the storm settles into contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: mosaics as preserved knowledge, rags as transformed failure, chanting as embodied timekeeping. The ending offers a non-literal answer—light isn’t restored but redefined through communal witness and imperfect motion. Avoids moralizing; “filtering truth from ash” gains meaning through action, not declaration. Resonance lies in the quiet defiance of creating beauty amid brokenness.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: transformation requires patience, and life persists through cyclical loss. The cicada and tidal pools aren’t explained—they accrue meaning through use and context. The final request—“Tell me about her… the small ones”—rejects grand narratives for observed particulars, echoing Chen’s method and honoring the mother’s quiet resilience. No moral is stated; resonance comes from Mira holding the cicada as the tide returns, embodying the story’s central insight without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between containment and expansion, never stated outright. The “gilded hush” reframes wealth’s silence as preservation, paralleling Mira’s own method of curating quiet to build breathable space. Final lines offer resonant, non-literal answer: hospitality begins with welcoming oneself. No moralizing; insight arises from porcelain doll’s hollow chest becoming a vessel for self-liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as vessel rather than void, shaped by the sounds we allow to dwell within it. No moralizing—insights arise through concrete parallels (crystals refracting light like memories refracting sound). The storm glass and prisms aren’t symbols but functional metaphors integrated into action. Final line (“the word felt like a promise that silence itself would keep”) offers a non-literal answer to grief’s isolation: silence can hold continuity, ritual, and care. Complexity remains—hospital monitors still exist—but meaning is reweighted through lived experience, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: true ascension is service to memory, not seizure of power. This reframing avoids moralizing—the insight arises from Kaida’s tactile encounter with the ruby flake and culminates in the throne room’s revelation. The final act—descending, not ascending—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Recurring motifs (paint layers, light, thrones) accumulate meaning without forced recurrence, and the cost (forsaking legacy for truth) lingers conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: love as self-erasure versus sanctuary as self-reclamation. No moralizing—wisdom arises through ash, scars, and silent thresholds. Final image reweights “emptiness” as plenitude, offering non-literal answer to “how to breathe.” Ambiguity lingers (Will she burn? Can scars heal?), but stance is clear: breath is sovereign. Recurring motifs (fire, links, thresholds) accrue pressure rather than decorate.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: carbon→diamond mirrors debt→wisdom, Marcel’s “hollow guarantees” contrast quantum “promises that could be kept.” Final image reweights premise without moralizing—the diamond isn’t redemption but proof “transformation was always possible.” Subtext thrives in gaps: volunteer work as atonement, bolt as both weapon and seal. Avoids binaries; suffering isn’t glorified but alchemized via awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as testimony, intuition as bridge, legacy as theft. The gramophone’s hidden frequencies literalize how truth is encoded beneath official history. The ending offers no moral but a resonant reconfiguration—Cassian’s walk into night carrying truth that ensures the dynasty stays ended—repricing the entire premise without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme—agency within determinism—emerges through concrete particulars: strings, marionette theater, ceremonial patterns. The ending offers a non-literal answer: dancing *with eyes open* reweights the premise that honor requires blind obedience. No moralizing; resonance arises from the knight’s murmured oath amid swaying trees that defy “standardized formulae.” Subtext thrives in silence (his initial muteness) and gesture (unsnap → dance), avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the brass button, dust rivers, and mismatched filing embody how institutional indifference fractures families. The ending offers a non-literal answer—history isn’t restored, but made legible—reweighting archival work as sacred witness. Subtext thrives in silences: the Suttons’ unspoken care, the teacher’s note, the clerk who preserved updates. No moralizing; resonance arises from Miriam’s quiet act of reconnection across time.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: truth persists not through spectacle but meticulous accumulation of small, unalterable traces. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—resistance is persistence in obscurity—reweighting earlier images (puddles, keys, film) without moralizing. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld: no grand speeches, only actions that trust readers to infer the tyranny’s banality. Final line (“It would not yield to indifference”) avoids thesis-statement by grounding resolve in lived practice.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: absence as power, silence as love, prophecy as burden best borne by hushing, not fulfilling. The final image—dewdrops catching “muted morning light”—reweights all prior motifs (prisms, echoes, negative space) into a non-literal answer: some truths heal only when left unsaid. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (saxophone case, yellowed letter). Ambiguity lingers—was the prophecy real?—but emotional truth is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme—remembrance as the bridge between severed worlds—emerges organically from concrete particulars: seed sorting, leaf patterns, moonstone dust. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: reconciliation is possible not through force but through witnessing forgotten things, embodied in Miren’s seed mandalas that “hummed with mossy delight.” No moralizing; wisdom arises from tactile experience (“every seed she touched now whispered its forgotten name”). Subtext thrives in silence—the unsaid names, the untranslatable leaf-script—and the final image reweights all prior cataloging as sacred ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: gears, moss, vinegar solution—not abstract musings. The admiral’s note (“befriend uncertainty”) is dramatized, not preached, and Marcus’s shift from repair to preservation enacts it. Final image—compass spinning “everywhere and nowhere”—offers non-literal answer: direction resides in openness, not fixed points. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Is this wisdom or retreat?), yet resonance is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: grief’s fractures can be honored, not hidden, and names anchor souls beyond death. The kintsugi metaphor avoids moralizing by being enacted, not explained—gold fills the crack but doesn’t resurrect Celestine. The final candle reweights the entire narrative: light no longer seeks, but remembers. Subtext thrives in silence (the unwrapped coin, the walk back in rain), resisting tidy closure while affirming that presence can be forged from absence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: healing requires embracing the entanglement of tragedy and mundanity. No moralizing—insight arises from cake, frosting, and warped notes. The final image (“pursuing the next luminous ache”) reweights the premise without stating it: grief isn’t erased but integrated. Subtext lives in silence, gesture, and the gorge’s transformed echoes. Ambiguity lingers (What happens to unhealed souls?), but resonance is earned through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically: the futility of reducing human suffering to equations, yet the necessity of pattern-seeking as survival. The old man’s insight—“Mercy has no formula”—is not moralizing but hard-won, dramatized through his cultivated forest. Final image reweights prior material: mathematics shifts from tool of state torture to instrument of healing, without stating a thesis. Subtext thrives in objects (masks laid side by side) and silence (Sera’s unspoken decision to trust).

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (lens), method (revealing hidden details), and setting (repurposed market), rejecting didacticism. The central question—how to translate lives erased from record—is answered non-literally: through rainbows refracting light onto names, making absence present. Subtext thrives in silence (the girl pointing with her grandmother mirrors Mira’s past) and avoids moralizing. The final image reweights all prior layers as acts of resistance against historical erasure, with ambiguity intact—these histories are seen but not “saved,” honored but not institutionalized.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of profession, grief, and preservation: some secrets must be unearthed to restore meaning. The mainspring barrel reweights “cracks in the façade” from metaphor to moral imperative. Final lines avoid moralizing, instead offering resonant reconfiguration—Marcus turns from salvage to stewardship. The daughter’s off-page question anchors thematic depth without intrusion, making the insight feel lived, not lectured.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: glass fruit, frost-code, bottled whispers—not abstract musings. The ending offers a non-literal answer to “How do we live with time?” via Marina’s hand on rustling pages: truth isn’t preserved but experienced imperfectly. Subtext thrives in silence shattered into “a thousand rustling pages” and frost melting into “no pattern except the truth.” No moralizing; resonance arises from the operator’s “rustling awakenings” becoming literalized in the library’s rotation and rainbow light.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges entirely through particulars: the shard, the spirals, the covered mirrors. The central question—how to build meaning from loss—finds its non-literal answer in the final image: “making brokenness itself architectural.” Subtext thrives in gesture (hovering fingers, photographing angles) and avoids moralizing; even Kasimir’s journal entries feel like tools, not sermons. The piece resists binaries—revolution vs. preservation—by synthesizing them into a third way: integration. Final resonance (“stubborn hope” amid “burnished sorrow”) reweights every prior detail without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: small magics repair broken harmony, and joy can be corroded but also restored. The final image—echoes singing below as Aldric ascends—offers a non-literal answer: repair is ongoing, unseen, and resonant. No moralizing; subtext lives in wilted petals, crimson-to-gold light shifts, and the duchess’s likely incomprehension. Complexity is preserved—transmutation isn’t evil, only misapplied—and the story resists tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: the limits of human knowledge versus the allure of irreducible mystery. Final image—Mara diving into water that “might or might not be only water”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Recurring motifs (compass, petrichor) accrue weight: the compass stilled on shore points “toward nothing and everything,” repricing measurement itself. Ambiguity lingers plausibly—Henrik as “possibility,” not ghost—resisting tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme—art as timewoven alliance—emerges organically from concrete particulars: driftwood’s salt-accumulation, the slide’s scratched names, the root-ball’s hollows.

No moralizing; resonance arises through image (“suspended in a clear frame”) and accumulated detail. Subtext operates in gesture (slipping slide into pocket) and silence (ignoring GPS), avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—the postcards, cathedral glass, petals as “cups”—avoiding moralizing. The central question (“why beauty chooses darkness”) is answered non-literally: some truths require gentler light. Subtext thrives in silence (the “dawning hush”) and gesture (Mara’s rearrangement of postcards). The ending reweights the premise without stating it: moon-rootedness isn’t lack but attunement. Ambiguity lingers (will her mural succeed?), but the conceptual shift feels irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: arranging bones into “WITNESS,” the unrippled lagoon as memory-vessel, the zeppelin as fragile conduit of truth. The ending offers a non-literal answer: justice requires both keeper and messenger, neither fully free. No moralizing—resonance accrues through image (“faces rising—hundreds, thousands”) and covenant. The story embraces moral complexity: truth demands sacrifice, and some burdens cannot be lifted, only shared asymmetrically.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the bottle’s paradox: some vessels must remain closed to function as mirrors, rejecting the alchemists’ extractive ethos. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—resurrection as reimagining—that reweights every prior image (lanterns, shells, grooves) without moralizing. Subtext operates through silence: Miranda never explains her method; others simply see “different possibilities, all true.” Complexity is preserved—magic isn’t evil, but parasitic—and counter-readings linger (is communal hope another illusion?), yet the final lantern glow affirms embodied truth.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as emotional echo, not factual record. Subtext operates through silence, dead languages, and wax shavings—never stated outright.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: preservation vs. stasis, borrowed time vs. chaos. Final image—seed planted in uncertain soil—answers the central question non-literally: growth requires entropy, not purity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the rope as counter-technology: wisdom resides not in data but in embodied listening. The ending offers a non-literal answer—silence after ringing is more authoritative than any siren—repricing “progress” as continuity with ancient attunement. No moralizing; resonance arises from the rope’s tremor, the bell’s pattern, and the valley’s safety. Subtext operates in what’s withheld: the board’s judgment is deferred, making Mara’s quiet release more potent than vindication.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: mopping as meditation, meteors as “small deaths burning bright.” The lantern’s amber transforms void into “sacred” space, arguing that vulnerability refracts meaning.

No moralizing; resonance accrues through Mira’s refrain about “weight of what we traded.” Complexity abides—nostalgia isn’t idealized but weighed against lived loss.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: torn feather, handmade kite, fractured poems. The ending offers a non-literal answer—“the incomplete is where light enters”—that reweights every prior image without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: respect as co-creation, not stewardship. The diary’s thesis (“respect isn’t tolerance—it’s architecture”) is tested and embodied through copper wire, fungal transplants, and open channels—not stated then illustrated, but lived. Final image reweights all prior action: Maren’s breath joins the “ancient dialogue,” offering non-literal answer to “how do we belong?” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will the next caretaker listen?) without confusion. Subtext thrives in silence—the fox’s presence, the cats’ absence—more than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: war’s end enables unexpected harmony where salt and fresh water mix. No moralizing—wisdom arises through seed placement guided by bird-song and ancestral tongues.

Subtext thrives in untranslated phrases (“Mortuus est campus...”) that resist tidy interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the leaf’s veins as roads, silence as map, grooves as memory. No moralizing; insight arises through Calder’s tears and communal movement.

Subtext thrives in gaps—the “wild hush” reweighted as anticipation, not dread—inviting reflection without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: perspective shapes reality, and true north is self-determined amid disorientation. The final sketch—Andromeda across three time-states—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: meaning arises not from fixed coordinates but from tracing trajectories through flux. No moralizing; resonance accrues through the compass rose’s distortion and the pencil’s anachronistic scratch, reweighting all prior material without statement.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through action: secrets as flowing water, not hoarded gold. The final line—“apprentice of all the beautiful, terrible mysteries”—answers the central question (how to live with the unknown?) without moralizing.

The feather’s transformation—from carrier of suppressed memory to soft, real object—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Final image (refracting dawn into unnamed colors) reweights prior material: reflection was survival; refraction is truth. Ambiguity lingers (What are the nameless colors? What comes next?), but the conceptual cost—pain of unburied memory—is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: imperfection as truth, failure as pedagogy. The tapestry’s frayed border reweights “damage” as deliberate wisdom, echoing Petrov’s flawed opening.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: truth’s multiplicity versus institutional demand for singularity. No moralizing—insight arises through concrete acts (refracting “I watched him fall” into prismatic variants).

    Theme emerges organically: hope requires vulnerability, not vaults. The final image—caves brightening as Marcus commits to returning lost fragments—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically through river-as-mirror, ivy-as-resurrection, and accordion-as-repair—never stated outright. The central question (“Can you forgive yourself if forgiveness only flows downstream?”) receives a resonant, non-literal answer in the final graffiti and wading epiphany. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid: her past breakdown, medication effects, and professional loss are implied through sediment metaphors and water quality readings. Ambiguity lingers (will she return tomorrow?), but the conceptual cost of swimming in forgiveness-current is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, legacy, and longing—never stated but crystallized in the grandmother’s books containing “every declaration of love she’d been too proud or too frightened to voice.” The ending offers a non-literal answer: truth resides not in exposing fraud but in witnessing vulnerability.

    Theme emerges organically: translation between senses, memory as preservation, light as language. No moralizing—insight arises through the algae bottles’ labels (“Middle C—Amber”) and Mara’s reframing of lanterns as musical notation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.5)

Subtext thrives in silence (the untouched jar at closure), gesture (gripping hands across neural tissue), and the final triad—“Two mothers, one child, a brain in a jar”—which reframes duplication as multiplicity-as-completion. No moralizing; the resonant answer to “Can fragmented selves parent?” is “Only together.” The brain-in-jar motif reweights from backup to symbol of necessary incompleteness.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: innovation requires freedom from compulsive mystery-solving.

The final image reweights the fort’s purpose without moralizing: luminosity shifts from regime’s display to rebel signal. Subtext thrives in silence (Voss’s “winking hush,” unspoken trust) and object use (quill as lockpick). No false equivalence—regime is oppressive, resistance necessary—and ambiguity lingers in whether light will be enough.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: friction as borrowed grace, not inherent law. The ending reweights prior material non-literally—the eels’ “mathematics” isn’t explanation but invitation to witness cosmic memory.

Subtext thrives in gaps: grandmother’s unkept promise reframes as trust in ancestral knowledge, not abandonment.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: censored words as landmarks, disappeared people as canyons. The final image—Mara mapping wounds “above the clouds”—reweights silence as testimony without moralizing. Subtext thrives in objects (timer, envelope) and actions (writing in lightning flashes).

Does forgetting negate meaning?—but the cost (labour without legacy) feels undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges through object-as-metaphor: the anniversary clock’s frozen time versus the film’s hidden frames argues that longing gains power only when made active. The final chord doesn’t reverse loss but reconfigures it—arrival isn’t reunion but co-creation of a new temporal refuge. No moralizing; resonance lives in the compasses pointing “not to magnetic north, but to moments when longing became strategically creative.” Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid: twenty years of music were practice for this single, world-bending encore.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges implicitly through Kima’s dilemma: collective memory lives in blood/bone, not just words, and verification must sometimes yield to faith. The final image—planting “possibility itself”—offers a non-literal answer to whether truth requires proof, reweighting the elders’ claim not as fact but as necessary risk. Subtext thrives in silence (Prem’s quiet observation), gesture (pressing soil firm), and charged objects (seed as compressed ancestry).
