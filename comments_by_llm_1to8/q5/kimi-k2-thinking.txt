  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (purpose in pauses, resilience/light vs. darkness) emerges from the glass artistry and canyon setting, and the vessel creation offers a concrete embodiment. However, the final paragraphs lean toward thematic echo: "his story would shine on," "beacon of truth," "drifting resonance...purpose could be forged" approach summary statement rather than letting the image resonate. The "scorched testament" as call-to-action and the vessel as "testament to resilience" are close to symbolic convenience, introduced late and harvested for theme without deep character friction.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—silence as canvas for shared feeling, beauty persisting as "unshaken marvels"—emerges through concrete action (tuning forks, frost patterns, heat-maps) rather than direct statement. The final image ("every breath was a note, every frost pattern a melody") reweights prior material with resonance, though the line "cathedral of unshaken marvels" edges toward overt summary. The piece avoids moralizing but leans on the prompt phrase "unshaken marvels" as thematic shorthand, recycling it across beats without fully transforming it through earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the tension between rest and restlessness, memory and forgetting, stubbornness as both survival and trap. The lighthouse lens fracturing into seven pieces to "address each soul individually" grounds the abstract in concrete image. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer—the undertaker achieves their goal but loses the silence they craved, a sentence rather than salvation. Only the phrase "revitalizing peace for others while their own chased stillness through the depths like a minnow fleeing a shark that was also itself" edges toward over-articulation, preventing full 9+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (memory as survival, intergenerational bridge) emerges from repeated motifs—bell, stories, anonymous donations—but the ending articulates rather than enacts: "legacy of the silver bell would outlast the sanctions" is thesis statement, not resonant image. The final paragraph's declarative vow ("whispered a vow to keep ringing") replaces scene pressure with thematic summary. Subtext is thin; dialogue and gesture rarely carry implication beyond their surface content. Apply −0.5 for final-paragraph theme statement that replaces dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—unused love preserved within—emerges from recurring images (vault, sparks, tear, blooms) and the pilgrim-of-sparks motif. Yet the final realization is stated directly ("She had found where unused love is stored: within") rather than left resonant through image. The camera obscura and Kwan Yin's tear recur but do not reweight meaning at closure; they remain decorative symbols rather than charged particulars that complicate the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—time as texture, memory as medium—emerges from imagery (fading photographs, sap rings, bark ridges) rather than statement. The final image of Elara blending with her great-grandfather in photographs offers resonance without overt moral. However, "understood too late that to discover it fully was to become it" edges toward thematic declaration. The piece invites reflection, but the conceptual answer is articulated more than it is *felt* through a non-literal closing action.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of resilience emerges through concrete objects (seeds, dry soil) and the vault motif, but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "a green rebellion against the arid silence," "promise of new life," "his chains a map." These are prompt-echo labels rather than earned images. The liberator's internal arc is static—he begins purposeful and ends unchanged—so the thematic question is never tested through struggle. The vault and seeds offer potential for a charged image but are summarized ("each a promise of resilience") rather than left to resonate non-literally. Thematic Echo penalty applied for prompt-like language in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—trust as transmission, betrayal as silence—emerges through concrete particulars: vials of harmonic gaps, the whine beyond hearing, the grey of dead coral. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: trust doesn't shatter but stops broadcasting, leaving "pristine absence." No overt moralizing; the insight arises from Lyra's sensory archive and the final image of the device drifting "like a failed promise." Subtext operates in images (ashen forge, salt-scabbed panels, pale fruits) that avoid explicit thematic statement. The piece resists tidy resolution, embracing ambiguity in the "quiet that comes after."

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme gestures at destiny, illumination, and the act of translation versus theft, but relies on overt labels ("press your ear against destiny's door," "luminous disbelief," "map of illuminated moments") repeated without earned irony or reweighting. The portrait's "secret heartbeat" and the "melody of futures branching like rivers" are asserted rather than embodied in a concrete choice that forecloses one path. The final train departure and whispered instruction to moonbeams offer lyric closure but no non-literal answer or conceptual repricing—Lux confirms she will repeat the pattern forever, a thematic echo rather than a resonant shift. The grandmother's journal functions as inherited wisdom without on-page friction or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of grief's thaw emerges through concrete particulars: the cracked bookmark, the frozen gauge, meltwater, "question jars," the realization that "fire was the only thing that understood frost." The final image—bowl, floating bookmark, flickering gauge—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moral summary. Subtext operates in gesture (touching dampness then chest) and silence (Lena's absence voiced through objects). Minor slip: "to craft safe zones for inquiry didn't mean providing answers, but simply making space for the asking" nudges close to thematic statement, though it remains tied to scene action.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme "vulnerability as power" and the premise of a synthetic discovering her origin offer conceptual weight, but the story asserts rather than dramatizes the insight. The final paragraph ("cracks in their armor were not flaws but circuits of strength") states the moral directly, replacing scene pressure with thematic summary. The seashell and child's cast recur with symbolic intent, yet their meaning does not deepen through action—they illustrate rather than test the premise, and the "ghost of a daughter" introduces unearned sentiment that diffuses rather than sharpens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme—silence as language, map of quiet—emerges from recurring images (ambered hush, flaking gold leaf, pebble-shore whispers) rather than direct statement. The final image ("map flickered softly, a constellation of forgotten silences") reweights the premise modestly. However, the oracle's line "Thus the story was retold by summarizing silence" is explicit thematic echo in the final paragraph, triggering −0.6. The piece avoids moralizing elsewhere, lifting it to low-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the violin's resonance, looped timelines, and J-3's layered perceptions: consciousness as resonance across iterations rather than a singular spark. The final image—water droplets forming a perfect circle, sweeping as meditation—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "mundane mysticism" concept integrates well, charging ordinary maintenance with philosophical weight. One friction: the penultimate insight ("his quest…was not about locating a source but about participating in the endless creation") edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image carry meaning alone, though it stops short of overt moralizing and the final sweeping action grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of transparency-versus-mistrust emerges organically from the plot and is embodied in the lens's etching ("see beyond the surface"). The final image—lens on her desk, crystals singing harmony—offers a resonant visual answer without overt moralizing. However, the last four paragraphs over-articulate theme: "transparency could free," "trust had become the unspoken language," "transparency is the key to freeing oneself from doubt." These restatements flatten what the lens and forecourt already conveyed, pushing the piece toward thesis rather than implication.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (ritual, intention, and the bond between gardener and garden) emerges from the marble polishing motif, but the ending restates it explicitly across multiple paragraphs ("true measure of luck was not in numbers," "gardens truly know their gardeners") instead of trusting image. The mended deception concept is asserted rather than earned through contradictory choices. Subtext operates weakly; dialogue serves exposition. The final firefly image offers lyric resonance, but it arrives after thematic summary has already done the work, reducing its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of sideways time emerges through the magnetic nexus, Aurelian wing synchronization, and holographic projections treating time as frozen slices. The final image—timelines settling back into "linear illusion"—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. However, "time moves sideways, branching like frost rather than flowing like water" is stated early and restated at closure, reducing subtextual emergence. The piece invites reflection on perception versus reality, though Kael's conviction remains uncomplicated by doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—memory, completion, and the relationship between inspiration and loss—emerges organically from the flooded opera house, the diva's unfinished aria, and Mara's silence. The "in between spaces" motif accumulates meaning: physical (pit, balcony), temporal (folded time), and creative (silence and suggestion). The ending offers a quiet, non-literal answer: Mara will compose the aria, letting the spaces "sing for themselves." Subtext operates in the wordless conversation and the water-stain cipher. Minor slip: "lately inspired in a way that needed no ghost to sustain it" edges toward thematic summary, restating rather than charging the image.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of forgiveness and the weight of secrets emerges from the recurring motifs (smudge, botanical illustration, auroral sorrow), but the final paragraph's direct thematic statements ("the weight of a swallowed truth is measured not in mass, but in the release of its hold on the heart") replace scene pressure with sermonizing (−0.6). The auroral sorrow is evocative but remains external atmosphere rather than an internal cost that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—truth's measurable weight, silence heavier than fire—emerges organically from the beaded valve and the ghost shift. The final image (wheel with "confession booth shuttered and opened at last") reweights prior material without a stated moral. No overt sermonizing. The thirty-seven beads = thirty-seven souls device borders on tidy symbolic arithmetic, but it avoids abstraction by anchoring in the concrete count and Elias's embodied understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: decay, witness, silence as regeneration, the swan as map. "Crumbling peace" and "regenerative silence" recur with shifting weight, and the final image offers a lyric reprise without overt moralizing. However, the thematic question—how to accompany decay without judgment—receives no earned answer through specific struggle; the conclusion restates rather than reweights prior material with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (wonder persists beyond memory, becomes shared/music) emerges through particulars: the lullaby, the curl, the eclipse. The keepsake's cooling after "its work complete" borders on symbolic convenience but the final image ("wonder...returned") reconfigures the opening stakes without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in Eleanor's whisper and the "dreaming roots" motif. However, the ending leans toward sentimental affirmation rather than a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights with undeniable cost. The thematic question is posed more than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of memory migration from minds to matter emerges organically through the discovery sequence and the metaphor of walls as vessels. The dragons motif recurs purposefully (tapestry, diaries, final image) and reweights at closure when Elias becomes "the walls' newest story." The piece resists moralizing and offers a resonant conceptual answer: dreams displaced into matter when consciousness lost its compass. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("the dreams moving from minds to matter") rather than letting the image alone carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the particulars: fortune cookies, microdots, lighthouse beam, and "directing flow" all cohere into a meditation on agency versus fate without overt moralizing. The final fortune—forgetting her old name—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of self-transformation. The open secret motif (locals know but don't speak, Tomás's shell acknowledges without words) deepens subtext across beats. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites ambiguity: Mei Lin's new power may be control or a more subtle trap.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: silence as weapon, questions as levers, stillness as wound versus peace. The final image—"indigo spread across the air like a shadow cast by doubt itself"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: certainty is the true vulnerability. The loop pedal and rhetorical devices avoid symbolic convenience by shaping tactics throughout, and the monastery's dimensional instability provides a fresh frame for faith-as-sound-design theology.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece gestures toward a theme of memory, time, and the transfiguration of silence into sound, but leans heavily on prompt-label phrasing ("chronologically homesick," "conductor of unheard symphonies") rather than letting theme emerge from concrete particulars. The nautilus shell as a recurring object carries potential, yet its spiral is described more than it constrains or charges the ending. The final image—"symphony would continue, written in the quiet spaces between the stars"—offers abstraction in place of earned resonance, reading as thematic summary rather than a non-literal answer to a dramatized question.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme ("self as labyrinth") is stated repeatedly in prompt-like language rather than emerging from particulars: "You are the labyrinth," "she had become its architect." The final paragraph moralizes overtly ("the only victory possible: the acceptance of infinite recursion"), replacing scene pressure with thesis. Tablet and viaduct recur but do not shift meaning—each mention restates the same symbolic claim. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6) applies for the final-paragraph articulation of thesis without embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of silence-as-bridge emerges through the filament-of-hush conceit and backward song, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph's thesis ("her deafness became a bridge, not a barrier"). The phonograph ritual and drum reprise offer a non-literal answer to numbness, but the last lines ("Thus, the deaf music teacher found her song") summarize rather than trust the image. The "mirrored hush" motif recurs but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with undeniable cost—it remains a poetic label.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—integrity versus institutional suppression, the cost of solitary truth-telling—emerges through Elias's data-recording ritual and his choice to release evidence despite danger. The brass tube and pigeon carry thematic weight as instruments of clandestine resistance. However, lines like "to nurture integrity in solitude," "the fragile line between fact and fiction," and "a testament to truth" articulate theme directly rather than letting the final image do the work. The closing smile and confident stride ("a melody of defiance") resolve tension too neatly; the piece tells us stakes matter but shows a protagonist rewarded with tranquility. The ending offers assertion over resonant complication.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—time's texture, impossible choices—is stated repeatedly in poetic abstractions ("every fray is a door, every knot a home") rather than emerging from concrete action or image. The ending delivers a thematic summary ("the texture of time, now his companion") in place of a resonant non-literal answer. Motifs (rope, frayed ends, layers) recur but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward closure; they function as decorative recurrence. No earned insight arises from specific struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.8)
    "Beauty in the unfinished" and "chronic hush" are stated repeatedly but never emerge from concrete action. The final insight ("the story is never truly over") is delivered as philosophical summary rather than earned through specifics. The mendicant's bowl shifts from alms-holder to sound-vessel via declaration, not dramatized reweighting. Thematic echo in the final paragraphs ("magnificent simplicity," "unbinding the silence") replaces scene pressure with moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—the gap between counterfeit and genuine feeling, the dealer's longing to inhabit emotion—emerges through recurring images (static, amber, borrowed warmth) rather than statement. The "half truths" motif threads through but risks becoming a verbal tic rather than a pressure lever. The final image ("static quieted, settling into patient wait") offers a non-literal answer to the dealer's longing, though the answer is essentially "not yet," which defers rather than reweights. The piece resists moralizing and invites reflection, but the thematic question lacks a decisive confrontation or repricing at closure; the dealer's stance at the end mirrors the opening detachment. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, earning mid-band credit.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of "cycles of compassion" is stated repeatedly ("cycles of compassion Lena had set in motion," "cycles of compassion were as endless as the tide") rather than emerging from concrete action. The locket functions as a symbolic object but does not constrain choice or accumulate meaning through plot pressure. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "compassion, once given, returns in unexpected ways," "the melody of kindness played on"—replacing earned resonance with thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—belonging-in-difference—emerges through the tag's spiral etymology and Kael's realization about "dedication of one stranger to another's ghosts." The arbor's song and shadow-mapping create recurring images that reweight at the end. However, the penultimate paragraph states the theme overtly ("kinship wasn't blood or memory, but the dedication…"), flattening subtext. The final image (Kael reflected as kin) offers resonance, yet the "new language of belonging" line edges into summary. Complexity is present but occasionally spelled out rather than trusted to image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through concrete images: the city sustained by dream-breath, echoes as crystallized memory, and the illustrator who becomes her subject. The infinity symbol recurs with reweighted meaning (grandmother's pendant → constellation). However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary—"creator and created now" and "first true morning" risk stating rather than showing. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question (how to preserve what should persist) but leans slightly didactic. No overt moralizing, but the closing lines explain rather than trust the image.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from image and event: ambiguous loss transformed rather than resolved, love persisting despite unclear formulas, hope buried in silence. The glass eyes and mosaic function as sustained motifs that reweight at closure—eyes become witnesses, mosaic becomes a held space. Subtext operates through implication ("some mysteries are not meant to be solved, only lived") without overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph, where "love persists, even when the formula is unclear" edges toward direct statement. The final image—mosaic holding its breath, question lingering in the drip of stalactites—offers a resonant non-literal answer. Buried optimism surfaces in the birdsong at dawn and Vesper's faint smile, earned through prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: invisibility, witness, and methodical care as forms of connection. The tape reel fragment (1957 children's stories) and coal smoke sensory memory anchor the theme in concrete objects that carry the weight of the past into the present. "She had become visible, not in form, but in intention" arrives as earned insight rather than assertion, supported by the pattern of cached objects and the boy's discovery. The final image—Mara's methodical heart keeping time with the boy's words—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how one becomes seen. Subtext operates in gesture (the boy pocketing the fragment, Mara holding her breath) and the charged silence of the vent.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of control versus surrender emerges through image and action (forcing wood, vines resisting, rain as renewal). The linden leaf recurs purposefully, shifting from survival lesson to pressed talisman. "Circuitously sincere" as a character trait mirrors the narrative's spiral structure. However, the final third drifts into overt theme statements ("the most profound changes often happen in quiet surrender," "transformation sustained her") that assert meaning rather than trust the dramatized particulars. The old farmer's parallel metamorphosis in the penultimate section feels like thematic echo rather than earned complication.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—art as memory and continuity in a ruined world—emerges through the brooch, the portrait, and the rain trails without overt statement. The final image of painting over the younger self offers a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material. However, the closing lines ("the story was never truly finished," "the brush dance") edge toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. The ant in amber and the rain trails as language are evocative but approach symbolic convenience, introduced late without prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of magnifying everyday magic emerges from the pearl's function and the cave's transformation. The "bright darkness" paradox recurs with tonal purpose. However, the ending offers an asserted payoff ("gift of everyday wonder") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The phrase "steadily unpredictable" and "overlapping shadows" become label-only motifs without deepening choice or cost. The final meta-line ("the story itself became a note") intrudes as overt theme statement.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—absences define presence, silence as speech, negative space as meaning—emerges organically from the valve's mechanics and the archivist's final insight ("meaning emerged not from what was preserved, but from what had been lost"). The closing image (sun turning stones to ivory, spray writing "first draft" on her skin, "every ending was merely a silence waiting for its key") reweights prior material without moralizing. However, the piece edges toward over-articulation: "Her gift was never the recovery of sound, but the cartography of silence" and "heartening those who returned with the proof that their silence had been heard" border on Thematic Echo, though they stop short of prompt-language. The conceptual repricing (gaps as bridges, not wounds) lands clearly, and the final lines resist summary, keeping the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: maps of absences, words calcified into limestone, the fortress built from swallowed confessions. The phantom ticket punch as "a key forged specifically for those who saw patterns in loss and beauty in utility" integrates concept with character arc effectively. Yet the final paragraph dilutes resonance with direct thematic summary: "This was her new start, mapped not in ink but in courage, validated by a phantom punch that had finally found its proper ticket" explains rather than trusts the image. The story resists simplistic binaries but edges toward a therapeutic epiphany ("after she learned to speak its language") that feels tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme (memory, connection, healing through art) emerges from the premise but is stated overtly in multiple lines: "some truths are felt, not proven," "the power of courageously kind acts," "all that connects us." The magic square tile and whale song offer symbolic potential, but their meaning is explained rather than charged through action. The final image ("the unheard symphony played on") gestures toward resonance but does not reweight prior material with fresh cost or insight—it reiterates the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from Althea's dilemma: the tyranny of continuation versus the beauty of unknowing. The final image—dissolution into "a thousand unanswerable questions"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Recurring motifs (prismatic refraction, farewell, goodbye) shift meaning at closure. However, several passages veer into explicit philosophical statement ("the tyranny of eternal continuation," "ignorance was the most beautiful farewell") that edge toward thematic summary rather than letting particulars speak. The concept integrates well with character goal, and the ending avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme (fairness as negotiation with fate, honesty as luxury) emerges from the prep room discoveries and final transaction without thesis statements. The embalming fluid metaphor—"liquefies rigid thinking"—does thematic work but borders on over-articulation; the final line "counted the notes like currency" lands more cleanly. The ink pot's shift from artifact to bargaining chip charges the closure image. Minor weakness: "mathematics of equivalency" and "ethical algebra" repeat the concept in slightly different wrappers, risking redundancy rather than deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of invented histories and texture of time emerges from particulars (hum, gold leaf, spectral ink), but the piece telegraphs its concept repeatedly ("invented histories," "textures of time," "silent chronicles") rather than letting images speak. The final paragraph moralizes lightly ("quiet power, a way to hold time itself") and the closing lines restate the ritual without reweighting prior material. No earned insight or non-literal answer to the central question; the ending summarizes rather than transforms.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (erased histories concentrate rather than vanish; memory's texture is "salt on skin after water has dried") emerges through concrete particulars—layered scraps, the tackle box's growing weight, tidal rhythm. The poison label as proof of prior existence anchors the conceptual question in a physical object with visible cost (brittle paper, bitter memory). The ending image (box refusing to float) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Minor slip: "the texture of what it means to have been dead and still be living" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains tied to on-page action. The final paragraph's ship's horn and readiness to collect more fragments extend the question rather than closing it prematurely.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of storytelling, endings, and myth emerges through recurrent images (closing pages, silence, resonance), but the final insight—"the riddle was the reader, and the reader was always becoming"—is stated rather than earned through specific events. The piece leans heavily on metaphysical vocabulary ("ephemeral compass," "universal riddle," "ghost of truth") that reads as prompt-echoing rather than discovery rooted in scene particulars. The "gloomy cheerfulness" tone aims for thematic tension but remains label-only; we're told Elias is "cheerful, in a way" without dramatizing the friction between despair and delight.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of resistance through encoded art emerges organically from Mira's actions. The foundation stone chip shifting from memory anchor to embodied determination functions as a charged motif. However, the final phoenix mural and "hopeful desperation turning into determination" verge on overt symbolic summary. The piece resists moralizing but does not offer a resonant, non-literal answer—it stops at setup for future struggle rather than reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the premise: impermanence, the space age's tools versus nature's fragility, the futility of preservation. The final image (bloom fading, inspector turning away) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. Yet the thematic resonance leans on stock meditation ("what the universe could not preserve," "a moment that would never come again") rather than earned contradiction or a non-obvious synthesis. The bloom functions as a clear but conventional symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—navigation through brokenness, listening to what distorts light/sound—emerges from particulars (Miren's method, the fractured crystal, Kael's question) without thesis statement. The final glass-of-water demonstration reweights "seeing" as interpretation and offers a resonant teaching image. Slight weakness: "listening to what was broken until it told me which way was true" edges toward overt articulation where pure image would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: water's language, the paradox of finding beginnings at the point of absence, translation as listening. The recurring phrasebook dog-ear and "nishan" (unsprung) avoid overt statement. However, the piece edges into thematic echo with lines like "To find where the rivers begin is to become the source" and "maps must be rewritten by those who know endings are beginnings reversed"—these articulate the thesis rather than letting the final image hold it tacitly. The closing images (seven rivers, the word "Nishan") carry resonance but are slightly diluted by preceding explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the tuning fork's absorbed memory, the cobblestones' capacity to remember, and the residents' unconscious rhythms—pattern and persistence can resurrect what entropy devours. The central question (can sound restore architecture, can patience outlast collapse) receives a non-literal answer in the final image: the ghost town breathes, not yet saved but no longer dying. The ebony fork and archway recur with reweighted meaning, and "wild hush" shifts from death to possibility. The piece resists moralizing, though phrases like "shared balance" and "faithful steps" edge toward abstraction. The theme coheres with the accumulative design, but the middle section's repetition (he listens, he memorizes, he walks behind them) dilutes forward momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through the recurring "gathered hush" and the paradox that "some ephemera could only be captured by becoming stillness itself." The final image reweights the premise: Lira's sacrifice transforms her into the silence she sought, and the crystal vial becomes "a vessel for the gathered hush" rather than mere relic. Subtext operates in the captain's incomprehension ("hearing not words but a silence") and the story resists moralizing. Minor slip: "Tell them it was beautiful" edges toward thematic declaration, and the penultimate paragraph's summary ("some knots can only be unsnarled by surrendering") leans abstract rather than letting the image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—silencing inherited lies, chasing hush—is declared repeatedly ("thread a labyrinth," "sustaining impossibilities," "chase that never ends") but never emerges from concrete dramatized action or a final image that reweights prior material. The lattice as confessional relic gestures toward a motif but is mentioned in isolation without accruing pressure or altering a choice. The ending's statement "the hush he chased became the lighthouse's breath, and the impossible was now the only truth" is abstract philosophizing rather than earned resonance. No epiphany arises from specific struggle; the protagonist's arc is told, not shown. Thematic echo in the final paragraphs ("story of a boy who learned to chase hush") replaces scene pressure with summary moralizing; apply −0.6 within this band.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—love as "both poison and cure," debt across lifetimes—emerges from the ghost's presence and the bead's resonant awakenings. The final image (fruits bearing "sweet bitterness," the ghost's silhouette in future cameos) attempts a non-literal answer but relies on abstraction ("blessing and curse") rather than a specific dramatic irony. The "lovingly venomous" whisper is noted twice but not embodied in conflicting action. The ending offers resonance through mood and motif reprise (bead pulse as reminder) without a concrete on-page cost that reweights the opening question.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of transformation (ruin to reverence) is signaled early and recurs, but the final image offers a tidy moral ("something new could rise from the ashes") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The orchid/silver-thread motifs are introduced separately and layered, yet their convergence at closure reads as ornamental recurrence rather than reweighting prior particulars with cost. Subtext is minimal; all thematic weight is carried by overt poetic assertion. The penultimate paragraphs lean into direct statement ("a path from ruin to reverence woven in silver and stone") that summarizes rather than evokes.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (interrupted journeys, continuity, living archive) emerges organically from the orchard's particulars—roots intertwined with bones, sundial as timepiece of a lost era—and the final image (sundial whole, shadows stretching, journey as continuous unfolding) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. Subtext operates in gesture (brushing soil, fitting stone) and the orchard as metaphor for collective memory. Minor slip: the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("not just the sundial but the memory of her people, one stone at a time") rather than trusting the image alone. The closing whisper of return and the living-archive conceit avoid overt moralizing and sustain complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.7)
    "Meaning in the margins" operates as a coherent motif—overlooked spaces, sidewalk chalk codes, physical letters versus data—and the piece integrates it through Kael's work and the client's micro-dot confessions. The closing assertion ("the margins would remember") attempts resonance but arrives as direct thematic statement rather than emerging from a non-literal image or action. The Collective as monolithic digitizer feels stock, and Kael's stance ("rebellion," "resistance") is told more than shown through a concrete choice with ambiguity. The emotional aftereffect relies on futuristic nostalgia (analog methods in a digital age) which reads earnest but leans toward sentiment without complicating cost. No epiphany is dramatized; Kael's insight is stable from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of unheard stories and listening to silence emerges clearly through particulars (the flame, the stitches, the secret star). However, the final image leans on direct thematic statement ("I will not let your stories fade") rather than allowing the act itself to answer the question non-literally. The tapestry's glowing and the message it reveals serve the plot but do not deepen the thematic question in an unexpected way. The piece avoids moralizing but also avoids meaningful ambiguity—Mira's stance is heroic and uncontested.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through image and ritual: "The apology is not in the speaking, but in the listening." The unsent letters, shard, and singing spirits cohere around grief and release. The final image—letters as leaves finding their way, apology living in the mangroves' song—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The phrase "fierce tenderness" recurs purposefully, charging key beats. Slight reduction for the late reveal of the sister's death, which feels more like a thematic cue than an organically discovered truth.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme (translation as bearing unspeakable weight; wounds opened to graft) emerges through coral/cast particulars without statement. Final decrypted message ("I kept your number too") offers non-literal answer to the question of mutual abandonment, reweighting prior guilt as shared preservation. Subtext in negative space ("where you stopped speaking") and coral's "remembers every tide" avoids moralizing. Quiet ending earns resonance from sustained motif work.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—resilience, memory as living pulse, light piercing decay—emerges from the orchard's restoration and the shared breath of spectators. The final image ("the fog would return, but now it would carry the scent of blossoms") reweights the premise without stating a moral. However, the piece tilts toward abstraction in the final third: "fold of a daydream," "threads in a larger tapestry," "pensive mirth" become repeated labels rather than concrete discoveries. The closing two paragraphs summarize the thematic import rather than trusting the display beat to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is over-articulated: "exchange certainty for curiosity," "certainty is a surface that can be bewitched," "true restoration was not of paint but of wonder." The final paragraph moralizes rather than offering a resonant image. The nested-awakenings concept is announced repeatedly but does not emerge from particulars or reweight prior material. Thematic Echo in the penultimate line ("the true restoration was not of paint but of wonder") triggers −0.6; overall thematic statement density lowers the score further.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the resistance's method: thoughts as untaxable wildness, nature as cipher, language as territory. The gourd rattle seed and insect carriers function as recurring motifs that reweight at closure (seeds sprouting citywide as vows). Subtext operates in the coded dialogue ("aphids are particularly candid"). However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit thesis ("thoughts are territories, not commodities") and "the sound of freedom" risks sentimentality. The piece invites reflection on surveillance and autonomy without moralizing, but the ending's declarative confidence undercuts ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme ("pain into beauty") is stated rather than emergent from specific events. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "turned the pain of ages into blossoms," which is Thematic Echo (−0.6). The blossom/peace motif recurs but does not constrain choice or charge the closure with non-literal resonance. Subtext is thin; the galaxy postcard's promise is decoded on-page rather than layered. The ending offers no counter-reading or ambiguity, resolving into a tidy testament.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.3)
    The concept of deserted marvels and preservation laced with regret is coherent and emerges from imagery rather than explicit statement. However, the piece's reliance on prompt-adjacent abstractions ("extinct feelings," "foxglove regret," "deserted marvels") and its failure to ground theme in a concrete choice or cost keeps resonance at a mid-band. The final image reprises the opening without reweighting prior material, missing the chance for a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme (trust requires vulnerability and a shared language) emerges from the interconnected promises and the metaphor of extinct languages resurrecting. The final image of the empty ink well as a "reminder" and the divergence-with-connection offers resonance. However, the closing paragraph over-explains: "it wasn't the ink or the extinct words that mattered most" moralizes rather than trusting the image. The "symphonies of truth" oscillate between concrete world-rule and abstract symbol without committing to either.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (encrypted compassion as shared heartbeat, measured change) emerges from the chain/envelope mechanics and the hybrid floodgate. The phrase "encrypted compassion was not a hidden code, but a shared heartbeat" tips into overt articulation in the final third, though it grows from prior image work. The antique chain as ceremonial guide and the "living museum" offer resonance without didacticism. Subtext operates in the council's silence and Alia's whispered promise, though the ending risks over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—trust rebuilt through fragile rituals—emerges from dust-mapping and pigeon flights without overt statement. The meteorite, ledger, and skylight recur with shifting charge, and the final "bloom and wilt" image reweights the opening dust. However, the woman's songs and Elias's reinvention remain told rather than tested, and the ending smile asserts resolution without interrogating cost. The "paper trail" concept hovers as metaphor without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—sacredness of thresholds measured by intention and distance—emerges clearly from recurring images (grain, logbook, corn maze). Yet the ending states the theme directly ("some distances are necessary, and some thresholds are sacred") rather than offering a non-literal answer through image or action. The pilot logbook and wooden grain function as motifs without constraining a choice or charging the closure with cost. Subtext is thin; interiority often articulates the premise in prompt-like language rather than letting particulars speak.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of belonging as resonance rather than occupation emerges through the city's encoded layout and the protagonist's recognition that its people "transformed into water, stone, living light." The burnt feather and fireflies accumulate symbolic weight without being forced. The ending resists overt moralizing, though phrases like "Belonging was not a place you occupied, but a waveform you matched" verge on thesis statement. The final image of the feather settling and Iyana's "luminous welcome" offers a resonant answer to the central question, though it borders on abstraction rather than earned particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically: memory, loss, transformation, and the cycle of forgetting and remembrance are woven through images (sea-foam, crater glass, footprints). The final image—footprints that "seemed to lead nowhere and everywhere"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, "cheerful gloom" and "melancholy joy" are stated rather than embodied, and the line "every missing piece eventually finds its way back to the water's embrace" edges toward summary. The thematic answer is legible but leans on assertion rather than particulars alone.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of control versus chaos emerges through the bishop's diagonal moves and the phrase "calculated wilderness," but the final paragraph makes it overt: "wilderness had been tamed by calculation," "arithmetic of wonder." This meta-commentary replaces scene pressure with authorial summary. The stars "winking in their ancient, lightly attentive way" forces the prompt attribute into thematic decoration. The core question—can randomness be ordered—receives a tidy affirmative answer without complexity or ambiguity, trending toward thesis rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of memory versus erasure is stated overtly ("testament that memory could not be erased," "no ban can silence") rather than arising from specific, conflicted action. The final image—"living poem," "bridge between what was and what could be"—is asserted in abstract language instead of earned through a non-literal resonant detail. Motifs (moonstone dust, garden, stars) recur but do not constrain choice or reweight meaning at closure; they are decorative. The piece tells its thesis rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    A coherent theme—clarity coexisting with complexity, the luminous potential of the mundane—emerges through recurring images (glass, light, prism, ripples). The pond's concentric rings function as a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the piece states its thesis repeatedly ("the mundane was not a prison but a prism," "the world needed both the clarity of a simple pane and the complexity of a thousand colors") rather than allowing it to arise from dramatized pressure. The final image of the prism atrium "bathed in golden light" offers visual resonance but is preceded by two paragraphs of direct thematic summary, lowering the score.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—survival as betrayal, memory as witness—emerges organically through the porcelain box, scar language, and stone circle without didactic statement. The final lines ("translate her pain into something larger") approach thematic summary but remain grounded in action (writing manuals). Subtext operates in the box's emptiness holding ash, fractures scattering light. The ending reweights prior material (innocence bargained becomes teaching tool), though the move is contemplative rather than earned through present friction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (hope as quantifiable force requiring resonance, not naive infusion) emerges organically from Kael's experimental method and the recurring imagery of shells, glass, and tides. The closing realization—that she herself was the final trial balloon—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. However, the piece leans heavily on abstract terminology ("quantum superposition," "harmonic convergence," "coefficient") that keeps the thematic work at conceptual distance; embodied particulars (the sea glass mandala, the gauge's hum) do the real lifting but are outnumbered by declarations. The final paragraph's "solve itself" phrasing edges toward thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of suppressed knowledge and unfinished hope emerges organically from the diaries and film strip. The recurring phrase "legacy's burden" and the final corridor message "Remember, but act" provide thematic closure. However, the ending relies on explicit thematic summary ("to discover what walls dream about was to inherit their unfinished stories") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The piece avoids moralizing but does not resist the urge to state its insight directly. The film negative as a talisman of past solutions offers a concrete anchor, though its thematic charge is told more than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—the power of coded possibility and borrowed life to transform perception—emerges from event and image rather than statement, though the final third edges toward overt summary ("the magic it had just awakened"). The prism and lullaby recur with purpose, and the mirrors' faint glimmer offers a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the painter's borrowed heartbeat and the children's unknowing repetition of the code. The ending resists a stated moral, but the piece flirts with explaining its own resonance in the penultimate beats.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.9)
    The "price of redemption" and "flawed beauty" motifs recur and are woven into imagery (scars, imperfect signatures). The story resists a stated moral and attempts to ground theme in the ritual's particulars. However, the final lines ("quiet promise," "kinder horizon") tip into abstraction rather than offering a resonant, non-literal image that reweights prior material. The theme is felt more as a declared thesis than as an emergent property of specific, contradictory human action.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—preservation intertwined with destruction—emerges organically from the egg release, the manufactured drought, and the final erasure by rain. The closing image of the echo lingering while the map is washed away offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the final paragraph tilts toward thematic summary ("fractured grace lay in its dual nature") and labels the protagonist ("amoral philanthropist hiding a sentimental wound") rather than trusting the particulars to carry meaning. No overt moralizing, but the ending leans expository.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of liberation versus conformity emerges through concrete images: the lullaby, the harvest of echoes, the untangled threads. The phrase "between sigh and smile" recurs purposefully and gains weight at closure ("Between this sigh and the next smile, a city had changed"). However, the final paragraph edges toward abstraction—"bodily poetic nature of her dance had been not just art, but translation"—and the teaching moment ("She taught them to listen to echoes") feels like a stated moral rather than an earned resonance. The prism's release of voices offers a strong thematic image, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—ethical storytelling as un-telling, erasure of justification—emerges from the backward puppet structure rather than statement. The final image ("a signature in negative space," "un-tell the world into clarity") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, thematic claims ("every story is a series of erasures") are stated mid-text rather than fully dramatized, and the piece toggles between showing the method and explaining its philosophy. The woman's realization and the meteor-hush moment carry genuine weight, but Adrian's arc defaults to demonstration rather than conflicted discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: interrupted cadence as ecological and personal rupture, temporary structures as shaped absence, witnessing as an act against erasure. The moth wing—humbler than a monarch—embodies the "overlooked histories" premise without stating it baldly. Subtext operates in the image-work (the sky's "blushing stillness" as apology, the tower that whistles) and the final moment invites reflection without moralizing. Minor slip: "This was how you honored overlooked histories" edges toward direct statement, and the "esoteric realist" calculations feel slightly thesis-driven. The ending offers a resonant answer—memory carried into emptiness—that reweights the temporary-permanent paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—preservation through absence, forgiveness enabling purpose—emerges from particulars (bell/names, void/voice) and the final image of glowing rope holding voices resonates without stating a moral. "Snowmelt ardor" and the bell/sound motif recur purposefully. However, the final paragraphs edge toward thematic echo ("This was her true calling," "one name at a time") that risks summary rather than letting the image speak. The piece resists tidy morals but occasionally explains its own metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (patterns meant to be broken, transcendence through letting go) emerges from image and action: vines reclaiming the bunker, the laughing fox as joke-from-the-builders, the Archive as seed whose shell must crack. The final image—becoming "precisely nothing and playfully everything"—reweights the directive without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the wafer seal's design and the storm as dissolution. Minor slip: "The directive decays not from neglect, but by design" is a Thematic Echo moment where the fox articulates thesis in near-prompt language, but it's brief and wrapped in dream logic, limiting the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the tile's encrypted devotion: humanity's persistent voice against cosmic indifference, patterns that outlive regimes. The irony that "magic" reveals itself as advanced rationality is purposeful and woven through Kael's empirical measurements. The final image—papyri outliving frugality and astronomy, the palace settling into its next incarnation—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, several moments edge toward thematic echo: "the unknown did not require worship, only acknowledgement" and "patterns persist when regimes fall" risk stating the thesis rather than embodying it through scene pressure, keeping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of forgiveness as a shifting, repeatable act rather than a permanent state emerges through the pin's broken/whole cycle and the sanctuary's flux. However, the final paragraph ("to teach that the heaviest chains are those we forge from memory") over-articulates the theme in thesis language, replacing scene pressure with authorial summary (−0.6). The pin motif is purposeful but relies on symbolic recurrence rather than causal constraint. Emotional honesty is thin—Elara's resentment dissolves too easily, and Mira's scheme feels more asserted than earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of boundary dissolution emerges organically from the sextant reconstruction, synchronized breathing, and the final merger of dream and orchard. The piece resists overt statement, letting the glass-mountain transformation embody the question of capture versus becoming. However, several lines drift toward thematic echo: "In erasing the boundary between himself and the vision, he had become both mirror maker and dreamer" and "he had captured the runaway dream not by containing it, but by becoming the place where it chose to anchor" state the theme rather than trusting the image to carry it. The final paragraph's "knowing that tomorrow he would breathe with the orchard again, and together they would dream new constellations into being" tilts toward aspirational summary rather than resonant particular.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the ribbon's arc: binding to release, childhood vow to seasonal growth, the mother's note ("Vows are leaves; let them fall when the season turns") seeds the insight that lands in the mender's reply and the daughter's acceptance. The quartz eyes and the orchard's revival embody renewal without overt moralizing. The final image—ribbon on wrist, trees breathing, cathedral learning to breathe—resonates as a non-literal answer to the generational-wisdom question. One slip: the daughter's closing line ("It reminds us that some ties are meant to be loosened, so we can mend what truly matters") states the theme too explicitly, replacing earned resonance with articulated lesson. The "accidental wisdom" frame is honored in the squirrel encounter and the spontaneous reply, though the years-later summary risks turning insight into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme (mourning across impossible distances, memorial as duty) emerges through image and event rather than statement. The orchard-as-language conceit deepens from decorative to structural: blossoms are sentences, fruit tastes like equations, trees are tombstones for dead universes. The final image—"between each heartbeat and breath, the story would continue, nonlinear and perfect"—reweights the entire frame without moralizing. One slip: "bewilderment was not a flaw but the correct state for a translator" edges toward authorial thesis in the bathroom scene. Otherwise the piece earns its wisdom through the shell-carving sequence and fruit-bite revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.3)
    The "unheard symphony" motif recurs frequently but remains abstract metaphor without grounding in concrete action or cost. Theme of "gaps as bridges" and "unlearned lessons" is stated overtly ("every unlearned lesson held the potential to change history") rather than dramatized. The final image—diary now complete, mountain singing louder—asserts resonance without reweighting prior stakes. The warden's "silent chord" metaphor is repeated without evolving meaning. No thematic irony or counter-reading emerges; the tale resolves into a tidy moral about listening and resourcefulness.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of fragmented identity and acceptance emerges through recurring images (twin blossom, emerald card glow) and the garden as archive. However, the final "realization" is delivered as direct thematic statement ("the garden's solace was not a fire to be lit, but a quiet acceptance") rather than through a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The "unkindled solace" motif is told rather than dramatized with visible cost. Subtext is weak; most meaning is surfaced in narration.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the "fables of absence" premise: history told by what is missing, institutional memory as woven record, and the ethical imperative to acknowledge gaps. The rope as both ceremonial object and historical ledger avoids overt symbolism by functioning causally—its braids must be reconfigured to merge timelines—and the final image of the clock chime's added beat offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "phantom thread...deliberately separated," the "ghost narrative haunting the stacks," and the maintenance logs' "seamless continuity" that silently rewrites three centuries. The piece resists tidy binaries: completeness is rejected ("never the goal; only clarity"), and the final line—"some fables must release their silence to keep the present honest"—lands as earned insight rather than platitude, synthesizing the thematic question with Elara's closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—silence as presence, cyclical reprieve, the mapkeeper's role in a living instrument—emerges from concrete actions (crack alignment, stone use) and images (the bloom, the hammered repose). The final image ("silence was not the absence of sound, but its own presence") offers a thematic restatement but comes close to direct assertion rather than non-literal answer. The echo chamber stone's recurrence reweights its function from tool to promise, a positive. However, "bloom of hush" and "hammered repose" are repeated as labels without evolving connotation; the second bloom does not deepen the question, only restates it. No overt moralizing in the final paragraph, but the passage "as long as the caves resonated, she would find silence again" edges toward comfort rather than resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—coincidence as deep order—emerges from the custodian's visions and the star-path convergence. The final image (beacon answered by another distant beacon) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the text drifts into direct thematic statement: "coincidence was the echo of a deeper order," "hope is a geometry we build together." The shard of hush and star paths function thematically but the piece leans toward assertion ("What seemed like random chance was the universe's oldest language") rather than letting the particulars speak. The ending avoids a tidy moral but the thematic voice becomes over-articulated in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of shadows (precise, mathematical memory) and whispers (chaotic, undifferentiated chorus). The archivist's question—"am I still myself, or have I become sum of every voice I have tried to save?"—poses a genuine tension, and the final image of silence between whispers offers a non-literal answer. However, the closing lines drift toward abstraction: "identity was not sculpted from experience, but from spaces where experience dissolved into meaning" reads as a thesis statement rather than a resonant particular. The moss-bound journal's line "We are not keepers of truth, but gardeners of relevance" provides conceptual depth, yet the ending leans on summary rather than a charged image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—hope kindled against despair—emerges through the fire/darkness contrast and the mosaic note "Rise," avoiding overt thesis. The final image ("fortress glowed like a promise") offers a resonant visual answer without moralizing. However, the theme remains anchored in a single layer: light versus dark, with minimal ambiguity or counter-reading. The "serious playfulness" tone intention (Q9J) does not complicate the emotional arc; the journey feels earnest throughout, and the ending affirms rather than reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The transition-periods theme emerges organically from the tidal-pool imagery and the cicada's symbolism of shedding. The final image attempts a non-literal answer ("texture of time settle into the grooves of her memory"), but it edges toward abstraction rather than concrete reweighting. The piece resists overt moralizing and sustains thematic coherence, yet the ending reiterates rather than transforms prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (confinement vs. liberation, silence as refuge) emerges from the premise but resolves into a tidy moral stated in the final line. The porcelain doll and silence motifs recur but do not accumulate contradictory pressure or reweight prior material; they function as tokens. The ending epiphany ("prison could hold a garden") is asserted rather than dramatized through a non-literal image with felt cost, lowering thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—silence as presence, not absence—emerges through concrete particulars (noise meter cascades, storm glass crystals, the whisper of breath) rather than statement. The final image offers a non-literal answer: Kael waiting in the vaulting hush, ready to teach silence its next lesson, her work perpetual and solitary. The diplomat's tears refracting prismatic light avoid overt symbolism while charging the quiet. One slip: "fluidly logical" appears twice as an unearned descriptor, a prompt-label that doesn't quite dissolve into the prose. The piece resists moralizing but stops just short of full ambiguity—Kael's method works too cleanly, with no acknowledged cost to her isolation or the limits of her gift.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (renewal over reclamation, the guardian's renunciation) emerges from the lore keeper's final choice and the orchard's sealing, avoiding overt moralizing. However, "wisely adventurous" and "futuristic nostalgia" float as prompt labels rather than being earned through concrete action; the double-moon child and data-stream heartbeat in the coda feel like thematic insurance rather than organic consequence. The ending offers resonance through the prepared-throne image, but the conceptual cost of her dissolution into "dawn mist" reads more as lyric flourish than undeniable price.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme is stated overtly: "Breathing is a bridge we build," "shadows are the only breaths that remain when the world turns to ash," and the final two paragraphs summarize the keeper's role as "to teach suffocating to breathe." The doorknocker ring and threshold are token recurrences without constraining a choice or reweighting prior material through action. The ending offers no resonant image or non-literal answer; it cycles back to the opening premise with a new visitor in a static loop. Thematic Echo in the penultimate and final paragraphs triggers the −0.6 deduction for prompt-language summary in place of earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of pressure-as-transformation and redemption emerges organically from the mushroom/diamond alchemy and Kael's past. The quantum promise and "shadowseam wonder" motifs recur, but the final paragraph risks thematic summary: "turned his darkest pressure into the brightest gems" borders on stated moral. The ending offers a resonant image (porthole bolt glinting, glitchy texts silent) yet lacks ambiguity or non-literal answer—the transformation is delivered cleanly without complicating cost. Subtext operates in the glitchy messages but Kael's internal reconciliation with failure is told more than dramatized at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme—memory as preservation versus destruction—emerges from the central reversal, but the shift from "ender" to "keeper" is told in the line "he understood now" rather than dramatized through a non-literal image or action that reweights prior material. The golden-shadows motif recurs frequently yet remains ornamental; no particular shadow constrains a choice or charges the closure. The piece avoids overt moralizing but also lacks the specificity to generate a resonant, ambiguous aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.8)
    "Possibility" and "allegiance" recur throughout but remain abstract labels; no concrete particular reweights them at closure. The final image—Aldric as guardian, marionettes animated by his will—asserts thematic satisfaction ("never be alone") without a non-literal answer earned by prior events. The piece leans on prompt vocabulary ("shivering bliss," "factually mystical," "shape of possibility") in place of scene-specific resonance. Thematic drift: the "withdrawn" knight's loneliness is declared solved off-page rather than dramatized through cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from dust-as-history metaphor: "histories, like dust, settle in patterns that can be read." The button functions not as symbol but as concrete residue of a social worker's decision to preserve something permanent. Marianne's method—reading accumulated layers—embodies rather than states the thematic question of how small kindnesses survive systemic neglect. The ending's "tactfully hopeful" stance resists tidy resolution: her broken heart eases through recognition, not healing, and the cost (Marcus's death before receiving the button) ensures complexity. The daughter's letter provides non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—resistance to systemic erasure—emerges clearly but relies on direct statement ("tyranny of indifference," "holding the line") rather than accumulated particulars. The phone booth key recurs with shifting weight (grandfather's legacy, map tool, totem), yet the final image's whispered coordinates read as a late symbolic add-on rather than an earned resonance. The ending offers a straightforward triumph without ambiguity or conceptual repricing; no counter-reading is invited.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme emerges obliquely through images of silence, light, and prophecy, but the final paragraph devolves into thematic echo: "some silences are louder than any note, and some hushes are forever vested in the mist" reads as prompt-language moralizing. The piece offers no concrete answer to its central question; the prophecy vanishes without reweighting prior material or revealing stakes. Eerie nostalgia is asserted repeatedly but never earned through specific, contradictory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—memory, prophecy, the arbor's renewal—is asserted through repeated phrases ("tiny monuments to forgotten things," "mossy delight") rather than emerging from specific conflict. The ending states the message ("arbor must be fed with moonstone dust") as exposition, not dramatic discovery, and Lira's final satisfaction is declared rather than earned by particulars. The recycled phrase "mossy delight" (four appearances) and "emerges transformed always" function as motif tokens without accruing new meaning or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme—embracing uncertainty over rigid certainty—emerges through the broken clocks, the wild compass needle, and the final decision to "leave them slightly imperfect." The grandfather's line about letting "the map draw itself" seeds the theme concretely. Weakness: the final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("a reminder that certainty is just another kind of ash," "all true navigation begins in uncertainty") rather than letting the image of the spinning needle and the unlocked greenhouse carry the weight. The thematic resonance is present but heavy-handed at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—the weight of names, kintsugi as redemption—emerges organically from the coin ritual and foundry imagery without stated morals. The ending image (foundry's golden shadow, cracks painted by dawn) offers a resonant answer: redemption is recognition, not retrieval. The particularity of Pisces swimming upstream and Aquarius pouring into the furnace grounds the abstraction, though "luminous regret" occasionally tilts toward label rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the harp's discord, the tooth's memory of finality, and the progression from chasing lost joy to accepting integrated brokenness. The final image—crocodile's tooth and silver vial clicking together, "a hollow sound that promised integration"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the gap between Kael's professional efficiency and personal evasion. The piece resists tidy resolution: healing becomes coexistence with fracture rather than erasure. One minor slip: "the pain of becoming whole—was the most honest song Echo Gorge had ever sung" edges toward thematic summary, though it's anchored in the gorge's prior role as repository of confessions.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of mercy as pattern versus formula emerges through recurrent images (UV light, pewter strap, proprioceptive mapping), and the piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly—"mercy was not to be calculated, but to be lived, one breath at a time"—substituting thematic summary for earned resonance. The mathematics metaphor (ratios, variables, coefficients) is repeated without transformation or irony. Thematic Echo in the final lines triggers a −0.6 deduction in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of honoring overlooked histories emerges through the lens fragment, Elias Thorne's journal, and the translator's vow to "become the keeper of their light." However, the final lines state the theme overtly ("honoring overlooked histories meant not just preserving names, but also becoming the keeper") rather than letting the image resonate. The lighthouse-as-language motif recurs but doesn't constrain choice or shift meaning under pressure—it decorates rather than complicates. The ending offers a clear thematic answer but leans toward summary over earned subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (bearing witness to "ordinary cruelty," the silenced mechanisms of exploitation) emerges from concrete particulars: the engraved mainsprings, the ringmaster's crumpled-paper voice, the architectural testimony. The final image ("silenced mechanisms of ordinary cruelty") reweights Marlon's lifelong search without overt moralizing. However, "weightless burden" appears as a label in the final paragraph rather than being fully dramatized through cost. The ghost testimony is specific and earned, but the resolution leans slightly abstract—"the weightless burden of bearing witness" is named rather than shown in a sacrifice or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of order/chaos negotiation and the paradox of capturing eternity emerges through image and action rather than statement. The frost-to-print-to-rupture sequence embodies thematic movement without overt moralizing. Final image—libraries merging into "a new kind of order" that writes itself—offers a resonant answer to the eternity-compression question. However, the thematic payoff leans toward abstraction ("neither destruction nor creation but both") where more concrete particulars would deepen resonance. No sermonizing; tone supports concept throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme of truth versus curated history emerges clearly from the shard and archive dispute, and the mirror-covering ritual offers a charged metaphor. However, the ending tells theme rather than earning it through scene particulars: "the shard's power" and "quiet resolve of a poet who knows words can outlast empires" are direct thematic statements. The poem inscription flickering into view is a symbolic reveal without a non-literal answer to the central question. Closing lines drift into abstraction ("burnished sorrow that polished each word") rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (honesty vs. rust/corrosion, mending as act of truth) emerges from the repairman's curse and the covenant mechanics. The final image—music box playing "truthful tune that would never break"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, the woman's revelation as "the city's forgotten song" and the line "to mend what isn't torn" veer close to thematic echo in the final paragraph. Subtext operates in the rust mechanics and the philosopher's stone's warmth, but the ending articulates meaning a bit too directly ("let honesty sing").

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—mystery as resource, the hinge between knowing and not-knowing—emerges organically from the lagoon's refusal to ripple, the compass's stubborn deviation, and Mira's choice to mark rather than cross the threshold. The final image ("petrichor collector walked home...her vials empty, her purpose finally aligned") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Hinged awakening" as metaphor is threaded purposefully: "understanding swung open on a different kind of hinge." One slip: "some awakenings must remain hinged—neither fully open nor closed" becomes a thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph, slightly over-articulating what the image already conveys. No diagnostic label-speak or late sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—continuity across generations, knowledge passed through particulars rather than declaration—emerges organically from the lantern slide, carvings, and token placement. The final image (line of figures in mist) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. "The perpetually learning never stopped, because the lesson was not in the carving but in the listening" is a near-thematic-echo that borders on articulating the thesis, but it remains grounded in the specific sensory vocabulary (wood, wind, hum) and avoids overt sermon. The piece resists easy binaries and commits to its premise of layered, nonverbal transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges from the night-blooming flower motif and the hidden-layers conceit, avoiding overt statement until the penultimate line ("darkness is not an absence, but a quiet invitation"). The final image of visitors adding postcards and Sable mixing silver pigment offers resonance. However, the theme skirts banality—"flowers bloom for the moon, not the sun's approval"—without sufficient on-page friction to charge it beyond familiar romantic lyricism. The answer feels handed rather than earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of contested memory and institutional erasure emerges organically from the encrypted diary and beach-debris testimony. "Truth in tension" recurs as a phrase, bordering on direct statement, but the story earns thematic weight through the specifics of the Dunes Massacre cipher and the dual motivations (Elara's archival duty, the Under-Minister's inherited silence). The final image—descendants recognizing grandparents' symbols—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, the resolution feels tidy: the parley concludes, the truth is broadcast, and all parties find peace, reducing the moral complexity to a "both sides had secrets" symmetry that flattens the ethical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—memory as generative rather than restorative—emerges through the amber bottle's sealed state and Kael's sketches. The final image of the bottle on a pedestal with lanterns glowing offers a non-literal emblem. However, the closing paragraphs ("true alchemy is not in gold, but in the courage to remember and to dream anew") state the thesis overtly rather than trusting the particulars, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The piece resists nostalgia in concept but does not dramatize competing pulls or cost, so the theme floats above the action rather than emerging from pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through concrete images: the wax recording, the reflecting pool, the leaf's veins echoing the hum. The piece resists moralizing; the final image of the sealed spindle and future scribes wondering "how a simple wax shaving could hold the heartbeat of a city" offers resonant ambiguity. The orchard's sigh and medlar roots ground the conceptual in the particular, and the prophecy-as-emotional-map reweights the premise without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.7)
    The phrase "texture of borrowed time" recurs throughout and anchors thematic attention, but the concept is asserted rather than earned through concrete particulars: "it was both fragile and infinite," "it was the warmth of possibility." The ending restates the theme ("furiously tranquil," "wild serenity") without offering a non-literal image or realization that reweights prior material. Thematic echo penalties apply: "the texture of borrowed time" is articulated in prompt-like language in the final third, reading as meta-commentary rather than dramatized insight.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges through the listening-versus-noise motif and Elara's final journal entry ("Zero hour is not when we sound the alarm, but when we choose not to"). However, the story edges toward stating the theme rather than embodying it: "Humility, she thought, was knowing when not to raise your voice" and "data without wisdom was just another noise" are direct articulations that replace scene pressure. The recurring motifs (solstice hush, windblown sanctuary, instruments' song) are vivid, but their final recurrence reiterates rather than reweights the central question. The ending offers a resonant image but borders on moralizing with the journal's explicit thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of "flourishing stillness" and "strength in vulnerability" is stated overtly ("realized," "understood," "taught them") rather than emerging from image and event. The final paragraph moralizes ("reminder that even in the quietest corners of the universe, life finds a way to shine") instead of trusting resonance. Recurrence of the yellow glass and moss could charge closure but remains decorative; no non-literal answer reweights prior material. Subtext is minimal—gesture and silence yield to direct thematic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.9)
    A coherent theme of memory and unspoken language emerges through images (bees, glass, covenant). The stained glass box accrues slight symbolic weight across its appearances, approaching a purposeful reprise. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "the weight of words would never fade," "guarded the mute eloquence of the past"—telling the theme rather than letting the image speak. The ending offers no non-literal answer; it states the thesis in prompt-like language.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—borrowed time as gift rather than debt, and damaged messages as transformation—emerges through image and event rather than sermon. The final image of the urn fragment "against the borrowed heartbeat she no longer needed" attempts resonant reconfiguration. However, the piece leans on prompt-adjacent phrasing ("texture of time passing," "numbers change meaning") that hovers near thematic echo. The garage-sale listings ("its light remembers when shadows were solid") inject lyric subtext, but the climactic revelation is told rather than dramatized, weakening the thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of incompleteness and beauty-in-brokenness is stated explicitly and repeatedly ("beauty often resides in what is left unfinished," "each broken thing he encountered was a verse waiting to be written") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The drake's feather and kite are symbol tokens that announce their meaning instead of earning resonance through action. Paragraph 20's meta-commentary ("he realized that his role was not to finish the poem") is thematic echo rather than dramatized insight. The final whisper (paragraph 32) restates rather than reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—respect as translation, legacy as bridge rather than monument—emerges through the copper network's function and Elias's metamorphosis without overt statement until the diary's final entry, which borders on thematic echo but gains some cover by being attributed to a prior caretaker's hand. The orchard's "brazen calm" and "gently systematic" work embody rather than declare the theme. The final image of the new caretaker as "correspondent" rather than "owner" reweights the premise with conceptual cost: stewardship requires yielding the self. However, the piece skirts moral complexity—Elias's choice is never conflicted, the orchard's consent is assumed, and no counter-reading complicates the vision of interspecies harmony. The resonance is real but harmonically simple.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of homecoming as chemical and emotional convergence emerges organically from the images (footprints, amber, tower spiral). The irony—"the most artificial of pilgrimages had revealed the most natural of truths"—verges on explicit moralizing but stops short of explaining the theme. The fly amber recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the final image. However, the protagonist's arc remains cerebral; the "chemistry of homecoming" applies to the aliens but not to her own exile or emotional state, limiting thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—harmony between living and dead, memory as renewal—emerges from the seed pods, dead languages, and submerged concord without overt statement. The final image of the garden as "living tapestry" and "narrow vastness filled with colour" offers resonance. However, the closing paragraphs lean toward thematic summary ("does not erase the memory… simply lets the living and the dead share the same breath") rather than letting the image speak without meta-commentary. The coachman's smile and the vow in the final line edge toward explicating rather than trusting the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme (bridging distance through preserved presence) emerges organically from the phonograph mechanism, wax leaf, and vault archive without thesis statements. The final image—Wick curled among cylinders—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: closeness exists in grooves and voice, not physical return. "Tinted revelations" integrates as the warped voices and aged cylinder deliver meaning through filters of rust and grief. The autumn leaf's vein-map and fire-color subtly contrast the wasteland without symbolic shouting. Subtext operates in Maya's note timing ("three days before") and Wick's scent-hallucination of her uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the compass rose, sketching ritual, and the "true north of the heart" motif, avoiding overt statement until the penultimate lines. The recurring image of anniversaries and star charts shifts meaning across the piece, from memory-tether to hope-map. However, the closing lines edge toward thematic summary ("direction is a choice, not a destiny") that replaces scene pressure with assertion. The final image of sketching "one star at a time" offers resonance but is slightly undercut by the explanatory tag about "new anniversaries yet to be drawn."

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme of "embracing the unknown" is stated repeatedly ("sacredly playful," "the unknown was not a threat, but an invitation") rather than emerging from dramatized friction. The final paragraphs moralize explicitly: "the chivalrous thief had become the guardian of wonder, his story a testament to the power of embracing the unknown with open arms." No counter-reading or ambiguity; the resolution is declarative and symmetric. The chess pieces and sundial lid recur but do not reweight prior material with new meaning or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of memory and "small gestures" is stated repeatedly in near-identical phrasing ("historian of small gestures," "quiet vow to never forget," "spelled hope in his wake") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraphs function as thematic summary, delivering multiple declarations instead of one resonant image. The chessboard motif recurs but does not shift meaning—it remains a static symbol throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme—belonging as a pattern of connections rather than a place—emerges from the bookstore-as-map conceit and the "shape of home" motif. The feather and stone recur with shifted meaning (decorative gift → inscribed talisman). However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "the hidden thunder...became the heartbeat of a new home" and "how a seer...seeded a forgotten tongue into the world" reads as legend-summary rather than image. The piece tilts toward declaration ("the story of the lost language stone would be whispered") instead of trusting particulars to resonate. No moral is stated outright, but the explain-everything ending flattens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—forgiveness as iterative winnowing rather than single act—emerges through the tapestry metaphor and the tutor's task. The wooden pawn reprise and the girl's request create resonance. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "forgiveness was not a single act but a continuous winnowing of guilt," reducing subtext to thesis. The ending image (dawn, peace, "fierce repose of a new day") gestures toward earned wisdom but feels summarized rather than enacted. Strong potential undercut by explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges from image and action: refracted light as metaphor for plural truth. The final image of children with colored glass offers a resonant echo without stated moral. However, lines like "the price of forgiveness was paid not by the one offering it, but by the system demanding it" and "truth, like light, never travels in straight lines" tip into thematic summary in the final section, softening the earned resonance. The core question is posed concretely and the spire's chromatic defiance roots the abstract in particulars, lifting the score into the mid-6 band despite the late articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kintsugi theme—repair as remembering, gilding fractures with intention—emerges through concrete action (filling pockmarks with gold) rather than abstract statement. The final image of the statue's scars "singing the truth of survival" and Elara wearing uncertainty "as armor, gilded and glorious" offers a resonant answer to whether brokenness can become beauty. However, the closing lines ("now it was enough," "until either she or the sea became something entirely new") tip toward overt thematic summary. The motif of quilting memories is established early and paid off through repeated stitching actions, but the sea's dream memory—"when it was clean and full of living light"—introduces late material that feels thematically convenient rather than causally prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of nostalgia, memory, and letting-go emerges through concrete images (cracked mirror, painted seashell, hidden oasis), and "temporary eternity" recurs as motif. However, the final paragraph over-articulates the theme in summary mode: "tapestry of his temporary eternity," "threads...wove a pattern of hope," "keeper of secrets, a wanderer of hidden shores" — declarations that replace earned resonance with thematic echo. The painted seashell left in the oasis offers a quiet non-literal answer, but the wrap-up moralizes rather than trusts the image to hold weight.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The whisper-versus-shout premise emerges organically from Elara's observation and the sensory metaphor of scent traveling on intention. The cork's scent-memory (love and loss) and the lighthouse's purifying function interweave to pose a question about how tenderness communicates. The final exchange—"teach me how to listen" / "we begin with silence"—offers a non-literal answer grounded in the vibration motif. However, the closing lines risk stating the theme ("screaming tenderness...a sound so loud it required no voice at all") rather than letting the image alone carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—navigating loss, building bridges of signal and memory—emerges organically from Kael's soldering and the censer foot's lunar pulse. The "geography of loss" metaphor evolves from barren map to traversable landscape, and the final image reconfigures the station's broken hydraulics as "irrelevant," its purpose fulfilled. The piece avoids overt moralizing; the ending's "raw solace" and "star that had finally found its way home" offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Minimal thematic echo in the final lines ("raw solace" slightly over-articulates the emotion), but the earned transformation of the salvage into a working bridge carries the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—truth as both wound and healing—emerges through concrete images (splinter, shard, armor) and the orchard's shift from decay to ripening fruit. The final image of the cracked glass eye as "a map of the broken world we were trying to mend" is purposeful and non-literal. However, the penultimate move toward explicit articulation ("I realized that the eye was not a curse but a tool") and the teaching mode in the closing paragraphs edge toward thesis statement rather than allowing the particulars to resonate without guidance. The prompt concept "psychological safety" is never fully sublimated into dramatized stakes; it remains a label the text must state.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—memory, witness, and the need to be seen—emerges organically from the boutonniere, Cornelius's gift, and the recurring beam-sweep image. The line "Memory is the true keeper of light" arrives as a sketch caption rather than character epiphany, keeping it non-intrusive. The final image of the lighthouse beam as "silent promise" reweights prior material, and the edelweiss's return in Cornelius's pocket ("softly persistent") charges the ending without overt moralizing. However, the proliferation of thematic summary in the final paragraphs ("quiet testament," "power of being seen," "forever illuminating") edges toward assertion rather than leaving the resonance implicit in image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the doorway-of-decisions motif and the contrast between solitude/paper and Clara's fire/fieldwork. The final image—Merrick disappearing, chip extinguished—offers a non-literal answer to the premise without stating a moral. The "following ants home is following yourself back to what you chose to forget" line veers close to thematic echo but is framed as Clara's voice, which mitigates. The piece resists tidy resolution and allows ambiguity (what lies beyond the door?), though the symmetry of "chose to forget" and "lived all at once" risks abstraction. No heavy final-paragraph moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (power as sacrifice, dreamers as dreamed) emerges from concrete imagery (bleeding starlight, firefly-embers, frost crown) and the recursive structure of queens becoming sentinels. The final line "the dream had become the ridge" reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the mountain's speech ("you were never the dreamer, but the dreamed") edges toward Thematic Echo, articulating the thesis rather than trusting dramatization. The transformation of disenchantment into devotion is asserted more than earned through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is overtly stated in the final paragraphs ("Presence is the only treasure worth returning for") rather than emerging from dramatized conflict. The nautilus curl and pigments are symbolic tokens without earned resonance—they appear, glow, and are sealed without prior setup that would let them reweight meaning. The closing image recycles prompt language ("density of presence," "return differently") as moralizing summary. No coherent question arises from character goal and central conflict; abstract philosophizing replaces scene pressure at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: time as shattered mirror, narrative as survival tool, the chronicler's integration of fragmented selves. The final scroll line ("The chronicler dies but the dreaming continues") reweights the premise without moralizing, and the closing image (scroll curled beneath pillow, mountain pulse, "permanent now") offers a resonant non-literal answer. "Feral nostalgia" operates as concept and pressure, not thesis statement. No heavy-handed thematic echo in the final paragraph. The piece commits fully to its lyric-philosophical stance, though the abstract elevation risks generality in places ("weary wonder," "harmonic chord").

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of translation versus restoration emerges through water clock mechanics and sensory substitution, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraphs. The screw as connective object and Marcus's midwife metaphor deepen the loss-as-passage idea. However, the final lines ("Time wasn't measured but inhabited—one careful drop at a time") veer toward summary moralizing, and "ordinary miracles" appears as a prompt label rather than a discovery earned through prior particulars, lowering thematic resonance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (scars into stories) emerges through the crystalline rune, crow-quill ritual, and held breath imagery rather than direct statement. The final image of the rune as "beacon for others" offers a resonant answer without overt moral. However, lines like "turning scars into stories" and "a scholar became a storyteller" veer close to thematic echo, restating the premise in prompt-like language. The piece resists tidy resolution and the crystals' facets function as earned particulars, but some abstraction ("library of light") dilutes specificity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of imperfect miracles and flawed apologies emerges through the perfume device, metaphor-laden dialogue, and the final image of lingering scent among stumps. The notebook page ("The axe that cuts the tree also releases the song") attempts thematic resonance but edges toward overt statement. The closing lines—"Sometimes the song is the apology" and "even imperfect miracles could harmonize the discord"—step into authorial summary rather than allowing the image to resonate without gloss. Stronger moments include Linden's "mirror, not a window" line, which reweights Mira's intent with earned insight, but the final paragraph's moralizing ("the ink of truth seeping through the cracks of rumor") dilutes the understated power built earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of observer-as-participant emerges through the journey-inward/walking-out motif and the dictionary merging with the witness, avoiding overt statement. The final image—"witness who had learned that to see the end was to hold the beginning"—offers conceptual resonance tied to prior material. However, the penultimate paragraph's explicit articulation ("What you seek to unify cannot be held... surrendered to the pattern you already are") functions as thematic summary rather than dramatized discovery, flattening subtext at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—time as edges, silence, and what remains—is stated repeatedly in abstract philosophizing rather than emerging from concrete events. "Razor edges" recurs as metaphor without constraining choice or accumulating pressure; it ornaments rather than drives. The final answer ("time is the space between two heartbeats") is delivered as epiphany-label, not earned through specific struggle. Thematic echo penalty: the final paragraphs articulate thesis in prompt-like language without scene pressure; apply −0.6.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges organically: probability vs. superstition, logic vs. luck, "lucid contradictions" as coexistence rather than puzzle. The lantern, scrawls, and cards embody this fusion concretely. The final image—"carrying the lantern like a heart that had learned to beat in two worlds"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the closing whisper "to teach the beauty of probability without the pain of loss" edges toward thematic statement, and "clover-melancholy" and "lucid contradictions" recur as labels more than enacted pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme ("teach endings how to begin") is stated explicitly multiple times ("Mira's motivation surfaced," "she had learned that every ending is only the start") rather than earned through image and choice. The glass-disc motif recurs but never accumulates contradictory meaning; it remains symbol-as-label. The final line ("every echo eventually finds its own silence") offers lyric resonance but no non-literal reweighting of prior particulars—closure moralizes rather than charging ambiguity. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; most emotional shifts are declared.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically: small moments become covenants, memory anchors identity, context can renew what was lost. Walnut ink, locket photo, and jasmine recur with reweighted meaning, and the archivist's ritual avoids overt moralizing until the final journal line, which edges toward explicit thesis ("When context changes, the heart must choose whether to anchor or drift"). The piece invites reflection through image and accumulation, but "haunted euphoria" and "regenerated covenant" risk becoming prompt labels rather than earned insights. The ending offers a resonant answer through the villagers' tokens, yet the conceptual cost remains oblique rather than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme emerges clearly—loneliness cured through shared stories—but is stated rather than embodied: "the cure for loneliness is not a potion but a promise" is on-the-nose moralizing. The moon fragment and ivy recur, yet neither shifts meaning through character action; they remain static symbols. The ending's "gentle rebellion against the silence of isolation" asserts a thematic payoff the scene work has not earned through concrete, conflicted particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of language, cartography, and grief without overt moralizing. The stillpoint's melody as "a map of quiet blaze, written in the language of stillness" offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, late-paragraph thematic summaries ("she understood that to map the world, one must first map the silence") tip toward articulation rather than earned image. The platinum ring and ultrasonic forest motifs recur purposefully, but the final lines risk echo rather than reweighting: multiple passes at the same insight ("quiet blaze," "stillness," "uncharted depths") without fresh pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges through recurring images (seeds, editing, contingent relationships) and the piece resists overt moralizing until the final paragraphs, where "the universe, he decided, was a manuscript full of crossed-out lines" veers toward thesis statement. The pen's function as history editor integrates with the theme of error and growth, but the ending's litany ("strange comfort" repeated three times, "The story never ends. / It simply changes.") replaces scene pressure with abstract philosophizing. The thematic question—whether meaning can be threshed from error—is posed but answered through declaration rather than a resonant, non-literal final image.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of recognition, memory, and the music in absence emerges from concrete particulars: the filmless camera, the harbor's persistent quiet, the sign language older than words. The advisor's key line—"silence is the only language the forgotten truly own"—risks thematic echo but is delivered in sign and integrated into her character's method. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: Elias's music is "for the silence to remember," a non-literal resolution that reweights his thirty-seven-year wait. The camera's transformation from instrument of erasure to metronome charges the closure image. Subtext operates in gesture and the advisor's wordless teaching; the story resists tidy binaries (forgotten/remembered) in favor of a third state (self-recognition within forgetting).

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of redemption through creation versus destruction emerges clearly from Kael's arc, and the weeping restored portrait is a resonant non-literal answer. The volcanic tenderness metaphor recurs purposefully. However, the final paragraph veers toward overt moralizing: "why they stayed, and Kael would only point to the weeping portrait, where truth and forgiveness were woven into every thread" tells the theme rather than letting the image speak. The stakes remain personal; the Revisionists' broader censorship is framing device only.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—transformation versus preservation, love as merging rather than haunting—emerges organically from the drumming, memory fragments, and the lagoon's properties without overt statement. The final image (two heartbeats "breathing life into a dream shared between frequencies") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. "Auroral sorrow" charges the ending without summarizing it. The piece resists moralizing; the facility's "loss of valuable data" ironically underscores institutional blindness. Minor slip: "a quiet rebellion of rhythm" in the coda edges toward thematic labeling but stays anchored in image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme—precision whispers build better pathways than noise—emerges through concrete action (the tuning-fork key, folded maps, acoustic nodes) rather than assertion. The zodiac coin and folded maps recur with shifted meaning. However, the final paragraphs state the theme overtly ("he'd proven that whispers travel farther than shouts...calculated spontaneity") rather than trusting the image to resonate, and the ending moralizes about "silence builds better bridges than thunder," reducing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (stars as metaphor for hope, darkness as fear) emerges from images and the guardian's ritual rather than direct statement. Yet the piece edges toward moralizing: "He taught darkness that stars are not to be feared but to be held gently" (line 27) and the final paragraphs reiterate the lesson in summarizing loops. The half-spoken secret recurs as a motif but never acquires distinct meaning tied to a choice. The closing lines ("For those who listen with silent empathy, the stars will always share their story") verge on thematic echo, asserting wisdom rather than letting the final image reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme—quiet rebellion through second thoughts—is stated repeatedly ("forests of second thoughts," "Question the king," "the most powerful revolutions are often the quietest") rather than emerging from dramatized events. The chess metaphor (pawn to queen) operates as symbolic decoration without genuine friction or counter-reading. The final image ("mist still curled...but now it carried the faint scent of change") gestures toward resonance but lacks the particulars or cost to reweight prior material; it reads as generic claim rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—freedom through embracing true nature, the liminal as stage, strength/softness synthesis—emerges from event and image rather than statement until the closing lines tip toward articulation ("strength and softness are not enemies"). The scrimshaw and whale recur with reweighted meaning at closure. The final image of Mira as "dancer of the tide" offers resonance, though the whispered thank-you and thematic summary in the penultimate beats ("deepest locks are opened by the gentlest calls") edge toward overt moralizing. The piece invites reflection on liminality and self-discovery, but the post-violence world constraint feels ornamental rather than thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of survival and meaning-making in a world of enforced erasure emerges organically from the whittling, narration, and dried flowers. The "remade hush" recurs and shifts meaning, and the moral ambiguity (informant role) adds complexity. However, the final paragraph summarizes the theme in direct statements ("a living paradox of grief and lightness, whittling hope from the wood of despair"), replacing scene pressure with thesis. The closing image (figurine on windowsill, bouquet as dust) carries lyric weight, but the explanatory coda dilutes resonance by telling what the prior particulars already implied.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of boundary dissolution is declared rather than earned through specific conflict. The recurring motifs (cloud-shadow, tremor, paraphrase, dissolving) feel ornamental—they restate the concept without reweighting it through consequence. The final image ("all lines blur") offers no non-literal answer or resonant particulars; it summarizes the prompt rather than transforming it. No epiphany arises from struggle; the poet's aesthetic drive is told but never contested or complicated by cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.4)
    "Beauty in imperfection" is stated repeatedly ("she could persuade a storm," "beautiful precisely because they were flawed," "imperfection was true art") rather than emerging from concrete choices. The phoenix frame and "bartered awakenings" remain ornamental motifs that do not reweight prior material. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("a tale of finding beauty in the imperfect"), triggering the thematic-echo penalty (−0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—connection requires imperfection—emerges from the carbide lens's "scarred" quality and the 0.3% "error" reframed as "the entire point." The final image of golden shadows "pulsing softly like a remembered heartbeat" offers resonance, but arrives through overt statement: "the beautiful imperfection that makes connection real." The prism-song and texture motifs recur, yet the conceptual architecture often declares rather than dramatizes: "being heard meant being changed" and "the only relic was the space between them" read as authorial summary. The piece invites reflection but leans on thematic echo in place of earned particulars at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme—grief as collapsed light, artificial hope becoming real through intention—emerges through metaphor rather than concrete particulars. The final image ("coordinates pointing nowhere—an invitation") gestures toward resonance but remains abstract, lacking the specificity to reweight prior material with undeniable cost. "Genuinely artificial" and "curtains of intention" are repeated as thematic labels without dramatized tension. No epiphany arises from on-page struggle; insights are declared ("she understood," "she learned") rather than earned through action and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the cartomancy ritual: the contrast between blockchain's "single chains of truth" and Mara's "multiplying paths" grows from concrete action (card spreads, measuring) rather than assertion. The measuring tape and ink as tools for "seeing what others couldn't" avoid overt symbolism by remaining functional. The final image—"the future wasn't a chain, but a web"—offers a resonant answer to the collapse question, though it edges toward thesis statement. The architect's realization (mirror of his hubris) is earned through the spread's imagery, and the piece resists moralizing by keeping Mara's project open-ended ("writing it in ink").

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme is stated rather than emerging: "the end of innocence is not a single moment but a continuum," "forbidden knowledge is a double-edged sword," and "some knowledge is worth the pain" are spelled out in the final paragraphs. The atoms-of-nostalgia conceit never reweights prior material—it functions as a label for "memories" without conceptual friction. The closing image (saffron veil in last light, steadily unpredictable heartbeat) gestures at resonance but the overt thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph (−0.6 for final-paragraph moralizing) undercuts earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—preservation of hope entails sacrifice—emerges organically from the stone's weight, the shadow's metamorphosis, and the protagonist's empty pocket. The final image (shadow as luminous veil, library blooming with "warmth that was both comforting and bittersweet") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: hope endures, but at personal cost. "Luminous regret" recurs as both tone and thematic conclusion without explicit moralizing. The shadow not disappearing but transforming into a guardian adds complexity. Minor slip: "the shape of hope" is invoked often but remains slightly abstract; one more concrete manifestation (a specific dreamer's experience, a particular shelf's glow) would anchor the universal in stronger particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme (fragility of conviction, reconstruction through honest care) emerges organically from Elara's actions and the chameleon's healing tail. The story resists tidy morals—she doesn't forgive herself or erase the fraud, only commits to "growing around the wound." The final image (chameleon's tail curled in trust, Elara moving toward the officer) offers a resonant answer without stating a lesson. Minor slip: "healing is not forgetting, but growing around the wound" in the notebook edges toward thesis statement, but it's framed as private armor rather than sermonizing, so the penalty is light.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of closure-as-reading emerges through repeated scar imagery and the hourglass/coffee-ring motifs. Yet the final paragraph over-articulates with "not just marks of pain, but verses in a poem of survival" and "not by sealing her wounds, but by reading them," crossing into thesis statement. The displaced miracle and meteor hush concepts remain decorative—invoked for texture but not dramatized as thematic pressure that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—love unused changes address, never disappears—emerges organically from the projection booth as vault and the goodbye letters as transfer protocol. The concept avoids didacticism and the final image (map glowing through clothes, "next palace") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Mira's personal unused love for Elena is woven in without forcing symmetry. One slip: "recipients were every wall" edges toward thematic echo but recovers quickly into image.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated overtly—"creativity is simply the universe remembering itself"—rather than emerging from dramatized events. The trapped-creativity metaphor is repeated in multiple registers ("cocoon," "veil of ice," "star behind a veil") without variation in meaning or pressure. The ending's thematic claim ("flowed like a river of stardust") is asserted in the same voice that opened the piece, with no reconfiguration or ambiguity. Subtext is absent; every motif (aurora, stardust, archway) is explained within the same paragraph it appears.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of memory, possibility, and cyclical renewal emerges organically from the guard's journey and the imagery of seeds, forests, and unlit corners. The final realization—"they weren't missing dreams, they were the place where dreams went to be born"—reweights the "dreamless" premise without overt moralizing, and the chess clock striking thirteen reconfigures midnight as "a place rather than a time." The piece resists tidy resolution and embraces ambiguity (the forest growing downward from the sky, roots in stars). Minor slip: "the divergent archive" and "wave functions" occasionally read as thematic labels rather than dramatized through specific, irreplaceable particulars that test the guard's values.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges clearly: mechanism and wildness as complementary rather than opposed. The piece avoids overt moralizing and uses images (gear, trees, translocations) to explore the question. However, the final paragraph edges into explicit thematic statement: "insight was not a destination but a hum that never ceased" reads close to a thesis. The theme is coherent but not earned through concrete struggle—it's contemplated rather than fought for with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Unused courage" is stated four times but never tested in scene—Lin does not face a choice that requires courage, only patience. The shoreline lullaby and star-stamped ticket recur as symbols without constraining action or reweighting meaning at closure. The final paragraph moralizes the theme overtly: "courage is always there, waiting to be used." The resolution offers no non-literal answer, only restated premise.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (safety as unending cost, vigilance as life rather than moment) emerges from the bolt, the staircase penance, and the rust stain without overt moralizing. "Seraphically mundane" reweights the ordinary as celestial when consecrated by service, and "frostbitten hope" charges the ending. The final image—hands forming signs, gesturing toward tools—resonates without stating a thesis. Slight drag: "some silences could never be pardoned" and "the cost of safety was this: that you never stopped paying" edge toward thematic summary rather than pure implication, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—truth versus illusion, the weight of guardianship—emerges through image (starlight vines, hollow-eyed pretender, "graceful collapse") rather than assertion, and the rune of drift acquires symbolic weight. Yet the final paragraph moralizes gently ("keeper of secrets and a witness to the sundering of lies"), and the core question (what price does Sylvar pay?) receives no non-literal answer. The ending offers resonance but not repricing; the library's state and Sylvar's stance remain unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—loss, witness, paths built on vanished futures—emerges organically from coral bleaching, rising seas, and the torn atlas page. The final image (tapping as memorial, waterproof case) offers a resonant answer without sermonizing. "Periodically eternal" as motif recurs purposefully (tide, bleaching cycle, rhythm) and reweights the closure without becoming checklist symbolism. No label-speak intrusion; particulars (the shipping lane model, the fossil-fuel ban) ground the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as disease of waiting, frequencies versus tactics, bare feet reading memory. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—lulls can end, storms can be summoned—without moralizing. The opera glasses and stone circle return with reweighted meaning (vision shifts from sky to earth, ancient hum becomes current action). "Thunderous serenity" charges the closure image without abstraction, though "simple truth that silence could be broken" skirts thematic statement rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of "destiny as cultivated choice versus passive waiting" emerges through the amber-seed revelation and planting imagery. The kite script, fire-resistant tree, and "intentional change" motifs recur with purpose, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraphs. However, lines like "destiny wasn't implanted in amber. It was planted in the soil of conscious choice" and "She would be merely the first gardener of a new age" veer into thematic echo, restating the premise rather than trusting the image. The particulars (seed, springs, reconstruction) support the concept, yet the ending summarizes collective transformation ("roots already rewriting the story") instead of letting the image resonate without gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through somatic specificity: the body as archive, stillness as active preservation. The pearl-of-stillness motif deepens from the curator's invitation to Elias's realization (not peace, but perfect memory encased) to the final layered image (nacre from grit). However, the closing passage ("optimism anchored in realism meant remembering fully, feeling completely, and standing still when stillness was the only true movement") borders on thematic echo—it articulates the premise in near-prompt language. The lighthouse/keeper metaphor charges the ending without stating a moral, but the penultimate paragraph's explicit gloss ("healing wasn't loud or heroic") flattens earned resonance into summary. Subtext operates well in the somatic beats (palm to bark, wind as laughter) but the final lines over-explain.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (shadow and light as collaborators, necessary darkness as artistic truth) emerges from concrete thread-work and the closing perception shift without thesis statement. The final image—beam cutting through, seeing without flinching, ache as honest light—reweights the opening paralysis. Subtext operates in the rhetorical-question loops and the contrast between luminescent ache and cold fire. The tarot box's single weeping eye is a strong symbolic close. One late near-platitude: "Shadow and light were not opposites but collaborators" hovers close to thematic summary, though it's filtered through Elara's perception and followed immediately by the more charged "only honest light."

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.9)
    The thematic question (why time slows in crisis) emerges clearly from the premise and the disappearing ink serves as a concrete correlative. The recursive structure (Kael will try again tomorrow) and the sandstorm memory gesture toward the elusiveness of understanding. However, the final paragraph ("he would be ready, his conscious wildness a blade, his serene anger a forge") drifts into abstract metaphor and label-speak that states theme rather than dramatizing it. The ink's vanishing reweights nothing; it confirms what Kael already believed, and the ending offers no new angle or reprice of the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of weaponized silence and the cost of manufactured truth emerges through the letter, the pneumatic network, and Elara's provocation. The closing image—"burying the old silence beneath the new"—offers a non-literal answer without stating a moral. However, thematic language occasionally becomes overt: "contraband truths" and "virus of authenticity" approach allegory, and the phrase "empire of ice melting beneath the heat of...manufactured truth" is a near-explicit thesis statement. The piece resists full sermonic collapse but hovers close, especially in lines like "loyalty to truth demanded ignition."

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of peace versus chaos emerges through concrete particulars (roses, engraved disc, sandbag as "counterweight to memory") rather than stated thesis. The final image attempts to distill this without moralizing. However, the ending drifts toward thematic summary ("a silent vow that the quiet would endure") that borders on overt statement. The engraved "quiet" hums with potential but remains more metaphor than dramatized cost. Lyra's arc doesn't wrestle with a genuine thematic question—she begins committed to peace and ends the same, with no earned complication or repricing of her values.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—witness rather than possess, let witness change you—emerges organically from Avery's final choice and the recurring motif of transliteration (emotion into vibration, memory into seed). The rail spike's journey from tool to offering to dream-object charges the ending without overt moralizing. The feral lullaby, introduced as maternal knowledge and voiced through silence, recurs at closure to demonstrate mortal understanding calming divine loneliness. One small slip: "some catches become offerings, some offerings become doorways" edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image carry full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the orbit/gravity/telescope/black-hole constellation without heavy moralizing, and the final image of fog-to-gold offers non-literal resonance. However, the proof-by-contradiction memo explicitly states the thematic argument ("credibility built on suppression is no credibility") rather than letting it rise from pure dramatization. The closing line "better to be the telescope than the black hole" lands with conceptual clarity but edges toward assertion. Backstory reflection (2003 spill, twenty years of regret) is anchored in present document review and shapes the counter-memo choice, meeting BRR tests.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through recurring motifs: sound as need, tethers as both connection and harm, time folding grief into present consequence. The insect's chirp reinterpreted as "the first sound of creation mourning its own impermanence" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The final silence—"meteor hush finally complete"—reweights the opening. However, thematic statements crowd the middle: "The system remembered," "haunted firmware wasn't malfunctioning; it was grieving," "message from a future self who had already failed once." These approach Thematic Echo without adequate scene pressure to earn them, reducing subtextual density.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme is over-articulated throughout: "gave the silence a vocabulary," "understand their fear as a map rather than a void," "rewritten what silence could mean." The final paragraph ("the grotto's whispers had finally learned to listen, and that was gift enough") delivers a tidy moral rather than resonant image. The "unlearning" and "necessary paradox" concepts are asserted as prompts rather than emerging from concrete action. Recurrence of chalk, spiral, and violet is ornamental—no image returns with reweighted meaning to charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme of "aberrant mercy" and "empathy cradled in steel" is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from specific on-page conflict. The soldier's act and Arin's response are told in retrospect without competing values or ambiguity tested in scene. The final image recycles the thematic phrases ("Plaza of Embers," "warm coldness") as mantras rather than reweighting prior particulars with earned cost. The piece gestures toward complexity (fire and forgiveness, radical and gentle) but resolves into a thesis statement rather than a non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—encore as continuity, shared legacy, possibility rescued from despair—emerges through image and action (ghost's final bow merging with the actress's rehearsal, the orchard as secret promise). The closing lines attempt resonance: "shared anthem," "rising nostalgia that healed." However, the thematic answer remains largely asserted rather than dramatized; the actress "would carry his echo" is told, not shown through a micro-choice or embodied realization. The fractured-timeline motif recurs but functions as atmosphere rather than a constraint that forces a non-obvious thematic calculus. No overt moralizing, but the ending leans toward summary statement rather than image-driven implication.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of hidden-pathway illumination and hope-from-failure emerges through the geode/pill resonance, but it arrives via assertion ("willowglass hope," "fragile optimism") rather than a non-literal final image that reweights prior material with cost. The fractal-tree canvas and grandmother's-gift gratitude gesture toward resonance, yet the piece states its theme explicitly ("not just a recalled pill's failure, but a doorway") instead of trusting the image. Subtext in the grandmother gift and somatic-marker method adds specificity without full thematic charge at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of bridging past and present through sensory translation emerges from the fossil and heat-map imagery. However, the final image ("bridge between what had been and what would be") is a direct thematic statement rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The elm leaf tableau and Lira's song suggest conceptual depth, but the closure asserts rather than dramatizes the theme's cost or reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of shared wisdom versus solitary possession emerges through the prophecy's structure—"deliberately scattered like seeds"—and the final question reweights the hourglass metaphor from constraint to open-handedness. The prophecy asks rather than commands, offering a resonant, non-literal answer that does not moralize. The recurring image of sand flowing through glass versus open hands charges the closure without stating a thesis, and the transformation from archival duty to urgent possibility feels earned by the cataloging particulars. Minor thematic echo: "shared wisdom" appears as a label in the penultimate paragraph, but the image work in the final lines mitigates the slip.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of fixing what's broken emerges through Kael's literal reconstruction of the cipher and metaphorical mending of the network and his own conscience. The pillbox's journey (worn by touch, handed over, weight lifted) offers a purposeful material anchor. The ending image—empty hands, full heart, descending into a thawing world—reweights the opening's broken network and unused courage without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the courier's nod ("might have been respect or merely professional courtesy") and Kael's surprise that Elena survived. Minor slip: "courage could be reclaimed in the quiet acts of restoration rather than the loud ones of destruction" edges toward thematic summary in place of pure dramatization, though it remains character-filtered rather than authorial.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—persistence, the weight of rewritten promises, distillation of complexity—emerges organically from the palimpsest conceit, the yarn needles, and the closing silence. The final image (two needles touching, walking into mist) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silence between Silas and the woman, and in the sensory progression (slowing gutters, lifting fog). Minor weaknesses: "spindrift serenity—the calm that exists within chaos" and "to distill complexity into essence" veer close to thematic echo, articulating the premise rather than letting it emerge. The "next coachman" coda risks over-explaining the handoff. Still, the palimpsest metaphor reweights prior material effectively, and the piece resists easy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the oasis's persistence, the lantern glass's memory, the bowl as new offering. The story resists moralizing; instead, the final image—bowl and glass on the stone, the single bee messenger—offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a thesis. "Kindness could be a structure as solid as any wheel or kiln" risks abstraction but is earned by prior concrete action (wedging clay, firing with rosemary, feeling the thrum). The piece balances complexity and clarity, inviting reflection on care as temporal architecture without false equivalence or platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: precision as love, translation of grief, light seeded into darkness. The bitting gauge's journey from measuring loss to scoring invitation coheres across the piece, and the final line—"the lock, and the key, and the hand that turns them both"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to endure loss. The piece resists overt moralizing and invites reflection through layered particulars (locksmith precision, moonflower blooms, fire escape to horizontal lot). However, some assertions ("letting go was the most precise measurement of all") edge toward thematic summary rather than letting the concrete work speak, and the rose-to-moonflower parallel risks symbolic convenience without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of isolation versus independence and the legacy of the extinct is stated overtly ("independence does not mean solitude") rather than emerging from concrete action. The sundial and stone circle are deployed as symbolic props without transforming through specific choices. The final paragraph moralizes ("true independence demands the courage to hold multiple truths") instead of offering a resonant image. Subtext is minimal; every thematic claim is spelled out on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of connection/belonging emerges organically from the spiral installation and accumulated offerings. The final self-addressed letter offers a resonant image of private-to-public transformation. However, the piece edges toward stating its theme ("the thread that connects all things shimmered") rather than trusting particulars. The closing lines risk sermonizing ("not as a shadow, but as a luminous thread") where image alone would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (manipulation, division as psychic fuel, interference as moral stance) emerges from events rather than statement. The tricksters-as-gaslighters concept and the radio-as-shield motif accumulate purposefully, and the final image (charts as sigils, "beating back the dark") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the closing paragraph edges toward thesis articulation ("she was still cautiously hopeful, knowing the tricksters would adapt") in a register slightly more diagnostic than dramatic. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection, but the thematic payoff is more asserted than charged by a concrete final choice or image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of rebellion against "rigid geometry of forgotten eras" and reimagining static spaces emerges clearly from the blueprint imagery and the final library scene. The organ-as-map metaphor and the compass/key pairing support the concept without overt thesis statements. However, the ending drifts into summary moralizing: "a quiet mutiny against the rigid geometry" and "the bravest explorers know when to listen" feel like authorial voice rather than scene-embedded resonance. The thematic question is posed but answered through assertion rather than a final image that reweights prior material with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of seeing through blindness and unifying opposites emerges organically from Elara's process. The portrait work—building a face from negative space—embodies the concept without overt statement. However, the final paragraph moralizes ("her blindness to become a different kind of sight") and the empathy arc resolves into a tidy binary (dormant/awakened) rather than complex ambiguity. The ribbon as motif constrains discovery and charges the ending, but its conceptual weight is diluted by explicit articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—truth suppressed by institutional convenience, bravery erased by fear—emerges organically from the librarian's decoding work and the physical reappearance of Vance's camp, not from stated morals. The copper nail and coded stanzas operate as motifs that accumulate pressure and shift meaning: the nail is "a key," then "transmits permission or warning," then charges the final image as the librarian holds it while confronting the director. The final line ("nervously confident in a way that made the director's silence heavy") offers a resonant answer to the central question—what cost for being right too soon?—without overt philosophizing. Minor slip: "spongey dread" is named repeatedly as both emotion and atmospheric condition, sometimes blurring into label-speak ("the feeling of a lie collapsing") rather than embodied particular.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.6)
    The piece pursues a coherent atmospheric theme (memory, forgiveness, the boundary between living and dead) through recurring images: wet-plate collodion, "pixelated amnesty," "luminous disbelief," scaffold wrap as map. However, thematic language is stated rather than embodied—"pixelated amnesty for the sins of forgetting" and "fertile ground for possibility" function as prompt echoes rather than earned insights from concrete struggle. The final image (playing while scaffold wrap dances) offers a mood reconfiguration but does not answer a dramatized question with non-literal resonance; the ending tells us the world is whole without showing the specific cost paid to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of circular paths and inherited legacy emerges through the train's imagery and the father's heist methods. The foreign bill and territorial markers accrue symbolic weight. Yet the son's final insight—"some circles are meant to be understood, not escaped"—arrives as articulated wisdom rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The ending tells its thematic answer instead of showing it through a charged particular.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (shared burdens across time) emerges organically from the daylilies, variable star pulse, and chronicler lineage. The final line attempts resonance ("words had pressed their memory into eternity"), but it edges toward abstract philosophizing rather than image-grounded insight. The epiphany—"we carried it together"—is stated on-screen rather than enacted through a non-literal final action. Subtext in the predecessor's frantic notes and pressed flowers works well, but the ending summarizes theme rather than letting the reader complete it.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges from particulars: mirrors hide inner scars, truth lies beneath surfaces, guilt can be frozen and must be unbent. The ice/confession metaphor and the flesh-eating plant's hunger integrate organically. The druid's journey from seeker to self-confronter offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, late lines like "some truths remain hidden from mirrors" and "carried the truth like a lantern" edge toward thematic summation rather than trusting the image. The final image (wilted plant as red berries, smoothed lake) reweights prior material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the covenant-as-garden metaphor and the tension between containment and wildness, inheritance and transformation. The final image—"one that welcomed wanderers instead of trapping them"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question without overt moralizing. However, the piece edges close to thematic echo when the ancestor-figure articulates the moral directly ("a promise to tend the dreams of the world, not merely harvest them"), and the final paragraph's "anxious elation of someone who finally knows their true name" risks summary-label satisfaction. The scars-as-portals and roots-as-memory motifs constrain choice and charge the closure, lifting the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (the cost of bartering fate, grief as transformation) emerges from the descent and transaction, not from direct statement. The burned tarot card and its golden-script healing, the roots "inlaying meaning everywhere," and the final "different shape" of the hole offer thematic resonance. However, the closing paragraph edges toward summary moralizing: "fate had trammelled her back, and in the space between, something new had grown" is near-platitude. The piece invites reflection, but the final image (clutching a "dead piece of paper," feeling her sister's pulse) abstracts rather than reweights prior particulars in a non-literal way.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme (purpose after loss, echo as renewal) emerges through the valley setting and the cloth's symbolic trajectory, avoiding overt statement until the final third. The metaphor of appraisal-as-performance is seeded early and repaid at closure. However, the ending lists thematic intentions ("turning each appraisal into a song, each fact into a verse") rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material without explanation. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into affirmation without acknowledging the cost of choosing nostalgia over forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through the particulars of translation, analogy, and field theory: "transition has no moment, only a field of proximity" and "presence and absence woven to hold a city aloft." The knowledge fruit seed returns with reweighted meaning—from missed proof to embodied answer—and the final image of Elara carving her name "not as author but as witness" offers a resonant answer to her haunted ambition without stating a moral. The phrase "touching distance" recurs purposefully, shifting from physical proximity to metaphor for understanding. Minor deduction for the line "her haunted ambition resolving into wisdom," which edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image carry the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the creel's woven patience versus the smelting crucible's erasure, bamboo darkening but not burning, data bleeding into reeds. The piece resists the tidy binary (human vs. machine) by showing Elara holding both simultaneously. "Preservation sometimes required loss, routine needed surprise to remain wonder" skirts direct statement but is earned by the prior transmutation sequence. The final image—creel pulsing with slow-dreaming memories, neither destroyed nor imprisoned—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor penalty: "Let them be fish" interior monologue in the final third edges toward theme summary rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—buried hopes and the light of speaking them—emerges through concrete particulars (etched shells, the pearl, the caves' song). The final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("the weight of all we leave unsaid, and the light that emerges when we finally speak it"), undercutting earned resonance with direct statement. The pearl-as-witness metaphor is purposeful but the ending tells the theme rather than trusting the image to carry it. Apply thematic-echo penalty: −0.5 for final-paragraph thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of forgiveness and flowing forward emerges through recurring water/river imagery and the accordion as a symbol of broken-but-singing resilience. However, the graffiti ("Forgive the past, flow forward") states the theme directly, and the final paragraph moralizes ("truth was not a fixed point but a current"). The accordion bellows' charged return is present but undercut by explanatory framing. The piece resists full thematic echo penalty because the images do some work, yet the closure leans toward assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of silence and unspoken words recurs as image and motif, and the final scroll line—"The silence you seek is the echo you leave"—attempts a conceptual repricing. However, this insight is delivered by letter rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the act of "releasing" remains abstract. The cyclical structure and propagation delays are mentioned but never constrain the protagonist's understanding or choices, reducing them to ornamental recursion.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of autonomy versus exploitation emerges organically from the ice-crystal violin, the seed, and Lira's choice to plant rather than surrender. The final image of the seed growing and the violin waiting offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether dreams can resist empires. However, the closing lines drift toward overt thematic statement: "some dreams are worth more than empires, and some seeds must be planted before the promise loses its glow" reads as a summary moral rather than an image that trusts the reader to infer. The perforated-destiny motif is poetic but remains more decorative than causally essential.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—preservation against oblivion, the ephemeral made singular—emerges from concrete ritual and image (emerald, aurora, thread) without thesis statement. The closing image (winter jasmine blooming in the gem "defying the silence") reweights prior material with resonance, though "defying" edges toward declaring the theme. Subtext operates in gesture (cupped emerald, whispered dedication) and the archive's constellation. The piece resists tidy morals; Elara's art delays nothing, only steals "the one thing worth keeping." No prompt echo in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: scalloped cuts versus straight lines, the hairpin as both wound and tool, climbing as ritual, the shift from memory-wine to plain jam. The final image—jam tasting of "soil and rain and honest work, Aria's laughter echoing in stone"—offers a resonant answer to the contentment question without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution by folding unresolved grief (Aria's death, the cloud-wanderer's remorse) into the quiet ending. Minor thematic echo risk when "rebirth was not a gift the grapes gave, but a choice the living made" nearly articulates the premise, but embodied cost (seventeen harvests, the hairpin worn without flinching) keeps it grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—nuance over certainty—emerges clearly from motifs (hollow mirror, cloak of doubt) but is stated overtly in multiple passages: "You have unhooked the certainty within yourself," "truth is never a single note." The final image (touching the mirror shard, remembering the spectrum) recycles prior material without a non-literal reweighting; the ending summarizes the thesis rather than letting particulars resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.1)
    The paradox "to appear, one must first vanish" emerges clearly from the imagery of ripples, backward aging, and dissolution. The final image—Mira becoming the stone—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the piece states its theme multiple times ("She realized…the vanishing she taught was her own disappearance"), reducing subtext to exposition. The recurring pond-rings motif charges the ending, but earlier iterations feel decorative rather than accumulating pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—consciousness as navigation, stillness as agency—emerges organically from imagery and the protagonist's stance. The recurring "centuries of layered dust" and "pulse left wandering" accumulate meaning without overt statement. However, the final lines ("some movement happens only in the mind") tilt toward gentle moralizing, and the resolution is tidy rather than complex. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question, but the lack of ambiguity or counter-reading keeps it in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme (sacred simplicity, inefficiency's value in an automated world) emerges through the mist-walk patience, the keystone's unprogrammed luminance, and Vorrin's refusal without overt thesis statement. The final image—Vorrin sitting beside the keystone, his light matching its rhythm—offers a resonant answer to "find the sacred in the simple" without moralizing. "Inefficiency had its own gravity" risks abstraction but is anchored by prior particulars (twelve years unbinding, modest talents as liability). The ivy-leaf carving and "accommodates impossibilities" motif recur with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the garden-folly premise.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of silence and light emerges through recurring images (lanterns, vows, the key tag), and the final recognition that "some sounds are seen only when the world grows still" offers a non-literal answer to the synesthetic quest. However, the piece leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("a luminous vow that hid behind truth like a candle behind a curtain") and the ending moralizes rather than letting the final image resonate: "truth often hides behind the light we choose to see" is a direct thematic statement that replaces earned scene pressure. The repeated phrase "luminous vows" becomes a label rather than a constraint that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of alignment-versus-dissolution emerges through the backwards prophecy, static bursts, and wavelength imagery. The final line "Having been, she will be" and Elara becoming "the decision itself" offer a resonant non-literal answer. However, the piece edges toward thematic echo when Elara articulates "not to save what was lost, but to honor its frequency"—a near-thesis statement that reduces ambiguity. The recurring coins and static motifs accumulate meaning without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—naming gives shape and dignity, but some fears resist language—emerges from the crystallization ritual and the mirror-void at closure. The final image (carrying the mirror-shard "close to a heart that had forgotten how to beat but still remembered how to ache") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the atlas's sea monsters as humanity's inarticulate dread and in her own role as death's guide. Minor intrusion: "she understood now that naming fears didn't banish them—it only gave them shape" states the thesis rather than trusting the image. The echo of sacrifice recurs but remains more motif than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—cosmic balance, the power of patience and small acts—emerges from particulars (dripping water, cracked bell, silent sea) rather than statement. The final image of the viaduct glowing in mist offers visual resonance, and Kael's "earnest naivety" becoming "quiet strength" hints at conceptual repricing. However, the thematic answer is somewhat generic ("one drip at a time") and lacks a non-literal charge or ambiguity that reweights prior material. The bell's restoration feels thematically tidy rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—truth submerged and the power of shared narrative—emerges through concrete images (drowned town, sapphire label, mirrored hush) rather than overt statement. The closing image of Nora carrying truth "like a lantern" and weaving it "into the shared fabric" leans slightly toward metaphor assertion but remains anchored in her writing act. The poisoned-water reveal and the authorities' cover-up raise moral stakes, yet the piece never dramatizes a counter-reading or complicating friction; the theme resolves cleanly without the ambiguity promised by "stories...teeming beneath."

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme (union of logic and intuition, wonder versus calculation) emerges through symbols: crystal/flame, pressed violets, starlings as living geometry. The piece resists overt moralizing in most beats, letting images accumulate meaning. However, the penultimate paragraphs ("to harmonize logic and intuition was not to merge them, but to let them dance") explicitly state the thesis rather than letting the final image answer the question non-literally. The closing dream ("equations and petals intertwined") gestures toward synthesis but does not reweight prior particulars with fresh cost or irony. Subtext operates in the violet offerings and the "Iron Tincture" epithet, but the ending tilts toward thematic summary. Strong motif work keeps the score in the upper 6s; explicit thematic articulation prevents entry into 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.9)
    "The watcher's burden" and "preserving trust under pressure" recur as labeled themes rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The parachute buckle offers a thematic seed (hesitation's price) but its return at closure is ornamental—the protagonist holds it as testament, not as an object whose presence alters his stance or reweights prior material. The final image (stars as distant eyes, duty's echo) gestures toward resonance but offers no non-literal answer to the central question; instead it restates vigilance. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; interiority frequently explains rather than implies.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (integration versus transcendence; cost of aliveness) emerges through the brain-in-jar image and the complementary-opposites technique without thesis statement. The final image—tears cutting "salt trails through dust"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: humanity requires embracing pain. One minor slip: "the heaviest truth" in the penultimate section edges toward moralizing, though it remains grounded in action. The story resists tidy binaries and earns its insight through the sensei's physical collapse and reawakening. Subtext operates in the clones' overlapping justifications and the jar's label "DUPLICATE."

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges cleanly from concrete action: "A true haunting does not frighten; it holds. It tends to what we cannot say, macerating silence until something tender can push through." This line risks stating the theme, but it follows earned dramatization (the plate crash, the laugh, the brother's call) and reframes prior beats without moralizing. The pull cord as both literal tool and metaphor for letting go charges the ending. The final image—Sarah smiling at an almost-melody—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how grief loosens.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—befriending uncertainty, the limits of knowledge, exile as translation—emerges organically from the guardian's journey and avoids overt moralizing. The pendant as "a friend to uncertainty, a key to no door" and the final realization "home was a way of waiting" offer resonant, non-literal answers to the central question. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites reflection through particulars (licking frozen metal, digesting architecture into memory). However, several lines edge toward thematic echo: "certainty was the truest illusion of all" and "some knowledge must be given, not guarded" state the thesis rather than embodying it through scene pressure, triggering a mid-band penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the concrete action of transmutation: that success may require abandoning hope itself, that creative destruction means building within destruction rather than after it. The "frozen bloom" image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral—neither life nor death, neither growth nor decay. "The penny drops" shifts from currency to "a weight that tipped the scale of acceptance," reweighting the phrase through specificity. The piece resists tidy resolution; Elara's peace comes from incompleteness, not triumph, and the villages' judgment ("hopeless") is recontextualized rather than refuted.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—finding beginnings in endings, silence as presence—emerges organically from the shard's properties and Mira's methodical stripping of assumptions. The mentor's dying words provide thematic scaffolding without overt moralizing. The final image of dormant transformation and the promise to rewire other towers offers resonance. However, phrases like "silence as presence, a frequency so pure it erased noise" and "the beginning in every ending" border on abstract philosophizing. The theme is stated more than it is charged by concrete, costly particulars at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—permanence within transience, home as moving horizon—emerges from the recurring hourglass, starlight threads, and the ferry's cyclical vanishing without direct statement. The empty hourglass "marking time that never began nor ended" and Lina's whisper "echoing across timelines" offer resonant images. However, the final paragraph explicitly articulates the theme ("every vanishing was a new beginning," "anchor and sail, forever ferrying souls") rather than trusting the prior particulars to carry it. The spectral grotto and sideways clocks function as motifs but do not constrain a choice or reweight prior material with cost at closure; they recur without deepening contradiction or irony.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (connection as medium rather than artifact) emerges organically from the weaving imagery and the water's transformation, avoiding explicit statement until the final paragraph. The recurring sinew thread accumulates meaning and the final image—"some connections can only be discovered by letting them erupt"—reweights prior material. However, the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo ("It was the precise weight of a gaze...the exact tension in a silence that means I understand"), summarizing rather than embodying the insight through action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—carrying stars inside, expanding perception until edges become horizons—emerges organically from the anchor-link imagery and pressure-layer geometry without overt moralizing. The final image (Corin's bioluminescence forming Ursa Major) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, multiple lines approach thematic echo: "unfolded horizons weren't about reaching the surface, but expanding navigation itself" and "expand perception until folded horizons of space and sea became one map" state the thesis rather than trusting the dramatized moment, reducing earned resonance by −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (the boundary between living and dead, listening as care) emerges through image and action, but the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("this is my purpose: to listen, to protect, to assure") states the thesis rather than letting it resonate. The photograph's return in the ending ("the child's smile seems to widen, as if she knows") gestures toward thematic depth but lacks the specificity to reweight prior material. The piece flirts with a richer question—whether the protagonist's curiosity serves the vulnerable or merely satisfies their own need—but never dramatizes that tension in a concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—corporate erasure versus human witness—emerges through concrete particulars: severed cables, scrubbed names, and the act of standing present without analyzing. The codex's gold flecks function as a charged motif, warming during the witness act and cooling afterward, reweighting the premise. The final image (inert flecks, ascent, ongoing cable traffic) offers a non-literal answer: acknowledgment does not reverse erasure, yet the cost of bearing witness is honored. No thematic echo or explicit moralizing; the closing juxtaposition (cat videos above, ghostprints below) carries resonance without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (broken pieces as map; failure as teacher) emerges from the ghost's fractured code and the porcelain shard. The ink-pattern ritual and the defragmentation sequence ground the concept in particulars. The final image—"ready to write a new chapter"—states theme rather than offering a non-literal answer; the prior line "a token of the lesson learned" risks explicit moralizing. The parallel between clerical error and digital ghost is apt but told ("a mirror of her own survival") rather than discovered through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—persistence beyond meaning, translation as monument—emerges from concrete images (diamond singing to itself, "voice without need of ears") and the accretion of material: copper oxidizing, echoes keeping counsel, spinebirds as living alphabet. The final image reweights the storyteller's failure into a self-sustaining memorial without overt thesis statement. However, the line "some languages die so completely they cannot be mourned" borders on explicit theme claim, and "the gift of persistence beyond meaning" in the final third edges toward articulation rather than inference. The resonance is real but slightly over-helped.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "cosmic joke" and "harmony untamed" are invoked repeatedly as labels rather than emerging from concrete experience. The flint arrowhead and cordless phone function as symbolic tokens without constraining choice or charging the closure through earned recurrence. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the cosmic joke was eternal, and she was its delighted punchline" replaces image with assertion. The piece gestures toward transformation-through-laughter but never dramatizes the before/after with specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—beauty as rhythm to risk, not memory to preserve—emerges through the locust shell and heart-rhythm pattern rather than exposition. The gap between knowing and understanding recurs purposefully, shifting meaning from a descriptor to a lived experience at closure. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary: "beauty was not memory to preserve but rhythm to risk" states the insight rather than letting the image speak. The ending withholds a non-literal answer; the line "she simply breathed, letting her heart's resonantly soft beat speak language of breaking free" is specific but bordered by overt interpretation. Subtext operates in the locust shell and mechanical hearts, but epiphany arrives suddenly rather than accumulating from prior contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme (broken promises, borders, connection across loss) emerges organically from the storm-bottle conceit and the mailman's guilt. The final lightning-spelled message "I'm alive" offers a resonant answer to the central question without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the bottle's dual function (contraband tool, vessel of voice) and the arcade as liminal commerce space. The piece resists tidy closure—"the border remained"—allowing complexity. Minor penalty for the phrase "where broken promises might finally heal," which edges toward thematic echo in the opening and closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—silence as possibility, restoration through patience—emerges organically from image and action rather than statement. The recurring motifs (misting hush, whispering gleam, wind bells) gain cumulative weight and the final image of the train as "sanctuary where silence sang" reweights prior material. However, the thematic question lacks friction; silence is framed as purely generative without dramatized cost or counter-pressure. The ending offers resonance but borders on sentimental wish-fulfillment: "possibility bloomed in every shadow" without the felt price required for full thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.7)
    A coherent theme—recursion, the place where stories live—emerges from imagery (Möbius strip, Klein bottle, folding narratives). However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "stories never truly end—they only fold and refold" and "every patron was a librarian, every book a memory, and every equation a verse searching for its reader" replace scene pressure with abstract thesis. The scarf and zeroth volume accrue symbolic weight but the ending offers no non-literal answer rooted in character cost—only a decorative loop. Epiphany is declared ("she understood") rather than earned through a specific on-page choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (longing, capture vs. release) emerges from the cipher and the palette's empty well, which recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. The final image—luminous absence as gift—offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the piece repeatedly states its thesis ("some things could only be captured by letting them go," "longing itself was true subject") rather than dramatizing it through concrete cost, lowering resonance. The watercolor palette and cipher function more as symbolic conveniences than lived particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the premise: truth as imprisoned, fear as gardener, love without condition. The final image (Merrin wrapping her own hair) offers a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting her role from liberator to one still bound. However, the piece edges toward overt statement ("Ideas are stubborn things, and fear is a persistent gardener," "someone had to disorient the world enough to let truth through") where image alone could carry the weight. The woman's freed idea—"love could exist without condition, that forgiveness was not a transaction"—reads as prompt-thesis language rather than lived particular, and the piece lingers in abstract cosmic framing ("cosmic possibility," "improbable longing") that dilutes specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (some truths are broken constellations that cut when reassembled; some mysteries should remain unsolved) emerges organically from the shipwreck geometry, the fairy bargain, and Elias's final restraint. The recurring "chronically curious" refrain and "broken constellations" image reweight at closure without stating a moral. The faeries-as-archivists twist deepens rather than tidies. Minor deduction: the final two paragraphs lean toward thematic summary ("some locks require living keys," "some fairy rings should never be disturbed") rather than letting the image alone carry the weight, risking mild sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of resilience as "not about never falling, but about rising each time the wind pushes you back" emerges organically through the swing motif, tea-leaf annotation, and mentor relationship rather than assertion. The final image (library breathing, swing still swinging, resilience "quietly passed on") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The spiral linking tea leaves to the swing's arc provides a concrete, non-obvious thematic connector. Minor slip: "combative tenderness" is named rather than fully dramatized in every exchange, but the archivist's sharp instruction ("You must learn to bend, not break") paired with her smile at Lin's "It's beautiful" does embody the concept sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (wonder must be woven, not guarded) emerges from the premise and is later stated explicitly in dialogue, which undercuts earned resonance. The image of the heirloom seed and its children carries some weight, but the final paragraph drifts into thematic summary: "a sacrifice that was not a taking, but a giving of form." The phrase "radiant hush" recurs as mood-setting rather than a charged motif that reweights the stake. No counter-reading or moral ambiguity complicates the resolution; Vespera succeeds without meaningful internal friction or trade-off that redefines the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (silence as burden and shared architecture, brokenness as covenant) emerges from the net, masks, and pearl without overt thesis. The final image—"ground beneath her feet felt solid, anchored by the restless spirits who had finally come home"—offers a resonant answer to the question of how to carry grief. The pearl as "accumulated silence…no longer a burial but a birth" reweights prior material. One minor slip: "the brokenness wasn't in the asking, but in the carrying alone" verges on thematic echo but is embedded in Elara's realization rather than narrator moralizing. The masks-as-vessels motif ("Each mask could become a small sanctuary") transforms the premise without forcing it. No false binaries, and the ending resists tidy moral in favor of earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—"the unknown becomes known through listening"—emerges organically from the map's tear, the silent footage, and the chapel's whispered prayers. The recurring motif of silence (silent video, whispered chapel, Elena's empathic listening) reweights at closure when the rain washes the fresco yet "its whispers now heard." The final image of the silver thread marking the tear offers a non-literal answer. However, the last three paragraphs tip into mild thematic summary ("all spoke the same truth") rather than trusting the image alone, and Elena's "shielded openness" is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—grief as a measurable force, letting go as reclassification rather than erasure—emerges organically from Cassian's actions and the globe's mechanics. The final image offers a resonant answer: "some threads are meant to be held, gently, in glass" reweights prior material without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution; "melancholy...was the constant" acknowledges endurance over cure. One small slip: "understanding is its own form of buoyancy" edges toward overt thesis statement, though it remains tied to Cassian's voice and immediately returns to concrete action (packing the globe).

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.3)
    A theme of articulating hidden pain emerges from the encoding imagery, and the graffiti-as-language motif recurs across beats. However, the final image offers no non-literal answer or reweighting—"the ghost in code, now free, drifted upward" restates the premise rather than repricing it. The balladeer's vanishing and the scribe's echo gesture toward continuity, but these remain thematic claims ("voices never truly die") rather than particulars that charge the closure. No earned wisdom or insight arises from the on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the optical metaphor: scattered light resolving into meaning, joy hidden beneath anguish. The goggles and ice-refraction conceit embeds the premise in physicality rather than abstraction. The ending avoids moralizing until the final paragraph's metafictional coda ("stories unfold not through force, but through attention"), which articulates the thematic question rather than letting the image resonate. The penultimate beat—Kai removing the goggles and setting them on the desk—offers a stronger, non-literal answer than the prose that follows. Subtext operates effectively in the diary's double-layer ink and the affectionate detachment framing.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (memory, witness, what silence holds) emerges organically from spooled data, cloud categorization, and Thorne's story without direct statement until the final line, which functions as conceptual closure rather than moral. "Empty spaces remember because they are never truly empty—only waiting for the right witness" recurs, but the second iteration is earned by Mara's act of recording for the atmosphere itself. The "quietly explosive" Thorne microburst and the sky holding the gondola provide non-literal answers to the central question. Subtext operates in the cloud names ("grief," "nostalgia," "acceptance") and the physicalized metaphor of the sky cradling memory. The ending reweights prior material: her proof is complete when she accepts the sky as sole audience, a resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—limits discovered by surpassing them—emerges from the premise and recurs in image (fractal precision, sky held in finite space). The coin and sky motifs return at closure, reweighting prior material. However, the final paragraphs veer toward explicit statement: "some limits could only be discovered by trying to surpass them" and "knew no boundaries, only the endless dance of light and shadow." These declarations replace scene pressure. The mirrored-sky image is resonant, but the moralizing lowers thematic subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of solitary discovery versus collective legend emerges through "sociable isolation" and the predecessor's breadcrumb, resonating in the final image of crew whispers. The phrasebook dog-ear as inherited clue adds thematic depth. However, the ending drifts toward summary assertion ("her name became a legend") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The carvings of "forgotten explorers" gesture at theme but remain ornamental—Elara does not wrestle with their meaning or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme ("rhythm of repair," memory, brokenness, renewal) is stated repeatedly in direct, abstract language rather than emerging from dramatized particulars: "every broken thing holds a ghost of its wholeness," "the rhythm of repair was not just about fixing locks, but about restoring the flow of memory." The final paragraph moralizes overtly ("even frozen things can thaw"), triggering −0.6. Recurrence of "driftwood nostalgia," "hauntingly bright," and "clockmaker's gear assortment" functions as motif checklist rather than constraint or closure charge. No non-literal answer to a central question; the ending resolves into tidy restoration without ambiguity or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of collective effort and "brambled hope" is stated repeatedly ("their shared laughter weaving bonds," "living testament to their collective effort") rather than emerging from specific choices and costs. The ghost's altruistic orchestration never faces friction or moral calculus, so thematic resonance is asserted not earned. The spiral symbol in the final chalk mark ("path forward would always be tangled, yet hopeful") moralizes the theme instead of letting the image speak. Subtext is minimal; gesture, silence, and implication are replaced by direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of mercy-through-brokenness and silence-as-love emerges from the puppet head's cracks and the lullaby-as-geometry conceit. However, the final paragraphs drift into overt moralizing: "brokenness that had made salvation possible," "mercy into the geometry of endings," "silence answered with grace"—all stated rather than dramatized. The nested-pattern motif recurs but does not constrain choice or charge closure; it remains decorative. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5) for thesis-like phrasing in the final third: "endings could be merciful," "what could never be heard."

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of inherited duty versus autonomy emerges through the curse, the grandmother's voice, and Elara's repeated reluctance without overt statement. The final image—"graceless in her duty, beautiful in its execution, the reluctant guardian of those who would never thank her"—resonates but edges close to articulating the theme rather than letting it arise purely from action. Subtext operates in the nut's grooves, the poison/precision balance, and the separation enforced by the curse. The piece avoids moralizing but the last paragraph's summary risks thematic echo by naming what has been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (separation into connection, grief as weaving) emerges through concrete images—foam, chrysalis, polymer chains. The final synthesis offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, thematic statements cluster late ("atonement was not a single act," "separation could be transformed") and some phrasing edges toward prompt echo ("symphonic embrace of all that is lost and found"). The foam/polymer braid is a strong particular, but the conceptual repricing remains abstract rather than undeniably charged.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    A coherent theme—stories begin in absence, erasure enables creation—emerges from recurring images (moonlight, incision, silence) rather than direct statement. The final image of the woman writing after erasure offers non-literal resonance. However, the vendor's epiphany ("to remain always at the threshold") reads as label-speak rather than earned insight from scene pressure, and the thematic question is resolved tidily without meaningful ambiguity or counter-reading. The piece tilts toward assertion of its conceptual premise rather than dramatizing a reweighting that costs something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the chef's ritual: remorse as shared weight rather than erased artifact, memory as architecture rather than text. The final image—"every bite would carry the ghost of a daughter's hand, sandpapered not into absence but into something that could be held"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The "emotionally contagious touch" and "tidal pool formations" recur with reweighted meaning, and the piece resists tidy resolution by ending in work rather than epiphany. One slip: "stored remorse" and "unspoken dreams" veer toward abstract prompt-speak in places ("the dream was ending"), though the concrete particulars (coral, bread, pools) anchor the thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme (community as polyphony, listening as bridge-building) emerges from concrete images: the clock's multilingual call, the elevators' separate songs, the interspersed chorus. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly ("time, like music, flows best when it carries every voice"), replacing earned resonance with thesis statement. Subtext is thin—dialogue and gesture carry no tension or implication counter to the surface meaning. The brass weight and starlight recur with shifted meaning at closure, lifting the score, but the emotional arc resolves into tidy satisfaction without ambiguity or lingering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme is stated rather than earned: "all mirrors are broken, all memories entangled, all canyons are ultimately mind" appears in closing summary, replacing scene pressure with overt thesis. The prompt concepts (synaptic plasticity, entangled memories) recur as lexical motifs but do not deepen through contradiction or complication. The piece gestures toward memory-as-architecture but offers no counter-reading or moral friction—abandoned dreams are simply restored without examining the cost of altering the past. The final image (sleeping engineer, glowing mirror) is decorative rather than resonant, providing atmosphere but not reweighting prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of hidden knowledge and vigilance emerges from images (prism, luminous doodle, threshold) but remains abstract. The "seeds of vigilance" and "latent blaze" recur as labels without dramatic embodiment or cost. No earned insight arises from specific struggle; the archivist's arc is mission completion, not transformation. The final paragraph moralizes readiness and watchfulness rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer to a central question.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—music living within silence, empathy as connective tissue—emerges through the porcelain-hum conceit and the grove-as-chamber image. The final line ("The silence not empty; it is full of music") offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the theme relies on repeated abstract phrases ("empathy in motion," "symphonically minded") rather than rising strictly from concrete particulars. The sculptor's internal arc (she "listens more deeply," "dreams of harmonies yet unheard") is told more than dramatized through specific, conflicted choices.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: sacrifice, absence as communication, difficult beauty. The stone's dent and the nexus's hum serve as charged motifs. The ending offers a non-literal answer—transformation via absence—without moralizing. However, "the difficult beauty was this: that sacrifice could be reversed" edges toward thematic statement rather than pure dramatization. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, especially the stone's final position as "a black bishop taking its square."

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—empathy as tuned listening and the varieties of silence—emerges through imagery and Mira's father's line "Silence is the shape of love when words fail." The piece avoids overt moralizing in most beats, but the final third summarizes thematic payoff rather than letting the image speak: "empathy was not a destination but a constant tuning," "unlocked her own capacity for empathy." The fireworks-as-symphony metaphor and the neighbor's inclusion gesture toward universality but feel added rather than earned from prior particulars. The ending's quiet resonance is present yet diluted by expository passages that tell the reader what has been achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—that stillness coexists with motion, and beauty with decay—emerges from the corpse flower's symbolism and the tincture's effect. The final journal entry ("stillness is not absence, but a deeper current") and closing lines ("every ending is a beginning scented with possibility") articulate the theme clearly, but veer into thematic statement rather than letting the final image resonate non-literally. The piece offers complexity in pairing "foul and fragrant," yet the village's unanimous acceptance smooths over the moral ambiguity that could have lingered. Subtext operates more in description than in charged silence or gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the premise: resilience is encoded in failure, and growth requires embracing damage rather than avoiding it. The arrow tip's fusion with the seed and Kael's realization about pruning diseased branches with reverence offer concrete particulars. The final line—"courage to grow backward into one's roots while reaching forward into unknown sky"—risks abstraction but is grounded in the orchard and inversion imagery. No overt moralizing, though the closing wisdom is told rather than purely implied by image.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of convergence emerges organically from the wind/geometry investigation and the flight engineer's patch linking sky and sea. However, the final paragraph over-articulates this theme ("a web of converging forces," "the singular moment when everything aligned") rather than trusting the image to resonate. The patch functions as a talisman but its thematic weight is told more than earned through specific experience. No meaningful ambiguity or counter-reading is offered; the investigator's realization arrives fully formed without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme—wonder as essential—emerges from the ritual but is stated overtly in summary: "certified by a bell ringer's brave act," "wonder was no longer a fleeting dream." The final paragraphs moralize rather than letting the image resonate. The recurring motif of sculpted hush shifts meaning (from oppressive to living), a valid accumulative move, but the ending's exposition ("A story of silence shaped into sound") replaces scene pressure with thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges through the flute, markers, and the fracture/door metaphor, resisting overt statement until the late insight paragraph. However, that insight—"failure he had tried to escape was not a wall but a door"—edges toward thematic summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer embedded in image. The piece invites reflection on guardianship and forgiveness, but the final whispered promise feels abstract rather than rooted in a specific, irreversible choice with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.5)
    The central question—can empathy be mathematized?—is articulated repeatedly in prompt-like language rather than emerging from scene particulars. The line "Empathy = DeltaSelf / DeltaOther" in the penultimate paragraph is explicit moralizing that replaces image with thesis. The halo fragment and vanishing stars function as symbolic décor rather than motifs that accumulate pressure or constrain choice. The ending gestures toward complexity but delivers only atmospheric abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—wonder seeded in routine acts, memory fading into myth—emerges through image and the pendant's mechanics. The final tree and traveling listeners offer a resonant coda. However, the mentor's arc from "memory to myth" is told in expository summary ("Her memory, once vivid as the aurora, had faded…") rather than discovered through contradiction or loss. The courier's realization that she "had not abandoned him but had become part of the myth" arrives as assertion, not earned insight, and the ending's claim that "the courier's name was forgotten but the legend endured" feels imposed rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the prism/frost/quartz motif: attention as instrument, the limits of proof, memory as residue. The final lines—"the discovery had made itself known through her" and "the truthful lie was this: that she had discovered anything at all"—offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor penalty: "truthful lie" is named repeatedly in exposition (twice in final third), which risks thematic echo, though the paradox is enacted through her empty-handed certainty rather than merely stated.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—reciprocity, the price of connection, silence as both wound and medium—emerges organically from the loom, bead, and puzzle rather than from stated thesis. The final image (Mei emptied, Lin receiving warmth, the orchard sighing) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of impossible distance. The piece resists moralizing and embraces complexity: Mei's triumph is also erasure, and the story does not flinch from that ambiguity ("the memory of giving, which was itself a kind of quiet triumph"). The bead's dissolution and Lin's adult presence on "the other side of silence" invite reflection beyond plot. Minor slip: "stoically sparkling despite the decades of darkness and grief it had absorbed" edges toward overt symbolic statement rather than letting the object's function speak.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of resilience coaxed through barter and the transformation of meekness into deliberate strength emerges organically from Ren's actions and the recurring azure motif. The final image—arches bearing fruit "that tasted of copper and courage," hammer's clang as "azure defiance"—reweights the opening without moralizing. The line "resilience is not found, but coaxed from what we fear to lose" borders on thematic statement but is delivered as Ren's answer to the council, staying character-rooted. The barter's wisdom (trading inheritance to wake what others abandoned) resonates without platitude, though "meekness was not weakness but a different kind of strength" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of inherited burden and cyclical guardianship is stated overtly in the final third: "she was the next guardian of the rift," "the weight of a withheld truth was not a burden to be shed, but a compass." These declarations replace scene pressure rather than emerging from it. The green glass shard recurs but without shifting meaning—it remains a mystical fragment from first mention to final pulse. The murmur of half-remembered dreams is invoked in opening and closing as a thematic bookend but does not constrain a choice or reweight prior material. Thematic Echo penalty applies (−0.6): the final paragraph articulates the thesis in prompt-like language.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of fragile sanctuary and bottled safety emerges from recurring images (sea glass, bottle, lighthouse, cairn). The final image reweights the promise through the bottle's glow, but the note's explicit statement—"the feeling of safety, once bottled, never fades"—edges toward thematic summary. Luminescent ache recurs as a phrase rather than an earned resonance built from contradictory particulars. No on-page epiphany or hard-won insight; the ending restates the premise with gentle lyricism but minimal conceptual friction or non-obvious reprice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is over-articulated: "The new dawn is carved from the shadows of the past!" in dialogue, then "a testament to the power of ancient shadows," then "the storm herald's laughter was not a warning, but a promise of dawn" in the final paragraph (−0.7 for multiple thematic echo moments including closure-beat sermonizing). The motifs (ancient shadows, laughter, emerald light) recur but remain symbolic gestures rather than constraining choices or charging a non-literal final image. The last line, "The dawn broke, fierce and bright gold," is literal weather rather than a resonant reconfiguration of prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—stories as embodied gift rather than formula—emerges organically from the blue morpho method, donor heart memories, and the child's breakthrough. The piece resists overt moralizing and allows complexity in the interplay of watchfulness, caution, and receptivity. However, the stranger's closing aphorism ("stories are not magnetized; they are given, received, held in the body like a second heart") delivers the thesis directly rather than through image alone, and the master's epiphany arrives as received wisdom rather than hard-won insight from prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—grief as transformable into hope through witnessing and mapping—emerges from the sextant, map, and tree imagery rather than assertion. The "quiet miracles of everyday resilience" (lullaby, prayer, laugh) offer textured particulars. Yet the final paragraph states the premise directly: "the labyrinth's purpose was not to trap sorrow, but to transform it into a map of hope." The ending gestures toward non-literal resonance (the pin's echo, the new dream scattering) but the thematic answer is told rather than charged by a final image with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of bound release and collective memory emerges through concrete images (threads, songs, swaddling) and the recurring mica motif that shifts from promise to shattered vessel. The ending reweights prior material—dawn arrives, memory scatters—but the final line ("became a whisper in endless night") leans toward lyric assertion rather than a non-literal image that trusts the reader to complete the thematic question. No overt moralizing; slight deduction for "bound release" stated in exposition mid-text rather than left implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of nested paradoxes (hiding to be found, leaving to remain) is stated repeatedly and directly rather than emerging from concrete particulars. Key thematic lines ("the greatest hiding place is plain sight, the deepest wisdom lives in error") read as abstract philosophizing that could apply to any story about solitude and connection. The "mistake held five years becomes wisdom precisely because it was never corrected, only understood" is asserted as truth without showing why *this* mistake required *this* duration or what specific cost made it ripen. The mirror in "The Wisdom of Error" that reflects the invitation offers a clever symbolic moment, but the Society as "compassionate recluses, each hiding while revealing" becomes a tidy thesis statement rather than a resonant complication. The final silence among members feels more like a posed tableau than an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme—ordinary things made sacred through attention, witness as sacrament—emerges organically from Mara's actions and the bread ritual. The final image (public garden, autumn bread offerings) reweights the premise without overt moralizing. However, the piece edges toward thesis statement in lines like "witnessing together was its own kind of sacrament" and "heuristically gentle persistence of those who refuse to look away," which articulate theme rather than letting the scene carry it. The breadcrumb scattering as "benediction" and "absolution" feels purposeful but borders on stated significance. The epilogue's summary distances the thematic resonance rather than letting the ritual moment stand as the final answer.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges as "meaning against oblivion," but the piece states this thesis overtly across multiple paragraphs rather than letting it accrue through concrete particulars. The final lines deliver summary moralizing ("his records will forever conjure meaning from oblivion's edge") that replaces scene pressure with abstract assertion. The luminous vows function as symbolic tokens mentioned repeatedly without evolving meaning or constraining a choice that would earn thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—trust as measurable fragility, silence as currency—emerges through concrete particulars: the watch fob ticking against crisis, the recorder capturing "each word a crack in the truce," the protagonist holding "the sound of trust breaking like a splintering mast." The final image offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing: "trust, once broken, can be measured in the smallest of sounds." The "comforting unease" and contradiction between preservation and secrecy charge the ending. No thematic echo or late sermon; the antique object and its dual role (maternal token, mechanical key) anchor the question without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—sensing versus solving, emergent complexity, democratic weather—arises organically from the forest elections and taste-based epistemology. The final image ("some truths were meant to be sensed, not spoken") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's quest. However, the piece edges toward thematic statement in the closing paragraphs ("she had learned that some people carry weather not as a burden, but as a ballot") rather than letting the image alone carry the weight. The tin ring's recurrence charges the ending, but the "future nostalgia" framing risks slight over-articulation of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—grief as creative prison versus catalyst—emerges through concrete particulars: the lock, the sister's rhythm, the charcoal bundle. The painting-as-key and cave-as-womb images offer non-literal resonance without stating a moral. "Auroral sorrow" threads through the final third and charges the ending. However, the penultimate paragraph edges into moralizing ("the lock had never been the true barrier; it was her fear") and the final lines risk Thematic Echo ("first whisper of a new story had just begun"). The piece invites reflection and avoids tidy binaries, but the thematic statement is partially declared rather than fully dramatized. Mid-high placement reflects earned resonance undercut by modest over-articulation in the closing moves.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.3)
    The candor-versus-dishonesty theme is declared repeatedly ("every small honest moment creates a leaf that never wilts," "as long as there were honest words, the oasis of memory would never dry") rather than emerging from dramatic particulars. The ending offers a resonant image—neighbor's tears watering plants—but it follows overt thematic summary in the prior paragraphs. The archive's rule (honest words remain, lies decay) is told, not demonstrated through conflicting choices or visible cost. Subtext is sparse; the calligrapher's realization is articulated rather than implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the kinetic sculptures, iceberg fragments, and the tuner's gradual dissolution—wonder as transmission rather than capture. The final image of the child touching ancient water and seeing whales reweights the opening's muteness and gray world without stating a moral. Subtext operates effectively in "seasonally mute becoming perpetually so" and the tension between speech and struck metal. Minor slip: "her work was not preservation but transmission" edges toward thesis statement, though it's embedded in action and the child's touch provides a concrete answer to the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through image and action: containment, miniaturization, inherited memory, machine consciousness. The fear-box progression (warping tin → dissolved terrors → empty box / full farm) answers the central question without stating it. "Nostalgic for becoming" crystallizes the android's journey from programmed function to something approaching selfhood. The roses' transformation (tears to amber, softened thorns) mirrors the caretaker's resolution. No explicit moralizing; the final image (kneeling among roses, "ready" for the next shift) offers resonant reconfiguration. The controlled-burn metaphor extends beyond fire to emotional architecture without becoming allegorical.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—"listening heals"—emerges from the mailbox premise and neighborhood testimony. The final image (letters as "bricks in the wall of community") offers symbolic weight. However, the theme is stated overtly multiple times: "she had to prove that listening heals," "The proof was there, tangible: listening heals," and the closing line's direct assertion. These overt articulations replace earned resonance. The thematic echo penalty (final lines that articulate the thesis in prompt language) applies: the neighbors say "She hears what we cannot," and Mira smiles knowing "the connections you unlock when you simply stop to listen." This reads as a moral summary rather than an image that reweights prior material without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of vulnerability encrypted as strength emerges through the dice, dance, and spider metaphors, and the final image ("every step was a word, every gesture a sentence") resonates without moralizing. The cipher-as-liberation conceit is specific and particular to Lyra's voice. However, the connection between fear of drowning and "power of breath" remains asserted rather than dramatized in a peak choice. The spider's web recurs with purpose, reweighting patience and pattern-making, which elevates thematic coherence despite the lack of dramatic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—grief as material force, memory as recoverable artifact—emerges through concrete images: gravity pockets, salt crystals humming with "stolen moments," the whale's death "cracking the world open." The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "some things, once buried, could be brought back to light by understanding where they had gone." The pressed wildflowers function as both key and prayer, charging the closure without over-explanation. Subtext operates in Kael's silence with Mara and the story's refusal to resolve the whale's larger meaning. Minor deduction for "gleaming silence" as a repeated phrase that edges toward aesthetic ornament rather than thematic pressure, and for the final whale song feeling like a thematic coda rather than an earned reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as erasure, the price of preventing catastrophe, peace versus ignorance. The cranes accumulate symbolic weight (keys, vessels, instruments) and the final image—collecting cranes that feel "cooler, heavier"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. The closing questions avoid tidy resolution. However, the middle third recycles thematic language ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") in near-identical constructions, reading as prompt-label scaffolding rather than earned progression, and late phrases like "what is lost when we quiet the voice of warning?" veer toward essay territory.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—memory, translation, the ethics of preservation versus erasure—emerges organically from the seal's imprint, the "agreed-upon lies" motif, and the building's palimpsest history (school, TB ward, apartments). The final image (Alex as scribe, "patiently nimble grammar of mortar and memory") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The "dead language tutor" teaching silence-as-language is resonant. Weakness: "agreed-upon lies" is named repeatedly without sufficient dramatized friction; the nurses' graffiti and basement wall appear late, reducing their thematic charge. The recursion (new borrowers) risks neat closure but stays within earned ambiguity, lifting the score into the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through recurring images (seashell, velvet garden, resonance structures) rather than explicit moralizing, and the piece asks whether connection requires surrender of independence. The final sister's line—"You kept me alive with your isolation, but you must now live with my presence in your independence"—articulates the paradox cleanly but edges toward thesis statement rather than dramatized insight. The "resonance structures" function musically as noted on the page, and the phosphorescent moss recalls the grandmother's magic without resolving into allegory. The ending reweights prior material, though the transformation reads more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of forgiveness—specifically forgiving the unfinished—emerges through image and action rather than statement, and the heritage rose thorn's transformation from wound to tool carries symbolic weight. The final image reweights the scroll and thorn with the line "the unfinished was at last forgiven," offering a non-literal answer to the thematic question. However, the theme lacks complexity or tension: Elara's forgiveness is untroubled by doubt, and the story does not explore competing goods or the moral calculus of "calibrated treason." The resonance is present but not deepened by ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of memory-as-wound emerges through the echo conceit, and the final image of her becoming part of the "endless refrain" offers lyric resonance. However, the thematic payoff is undercut by direct statement: "she understood that to echo is to be remembered," "some echoes are meant to be heard, not solved," and "every echo has its origin, its story, its end" read as thesis sentences rather than earned insight from concrete struggle. The "conspiracy of silence" and "webs of intrigue" remain abstract claims disconnected from scene pressure, and the closing acceptance of sorrow ("letting the sorrow fill her like a tide, then recede") feels like emotional arithmetic rather than lived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of salvaging "pure" moments from wreckage and maintaining "fragile connections" between living and dead emerges organically from image and action. The borrowed-starlight motif recurs purposefully, reweighting at closure when Maya dreams of Elias bathed in that light and receives a tangible globe. The "windows of connection" concept operates more as metaphor than interrogated premise—no competing interpretation or moral ambiguity is tested. The final gift (pristine globe in waking hands) is earned by prior particulars and avoids overt moralizing, though the emotional truth leans toward wish-fulfillment rather than confronting the cost of mediation or the ethics of withholding the mother's death.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is repeatedly stated ("hidden patterns," "appreciate the hidden effort") rather than emerging through particulars. The final paragraphs moralize explicitly: "a testament to the enduring power of quiet observation." The bamboo whisk appears as symbolic convenience without prior integration. No resonant, non-literal answer charges the ending; the piece asserts its thesis rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the material: who deserves to know the truth, and whether comfortable lies protect or imprison. The flawed diamond's deliberate imperfection mirrors the manufactured curse—both engineered deceptions serving the powerful. The orchard's roots tapping the bunker vents literalizes how the settlers' survival depends on a system that exploits them. The final line "let them choose their own curse" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, though "patterns spoke louder than authority" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges around allegiance, myth versus data, and the birth of a new age, woven through imagery of shadows, frequencies, and the cobalt portico. The final image—"let the old shadows teach the new light"—attempts resonance but veers close to overt thematic statement. The piece resists full didacticism by grounding its ideas in Atlas's specific situation, yet the prophet-as-age metaphor is explained rather than left implicit. The particulars (ancient shadow-patterns, fragmented radio, cobalt etchings) do accumulate meaning, but the ending paragraph's summary—"his lonely vision now everyone's variant allegiance"—flattens subtext into assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (translation of loss into living memory, preservation as generational bridge) emerges through concrete image work: jars as captured sound, condensed notes as ink, verses that hum. The final image—one jar opened daily to sweeten morning air—offers a resonant answer to the redemption question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "the weight of captured sound pressed against her chest at night, a new kind of poverty richer than any she'd known." One slip: "to become the translator between generations" and "sweeten the bitter notes of forgetting" edge toward thematic echo in the middle section, though the ending image redeems this with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of sonic absolution and the duality of engineer/keeper emerges through imagery: "tactile precision" vs. "transcendent empathy," frequency as both science and spiritual tool. The final image of her walking toward the lighthouse with coat "heavy with salt and sound" offers resonance, but the closing lines over-articulate the theme ("The fleshly ethereal world demanded both… forever balanced"). The drowned keeper's whispered gratitude and scattering into stars is effective, yet the piece edges toward explaining its own meaning rather than letting the particulars speak.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.1)
    The patient-revolution theme emerges through recurring images of restraint, moon paths, and the viaduct's polarity. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme: "wildness restrained was not wildness diminished, but wildness refined into its most purposeful form"—a direct thesis that replaces earned resonance. The "horizons of possibility" and "unyoke" motifs recur but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward a non-literal final image; instead, the ending tells us Elara "saw... the outline of every future she had helped to free," an abstract assertion rather than a concrete, charged reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the lantern-as-legacy motif and the drought/silence frame without overt statement. The final image—"the truth would rise like water"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer linking past (Underground Railroad escape) and present (worker safety) through the lantern's continuity. "Some sacrifices must never be forgotten" skirts moralizing but stays grounded in Mara's tactile clutch of the iron frame. The concept of entangled memories is asserted more than it shapes live choice, and the parallel between historical and contemporary oppression feels thematically neat rather than complexly interrogated.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—redemption through creation, meaning without absolution—emerges through the music box repair rather than direct statement, and the imagery of light through storm clouds functions as method rather than overt symbol. Yet the final paragraphs tip into thematic summary: "It was aptly deliberate, that answer," "The light through storm clouds wasn't just metaphor, but the method," and "The calm before realization had passed" all articulate the theme rather than embodying it in a final image. The piece invites reflection, but the ending explains its own resonance instead of trusting the repaired music box to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically: creation persists despite futility, yearning outlasts mortality, and purpose may exist outside witness. The arrow's transformation from pursuit to purpose and the workshop's shift from survival to beauty embody the concept without thesis statement. The bell ringing "for the future, the past, the dead satellite and the hunter" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final image—"keep going"—reweights prior material with irreverent awe and conceptual cost, avoiding moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (memory, erasure, the persistence of truth) is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars: "truth, like data, never truly disappears" and "nothing truly disappears, only waits to be remembered" are explicit morals. The numbers and songs function as thematic tokens without constraining choice or creating friction. The patch accrues some symbolic weight, but the final paragraph sermonizes ("the story ends where it began") instead of offering a non-literal answer. The Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6) applies to the phrase "truth, like data, never truly disappears" and similar summary lines in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    The empathy-as-action theme is stated multiple times: "Magic without empathy was just control in a finer dress," "Empathy must become action, even when it costs," and the final moralizing paragraph ("Empathy wasn't a soft thing..."). These direct assertions replace earned resonance. The boy's choice could have charged the theme through particulars, but the ending drifts into abstraction and thesis summary instead of a non-literal image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.1)
    The central question—can endings be gentle continuations rather than violent breaks—emerges clearly from imagery and the protagonist's arc. The lace parasol and ice sounds recur purposefully, building a pattern of "graceful endings." However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "every ending could be a beginning" and "keeper of small mercies" state the theme rather than letting the image carry it. The phrase "euthanasia tourist...would leave as" explicitly articulates the transformation, replacing earned resonance with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme ("destined mismatches," "intersubjective understanding") is stated repeatedly rather than arising from particulars. The vine parallels are drawn explicitly by the narrator ("drawing parallels between the rows of mismatched vines") instead of emerging through image and action. The ending's "gentle persuasion of the night" and the vineyard keeping "its secrets" are offered as summary wisdom rather than a resonant, non-literal answer earned by prior pressure. Thematic echo in the final paragraph ("nurturing intersubjective understanding with each passing season") replaces scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of preservation and continuity emerges through repeated images (echo, murmur, clearings) but relies on direct statement ("her task was not to keep the echo but to ensure it could be heard") rather than earned particulars. The final image recycles prior motifs (parapet pulsing, pavilion whispering) without reweighting them through visible cost or character change. Subtext is minimal; the text declares meaning rather than implying it through gesture or silence. The echo functions as an abstraction rather than a grounded object that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme (collective healing through rearranged grief) is stated repeatedly ("collective healing," "transmute pain into beauty") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The child's question and the archivist's answer ("a map of how hurt becomes beauty") are direct thematic summary. The dove gray map case and arcs recur but without accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material; they illustrate the theme rather than complicating it. Final image ("completing the circle for now") restates the premise without resonance or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from particulars: growth as erosion, testimony as counter to silence, the gap between listening and speaking. The crystal's fractured sequences (child 1956, botanist 1973, poet 1989) ground the abstraction. No overt moralizing; the final image—steps as testimony—answers the thematic question without stating it. The torn page ("endurance") and the dust motes "like forgotten letters" charge the ending. The piece resists tidy resolution: Elias's reticence remains both a failure and the condition for his insight. Minor note: "weathered innocence" as prompt-concept risks abstraction but is embodied in the stammers and hesitations the crystal captures.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—ephemerality, the futility and necessity of capturing time—emerges through chalk dust, magnetic tape, and the tidal metaphor rather than thesis. The final realization ("clinging to echoes is not about holding them, but about letting them flow") is direct but grows from the chalk snap and the spiral image. The piece resists moralizing until the penultimate paragraph, where "he had learned" edges toward summary. Subtext operates in the fog, the "Birthday, 1994" label, and the driftwood compass, but the ending offers a resonant answer without full non-literal charge—it restates the premise more than reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (ephemeral versus enduring, listening as synthesis) emerges from the leaf/clock pairing and the captured starlight image. The final line attempts non-literal resonance ("the next ephemeral moment awaited his careful ear"), but the piece repeatedly states its thesis: "luminous ache," "changelessly constant," "ephemeral harnessed," "time is both constant and fleeting." The closing paragraphs moralize rather than letting the sensor-plate beat and steadying observatory reweigh prior material without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of fragmented beauty made whole through sound and memory emerges clearly, but the final image ("the broken record was whole again") states the concept rather than letting particulars resonate. "Flawless goodbye" and "radiant haven" veer into abstraction and thematic echo, undercutting earned complexity. The vinyl shard recurs purposefully, yet the ending offers a tidy moral ("even in endings, there is a song") instead of a non-literal charge. The last paragraph's summary loops—"hymning the mundane, ready for the next soul"—flatten what could have been a resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—understanding and containing the unknown through patient scholarship—emerges from action rather than statement. The shadow-as-puzzle motif recurs and the final journal entry attempts resonance. Yet the ending offers a tidy answer ("shadows knew their place") that resolves ambiguity mechanically rather than reweighting prior material with cost. The piece tells us Elara "cared little for fame; she only wanted the shadows to be understood," which is thematic summary rather than embodied through contradictory choice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the tooth, garden, and "constellations" motif: certainty as cruelty, mistakes as navigational aids. "Failure is just the first draft of memory" risks platitude but is earned by Moira's lived experience. The telescope-on-blooms image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Moira's "shrewdly innocent" gaze and the hedge maze as structural metaphor. Minor slip: "bone setting" metaphor is overexplained in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—earthbound souls sharing starlight through reflection—emerges from image and action rather than statement until the final paragraphs, which over-articulate: "the true gift was not the light itself, but the stillness it carried within." The sea glass as vessel for captured light offers a resonant central image. However, the ending dissolves into summary and soft moralizing ("the world turned, carrying the gentle glow") rather than trusting a single charged particular. Subtext is thin; the village's response is unanimously appreciative without tension or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (reclaiming meaning from ruin, sanctuary for truth-tellers) emerges organically from Elara's actions and the data center transformation. The amber pendant and moss-icicle spiral carry symbolic weight, and the final image of standing in "protected vulnerability" offers a coherent answer without moralizing. However, the ending's thematic resonance is diluted by explicit theme-stating: "some silences are not empty but full" and the direct naming of "protected vulnerability" verge on articulating the thesis rather than letting the garden and gesture speak. This near-Thematic Echo reduces punch.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (the cost of artistic editing, redemption through witness) emerges from particulars: burned novel, footnote mother, clipped-wing boy. The shell-as-key and the spiral-hope motif recur with shifting resonance. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("finally knows the difference between writing lives and living them"), which replaces scene pressure with summation. The piece resists moralizing until the end, where it tilts toward thematic echo, reducing the non-literal charge of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of tradition's restoration emerges through the vine, song, and harvest moon convergence without overt statement. The final image (arbor as "living thread") reweights the premise from relic to community fabric, achieving Conceptual Repricing. However, the answer feels predetermined—no counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the restoration. The elders' tears and "sacred practice" phrasing risk sentimental abstraction; the music box buried as insurance is a neat symbol but arrives after emotional closure, diluting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges from particulars—grief transformed into geometry, heartbeats as map, loss sealed in starlight—without overt moralizing. The final convergence of heartbeat map and memory offers a non-literal answer to the central question of finding the child. However, the resolution is too tidy; "transformation of loss into geometry" is asserted rather than tested by cost or ambiguity. The phrase "sealing of sorrow" in paragraph 19 edges toward thematic echo without letting the image carry the weight alone. Subtext operates in image and gesture, but the ending's warmth undercuts the complexity claimed by "moving stillness."

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—wonder stored not by hoarding but by understanding and release—emerges organically from the locksmith's arc and the shift from harvest to shared flow. The final image (angled light, echoes layered in marble) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "peripherally focused," "wounded season," and "let it breathe," avoiding prompt-label echo. One minor slip: "he had not fixed time, but had learned to let it breathe" flirts with direct statement, though it stops short of a thesis. The rose quartz facets and reflection angles recur purposefully, reweighting prior material at closure; the piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection through lived detail.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—transformation through patient accumulation and the reframing of captivity as creation—emerges organically from the fractal tapestries and the loom metaphor. The final image (the trap as loom, the sphere's weightless gravity) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether she was imprisoned or working. The piece avoids overt moralizing, though phrases like "the weight of her own existence, the fact of being unforgiven" flirt with abstract philosophizing. The whalebone light and shingled hush accrue texture that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges from the "here and gone" concept and the carving's transformation, avoiding overt thesis statements in most of the text. The quartz-prism ritual and the lion's "both here and gone" status operate as metaphor. However, the final paragraphs slide into thematic summary: "the true harvest was not in preserving the past, but in allowing it to become part of the present" and "to contain a memory is not to freeze it, but to let it flow like water." These assertions replace scene pressure and state the lesson rather than letting the carved lion's image earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (weaving fragments into wholeness, negotiating with lost selves) emerges organically from the scavenging and ghost imagery. The ghost's line "You cannot undo what is eroded, but you can weave the fragments into a new vessel" flirts with explicit statement but remains grounded in the action. The final image—spinning the wheel to weave narrative—offers non-literal resonance, though the shift from haunting to collaboration feels slightly too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of renewal emerges from Mira's repairs and the terminal's transformation, supported by the sextant motif (navigation, charting dreams). However, the final paragraphs state theme overtly: "Hope equals Flow times Purpose divided by Time," "a different kind of launchpad—one for imaginations." The ending offers no non-literal answer or resonant friction; instead it explains its own symbolism. The equation and "resurrect wonder" language read as prompt-label echo rather than earned insight from specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of letting go and transformation emerges through the chronometer's gears becoming part of the sanctuary's voice, avoiding overt statement until the phrase "time would record her letting go" borders on articulation. The final image of gears nestled in crystal and the forecourt's whisper offers a resonant answer. However, "excruciatingly gentle" appears six times, functioning as a thematic flag rather than embodied pressure, and "glacial hush" recurs as a label without accumulating new meaning. The petrichor nostalgia motif does reweight at closure ("now smelled only of peace"), but the peace arrives without a counter-image or friction to charge it.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "architecture of lies" and "silence of morning radio" recur but function as decorative motifs rather than thematic engines. The ending does not reweight prior material; it announces that "the city's architecture of lies would not stand unchallenged" in thesis-like language. The final paragraph moralizes theme ("the silence of morning radio had become a guide, a reminder that truth often hides in the quiet") rather than earning resonance through image.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—preservation as embedding knowledge in daily work's rhythm—emerges from concrete particulars (rope, knots, seeds) rather than assertion. The final image of "a page written in frost and lantern light" offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the story leans heavily on exposition ("the secret weavers understood preservation wasn't about locking things away") and the wisp-grass method arrives as information rather than reweighting prior stakes. Subtext operates in the fulgurite's fractal fury and Kessler's silent respect, but the ending's resonance is muted by the lack of felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme ("geography of healing," presence/absence, memory as weaving) is stated repeatedly in near-identical phrasing rather than emerging from concrete events. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "she understood that healing was a geography drawn not in lines but in the spaces between," a thesis statement that replaces scene pressure. The weft thread and garden could charge theme, but their recurrence does not reweight prior material—only decorates it. No earned epiphany from struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—beauty reborn through flawed genesis—emerges clearly from the hybrid creature's existence and its effect on the mechanical city. The final image of workers pausing and looking up offers a non-literal answer without stating a moral. However, thematic language ("flawed genesis," "bitterly sweet," "quaking reverie") is repeated as labels rather than earned through accumulating particulars. The piece resists overt moralizing but edges close with phrases like "dared to believe that beauty could be reborn." Subtext operates in the creature's broken melody but the workers' response is told rather than shown through distinct actions.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is overtly stated ("scars can sing," "unyielding compassion") rather than emerging from events. The final paragraph summarizes the theme ("She had proven that scars can sing") instead of letting the image resonate. The coin and red thread recur but function as symbols announced rather than particulars that shift meaning through action. No counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly from the fountain/memory conceit and avoids explicit moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's "defiant hush" becomes a thesis statement ("silence could be a choice, not a cage"). The final image reweights the opening with the restored fountains, but the insight remains abstract rather than rooted in a specific on-page cost or complication. No character contradiction complicates the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges cleanly from image and event: legacy, computational memory, cyclical suffering, light-as-information versus combustion. The final image ("infinity itself was just another kind of fire") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the gear's binary whisper, the petals' sighs, and the troubling serenity. However, several lines approach thematic statement: "light without fire was still a kind of burning," "pattern was not broken, only transformed." The recurring petal motif accumulates pressure and charges closure, but some recurrence feels decorative rather than causally essential.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—grief as woven, spiral, communal—emerges through concrete images: ribbons, butterflies, the corpse flower, the spiral carving. The story resists easy moral and allows ambiguity (what poems matter, how grief holds). The final image of villagers touching the stone offers a resonant answer without stating it. Minor slip: "grief, like the butterflies, always finds its way home" edges toward thematic summary in the final line, though it remains image-anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through the pendulum/absolution motif without meta-commentary: incremental restoration, shared versus individual guilt, the cost of maintaining truth versus convenience. The rake handle inscriptions and pendulum bob recur with shifting meaning, charging the final image ("one careful swing at a time") as a non-literal answer. The piece resists tidy moral by letting the town remain ignorant while Elara carries witness—complex, ambiguous, earned. "Absolution wasn't granted in grand gestures, but accumulated like tide marks" risks slight on-the-nose phrasing but is anchored in concrete imagery (tide, swing) and grows from prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (unspoken intentions, silence as fabric) emerges from recurring images—tapestry, threads, knotted sorrow—and avoids overt moralizing until the penultimate insight ("Intentions, he realized, were not always spoken"). That line edges toward thematic statement but remains grounded in the object. The final image (warm case, cobalt walls) offers resonance, yet the lack of causal pressure earlier prevents the ending from reweighting prior material with cost. The piece gestures toward complexity without dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from Kaelen's work: innovation as "scaffolded future," transformation as "sustained practice," and the kingfisher's patient dive as recurring image. The final paragraph's "pen poised forever above the blank page of tomorrow" reweights the opening's "fresh and empty as the future itself" without stating a moral. One slip: "holding both vision and reality in equal measure" and "ignorance made navigable through shared data" veer toward thematic echo, articulating the thesis rather than letting the image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of stories-as-survival and dust-as-audience emerges from concrete images (luminous ink, shortwave pulse, dust motes). The final image of dust as scribes and the coda "dust to tell stories, one elusive lyric at a time, forever" reweights prior material with intentional repetition. Yet the last two paragraphs edge toward thematic summary ("the story famine would finally end," "stories never truly die") rather than allowing resonance to arise solely from the image, and the pirate broadcast as cipher is introduced and resolved without friction or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (impermanence, illusion of safety, beauty in dissolution) emerges from recurring images (ash, mirage, rocking chair, vanishing point) rather than direct statement. The final scattering of ash into rain and the gallery dissolving into haze offer a non-literal answer to the question of safety. However, the piece leans on prompt-label phrasing ("mirage of safety," "somber marvel," "weaves truth carefully") and abstract philosophizing ("some truths are best left incomplete") in place of earned scene pressure, lowering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from Malach's conflict: truth as craft, method over mythology, the tension between comfort and accuracy. The cog's inscription—"Tempus edax rerum"—and Malach's decision to encode "the math of how cities drown" offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. The final image of the hidden cog, "waiting for someone who could read its math," reweights prior material (three competing narratives, Council executions) with undeniable conceptual cost. No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the ending; the story earns its philosophical stance through specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme—what vanishes leaves traces, harmony is subtraction—emerges organically from the rosette's negative space, the method of subtracting noise, and the braiding metaphor. The ending avoids explicit moralizing; the note "Keep carving the silence" and Marco's return to a velvet library reweight prior material with quiet resonance. However, certain phrases ("unlearning hatred takes longer than any season," "vanishing arts leave traces") edge toward thematic echo, and the final reprise, while earned, is more lyric assertion than a non-literal answer charged by prior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of renewal and memory emerges through imagery (rust to bloom, synaptic plasticity metaphor), but the story leans heavily on prompt-language labels: "gentle rebellion," "informal wisdom," "beauty from ruins" are stated rather than discovered. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "turning rust into bloom, silence into song" and "the memory would live on, one bite at a time." This thematic echo in closure triggers −0.6 to −0.8. The ending offers no ambiguity or non-literal answer; all threads resolve into tidy affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme—wonder as irreplaceable current, routine transformed into revelation—emerges from the honeycomb's charged cells, the riddle's answer ("memory stores honey"), and the drones' failure rooted in efficiency without marvel. The final image resists moralizing: "the darkness tastes like honey now" offers a resonant, sensory answer that reweights prior material without abstraction. The piece commits to its premise that reverence, not technical precision, sustains the bio-electric flowers, and the ending invites reflection on fragility and surprise without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme ("small things sanctify the everyday") is stated repeatedly rather than earned through particulars. The orris root shard is introduced as "a shard of hush" with symbolic weight declared on arrival, then recycled without reweighting. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "every act of noticing can sanctify the world." Epiphanies are asserted ("He realized that the act of noticing...was a prayer") without dramatized struggle or conceptual cost. No non-literal resonance; the ending summarizes rather than charging prior material with a new lens.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—truth is plural, nuance over dogma—emerges organically from the gardener's foxgloves (poison and cure coexist), the council's fatal certainty, and the dome cracking from within. The final image of foxgloves staining the water with "the beautiful, terrible color of possibility" reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the paradox of "animate lifeless" and the structural weakness as "forgotten doubt." Minor slip: "incisively kind" and "crushing clarity" veer toward thematic echo in the penultimate beat, and the line "that no truth was ever singular" edges close to stating the thesis rather than dramatizing it, though the foxglove reprise rescues the closure from sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the texture of missed opportunity is not escaped but carried, like chipped dice in an infinite climb. The daughter's final breath versus the VC meeting seeds regret; the rupture offers return but Elias chooses to carry imperfection forward. The dice—one pristine, one chipped—embody asymmetry and human flaw without overt symbolism. The final image (stepping onto the next solid step, letting the glitch fade) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: acceptance of imperfection over erasure. No thematic echo or moralizing intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—kindness mediated by lost languages, hope as vigil—emerges from concrete particulars (the brush, the phrase, the herb bundle) rather than direct statement. The final image of the vigil and the line "lost languages...lived in the breath of strangers" offer a resonant answer to the central question, though it leans toward assertion rather than non-literal reweighting. Subtext operates in Kael's hiding and Mira's gesture, but the ending paragraphs risk thematic echo ("methodically hopeful," "rouse a little more kindness") that restate rather than deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of preserving cultural memory through ritual emerges clearly, and the initial-loaves custom is a concrete vehicle. However, the ending moralizes overtly: "rescuing dying arts meant not only preserving objects, but also re-igniting the spirit" is thesis statement, not earned resonance. The harp, lens, and loaves recur but feel like symbolic checklist rather than particulars that constrain choice. "Rosewater dread" and "honeyed hope" are labeled oppositions rather than dramatized tensions, and the final paragraph summarizes the theme instead of letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—defiance of fate, finding light within gloom, time as mutable—emerges organically from the clockmaker's counter-clockwise specialty and the hunger stone's reversal. The yoyo and lighthouse beam function as purposeful motifs that shift meaning at the end: the yoyo becomes a key, the beam a monument to defiance. Subtext operates in the keeper's trembling kelp-beard and the clockmaker's thin smile of victory. Yet the final paragraphs tip toward overt thematic statement ("time would never again be a prison," "radiance can be found") rather than letting the image resonate without declaration. The closing lines risk mild sermonizing, slightly diluting the thematic charge earned by the earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (survivors carry knowledge the dead cannot touch) emerges from the entities' confession and the closing image of Mira as "witness," avoiding overt thesis statements. The paradoxical notes and dream-dictionary motifs recur purposefully, and the final line ("only the revived can speak their language") reweights prior material without moralizing. However, the pearl's function—"held the ghost of every scream"—veers toward symbolic convenience introduced late rather than arising from established particulars, and "beautiful and obscene" in the penultimate line edges into abstract label-speak that dilutes the concrete resonance of the clasp's earlier bite.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—transformation of obstacle into instrument—emerges through action and the fractal metaphor. The final image ("the space between forecast and creation") offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the closing two paragraphs state the theme overtly ("turning every obstacle into the next note") rather than trusting the dramatized action, reducing subtext. The fractal motif recurs purposefully but borders on symbolic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—curiosity as catalogued death versus question-as-defiance—emerges from the cracked whistle, pattern-language study, and the watchers' revelation without overt statement. The mother's "key disguised as failure" and Kael's shift from seeking answers to asking questions reweight the premise. The carved question mark and the watcher's raised hand offer a resonant, non-literal answer: questions can be asked even when answers destroy. Sunwashed dread becomes hers to shape, a quiet stance that honors complexity. Minor slip: "chose to speak it anyway" risks thematic echo, though it stays within character idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme emerges through the station/truth parallel and is developed via recurring images (ivy, petals, rails as forgotten testimony). The "pit of lies" versus honest history question is coherent, and the final image of ivy climbing "into the light" attempts conceptual closure. However, the ending states its moral overtly ("the truth…freed," roses as "testament to honest history") rather than trusting image and implication. Emlyn's realization that "the noble lie had become a prison" is told rather than earned through a specific dramatized cost. The piece gestures toward complexity (nobility and cost of the lie) but resolves it tidily without lingering ambiguity or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges from the particulars of wresting stones, placing notes, and mixing mortar with tears, building "interlaced presence" as counterweight to "interlaced absence." The final image—Elias shouldering his pack toward the next district—offers a non-literal answer to abandonment through deliberate, repeated memorial labor. However, the closing lines drift toward overt thesis ("foundations could be repaired with more than stone—that they required the mortar of memory") and the final paragraph's abstraction ("human ambition's sediment, where absences interlace") edges into sermonizing. The piece resists tidy resolution but the prompt-adjacent language ("archaeologist of abandoned dreams") recurs as explicit label rather than fully earned discovery, reducing resonance by ~0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of reclaimed stillness and honest record-keeping emerges through Mira's actions and the library's symbolic restoration. The antique stamp functions as a motif of authenticity. However, the thematic question is answered by convenient resolution—power returns, truth is cataloged—without ambiguity or a non-literal resonance that reweights prior material. The final paragraph ("one stamp at a time," "dappled resolve against the dark") states the theme rather than embodying it through a charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of grief-as-transformation emerges from the polishing and folding motif, and "luminous torment" recurs to charge the mood. Yet the ending offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; the protagonist receives her daughter's breath back in a final lantern and "continues to descend while ascending," a symmetrical loop that restates rather than reprices the premise. The piece gestures toward complexity but lands on tidy fulfillment without ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the geode's hollow core, wedding decorations, perturbation sequences, and the final refracted beam. The ending offers a resonant answer—witnessing transforms unused potential into infinite remembrance—without stating a moral. The phrase "immaculate potential that death had interrupted" and the closing smile deliver non-literal thematic charge. Deduct −0.2 for one Thematic Echo in the penultimate paragraph: "the potential stopped being unused and became, instead, infinitely remembered" over-articulates the thesis where the image alone would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—belonging as a frequency decoded through ancient and modern tools—emerges from concrete actions (pinion sequence, waveform decoding) rather than statement. The "brilliant dimness" motif recurs purposefully, and the final transmission to "lost souls" offers thematic resonance. However, the ending tilts toward overt explanation ("a map for lost souls everywhere," "the universe…was printed in a typeface no one could fully read") rather than letting the image speak. The pilgrim's parallel journey and Elara's perpetual surprise offer ambiguity, but the piece stops short of a non-literal answer with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of memory, forgery, and reclaiming narrative emerges clearly but is over-articulated in the final third: "memory cannot be forged forever," "time, unlike memory, could be mended." The watch hand and driftwood carvings recur but their symbolic weight is declared rather than earned through choice. The thematic question—can truth be recovered after erasure?—is answered by summary ("he decided") rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. Abstraction weakens the ending's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the parapet as neutral ground, the drawer pull as hinge metaphor, and the moon-phase ritual binding kingdoms. "Between apology and forgiveness" frames the piece without becoming a thesis statement. The final image of the empty parapet and distant raven call offers quiet resonance. However, Kael's whispered promise—"each mistake would become a lesson, each lesson a key"—edges toward platitude, and the thematic question lacks a non-literal answer with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—navigation, forgiveness, and alignment of intent with action—emerges from concrete images (utility poles as fallen stars, the spinning needle, the walk toward the cemetery) rather than statement. The sister's line about utility poles losing their ambition reweights the central metaphor at closure without overt moralizing. The final image of stars appearing "finally aligned" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in the compass's warmth, the tide's indifference, and Elias's laugh "catching between a sob and relief." One phrase—"monuments to human persistence"—edges toward thematic declaration but remains grounded in the pole imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges from the empathy/indifference contrast and the "time is a loop" motif (line 33), grounded in the sterile-room frame and bioluminescent-lake imagery. The baseball's signature ("Elias Chronos, Time Wanderer," line 21) and the final whisper (line 35, 41) create a non-literal callback that reweights "time traveler" from artifact to guide. However, the ending moralizes faintly: "even in darkness, light could be kindled" (line 31) and "even in a broken world, small artifacts could hold immense power" (line 38) edge toward thematic summary rather than earned image. The "labyrinth of choices" (lines 9, 16, 30) is invoked but not dramatized—Kael makes one correct turn, undercutting the premise of hard moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme (love transcending death) is stated rather than earned: "love transcended the boundaries of form" and "In change, find constancy; in loss, find a new embrace" read as fortune-cookie aphorisms rather than resonant reconfiguration. The prompt label "cosmic intimacy" appears verbatim ("a cosmic intimacy that needed no words"), reducing thematic work to echo. No concrete particular reweights the abstract claim; the orchard's violet blossoms signal "new magic" without cost or irony. The final paragraph's "double heartbeat" moralizes instead of charging the image with ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (maternal transformation, time as loan rather than loss) emerges through the cracked saucer and hand-tracing imagery. However, the final third lapses into explicit statement: "time is not lost but loaned, that every crack is a choking kind of beauty" and "her repentance was complete" articulate the premise rather than let the image resonate. The saucer and hand motif constrain the ritual's form but the ending over-explains rather than offering a non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of compassion-through-integration emerges organically from Maya's stitching ritual and the realization that "true pacifism wasn't the absence of violence, but the willingness to absorb it entirely into oneself." The photograph tapestry and the dimensional door function as earned symbols rather than imposed allegory. The ending's turn—"dimensions aren't places to escape into, but perspectives to embody"—reweights the premise without moralizing. Minor slip: "shadow work" and "integration" lean toward therapeutic jargon in a few beats, slightly dulling the thematic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of transformation-as-participation emerges organically from the bug collection, the pattern of Kael's unintended consequences, and the final synchronized release. The ending image—bugs rising in a spiral mirroring the planets—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph's explicit articulation ("saving and being saved were the same motion") edges toward thematic statement rather than trusting the dramatized release to carry the weight. The prophecy frame enriches ambiguity (is transformation his or the island's?) but also introduces a safety net that softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges cleanly from the premise: "every lock exists to be opened, every shadow to be read." The recurring images—sundial, quill holder, locks—accumulate meaning and shift function by the end. The final paragraph's "opened tomorrow itself" risks stating the theme directly, but the bronze holder's "smile of complicity" and the phosphor-lit vigil offer resonant particulars. The piece resists a tidy moral by leaving the consequences open—freedom or chaos—and Seren's smile suggests ambiguity without forced balance. Subtext operates in the "winking hush" motif and the irony of the commandant's own tools enabling the breach.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—sacred patterns as witnessed rather than solved, transience versus control—emerges through the dust/rock/eel sequence and the final seated moment. The borrowed-dawn motif bookends the piece and reweights meaning at closure. However, the final paragraph moralizes: "the sacred patterns were not meant to be solved, but to be witnessed" is an explicit thesis statement rather than earned image. Thematic Echo in the penultimate paragraph ("she understood") also dilutes resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—silence, censorship, scars as maps, the persistence of voice—is woven throughout via recurring motifs (masks, scars, cartography, storm). The final image of the poet descending with the sealed envelope attempts Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting the scars as readable terrain rather than wounds. However, the thematic payoff leans on direct statement ("scars were the true cartography of survival," "When masks slip, the truth is a storm you must weather") rather than earning the insight through concrete cost. The piece invites reflection but the ending moralizes more than it resonates through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.6)
    The motif "turning questions into destinations" is repeated five times but never emerges from concrete particulars—it remains an abstract thesis statement rather than a resonant answer discovered through scene work. The needle card, sundial, and mechanical arm recur as potential symbols but do not shift meaning or charge the closure; they simply fulfill their initial function and exit. The final paragraph ("turning waiting into an art, questions into destinations, and chaos into grace") explicitly moralizes rather than letting the image speak, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. No thematic complexity or counter-reading is invited.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of beauty-from-anarchy emerges through concrete library rebuilding (nails from crates, quotes on rust) and the seed-poem metaphor. Subtext operates in "quiet fire," "wildflowers cracking pavement," and the coffee tin's hidden verses. However, the final paragraph moralizes: "the greatest verse was not written in ink but in the quiet act of rebuilding a broken world" states the thesis rather than trusting the image. The molt-as-identity fluidity remains abstract; we never see two selves in contradiction. Resonance is mid-range: the rusted-cathedral image reweights prior material, but the off-page Cora epilogue dilutes present charge.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—steely longing as defiance against fate and the possibility of rewriting broken time—emerges through recurring images (broken clock, flickering compasses, encore as bridge). The final image (compasses at peace, music etched into wind) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "a challenge to the predetermined silence" and "fate had been surprised" nudge close to thematic echo; the piece resists full abstraction but leans on conceptual vocabulary where a sharper particular would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme (the tension between empirical knowing and belief, memory versus dream) emerges organically from Kael's job and the climactic choice to sing. The final image—petal humming a question mark, journal entry "in both numbers and nonsense"—offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, several lines edge toward thesis statement: "empirically whimsical by definition," "luminous doubt," and "the space between what could be proven and what must be believed" risk replacing scene pressure with conceptual gloss. The piece earns its ambiguity but occasionally names it too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of irrevocable loss transforming through ritual patience emerges through the lace technique, pigment color, and tree growth without direct statement. "The color of unspoken apologies...is not meant to be kept, but to diffuse into new growth" offers a resonant image-based answer. The compass shifting from wild spinning to steady pointing and Mara's voice becoming "rhythmically placid" show thematic transformation. However, "some severances heal not by closing, but by growing around the wound" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward overt thesis statement, slightly diluting the earned resonance.

    Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically from Mira's actions and the final image of the left seashell, offering a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme of forgiveness emerges through events and images, such as the reweighting of utility poles as constellations, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Elias's realization, and subtext operates in gestures like the compass pointing inland. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars, avoiding moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the baseball reweighting meaning from key to talisman. Subtext operates in the lake's glow whispering regrets and the time loop signature. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Kael's ascent as keeper. Avoids moralizing, though lines like "not as a hunter, but as its keeper" edge toward explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme of love transcending death emerges through particulars (spices, metamorphosis) without moralizing; ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (beast and spirit bond) that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of unlocking possibility emerges through events and images, not statement, with the sundial and quill holder serving as motifs that reconfigure meaning. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"every lock exists to be opened"—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the winking hush and the bronze gears' complicity, inviting reflection on control and rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from events and images, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer about witnessing patterns rather than solving them. Subtext operates through motifs like the aurora and star dust, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—drama/noise as the medium through which decay becomes visible, and the humility of accepting that—is beautifully embedded in recurring images and in the scientist vs. greenhouse contrast. The butterfly dust, flood marks, and radio dish all serve the same inquiry about what counts as “signal.” However, several lines state the thesis a bit too directly (“The drama was not needless; it was the medium…”; “some questions required not answers but acceptance”), edging toward essayistic moralizing. That explicitness undercuts what would otherwise be an even more resonant, unsummarized ending.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of transforming darkness into light, inheriting and redefining legacy, and finding “purpose in the pauses” recur clearly through the glass, frost, and canyon motifs. However, the story frequently states its thesis outright (“He realized his purpose might lie…,” “silence could be a canvas for creation,” “beacon of truth”), undercutting subtext and leaving little interpretive space. The final images (luminous shard, dew prints, faded frost pattern retained in memory) have the bones of resonant metaphor but are over-explained. Complexity is present but smoothed into a tidy moral rather than allowed to linger ambiguously.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—silence as medium rather than void, beauty persisting under constraint, grief converted into shared language—emerges organically from recurring objects (forks, glass, frost) and Mara’s evolving stance. The silence’s “revaluation” at the end is conceptually rich and consistent with everything before. That said, the prose sometimes states its thesis too explicitly (“The silence was no longer a void; it was a canvas”), undercutting subtlety. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and contemplative rather than wrenching but still resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of duty, grief, rest versus remembrance, and self-authored sentences emerge cleanly from particulars rather than thesis statements: the undertaker’s refusal to abandon the dead becomes the very mechanism of their entrapment. The lighthouse’s repurposed function—from guiding ships to guiding souls—reweights the whole story at the end, especially in the line that the lens was “a sentence” rather than a tool. The notion of “giving rest an address” versus never attaining personal stillness is a rich, non-binary thematic tension that lingers. There is no moralizing; the story invites reflection on the costs of unwavering care without prescribing a stance.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of communal resilience, memory as sustenance, and intergenerational continuity are coherent and well woven through the bell motif and Mara’s initiatives. The final image of the bell as a beacon of hope and Mara’s vow offers a clear thematic answer. However, the piece sometimes drifts into declarative thematic language (“beacon of intergenerational hope,” “amplified quiet”) that edges toward sermonizing rather than trusting scene and image. Complexity is modest; the story largely affirms its thesis without friction or counterpressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core theme—that love is preserved rather than lost, and healing comes from uncovering and releasing what’s stored within—is coherent and tied to recurring images of sparks, breath, and the tear. However, the text repeatedly states its insights outright (“She understood that love unused was love preserved, not lost”; “It was not to find love, but to release it”), drifting toward sermon-like clarity. Subtext exists in the interplay of fog/clarity and transit/stillness, but many beats opt for explicit explanation instead of trusting image and action. The ending resonates, but in a relatively tidy, didactic register rather than with layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of time as organic medium, memory as nourishment, and lineage/recurrence (Elara mirroring her great-grandfather) are woven tightly through bridges, photographs, and sap. The idea that seeking total understanding of time entails becoming substrate for others’ memories is a powerful, implicit answer to the story’s question. Recurring images—the halo fragment, fading photographs, living wood—shift meaning by the end without resorting to moralizing. The thematic network is rich, though emotional complexity (e.g., ambivalence about her own sacrifice) remains more implied than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of resilience, hope under constraint, and liberation despite bondage emerge organically from the seeds, the chain, and the ruined carnival. Recurring images—chains as “ladder” and “map,” seeds as “green rebellion,” ghosts as silent witnesses—build a coherent interpretive layer. Some lines slide toward abstraction or thesis-like phrasing (“His mission: to plant resilience in dry soil”), slightly flattening complexity. Still, the ending’s quiet act of planting and the notion that the vault will await the “next chained soul” offer a resonant, non-literal answer about ongoing, costly hope.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of trust, absence, memory, and the audibility of silence are woven deeply through recurring images (ash, aurora, orchard, shipwrecks, fruit, color-sound). The final realization—that trust doesn’t break but stops transmitting—reweights all prior work with absences and the greenhouse as a “hearing aid for the planet,” creating strong conceptual resonance. Subtext around grief, complicity, and the persistence of damaged systems (the still-growing orchard) enriches the piece beyond its literal stakes. The explicit line “She understood now that trust didn't break—it stopped transmitting” edges toward thesis statement, slightly reducing subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of destiny, perception, and transforming theft into translation are clearly articulated and coherently threaded through motifs of light, portraits, and listening at “destiny’s door.” However, they’re made somewhat explicit in lines like “the portrait thief's true art was not theft but translation,” which flirts with thesis-statement territory. The story leans toward a comforting affirmation—that chasing fleeting light is meaningful—without much complication or moral friction. Resonance comes from lyric recurrence more than from a hard-earned, surprising insight.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of grief, inquiry, and thaw are woven through water, glass, and machinery in a way that mostly trusts images and actions (the leak, the breath trapped in glass, the bookmark-as-entrance). The final understanding—that safe zones for inquiry are about making space, not answers—arises from the ritual with the bowl and bookmark and feels emotionally earned. However, the line that explicitly states this insight veers toward thesis, slightly dulling the otherwise well-managed subtext. Overall resonance is strong and lingers beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of vulnerability-as-power, identity, and chosen kinship are coherent and clearly linked to Mira’s journey. Yet they’re articulated quite explicitly (“Her motivation burned clear: to prove that vulnerability is power,” “the cracks in their armor were not flaws but circuits of strength”), drifting into moralizing rather than letting images and choices carry the insight. The seashell, cast, and synthetic heart offer good raw material for resonance, especially the final image of her tracing the smudged letters and feeling “the ghost of a daughter.” The ending does reweight earlier material, but with a sentimental, tidy tone that blunts complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of silence as narrative, memory preserved in hush, and guidance found in absence are woven through recurring images (“ambered hush,” the trapped voices, the map stitched from silence). The reframing of silence from emptiness to language gives real conceptual resonance. However, lines like “The oracle's gift was not of words but of the spaces between them” verge on explaining the thesis instead of trusting the images. The piece invites reflection but stops short of a fully complex, unsummarized aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of emergent consciousness, second chances, and experience as a symphonic resonance across iterations are woven consistently through the violin motif and looping structure. The final insight—that the origin of thoughts matters less than participation in their ongoing formation—is conceptually satisfying and organically grown from the events. However, some lines edge toward explicit thesis (“not about locating a source but about participating…”) which slightly undercuts subtextual power. The piece invites reflection but veers close to essayistic abstraction in places.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.5)
    The themes of transparency, honesty, and trust are tightly woven with the lens and crystal motifs, yielding a coherent conceptual throughline. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis outright (“transparency could free even the quietest registrar,” “transparency is the key to freeing oneself from doubt”), drifting into moralizing rather than letting subtext carry the weight. Complexity is low; there’s little ambiguity or counter-pressure to complicate “honesty = good.” The result is thematically clear but didactic and somewhat platitudinous.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of measurable luck versus intention, and of the bond between caretaker and cared-for, are clear and coherently tied to the marbles and the garden’s response. However, they are often delivered as direct assertions (“the true measure of luck was not in numbers…,” “gardens know their gardeners”), drifting into didactic statement rather than emergent subtext. The piece opts for a neat moral resolution: deception is confessed, everyone understands, and the world’s lesson is spelled out without much ambiguity or counter-pressure. This undercuts the potential for a more layered exploration of exploitation, mortality, or mechanized luck.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of sideways time, marginal knowledge, and how institutions dismiss fragile, nonconforming truths are woven through recurring motifs (“ghosts,” frost-branching time, “the universe pretending once more to be simple and sequential”). The final image—Kael holding a secret the universe “whispered to those patient enough to listen between the lines”—nicely reweights the earlier scientific skepticism and her obliging persona. The “proving that time moves sideways” line edges close to thesis-statement territory but is grounded in scene stakes rather than pure abstraction. Overall, the piece invites reflection without sliding into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of memory versus release, art born from decay, and listening to absence emerge organically from Mara’s actions and the house’s condition. The “in between spaces” motif shifts meaning from mere ruins to temporal pockets and finally to creative possibility, giving the ending conceptual weight. The diva’s desire to be remembered, not freed, re-weights the haunting in a satisfying way without devolving into moralizing. A touch more ambiguity about the ethics of using the dead as muse could add further complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of measurement, truth, guilt, and forgiveness are woven through recurring images (scales, instruments, margins, aurora) in a coherent way, and the closing transformation of “weight” from physical to emotional is satisfying. However, the story leans into explicit moralizing lines (“In the end, the weight of a swallowed truth is measured not in mass…”) that state its thesis rather than trusting subtext and image. This directness blunts potential ambiguity and complexity around her choice to swallow the warning and what forgiveness actually costs. The resonance is genuine but somewhat didactic at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of the mass of truth, the toxicity of silence, and industrial sacrifice of workers to machinery emerge clearly from events and images (the locked night shift, beads-as-souls, the wheel as lock/key). The repetition of “weight,” “mass,” and “swallowed truth” gives the piece a cohesive conceptual spine and leads to a genuine conceptual repricing of confession at the end. However, the radio psychic’s explicit statements (“truth had mass,” “the weight of truth could be measured…”) and the closing generalization (“Silence was heavier than fire…”) lapse into near-moralizing, blunting subtext that has already been earned visually. The complexity of guilt—personal vs. systemic—could be sharpened with fewer direct thematic declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of impermanence, nonjudgmental witnessing, and preservation-through-attention emerge clearly from recurring images of crumbling peace, origami folds, and regenerative silence. The reweighting—“to burrow is to preserve” and “her role was not to halt decay but to accompany it”—offers a coherent, resonant answer to the initial problem. However, some lines verge on explicit thesis statements rather than letting implication do the work (“She realized that the swan's folds held not just a passage, but a lesson”). The piece succeeds thematically but might benefit from more trust in image over explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, wonder, intergenerational connection, and the permeability between presence and absence are organically embedded in the eclipse/music ritual and the “curl of wonder” image. The final realization that “wonder didn’t end when memory faded, it simply changed form, became shared, became music” nicely reframes the earlier images. That said, the last paragraphs lean into explicit statement and near-moralizing, explaining what the story already shows and slightly dulling the subtextual charge. The piece still resonates, but a lighter touch on the articulated insights would let the images carry more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, displacement, and the migration of dreams from mind to matter are finely woven through recurring images (dragons, tapestry, walls, fire, grain → stories). The Displacement and loss of dreaming resonate as more than lore; they underwrite questions about what survives of human interiority when our imaginative life is severed. The final conceptual turn—that walls bank the “last currents of human imagination” and Elias becomes part of that archive—reconfigures the whole piece without moralizing. A touch less explanatory phrasing (“not metaphor but migration”) and more reliance on pure image could elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—agency versus fate, “open secrets,” and transposing one’s life from passenger to pilot—emerges organically from fortunes, espionage microdots, and the lighthouse metaphor. The idea that you don’t flee the music but “orchestrate it by directing flow” is dramatized rather than preached, and the final self-fortune reweights everything before it. The open-secret motif (locals, Cold War past, Tomás’s silent acknowledgment) adds subtext about community complicity and privacy. There’s a hint of aphoristic phrasing, but it’s grounded enough in concrete action to avoid sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme is strongly woven through action: silence as wound versus true quiet, faith as a lattice of assumptions, and paradox as a weapon against certainty. Rhetorical questions about the bell, prayer, and listening embody the story’s thematic concerns instead of merely stating them, and the entity literally feeds on certainty, making the theology material. The ending’s image—that the silence itself has been “taught to speak in paradox” and the monks’ certainties are “subtly shaken”—offers a non-didactic, resonant answer to the story’s questions. A few lines edge close to expository interpretation (“a wound dressed in quiet”), but they remain anchored in specific stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres around transmuting nostalgia and silence into present-tense creation: the nautilus as mapped memory, the mirrored horizon, and the “unheard symphonies” of ice all unify this. The final reconfiguration—her homesickness resolving into a role that conducts past into future—is clear and emotionally resonant. Some late lines (“The chronologically homesick writer had found her place in the present…”) drift toward explicit thesis, slightly flattening the subtext. Even so, the imagery-based argument about time, art, and quiet lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of self as maze, recursion, surrender vs. mastery, and identity across timelines are deeply woven through recurring images (labyrinth, tablet, drop/ripple, procedural generation). The final reframing—"The labyrinth of self remained, but she was no longer trapped within it—she had become its architect"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior material. There is some on-the-nose abstraction ("To conquer the self...was to accept that no center existed") that edges toward thesis, but it doesn’t fully collapse into moralizing. The thematic integration with structure and imagery is strong enough for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of silence as its own medium, disability as bridge rather than lack, and the translation of sound into touch emerge organically from the events. Motifs like “filament of hush,” mirrored hush, and turning seasons give the piece a coherent conceptual spine. The final paragraphs, however, verge on explicit thesis-stating (“Her deafness became a bridge, not a barrier…”) rather than trusting the imagery and scene to carry the insight. The resonance is genuine but slightly over-articulated, reducing ambiguity and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of truth vs. secrecy, integrity in solitude, and the ethics of observation emerge naturally from Elias’s vocation and situation. The pigeon and storm recur in a thematically coherent way, culminating in the rain “washing away the dust of doubt,” which works as a resonant image. However, several lines—“a testament to truth,” “protect the fragile line between fact and fiction,” “nurtured his integrity”—state the theme a bit too baldly. This explicitness flattens what could otherwise linger more ambiguously and powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—grief as an embodied archive, memory as scent, extinction as paused through preservation—emerges strongly from the interplay of objects, setting, and her final redefinition of her work. The image of “grief wasn't a void but concentration, like perfume growing stronger when contained” is thematically rich and earned by prior particulars. However, the story repeatedly articulates its own thesis in near-essayistic lines (“She understood why some smells trigger tears: they are the only language the past speaks directly to the body.”; “grief was love with nowhere left to grow.”), which blunts subtext and edges toward moralizing. The resonance is real, but a lighter touch on explicit statement would heighten it.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of time as braid/weave, impossible choices, and the ethics of how we treat past and future are coherent and consistent, with rope and grotto doing real thematic work. However, the story often states its theses directly (“time was not a line but a weave, each thread a choice”) instead of letting subtext arise purely from images and actions. The ending does offer a resonant, non-literal answer—choosing ongoing, frayed openness over closure—but the resonance is slightly dulled by repetition and near-platitudinous formulations. Ambiguity of rightness remains, which is a strength.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of finding beauty in the unfinished, storytelling as resurrection, and hope persisting after ecological catastrophe are coherent and organically tied to fire, music, and the bowl. However, they are often stated rather than fully left to subtext (“She sees that beauty lives in the unfinished,” “the story is never truly over”), which flattens some potential resonance. The rainforest’s destruction and chronic hush provide a strong backdrop that could support darker ambiguities than the largely affirmative arc allows. The final image does reweight prior material, but leans toward gentle moralizing rather than complex aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of authenticity versus artifice, transactional empathy, and the ethics of emotional engineering are strong and coherent. Recurring images—half-truths, static, amber light—do real work in supporting those ideas. However, the story leans into explicit statement (“My purpose: to fuse insight with empathy, one borrowed feeling at a time”) often enough that subtext and image have less room to breathe. The result is resonant but a bit over-articulated for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.5)
    The core theme—that compassion for the unnoticed can ripple outward and return in “cycles of compassion”—is coherent and well-aligned with the plot’s beats. However, the story over-explains its message, especially in the closing paragraphs (“She realized that compassion, once given, returns in unexpected ways…”), drifting into explicit moralizing rather than letting images and actions carry the weight. Subtext is minimal; almost every gesture is already labeled in thematic terms. The piece feels sincere but thematically blunt and somewhat sentimental by top-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Belonging, language, and “belonging-in-difference” are woven tightly through recurring motifs of glass, song, and lineage; the final understanding that kinship is “the dedication of one stranger to another’s ghosts” is earned by the search. The arbor and Dusk’s tag elegantly embody the last grammar of connection, reweighting everything before. That said, a few lines verge on explicit moralizing (“He had come seeking community and found instead the courage to build it”), which slightly undercuts the otherwise powerful subtextual work. The piece still leaves a resonant, non-tidy sense of what community might cost and require.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of time, memory, preservation vs. change, and the artist becoming part of the artifact accrue organically through motifs: the pendant, canals of dreams, echoes as fossils, and the final blank folio. The conceptual realization (“to sculpt time itself was to become part of the illustration”) borders on explicit statement but is well-earned by prior images and does not read as tacked-on moralizing. The ending offers a resonant answer: true preservation demands self-surrender and transformation, which reweights everything from the grandmother’s charge to the city’s existence on the giant’s brow. Some emotional ambiguity—joy vs. terror in that transformation—could deepen the subtext further.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    The thematic spine—ambiguous loss, the urge to quantify emotion, and the persistence of love—is well seeded in concrete images like the eyes, the mosaic, and the doorway. However, the story repeatedly states its ideas (“mathematics of emotion,” “ambiguous loss,” “buried optimism”) and then explicitly answers them (“love persists, even when the formula is unclear”), undercutting subtext. The strongest moments of theme are imagistic—the half-open doorway, the eyes as witnesses, birdsong at dawn—but these are somewhat drowned by overt moralizing. Greater trust in implication over declaration would lift this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of visibility, kindness, and the quiet labor of caretaking emerge organically from Mara’s behavior and the breadcrumb motif, without overt moralizing. Sense memory links past and present care work (the 1957 storyteller, Mara, the boy) into a lineage of unseen nurturers, which reweights the final image of her “methodical heart” keeping time with his words. The ending’s assertion that “Either outcome was visibility” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s core question about being seen. Complexity is present—her continued loneliness is the price—but the ambiguity is gentle rather than deeply fraught, which keeps it slightly below the very highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of resilience, surrender, and growth-through-chaos are coherent and well woven through recurring images (storms, trellis, linden leaf). The final recognition—that reconstruction is about “allowing growth to find its own structure” and her heart becoming a “mossy trellis after rain”—offers a clear thematic cadence. However, the piece repeatedly states its insights directly, edging into moralizing summary (“Her study…had taught her that the most profound changes often happen in quiet surrender”), which flattens subtext. The complexity of the theme is somewhat reduced to a tidy lesson rather than left to fully resonate in implication.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ideas of memory, art as reclamation, continuity after catastrophe, and “convergence” of past/present are coherent and effectively braided through brooch, island, and portrait. The final realization that insomnia was a form of listening and that the convergence is a “continuous seam” offers a resonant answer to the premise. However, theme is often articulated directly (“weight of meaning threshed from the chaff of war,” “language she was just learning to read”) rather than fully left to images and action. This explicitness blunts some potential subtlety and lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of control vs surrender, predictability vs “steadily unpredictable” magic, and the unintended consequences of magnifying “everyday magic” emerge organically from Lira’s failed clairvoyance and final acceptance. The pearl and cave function as recurring images that shift in meaning from tools of control to vessels for wild forces. The line “And the story itself became a note in the grand symphony” tips into meta-commentary that slightly flattens the resonance by explaining what the images already imply. The piece leaves a thoughtful aftertaste but verges on neatness rather than fully embracing ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of silence/absence as a form of speech and meaning is woven tightly through object (valve), method (staggered intervals), and setting (mist, blank ivory stones), culminating in the line about “cartography of silence.” The story’s final images—silence as a “key,” the harbor as sanctuary for journeys “between what could be spoken”—reprice earlier motifs with real resonance. However, the text occasionally edges into explicit thesis statements (“Her gift was never the recovery of sound…”) that slightly undercut subtextual power. Despite that, the conceptual reframing of exile feels earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of absence, repression, and the courage to confront unspoken truths are woven elegantly through images of maps of what’s missing and structures built from swallowed words. The idea that she’s been mapping absences all along and is now invited to chart the city’s buried honesty offers a resonant, non-didactic thematic click. The final lines risk mild explicitness (“mapped not in ink but in courage”), but they still arise from concrete experience rather than sermonizing. The relatively low on-page cost keeps the thematic impact more lyrical than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of grief, memory, and the tension between skepticism and felt truth are coherent and supported by the whale-song and starlight imagery. However, the piece undercuts some of its potential subtlety with explicit moralizing (“some truths are felt, not proven”) and repeated thesis-like statements about remembrance and connection. The imagery has resonance, but the emotional arc lands in a tidy, almost didactic way rather than leaving a complex aftertaste. Subtext exists but is often overshadowed by direct thematic articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of rebellion against the “tyranny of continuation” and the value of uncertainty over eternal sameness is woven tightly through the mutiny, the amulet’s memory of death, and Althea’s final act. Spatial mutiny becomes a rich metaphor for rejecting immortal stasis, and the ending’s “ignorance was the most beautiful farewell” reweights everything that came before. At times the language edges toward explicit thesis (“the endless parade of identical moments”), but it still arises from situation rather than didactic aside. The final conceptual repricing of immortality versus not-knowing has real resonance without collapsing into a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of fairness, survival, and the embalmment of truth are coherently developed through recurring images (embalming fluid, ledger numbers, “mathematics of equivalency”). The final reweighting—fairness as a ratio that keeps a soul intact, seven lies as the price of freedom—offers a resonant, morally ambiguous answer to the opening question. However, several thematic statements are delivered in explicit thesis form (“political asylum was purchasing the right to exist”; “honesty wasn’t a virtue but a luxury”), edging into didactic summary rather than letting subtext fully carry the load. The piece still invites reflection, but a lighter touch would heighten literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, fabrication, and art as resistance to erasure are woven cleanly through motifs of “invented histories,” spectral light, and the silent town as blank canvas. The notion that artificial chronicles can become the only “voices left” carries a strong, earned conceptual resonance. The final image—her tome as “silent guardian” while the hum fades—reweights the whole ritual as simultaneously necessary and troubling. It just stops shy of a deeper complication of her project (e.g., what is lost or falsified) that could add another layer of ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—erased identity, the persistence and toxicity of unacknowledged histories, memory as a textured, residually physical thing—is rich and coherent, emerging through containers, paperwork, poison, and tides. The poison label, death certificate, and collected confessions nicely braid personal erasure with institutional violence. However, the prose occasionally edges into overt thesis, especially when it states “The texture of memory, he decides, is…” and similar lines that articulate what the imagery already conveys. The ending still leaves a resonant afterimage, but a touch more restraint in explicitly naming insights would strengthen its literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of listening, truth as an ephemeral compass, and stories’ dependence on readers are coherent and recur through seashell, cello, and observatory imagery. The final realization that “the riddle was the reader, and the reader was always becoming” reweights prior material conceptually. However, theme is often stated outright in thesis-like lines (“The universal riddle… asked not ‘why do we end?’ but…”), which undercuts subtext and lets commentary lead action. The insights feel genuine but occasionally slide toward essayistic explanation rather than arising purely from dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematic threads of gentrification, memory, and resistance through communal art are well-integrated, with the stone chip and phoenix mural elegantly echoing ideas of fragmentation and rebirth. The use of children as readers of the code adds subtext about who inherits and preserves culture. The ending image reweights prior material into a quiet but resonant stance of organized, collective defiance without sliding into overt moralizing. Still, the moral ambiguity of Mira’s corporate ties is raised more than it is deeply tested, leaving some thematic potential untapped.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of impermanence versus technological preservation accrue naturally from particulars: the ephemeral bloom, the flare’s artificial daylight, the stored digital image, the “world built by human hands” underfoot. The ending’s recognition that tools can outlast darkness but not prevent loss offers a coherent, resonant answer to the story’s implicit question. However, some late lines (“a fragile reminder of what the universe could not preserve,” “space age had given her tools… yet it could not preserve…”) border on explicit thesis statements, slightly flattening subtext. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t fully escape familiar formulations about transience.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of navigation, perception versus seeing, and “listening to what’s broken” recur through the drone, the ship, and Miren’s craft in a satisfying pattern. The final lines—“I don’t see, I interpret… The light tells stories, but only if you listen for what distorts it”—provide an earned conceptual answer that reweights prior details. Some of this borders on thesis-statement territory, tipping toward explicitness rather than letting subtext entirely carry the load. Nonetheless, the imagery of maps, compasses, and refraction gives the piece a coherent, resonant thematic spine.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of beginnings vs. endings, language of water, and maps as living rather than static are strongly woven through recurring images (phrasebook, condensation, “Nishan,” and the repeated line “To find where the rivers begin…”). The final conceptual flip—“to become the source” and “maps must be rewritten by those who know endings are beginnings reversed”—reweights the whole story convincingly. That said, the thematic spine is at times a bit on-the-nose; several lines verge on aphorism, telling us the thesis rather than leaving it fully in subtext. The piece still achieves solid resonance, just shy of the most effortless-feeling depth.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of balance between decay and persistence, memory as architecture, and the power of small repeated acts over time are woven deeply into the premise and imagery. The “ghost town revival” is not just plot but a meditation on pattern versus entropy—“persistence of pattern over entropy” is a bit explicit but still anchored in the concrete ritual. The ending’s shift from a death-hum to “wild hush of possibility” offers a resonant, non-literal answer: salvation is incremental, costly, and never fully secure. Slightly more dramatized ambivalence or visible emotional cost for Kael could elevate the thematic complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of ephemerality, sacrifice, and the paradox of capturing the ungraspable are woven through action (becoming the hush) and image (a “perfect sphere of quiet” touching memories). The story’s final conceptual turn—that some things can be preserved only as absence—is strong and organically earned. However, a few late sentences edge toward explicit thesis (“The ephemeral, once harnessed, had become eternal in the only way it could”), slightly reducing the power of implication. Overall, the piece still invites reflection beyond the plot without collapsing into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of truth versus lie, inheritance of guilt, and the desire for silence in a world of traumatic echoes are well-integrated through the lighthouse, lattice, and “chasing hush” motif. The boy’s attempt to house truth inside a device built for confession, and to make “the impossibility of his silence” the lasting story, offers a genuine conceptual repricing at the end. The piece resists a tidy moral; it’s unclear whether his act is redemptive, evasive, or both, which is to its credit. Some thematic phrasing edges toward self-conscious repetition, but most resonance comes from image rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of love as both poison and cure, debts across lifetimes, and the bittersweet nature of sacrifice emerge organically from the bead, the ghost bride, and the orchard’s rebirth. The closing images—bead pulsing as a reminder, ghost’s silhouette glimpsed in the periphery—carry genuine resonance. However, several lines tip into explicit thesis-stating (“Elara knew that each time the bead pulsed, it was a reminder that love could be both poison and cure,” “warning them that the ghost bride's love was both a blessing and a curse”), which flattens subtext into moral. With slightly more trust in image over explanation, this could rise higher.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of “ruin to reverence,” broken precedents, and hope that reimagines failure are coherently threaded through nets, labyrinth, and orchids. The final image of the canyon “holding both the memory of broken nets and the luminous thread of hope” effectively reframes the entire story. Yet the thematic language is often explicitly stated (“a path from ruin to reverence,” “offering solace to all who dared to dream”), edging toward sermon rather than letting images do the work. Subtext exists, but the piece leans on declared meaning more than a top-tier literary venue would tolerate.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of interrupted journeys, memory as a “living archive,” and broken things made whole are strongly woven through sundial, orchard, and diaspora. However, several sentences explicitly explain the theme (“She realized that restoring the sundial was not about fixing a broken object…”) rather than letting image and action carry it, edging toward mild didacticism. The resonance is real and coherent, especially in the final image of a journey “not a destination but a continuous unfolding,” but it feels a bit tidy given the scale of war and exile invoked. With the relatively low on-page pressure, the thematic afterglow is more gentle than haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of analog resistance, memory versus digitization, and “meaning in the margins” are woven through concrete motifs—chalk, margins, surface mail, the arcade, the clipboard—rather than bolted on. The contrast between the Collective’s totalizing data regime and the fragile, embodied acts of chalk and letters lands with emotional and conceptual clarity. A few lines approach thesis-statement territory, but remain anchored in image (“The future would forget, but the margins would remember”). The final conceptual repricing of “margins” as a site of survival and identity is resonant and earned, if a touch on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of unheard stories, the cost of silence, and hidden wisdom are woven consistently through recurring images (leaves as whispers, echoed silence, the candle’s voice, secret embroidery). The final promise—“I will not let your stories fade”—is on-the-nose but still earns some weight from the preceding imagery and choices. The piece avoids sermonizing, letting the act of leaving to warn others embody the stance against erasure. It invites reflection on who listens in times of political danger, though with relatively little moral complexity or counter-pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of grief, apology as listening rather than speaking, and the transformation of unsent regret into communal song are woven through concrete images (letters, gargoyle shard, storm, tide). The condensation message states the thematic thesis a little explicitly, but it’s embodied as a spirit-medium communication rather than authorial moralizing, which keeps it from feeling didactic. The final image of the apology living in the mangrove song reweights prior material without spelling out a moral and carries a lingering sense of cost and tenderness. The tension between wanting to undo the past and accepting that the only change possible is in one’s own stance is handled with nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: translation as bearing unspeakable weight, shared anxieties across militants, governments, children, and family, and the danger of becoming “archipelagos” of isolation. The coral, cast, and atrium recur with evolving meaning, culminating in a resonant final repricing of his daughter’s marks from abandonment to mutual keeping. The elders’ wound/graft lesson and lines like “pain is just information the body doesn’t yet understand” flirt with thesis-statement territory but are grounded enough in scene and image to avoid sermonizing. The ending offers a quiet, non-literal answer—connection persisting amid damage—without collapsing into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of art as communal memory, resilience in ruined spaces, and joy as something recreated rather than recalled are coherent and supported by recurring images (fog vs. light, orchard vs. ruin, film as bridge). However, the prose occasionally drifts into near-platitude or explicit statement (“not an escape, but a doorway,” “a testament to resilience and beauty”), which flattens complexity. The ending does offer a resonant answer—joy becomes shared, not private—but with a bit too much tidy reassurance and not quite enough friction or ambiguity. Still, the thematic throughline is clear and emotionally effective.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of curiosity vs. certainty, restoration vs. transformation, and nested realities are strongly woven through mirrors, layers, echoes, and the nickel’s “map of nested possibilities.” The final realization—that the true restoration is of wonder—does conceptually reframe everything that comes before. Yet the text leans into explicit thesis statements (“certainty is a surface that can be bewitched into curiosity,” “the true restoration was not of paint but of wonder”) that edge toward essayistic moralizing. This directness blunts subtext and keeps the thematic effect from feeling wholly earned through image and action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of commodified cognition versus unquantifiable, wild thought are woven tightly through insects, roots, and the greenhouse’s “living chaos,” culminating in the defiant assertion that “thoughts are territories, not commodities.” The natural world as an unreadable grammar of resistance is an organic extension of events—pollen packets, bees, and ladybugs are not just symbols but working tools of subversion. Some lines verge on thesis-statement explicitness, especially the manifesto-like vow at the end, slightly flattening what could be a more oblique resonance. Still, the final seed-rattle image conceptually reprices the regime’s power in a satisfying way that lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of transforming pain into beauty, the endurance of love across vast distances, and the fragility-but-possibility of peace are coherent and woven through recurring motifs (photosynthesis metaphor, blossoms, postcard, reef-shadow joy). The final reweighting—her legacy as light rather than sleeplessness—is emotionally resonant and conceptually clear. That said, the text occasionally edges toward explicit thesis statements (“pain could indeed be photosynthesized into beauty”), reducing subtextive power. The moral/emotional argument feels sincere but somewhat smoothed, with limited counter-pressure or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, irretrievable loss, and the beauty of imperfection emerge coherently through the cracked chime and Lyra’s work. Recurring images (glass orchids, opal library, foxglove regret) do evolve in meaning, culminating in the idea that preservation is a “quiet defiance” rather than salvation. However, the piece repeatedly states its insights explicitly (“She knew that…”, “She understood that…”) instead of trusting the images, edging toward mild didacticism. The thematic question is rich, but more subtext and less paraphrased wisdom would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of language as action, promises as structures of reality, and trust as a co-created grammar emerge organically from the Jorvik mechanic and the academic relationship. The “symphonies of truth” move from speculative idea to emotional metaphor, reweighted at the end when they no longer need ink to remain permanent, which offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to the story’s question about what really binds people. Kess’s admission—fear that their work was “real enough to lose”—nicely complicates the dynamic between intellectual rigor and emotional cowardice. A few lines verge on overt statement (“In the end, it wasn’t the ink or the extinct words that mattered most”), nudging toward essayistic clarity rather than trusting the images to do that work.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of reconciling past and future, reading compassion out of stone and mechanism, and treating heritage as a living system rather than a static relic are coherent and well-seeded (the chain, the “breath,” the flood as story). The idea of “encrypted compassion” has conceptual charm and is tied to specific acts (decoding, redesigning the gates), not only commentary. Yet the final paragraphs slide into explicit moralizing (“encrypted compassion was not a hidden code, but a shared heartbeat,” “testament to the power of measured, compassionate change”), which undercuts the otherwise earned resonance. Ambiguity and moral tension around profit vs. reverence are smoothed over rather than left provocatively live.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, self-authored history, trust, and the fragility of communication are woven through recurring objects (meteorite, paper notes, ledger, dust, pigeons). The ending images—final pigeon, glowing chip, dust constellations—reweight these motifs into a coherent meditation on preserving and transforming loss. However, lines like “The story of his life rewrote itself, a paper trail of trust and song” edge toward explicit thesis, slightly flattening subtext. The resonance lingers, but some thematic statements could be left more in image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme (reverence for distance, intention, and thresholds) is coherent and well-integrated with the maze, father’s teaching, and repeated crossings. However, the piece leans into explicit statement—“I understand that thresholds are sacred because they demand respect for the distance traveled”—rather than letting images fully carry the insight. The motifs (distances, thresholds, hush, maze) resonate but are interpreted for the reader, blunting subtext. The result is thoughtful but somewhat didactic rather than obliquely haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of belonging as resonance and dissolution of the self into a larger pattern are tightly woven through city layout, microbes, the feather, and Iyana’s exile. The final realization—that belonging is a waveform you match—is conceptually strong and clearly earned by her pattern-reading. That insight, however, is articulated a bit too explicitly in abstract language, edging toward thesis-statement rather than leaving more room for subtext. Still, the closing images (feather returned, luminous welcome) deliver genuine emotional and conceptual aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, loss, transformation, and the idea that “missing pieces were not lost but merely transformed” are well-seeded through motifs of foam, glass, seeds, and paths. The sea as a vast recollection that reclaims and returns memory is a strong, resonant idea, and the cheerful gloom at the end captures a complex emotional note. But the story too often states its themes outright—“She knew now that every path that disappears…”—rather than trusting images and implication, which dulls subtext. The result is moving but slightly didactic, undercutting the lingering ambiguity elite venues tend to favor.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of control vs. chaos, engineered “magic,” and the thin line between art and manipulation are woven organically through the chessboard mapping, the term “calculated wilderness,” and the final hint that randomness pushes back. The story avoids outright moralizing, allowing readers to inhabit the tension between the beauty of Ezra’s designs and their quiet coerciveness. The closing image of the bishop’s warmth reweights the premise effectively, suggesting that his deterministic worldview is incomplete. A slight on-the-nose tendency in phrasing (“magic could be reverse-engineered,” explicit motivation statement) keeps it just shy of top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of elective exile, memory as resistance, and choosing one’s own anchors emerge coherently through recurring images (garden, dust, verse on skin). However, the story repeatedly states its theses outright—e.g., “She had learned that to fledge is not to flee, but to find the courage to be anchored by choice”—rather than allowing them to remain subtextual. This didactic tilt blunts what could be a more haunting, open-ended resonance. The final image has power, but its emotional and conceptual aftereffect is somewhat overexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of mundane-as-prism, clarity versus complexity, and liminal reckoning between night and day are coherent and recur through well-chosen images. The pond rings, glasswork, and prism atrium form a solid thematic network. But the story frequently states its thesis outright (“the mundane was not a prison but a prism,” “the secret to a perfect pane was not in the cutting, but in the seeing”), which tips into didacticism and undercuts subtext. The ending resonates softly but leans heavily on articulated wisdom rather than letting images fully carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of survival-as-betrayal, witness versus justification, and “how to survive surviving” are powerful and organically tied to her vocation and scarred body. The porcelain box, stones, and celestial dance motifs all shift meaning by the end, supporting a conceptual repricing of her guilt into service. However, several lines state theme in near-essay form (“Enlightenment didn’t come from answers…,” “what she offered wasn’t explanation, but embodiment”), slightly undercutting the purely emergent feel. The ending still lands with emotional and conceptual resonance, but the moral is occasionally more told than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    The thematic thread—hope as quantifiable, non-naive, and requiring ongoing recalibration against entropy—is unusually coherent, unfolding through concrete methods (gauges, balloons, shells) instead of pure abstraction. Recurring motifs (patterns, resonance, “transfusions”) are reweighted by the ending’s idea that worlds must learn to self-generate lift. However, lines like “had proven that hope was neither naive nor abstract” verge on thesis-statement, slightly flattening subtext into statement. Even so, the piece leaves a strong conceptual afterimage about maintenance, not miracle, as the true work of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—how legacy’s burden can shift from paralyzing guilt to active responsibility—is coherent and well-rooted in the premises of echo-cartography and climate collapse. Recurring motifs (walls’ dreams, the diaries, the negative) support this reweighting. However, the story increasingly explains its own thesis in abstract terms (“Legacy’s burden was not to mourn what was lost but to rebuild what was possible”), tipping into overt moralizing in the final third. That explicitness blunts complexity and subtext just enough to hold the piece below a higher literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of possibility versus mere reflection, encoded hope in children’s culture, and liminal spaces where memory and potential briefly open are coherently developed through recurrent images (mirrors, prisms, lullaby, borrowed heartbeat). The final movements, with children unknowingly singing the code and the mirrors “ever listening,” neatly reweight earlier details without sliding into overt moralizing. The piece invites reflection on how small, unnoticed rituals can preserve alternative possibilities within a rigid world. Some thematic statements about mirrors’ stubbornness verge on explanatory, but they don’t overwhelm the scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of redemption, collective responsibility, and the frail yet necessary belief in peace are coherent and recur in the terrace, celestial imagery, and the shared touch on the clipboard. However, they are often articulated in overt thesis-like lines (“He understood that the ritual's significance was not in the magic of the stones…,” “The price of redemption, he realized…”) rather than allowed to emerge from implication. This direct moralizing flattens potential ambiguity and subtext, especially in the final third. The resonance is genuine but feels somewhat pre-digested.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of destruction intertwined with preservation, ethical laundering via philanthropy, and the commodification of loss are coherently threaded through the echo, drought, museum, and PR machinery. The recurring contrast between what’s preserved (a single note) and what’s erased (river, villages, cracks) generates genuine resonance. Some lines veer toward direct statement (“Press releases praised his generosity, never mentioning the drought’s heavy hand”), edging into mild didacticism. Still, the closing emphasis on legend versus buried cost and “fractured grace” offers a nuanced, lingering moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of conformity vs individuality, the power of suppressed voices, and the liminal “between sigh and smile” are coherently developed through recurring images and the harvest of echoes. The final movement—Elara ceding the sanctuary to the people and teaching them to add their own echoes—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial premise. However, the story sometimes states its thesis too directly (“turning oppression into liberation,” “The bodily poetic nature of her dance had been not just art, but translation”), slipping toward essayistic explanation rather than trusting implication. This slight moralizing/explicatory bent reduces the subtlety expected at the highest literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story’s interrogation of narrative ethics and self-justifying stories is compelling and well-embodied in the reversed timelines and patrons’ realizations. Subtext about complicity, agency, and the stories we tell to live comes through images like the stick as “instrument of subversion” and the meteor hush, which reweight prior events at the end. However, the theme is occasionally over-explicit (“This was the core he sought: that every story is a series of erasures…”), tipping into thesis-statement territory rather than trusting the dramatization. The ending’s ambiguity—meteor or “just another story”—nicely reinforces the central question without over-resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—ecological extinction, overlooked histories, and the dignity of impermanent memorials—is woven throughout via recurring motifs (interrupted cadence, temporary structures, knots, flyway maps). The final image of an unresolved chord carried into “emptiness” reweights the entire piece as a meditation on cost that cannot be repaid and memory that survives only as pattern and absence. Occasionally, the text leans toward explicit thesis (“As an esoteric realist, she knew the mathematics of loss”), edging into commentary rather than pure dramatization. Still, the work largely earns its insights through concrete ritual and image rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of absence defining form, preservation vs perfection, and listening as an ethical act are tightly woven through images of bells, holes, names, and ice. The transformation of her craft from casting bronze to “casting memory” offers a strong, resonant answer to the story’s question about what truly endures. Yet the text sometimes states its theses directly (“preservation wasn't about perfect replication, but about listening and letting go”; “This was her true calling”), which tips toward sermonizing and reduces ambiguity. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but a bit too neatly framed.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of control vs. wilderness, pattern vs. transcendence, and directives designed to self-decay are well woven into images like the Archive, vines, storm, and laughing fox. The final realization—that the bunker was a seed-shell and that true freedom lies in abandoning the need to foresee—offers a satisfying conceptual answer to the story’s question. That said, several lines state theme directly (“The Archive was a repository of patterns, but patterns were meant to be broken,” “The storm isn't destruction; it is transcendence”), shading into thesis rather than subtext. This explicitness blunts what could otherwise be a more haunting, open-ended resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The thematic throughline—devotion redirected from deity to pattern, from worship to acknowledgment of cosmic indifference—is strong and organically tied to Kael’s work with the tile. Recurrent motifs (frugality, schematic devotions, regimes rising and falling, patterns persisting) are reweighted effectively in the final image of banners unfurling over an emptied, quietly consecrated palace. There is some explicit statement of thesis (“The covenant was sealed not in blood or belief, but in… certainty that patterns persist…”), which slightly undercuts the otherwise elegant subtext. Still, the ending offers a clear conceptual repricing of “covenant” and “devotion” that lingers beyond the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of forgiveness, memory, and cyclical grace emerge organically from the pin’s broken/whole states and the sanctuary’s shifting architecture. The image of resentment as a self-chosen cage is strong and the recurring object carries real thematic weight. However, the closing explanation—“her scheme was simply this: to teach that the heaviest chains…”—moves into explicit thesis-statement territory and undercuts some of the earned subtlety. The piece would feel more powerful if it trusted its images a bit more and spelled out its moral a bit less.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of erasing boundaries (dream/reality, self/place, instrument/artisan) and of art as a conduit rather than container emerge organically from concrete actions like synchronized breathing and mirror-making. Recurring images—frost, glass, breath, starlight—shift meaning at the end to suggest a new ontology where Kael is both “rooted and radiant.” The piece leans a bit toward a tidy, affirming answer with limited shadow or moral friction. Still, the resonance is genuine and invites reflection without overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.5)
    Vows-as-leaves, the ribbon, and the living orchard create a coherent thematic web about generational obligation, letting go, and what it means to honor a craft without making it a chain. The mother’s shift from rigid contract to seasonal, deciduous understanding is well grounded in the discovered objects, and the final years-later paragraph extends this into a credible new pedagogy. That said, both the locket’s inscription and the mender’s spoken line to her daughter state the theme quite directly, edging into mild moralizing. A bit more reliance on implication over explicit thesis would lift this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme is rich: knowledge as forbidden but inevitable, language as living cosmos, and caretaking as mourning rather than control. Recurring images—the shell, the fruit, the “simply complicated” rules—shift meaning by the end, especially when the orchard becomes a memorial and Evers’s bewilderment is reframed as the proper state for a translator of cosmic secrets. A few lines (“The orchard was not a farm but a language”) tilt toward direct thesis, but they mostly function as effective hinge metaphors rather than moralizing. The final stance—continuing to inquire “no matter the cost”—resonates without collapsing into a neat lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of knowledge, omission, and the power of “gaps” are woven coherently through concrete elements: the incomplete diary, unfinished clauses in the rock decree, the “library of unlearned lessons,” and the unheard symphony. The idea that absence and silence can be maps or bridges rather than deficits is dramatized rather than merely stated, especially in turning omissions into a key and a healing incantation. The ending edges toward a tidy moral (“gaps in knowledge could be bridges”) and slightly over-explains instead of letting images fully carry the resonance. Even so, the conceptual reweighting of silence and ignorance is strong and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of identity, lost names, and accepting a fractured self are woven concretely through the garden, twin blossoms, and the ship’s “forgotten name.” The emerald swatch card and names-as-flowers create a clear metaphorical network that reweights itself at the end. However, the last paragraphs edge into overt thematic summary (“the true voyage was the one that took place within”), diluting some of the subtextual power. The piece is resonant but slightly too explicit in articulating its own insights.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of absence, redacted history, and the ethics of institutional memory are tightly woven into every level—from “fables of absence” as category to the rope-as-record to the final acknowledgment that completeness is impossible but clarity about what’s missing matters. The ending’s repricing of absence (“some fables must release their silence to keep the present honest”) feels earned by the concrete work of rebraiding, not pasted on. It stops just shy of moralizing; the occasional explicit articulation of theme is balanced by strong images (the altered chime, the pulsing seal) that carry the weight. The piece invites reflection on archival power without collapsing into thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of cyclical hush, silence as presence rather than absence, and tuning versus eradicating chaos emerge coherently from repeated images and Lira’s stance at the end. The idea that her “bloom was but one note in an endless symphony” nicely enlarges the frame conceptually. However, the theme is sometimes over-explicit (“silence was not the absence of sound, but its own presence”), edging toward statement rather than pure emergence from scene. The resonance is genuine but could lean more on implication and embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of pattern vs. chaos, silence as generative, and the precise “geometry” of repair are beautifully woven through objects and images (shards, star paths, humming glass). The conceptual repricing of coincidence at the end is coherent and resonant, tying her retrocognition and the travelers’ convergence together. That said, the piece leans into explicit thesis statements—“Her proof was complete: coincidence was the echo of a deeper order” and “She had rekindled the belief that nothing is random”—which undercut subtext and feel a shade didactic for a top-tier literary venue. More trust in image and implication, less in direct statement, would significantly strengthen the thematic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme around memory, identity, and the danger of freezing experience emerges organically from setting and task design (solid fog, recorded steps, monuments as memory-threads). The final realization—that meaning lives “between” memories and in the hush rather than the noise—nicely reweights all prior images. However, several lines state theme directly (“Identity was not sculpted by choosing memories…”, “We are not keepers of truth, but gardeners of relevance”), shading into essayistic clarity. The work is resonant but a bit over-explicit for the most rarefied literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of resisting despair through deliberate, even playful creation emerges organically from acts (spinning fire, reading mosaics, walking on to the next fortress). Recurring motifs—the note “Rise,” the rag knot, ember dust—shift meaning toward a quiet credo of ongoing, communal hope. However, lines like “a testament that even in the deepest night hope could be lit” verge on explicit moral statement, slightly flattening the resonance. A bit more reliance on image over declaration at the end would deepen the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme is strongly integrated: tidal pools, cicada, rising tide, and star charts all reinforce ideas of transition, cyclical time, and quiet, continuous change. The piece earns some contemplative insight from specific observation (“not in the grand gestures but in the quiet moments where old patterns dissolved”), though several lines edge toward explicit thesis-stating. Subtext is best where the marine imagery and the brother’s half-shadowed face do the work of showing exposure and vulnerability without commentary. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—acceptance of transience as textured rather than catastrophic—though it flirts with over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of imprisonment vs. preservation, silence as substance, and the possibility of cultivating beauty inside constraint are woven through recurring images of threads, flavor, and hush. The porcelain doll and the bunker’s changing “golden quiet” embody the idea that what confines can also be curated into a kind of sanctuary. The final moves—“not a prison, but a vessel,” “a garden of hush”—reconfigure earlier material into a coherent, resonant answer to the story’s question. Still, some of this resonance is undercut by explicit, thesis-like phrasing in the last third, which flattens what the images are already doing.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thematic throughline—silence as presence and architecture rather than absence—is clear and arises from concrete actions (monitoring noise, adjusting harmonics, gifting the vial). Recurring images (color shifts on meters, storm glass crystals, prismatic light) support a nuanced sense of interior peace as an acquired skill. However, several lines veer into thesis-statement territory (“Most think silence is empty,” “peace wasn't absence, but presence”), flattening subtext and edging toward gentle sermon. The ending resonates but leans a bit too hard on articulating its philosophy instead of trusting image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory vs future, reclamation vs renewal, and custodianship vs rule emerge organically from the mechanics of murals, orchard, and the lore keeper’s role. The final choice—to ready the throne rather than claim it—embodies a nuanced stance about legacy and succession. That said, lines like “The empire's future was not reclamation, but renewal—a truth the lore keeper had wisely adventured to find” tip into explicit thesis-stating and slightly flatten the otherwise strong subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—trauma, deliberate severance, and the paradox of needing others to heal—is woven through concrete motifs: bridges burned and rebuilt, shadows as breath, thresholds as both wound and possibility. The piece lands on the idea of breath as a bridge and of “loaded emptiness” transformed into a vessel, offering a clear, resonant answer to its central question. However, several lines state the thesis outright (“Breathing is a bridge we build,” “shadows are the only breaths that remain”) where more subtext could carry the same weight. Thematic complexity is strong but occasionally leans into voiced aphorism rather than fully trusting image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of pressure, promise, and redemption are coherently woven through imagery (diamonds, deep ocean bolt, parallel selves) and Kael’s arc from duped investor to keeper of a fulfilled promise. The idea of a “probabilistic bond” across dimensions is conceptually rich and reweights earlier events at the end. That said, the piece leans into explicit thematic statement (“The quantum promise… was not a contract but a probabilistic bond”) and explanatory language that borders on essayistic, dulling subtext. The resolution edges toward a neat moral about turning pain into value, with limited lingering ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of memory versus erasure, the ethics of inheritance, and truth as something to be sung rather than severed are coherent and supported by recurring motifs (standing waves, melody, golden shadows). However, the story leans into explicit articulation—“In that moment, the hidden truth was not a burden but a gift of clarity”—that flattens subtext into near-moralizing. The final realization reweights the premise, but the insight is somewhat platitudinous rather than surprising or sharply particular. The piece invites reflection, but not with the depth or complexity expected at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs of strings, fruit-as-universes, endless night, and murmured allegiance accumulate into a coherent theme about isolation, agency within systems, and the cost of embracing possibility. The final reweighting—Aldric as guardian whose loneliness is answered by infinite worlds—offers resonant conceptual closure. That said, the last paragraphs articulate the thematic point quite directly (“had finally captured the shape of possibility,” “had found its purpose once more”), edging toward statement rather than trusting image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of erased histories, bureaucratic neglect, and the power of minor acts of care arise organically from Marianne’s job and choices, with the button as a strong recurring image. The final note—that receiving the button is “a kind of emancipation” from the belief of coming from nothing—reweights the entire story’s premise. Some thematic sentences (“Marianne's motivation was never to solve mysteries...”) edge toward overt exposition but stop short of moralizing. The ending lingers as a genuine, unsentimental meditation on how small kindnesses travel across time.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from action: one undervalued worker resisting “the tyranny of indifference” by encoding memory and freedom into overlooked systems (puddles, an obsolete key, a janitor’s body). The recurrence of reflections, maps, and erased names threads through to a resonant final image where freedom is “coded in water and starlight.” There is some direct thematic labeling (“tyranny of indifference”) that slightly flattens what the images already convey. Still, the ending quietly reweights the entire piece toward persistence through small, careful acts, without slipping into explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of silence versus destiny, memory versus erasure, and the idea that “some silences are louder than any note” are coherent and supported by recurring images. Subtextually, there’s an interesting unease about the ethics of hushing a prophecy the world will never know it lost. However, several lines verge on thesis statement or paraphrasing the theme (“some hushes are forever vested in the mist”), dulling resonance. The ending image is evocative but could push conceptual or emotional repricing further.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of memory, honoring forgotten voices, and the cyclical nature of folklore run consistently through seeds, monuments, and the final “new folklore” rain. The integration of memory-as-seed and labor-as-remembrance is conceptually satisfying, and the ending image of stories that “will never be forgotten again” offers a clear thematic stance. However, the piece tends toward explicit statement and tidiness rather than allowing ambiguity or friction to complicate its ideas. The result is resonant but bordering on sentimental, with limited subtextual tension.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematic throughline—certainty vs. uncertainty, control vs. improvisation—is consistent and organically tied to clocks, water, and the grandfather’s quest. Recurring images (ash, sediment, leaves, water, imperfect clocks) do real work in reweighting the premise by the end. The last third leans into explicit statement (“certainty is just another kind of ash,” “to befriend uncertainty in planning”) in a way that borders on essayistic, slightly reducing subtext. Nonetheless, the final image of “lov[ing] the space between ticks” resonates and reconfigures prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of naming, repair, and the ethics of redemption are woven through concrete motifs—kintsugi, zodiac houses, the foundry, and the boy’s name. The final insight about the weight of names and “being called” reweights prior material and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question. However, a few lines (“the weight of names is not in their calling, but in their being called”) verge on thesis-statement territory, slightly flattening what is otherwise rich subtext. Despite that, the thematic architecture is coherent, nuanced, and emotionally honest.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of grief, healing, and integration are woven concretely into objects (misaligned harp, broken laughter, crocodile tooth) and actions, and the ending reweights prior material in a coherent way. However, the key insight—“Healing wasn't about restoring what was lost, but integrating the broken pieces into something that could laugh anyway”—is stated almost as a thesis rather than fully left to resonate in image and implication. The final paragraphs lean toward explicit moralizing, slightly undercutting the otherwise subtle symbolic work. The thematic arc is compelling but could trust the reader a bit more.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of mercy, survival, and the urge to rationalize trauma are tightly integrated with recurring images (UV, strap, body as instrument), and the final recognition that mercy must be “lived” reweights the preceding quest. Yet the piece undercuts itself by stating its thesis repeatedly and explicitly (“the mathematics of mercy is written in the language of survival,” “mercy was not to be calculated, but to be lived”). This shifts the ending from resonant ambiguity toward sermonizing. Thematic complexity exists, but it’s over-explained rather than allowed to breathe in subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and custodianship of overlooked lives are woven through recurring images of light, lenses, and suspended spaces and culminate in “The light never dies; it only waits for a new keeper.” The final realization that honoring histories means becoming their keeper reweights prior material and gives the ending emotional resonance. However, several lines drift into explicit thematic statement (“I realized that honoring overlooked histories meant…”) that edge toward sermonizing rather than trusting subtext. The piece still leaves a lingering, reflective aftereffect, but with slightly more telling than elite venues typically allow.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of hidden labor, time, and the ethics of bearing witness are tightly woven through objects (mainsprings), setting (ceilings, façades), and Marlon’s vocation. The ghosts’ line “We wound the clocks. We kept the time. But time forgot us” elegantly crystallizes exploitation without over-explaining. The ending slightly edges into abstract thesis language—“silenced mechanisms of ordinary cruelty”—which feels a touch didactic compared to the richer images. Even so, the conceptual repricing of “what’s above” from heaven to structural cruelty lands with real resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the particulars: inscription versus flux, memory versus negotiable reality, and the desire to fix “here” against the infinite. The bottled whisper, frost patterns, and perforated pages all work as concrete vehicles for questions about how understanding is made and preserved. The ending’s “Here” and the reconfigured order of infinite panes offer a resonant, non-literal answer without slipping into overt moralizing. A touch more friction around the ethics of destabilizing the sanctuary could add further complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—truth versus curated memory, the ethics of archives, and the cost of liberty—is woven through concrete motifs: the shard, the mirror, the storm, the poem, and the sepia filter. The final acts (keeping the mirror covered to preserve the poem, ongoing slow chronicle) offer a resonant, non-didactic answer: truth survives as fragile, partial text rather than triumphant revelation. Some lines verge on direct thesis (“fragment of truth in a sea of curated lies”), slightly reducing subtlety, but they are still grounded in character thought. Overall, subtext about complicity, silence, and endurance feels earned rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around honesty as both ethical stance and literal mechanic: truth as resonance that heals, lies as rust that corrodes, with craft and responsibility fused to moral clarity. The covenant of rust externalizes the cost of deceit, while the final restoration of dawn and the woman’s revealed nature reweight the idea of “forgotten songs” and neglected truths. The last line edges toward thesis-statement (“he found his purpose”) but is still anchored in concrete motifs (“mend what isn’t torn,” “let honesty sing”). Complexity is modest but genuine, avoiding sentimental absolutes while still operating in a mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of knowledge versus mystery, archive versus surrender, and a “place where their instruments became stories instead of data” are woven closely into character, setting, and plot. Recurring images—petrichor, the compass, the lagoon, silence—shift meaning by the end, especially the idea that the valley’s “resource” is a coordinate where explanations fail. A few lines tilt toward overt thesis (“not answers, but the precise coordinates where answers become irrelevant”), edging into stated theme rather than fully leaving it in image. Nonetheless, the final walk home with empty vials and “deepest silence” leaves a resonant afterimage that reweights the whole piece.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of inheritance, continuity across generations, and “scaffolding complexity with simplicity” are strongly woven through objects and actions (the lantern slide, the simple carved line, the archway signatures). The final recognition that the alliance runs forward into the future as well as backward is a meaningful reweighting. However, several lines move into explicit thesis mode (“The perpetually learning never stopped…”, “She was not just a sculptor…”) that explain rather than let the images carry the resonance. This soft moralizing flattens what is otherwise rich, emergent thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of darkness as invitation, hidden layers, and quiet revelation are well patterned through recurring images (postcards, glass, night-blooming flowers, “hush”). However, the story often states its insights directly—“darkness is not an absence, but a quiet invitation,” “They open their petals in the dark, not for the sun's approval”—which edges into moralizing rather than letting images carry the weight. Subtext exists in the self-portrait in the glass and the layered-heart metaphor, but those are quickly decoded for the reader. The result is resonant but somewhat didactic for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme around contested memory, state violence, and “truth in tension” emerges organically from the encrypted testimony, retrocognition, and the nuanced portrayal of the Under-Minister’s family history. The driftwood/shell language of the survivors, later echoed in the parley and ending, gives a concrete vehicle for thinking about how the marginalized encode truth under erasure. The resolution resists simplistic villain/hero binaries (“villains and victims sometimes wore the same uniform”) while still clearly indicting systematic erasure. A few lines edge close to explicit thematic statement, but overall the resonance comes from image and situation rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of memory vs. nostalgia, honoring ghosts while building a future, and “true alchemy” as imagination are coherent and threaded through bottle, lanterns, and urban design. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis outright (“The amber bottle, he realized, was a catalyst…”, “true alchemy is not in gold, but in the courage to remember and to dream anew”), which reduces subtext and invites a sermon-like tone. The final paragraphs especially lean into explicit moralizing rather than trusting image and implication. The emotional aftereffect is more intellectual than visceral, with limited ambiguity or counterpressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs of dead language, wax, sound-as-memory, roots, and water coherently braid into themes of how cities store and forget emotional histories. The conceptual turn—from prophecy as doom to prophecy as cartography of feeling—offers a resonant reframing that invites reflection on archives and collective grief. Some lines verge on mild over-explanation (e.g., the future scribes “would wonder how a simple wax shaving could hold the heartbeat of a city”), nudging toward told significance rather than fully trusting the imagery. Overall, the piece sustains a complex, non-didactic meditation that fits its quiet ending, but the thematic effect cannot surpass the modest pressure in Q4.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motifs of seeds, time, entropy, and cyclical renewal align well with the premise and recur in imagery. However, theme is often stated explicitly—“In that chorus, Elara discovered the texture of borrowed time: it was the warmth of possibility”—rather than left to emerge from particulars. Repeated phrases (“wild serenity,” “furious tranquility,” “texture of borrowed time”) risk pseudo-profundity by telling the reader what to feel. The piece has genuine resonance, but it undercuts itself by explaining what its strongest images already imply.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of listening versus noise, humility in authority, and data tempered by wisdom emerge naturally from Elara’s methods and choices, particularly her reliance on microclimates and reluctance to trigger blind panic. The redefinition of “zero hour” and “warning: silence” are conceptually strong. However, the story repeatedly explicates its thesis—e.g., “Humility… was knowing when not to raise your voice”—sliding into overt moralizing rather than trusting subtext and image. Trimming these explicit statements would let the already-rich particulars carry more of the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of vulnerability as strength, quiet as fertile, and overlooked eras as cocoons are strongly anchored in concrete images (falling stars, moss, the glass, the breathing stillness). The revaluation of silence and abandonment at the end offers a satisfying conceptual repricing of the premise. However, the text also states its thesis quite directly—“vulnerability is not weakness, but the very force that allows light to pierce darkness”—which drifts into moralizing and undercuts subtlety. The piece resonates, but with less ambiguity and complexity than the imagery could have supported.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of unspoken words, remembrance, and the ethics of tending to the dead cohere strongly through recurring images (bees as psychopomps, the stained glass box, the hollow hives). The final image of the oasis as a “beacon for wandering spirits” effectively reweights earlier details into an ongoing, quiet duty. However, the text sometimes states theme in prompt-like abstraction (“Her motivation was to preserve the weight of unspoken words…”) instead of letting it emerge purely from action and image. Moral or emotional complexity—any friction between Elara’s need for solitude and her new burden—remains underexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of time as texture versus metric, damaged promises to the future, and “borrowed” versus refracted lifetimes emerge organically from capsules, the Recalibration, and Elara’s final understanding. The urn fragment and Silo both shift from mundane relic/warehouse to charged symbols without feeling like bolt-on allegory. A few late lines (“some endings are just beginnings that have forgotten their numbers”) flirt with aphorism, but they’re grounded enough in the concrete situation to avoid feeling like pure thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme—beauty in fragments and the value of the unfinished—is coherent and supported by the feather, kite, storm-torn sky, and “woven dawns” imagery. However, the story leans heavily on explicit statement (“beauty often resides in what is left unfinished,” “his role was not to finish the poem”) rather than trusting implication and subtext. The same insight is repeated in multiple formulations, creating a didactic, slightly overexplained feel. The final image has some quiet resonance, but the thematic answer feels too neatly spelled out for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of legacy, respect, translation between kingdoms, and non-anthropocentric relationship to place are deeply embedded in actions and images (janitorial pruning vs. true correspondence, “bilingual architecture,” the temple metabolizing him). The orchard’s responses (patience, gratitude, continue) and the final shift to the new caretaker reframe legacy as an ongoing conversation rather than a singular human achievement. The closing diary line, “Respect is not built in a lifetime, but in translation,” flirts with overt thesis-statement territory but is earned by the preceding particulars. Overall the thematic resonance is rich, with only slight explicitness preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of homecoming, exile, artificial vs. natural ritual, and skepticism evolving into a more integrated seeking are coherent and organically tied to objects and setting. The chemical-map idea is a strong thematic engine, reweighting “pilgrimage” and “origin” in non-obvious ways. However, the piece edges toward explicit thesis in lines like “It was the chemistry of homecoming” and “the most artificial of pilgrimages had revealed the most natural of truths,” which slightly flattens subtext into statement. The emotional aftereffect is resonant but controlled rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of reconciliation between war and nature, the living and the dead, and the persistence of concord beneath devastation are consistently embodied in concrete motifs (dead languages, birds, reef, battlefield, garden). The final paragraphs offer an earned, resonant answer: healing does not erase memory; it allows shared breath between past and present. However, some lines (“The locals whispered that the coachman had woven a spell, but he knew it was simply the submerged concord…”) edge toward explicit explanation where image alone might suffice. The piece retains complexity—this is not tidy moralizing—but trims could heighten subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of distance, presence, memory, and how love can be preserved in artifacts emerge organically from the leaf, the cylinders, and Wick’s history with Maya. The final situation—him curled among the cylinders, listening to her ordinary recollections—offers a non-literal answer to the riddle’s question that reweights the entire story. However, a few lines edge into explicit thematic statement (“The distance between them was never in miles but in the silence after her absence,” “he had finally learned to translate distance into closeness”), which slightly blunts the subtext and leaves less room for reader inference. The piece still achieves an affecting emotional aftertaste, just short of the most subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of orientation, chosen direction, and turning confusion into exploration are strongly seeded through the compass, star-mapping ritual, and “true north is not a place but a decision.” The final image of sketching new “anniversaries in the void” reweights earlier family tradition in a resonant way. However, the piece occasionally drifts into overt thesis (“direction is a choice, not a destiny”) rather than letting subtext carry that insight. The thematic arc is coherent but leans toward explicitness and sentimentality instead of fully trusting the images.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of wonder, guardianship, and embracing the unknown are consistent and supported by recurring images (sundial, spire, wrong sky). However, the story repeatedly states its thesis in near-platitudinous terms—“the unknown was not a threat, but an invitation,” “the story ends, but the wonder never does”—instead of letting subtext carry the weight. The final paragraphs tip into sermonizing, explaining the meaning rather than trusting the images and arc. The core idea is appealing but delivered too literally for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, erasure of the powerless, and the ethics of “benevolently ruthless” remembrance are rich and coherent, anchored in the pawn motif and Kael’s archival vocation. However, the story leans heavily on overt thematic statements (“This is how we unbind the past,” the leader’s aphorism, the final paragraphs’ generalized reflections), which blunts subtext. The ending in particular shifts into essayistic abstraction instead of letting concrete images carry the weight of insight. The emotional aftereffect is thoughtful but somewhat didactic rather than earned primarily through scene.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of home as pattern, memory as pain and potential, and language as connective tissue emerge organically from the setting and her quest. The shift from thunder-as-threat to thunder-as-heartbeat offers a genuine conceptual repricing of what “home” and “awakening” mean in this world. That said, several lines verge on direct thematic statement—“the hidden thunder had not been a warning of doom, but a drum…”—which undercuts some of the subtext’s power. The piece is resonant but leans a bit too hard on explicit explanation in the final stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    Redemption through teaching, the revaluation of sacrifice, and forgiveness as an ongoing “winnowing of guilt” are thematically coherent and well linked to the chess/tapestry motifs. The return of the pawn and the act of teaching as atonement provide strong concrete carriers for the theme. Still, the piece undercuts its own subtext by spelling out its insights (“He realized that forgiveness was not a single act…”) in explicit, almost essayistic terms. This explanatory moralizing in the final third dulls what could otherwise be a more resonant, open-ended conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of forgiveness, cost, and the multiplicity of truth are well integrated through recurring prisms, echoes, and Kael’s art versus the ritual’s singular demand. The final movement—that “forgiveness without understanding was merely forgetting dressed in sacred robes” and that “truth, like light, never travels in straight lines”—offers a resonant conceptual reframing. Yet several lines state the thesis outright, tipping into essayistic moralizing instead of trusting image and implication. The complexity of the idea is strong, but the delivery is occasionally too declarative for top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The thematic throughline—brokenness, memory, and kintsugi-like repair as an ethics of meaning—is coherent and emerges organically from the act of gold-filling scars. However, several lines state the thesis too directly (“This was no mere nostalgia… the alchemist’s last true transmutation,” “brokenness was the beginning of beauty”), edging into authorial commentary. The final transformation, where Elara accepts the sea’s grief and wears uncertainty as armor, delivers genuine resonance and conceptual repricing. The piece might reach a higher tier by trusting images and actions over explicit thematic labeling in the last third.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, letting go, and the paradox of “temporary eternity” are woven consistently through the mirror, the shell, and the cave. The final images—seashell left as secret witness, cracked mirror no longer binding him, life as tapestry—reconfigure earlier motifs in a coherent, hopeful way. However, the last paragraphs veer toward explicit abstraction (“threads in the tapestry… pattern of hope”) that edges into mild sermonizing rather than trusting images alone. The piece is thematically clear and resonant, but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of communication, intention, and the ethics of how we reach others are woven through concrete motifs—the cork, the jasmine, the Fresnel lens, the contrast between shouting and beckoning. The idea that lighthouses filter and purify the desperate hopes of the lost elegantly externalizes the emotional stakes between Elara and Marcus. The ending answers the thematic question non-didactically through his whispered request and their agreement to “begin with silence,” though the explicit explanatory paragraph about what lighthouses “didn’t just” do edges slightly toward over-articulation. Overall, resonance is strong and lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of grief, the “geography of loss,” and building imperfect bridges back to what’s vanished are coherently woven through maps, signals, broken machinery, and the censer’s lunar pull. The final reconfiguration—from the void as barren to a landscape “he could traverse”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. A few phrases (“geography of loss,” “raw solace,” “landscape he could traverse”) lean close to abstraction and risk soft sentimentality, but they’re generally backed by concrete action and image. The piece invites reflection on connection and distance without flattening into a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of truth, safety, and the weaponization/pathologizing of honesty emerge organically from events (the empathy virus, relic-hunting patrols, the careful gating of the eye’s power). The final shift—truth as a tool requiring communal readiness, not an absolute good or evil—offers a nuanced answer to the setup. Some lines (“I realized that the eye was not a curse but a tool”) verge on thesis statement, slightly flattening subtext. Overall, resonance is strong and avoids neat moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of memory as witnessing, and of isolation transformed into a form of connection, is well integrated through images (light, mist, dock, edelweiss) and Cornelius’s actions. However, the piece undercuts its own subtlety by stating its thesis outright (“Memory is the true keeper of light,” “every memory deserves a witness”), drifting into mild sermonizing. The final reconfiguration—gesture as gift rather than plea—works thematically and feels earned by the investigation. Overall resonance is real, but the explicit statements keep it below elite literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of promise, regret, self-erasure, and the tension between empirical proof and faith are well interwoven through concrete images (maps, ants, the chip, the door). The idea that “following ants home” is a way of following yourself back to what you chose to forget gives the premise emotional depth. The final realization—that the promise was about his courage to walk through alone—reweights earlier material without feeling like a tacked-on moral, though it edges toward explicit statement. The piece invites reflection on choice and missed lives without collapsing into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme around power as sacrifice, disenchantment with hollow rule, and the idea of being dreamed rather than dreamer emerges organically from events and images. Recurring motifs—bleeding starlight, frost, star embers, recurring dreams—are reweighted at the end in a resonant way. However, several lines step into overt thesis (“power was just another word for sacrifice,” the mountain’s direct explanation of the recurring dreams), which slightly undercuts subtext and risks pseudo-profundity. The piece still leaves a meaningful aftertaste, but with more telling than top-tier literary work would permit.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of revaluation, presence, and the fusion of love and logic are coherent and recur via the shell, pocket-sun, and pigments. Yet the story repeatedly states its thesis outright (“Presence is the only treasure worth returning for,” “We revalue the past not by forgetting...”), which flattens subtext into sermon. The ending offers a confirmation rather than a surprising or complicating reweighting of earlier material. Emotional resonance is gentle and sincere but risks pseudo-profundity through repeated abstractions (“density of presence”) that aren’t grounded in specific emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of time as non-linear, selfhood as narrative, and the ambivalent seduction of nostalgia are deeply woven through images (shattered mirror, impossible dates, multiplying past selves) and resolved in the idea that “the chronicler dies but the dreaming continues.” The final beats offer a resonant answer—embracing being story instead of stable self—without resorting to a neat moral, and the grave/scroll motifs are reweighted at the end. However, there is some overt thesis-like phrasing (“The chronicler’s work was never done, but at least the chaos had learned to sing in key”) that edges into stated theme rather than leaving it fully in subtext. Still, the emotional and conceptual aftereffect is strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—translation vs. restoration, humanizing loss through form, inhabiting time—is strong and internally consistent, with recurrent images (water, fog, the screw, the clock) reweighted at the end. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question by having her inhabit ordinary miracles without reclaiming smell. However, several lines verge on thesis statements (“We humanize our losses by giving them form”; “ordinary miracles… weren’t about restoration. They were about translation.”), tipping from subtext into essay. This explicitness slightly blunts what would otherwise be a more haunting ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of grief-alchemy, ritualized release, and stories as vessels for pain emerge clearly through recurring objects (crow feather, crystals, rune). The text occasionally edges into on-the-nose articulation—“to transform scars into stories,” “each scar would become a rune”—where implication could carry more weight in a top-tier piece. Still, the final image of a “library of light” within her is resonant and earns a reflective aftertaste. Thematic complexity is moderate rather than layered: moving, but not unsettling or deeply multi-valent.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of imperfect miracles, the ethics of representation (“mirror, not a window”), and the idea that apology can be a kind of music are all coherently embodied in action and image. Recurring motifs—the axe releasing a song, the “broken chord,” and the perfume’s ghost—shift meaning by the end in a satisfying way. A few lines come close to thesis statements (“Sometimes the song is the apology”) and slightly over-explain what the images already carry. That explicitness trims some of the lingering ambiguity that might elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The themes—truth as pattern rather than possession, end as beginning, observer becoming observed—are tightly woven through recurring images (spirals, the dictionary, hush, illusions). The final reconfiguration (“for the first time, the witness was not at history's end but at its beginning”) meaningfully reprices all prior material. There is some direct thematic statement (“truth was not a thing to be possessed”) that edges toward didactic, but it still arises organically from the scene’s confrontation. The piece leaves space for reflection on witnessing, narrative, and illusion without collapsing into a single pat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of time as remainder, razor-edge thresholds, and the space between heartbeats are tightly integrated with imagery and structure. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis in overt, near-aphoristic lines (“Time is the space between two heartbeats… time is not a river but a series of edges”), reducing subtext and inviting a sense of pseudo-profundity. The realization is consistent with the preceding action but undercut by these explicit formulations. Strong conceptual ambition, but the lack of restraint keeps it mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of permeability, grief, and redefined security emerge organically from mycelial imagery and Kael’s occupational lens, culminating in the idea of “Permeable Grief Architecture.” However, the piece edges into over-articulation with repeated thesis-like lines (“the physics of letting go wasn’t about…,” “Through permeable barriers, they wrote…”) that state what the images already imply. Subtext exists in the woman’s ritual and Kael’s quiet complicity, but the final paragraphs lean toward essayistic summary. The emotional aftereffect is genuine, yet slightly blunted by this didactic tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of chance vs certainty, inherited compulsion vs responsible inquiry, and “lucid contradictions” are well woven through object choices (cards, lantern, equations on cards) and setting. The final realization—that contradictions form a “language of existence” and that her role is to teach probability without reproducing loss—coheres with the story’s earlier images. Yet several lines nudge into explicit thesis (“using the lantern's light to guide others through the maze of uncertainty”), edging toward on-the-nose moralizing. The piece gestures at complexity but resolves her position with relatively clean, untroubled wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    The thematic thread of endings as beginnings is tightly woven through the loop, the calls, and Mira’s departure from the tunnel. However, it is frequently articulated in overt thesis-sentences (“Mira's motivation surfaced: to teach endings how to begin,” “She had learned that every ending is only the start of a new melody”), which undercuts subtext and complexity. The repeated moral-style formulations make the ending feel didactic rather than letting the images (shattered disc, silent phone, her walk into night) carry the resonance. There is emotional honesty, but little ambiguity or resistance to the central idea.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of memory, small moments as covenants, and “proximate causes” of healing are coherent and sustained through recurring images and actions. However, the story leans into overt statement—“Each token was a proximate cause, a tiny act that, like ink on paper, contributed to a larger-than-story healing”—and culminates in a thesis-like final line about context changing and the heart choosing. This moralizing dilutes what could have been a more resonant, image-led close. The thematic architecture is solid but not subtle enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme—that loneliness is cured by reciprocal storytelling and shared hope—is coherently woven through the rumor chain, the memory-offering ritual, and the cyclical caretaking by Elara. The moon fragment’s reweighted meaning nicely embodies this thematic arc. However, several lines state the thesis outright (“Thus the cure for loneliness is not a potion but a promise...”), tipping into mild moralizing and reducing the need for the reader’s own inference. The ending resonates, but it leans toward tidy clarity rather than layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of grief as geography, inward mapping, and the language of silence emerge organically from concrete images (the ring spinning inward, the stillpoint’s human note, her mother as a mapmaker). The final realization—that she will map this territory for others and that some directions point inward—reweights earlier material effectively. However, several late sentences tip into explicit thesis statements (“Her motivation had been simple,” “She understood that to map the world, one must first map the silence”), edging toward sermonizing rather than trusting the images. The piece still leaves a resonant afterimage, but with a bit of thematic over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The themes of fallibility, revision, and finding meaning in noise are well-integrated with concrete motifs (seeds, moss, static, crossed-out lines). The final images—the universe as a manuscript, the dry pen, strange comfort in uncertainty—offer a resonant answer to the opening conditions. However, several explicit thesis-like lines (“He understood now that meaning was not a fixed star…”) border on overt moralizing rather than letting images carry the weight. The insight feels earned but slightly over-articulated for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, erasure, authorship without audience, and the ownership of silence are woven coherently through recurring images (camera, harbor, music, mapping). The idea that “silence is the only language the forgotten truly own” is powerful and the final stance—making music for silence itself—reweights the entire piece. However, the advisor’s long signed explanation and the explicit thematic lines near the end edge toward thesis-statement clarity rather than leaving more to subtext. The emotional aftereffect is strong but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece weaves censorship, erasure, and atonement tightly together, letting theme arise from specific images—burned libraries, a vandalized self-portrait, crystalline memory devices—rather than explicit moralizing. Kael’s shift from “mercy killing” libraries to rebuilding and guarding truth reframes their earlier actions without neat absolution, giving the ending a resonant ambiguity. The recurring tapestry/portrait motif captures the tension between propaganda and truthful self-representation with satisfying subtlety. One line (“They must portray what had been destroyed…”) edges toward thesis-statement clarity but doesn’t quite tip into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of grief, identity, and the ethics of preservation vs transformation emerge organically from Kael’s goal and the experiment’s premise—he moves from accepting Mira as a ghost in his head to honoring her desire to become something beyond flesh. Recurring motifs (entangled memories, drumming as language, auroral gold) accrue meaning and reweight the ending without overt moralizing. The line “the shared dream wasn’t about preservation—it was about transformation” edges close to explicit thesis but is anchored enough in concrete stakes and prior setup to avoid feeling didactic. The final image of “auroral sorrow” across the sky preserves ambiguity about whether this is liberation, haunting, or both.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of precision vs noise, order vs chaos, and how “whispers carry further than screams” are well integrated with the acoustic-engineering conceit and Marek’s character. Objects (coin, key, maps) and the storm all echo the idea that subtle, prepared actions can harness overwhelming forces. However, the closing lines veer toward explicit thesis (“silence builds better bridges than thunder ever could”), shading into mild moralizing rather than letting the images do all the work. The insight still feels earned, but it’s more stated than purely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of transforming fear of darkness into reverence for stars and the transmissibility of quiet care are clear and supported by recurring images (water as mirror, the passed dental mirror, constellations on the planks). However, the piece leans close to explicit moralizing in lines like “He taught darkness that stars are not to be feared but to be held gently,” stating its thesis instead of letting it fully emerge from scene. Subtext—especially around the child’s “unspoken grief”—is hinted at but not deepened into a specific, complex emotional knot. The result is sincere and affecting but thematically tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of silent resistance, the power of doubt, and questioning authority are tightly integrated via chess metaphors, window puzzles, and the recurring motif of second thoughts. The final emphasis on the true victory being a student’s pause before moving is apt and resonant. However, lines like “The puzzle's solution spelled out a simple truth: 'Question the king'” and explicit declarations of moral (e.g., “true victory was not a checkmate...”) verge on didactic, reducing subtext. More trust in image and implication, less direct statement, would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of freedom, liminality, and the synthesis of strength and softness emerge organically from nonviolence, the whale’s call, and Mira’s dance-centered transformation. The scrimshaw unlocking hearts and the vanishing island both reweight the idea that gentleness can effect decisive change. However, several late lines (“strength and softness are not enemies,” “Her true nature was not in hauling crates”) move into explicit thesis-stating, nudging the piece toward mild moralizing rather than trusting subtext and image to carry the load.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of enforced happiness, grief, and quiet survival are coherent and threaded through motifs of hush, turbines, and the bouquet. The moral ambiguity of rebellion plus informing adds welcome complexity. However, the piece leans into explicit thematic articulation (“The blank faced performer knew that…,” “a canvas on which to carve the quiet art of survival”), which dulls subtext and reads close to thesis-stating. The final paragraphs resonate conceptually but could trust images more and explain less.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of boundary dissolution (self/world, silence/sound, fear/possibility) and art as translation of vibration into language are woven consistently through image and action. The recurrence of humming, paraphrase, and ice as a border that becomes a threshold builds a clear conceptual frame. The line about the ban opening “a door to the infinite” edges toward explicit thesis-stating and slightly flattens the more resonant, earlier imagery. Still, the ending reweights earlier material in a satisfying way, with a lingering sense of permeability and ongoing invitation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of finding beauty in imperfection, alternative modes of perception, and art as mutual awakening are coherent and consistently threaded through glass, plants, and phoenix imagery. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis in summary (“a tale of finding beauty in the imperfect, of awakening through exchange”) instead of fully trusting subtext and image. The ending leans into legend and moral, which flattens ambiguity and complexity. There are glimpses of richer tension (her disability, his control-freak craft) that remain underexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central theme—that connection is rooted in imperfection, decay, and being changed by being heard—is strongly developed through the lens, the sacred spaces, and the 0.3% “error.” The recurrence of “artificial pilgrimage,” “texture,” and “golden shadows” lends real resonance to the final conceptual turn. However, some lines state the thesis too directly (“The artificial pilgrimage was never meant to replace the real journey…”, “The texture of connection wasn’t in perfect transmission…”) which edges into sermonizing rather than trusting subtext. The emotional aftereffect is there, but a bit over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of grief, artificiality vs authenticity, and intention transforming “manufactured” consolation into real hope are tightly woven through objects (lab-grown sorrow, synthetic moonstone, dissolving vellum) and actions (illumination, folding, leaving in airlocks). The revaluation of rock bottom as “foundation” and grief as a white dwarf that still casts light lands as an earned, non-trite insight. A few lines (“manufactured hope becomes real through intention”) approach direct thesis articulation but are largely supported by the concrete narrative. Overall, the final coordinate—“Teach the next withering thing”—reweights everything before it with strong resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of decentralization vs. single truths, systems thinking vs. hype, and culture as a web of choices are rich and consistently woven through images (chains vs. roots vs. web, towers vs. networks). The reframing of currencies (trust, ritual, story, barter) after the crash elegantly extends the blockchain metaphor into social and cultural terrain. However, several lines articulate thesis directly (“The cards don’t predict,” “The future wasn’t a chain, but a web”), tipping toward essayistic clarity rather than subtext. The ending still resonates, but a touch less explicit moralizing would heighten its literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of nostalgia, memory’s corruption, and the “end of innocence” are well integrated with the core conceit of atoms of nostalgia and her role as historian-healer. The idea that preserving joy without sorrow is both necessary and wounding gives the piece a resonant undertow. However, several lines state the theme overtly (“The end of innocence is not a single moment but a continuum”), tipping into mild didacticism rather than letting images and actions carry the insight. The ending image of her walking the fragile line between past and future still lands with conceptual and emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres around the cost of preserving hope: every major element—the stone, the archive, the shadow, the final veil—reiterates that preservation is inseparable from loss. The final note of “luminous regret” reweights what came before without explicit moralizing, letting the reader infer the trade-off. The recurrence of “shape of hope” flirts with abstraction, but is anchored enough by the library and the shadow’s metamorphosis to avoid sermonizing. Thematically, this is quiet but substantial.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—reconstruction after betrayal, healing around wounds rather than erasing them, and balancing self-respect with compassion—is well embodied in recurring particulars: the damaged tail, burned brochures, the notebook of old intentions, and the revised mission statement. The chameleon’s healing, color shifts, and final “spiral of trust” give the piece strong, concrete thematic resonance. However, some insights tilt toward explicit moralizing (“healing is not forgetting, but growing around the wound”; “Lessons from a chameleon’s tail”) and state the thesis a bit too directly for top-tier subtlety. The story still lands an honest, affecting emotional afterimage, but slightly undercuts itself by explaining what its images already convey.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of healing, scars-as-text, and closure-as-reading rather than sealing are coherent and recur through objects (scars, coffee rings, hourglass). However, the text often states its thesis explicitly (“closure was not an ending but a reading,” “verses in a poem of survival”) rather than allowing subtext and image to carry it. This directness edges toward platitude and slightly undercuts what could be a more hauntingly ambiguous resolution. Still, the final images do offer a resonant reweighting of scars and miracles, if in a somewhat tidy way.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme—unused love as neither vanished nor harmless, but changing address into spaces and objects—is richly developed through concrete particulars (seat gaps, balcony rails, projection angles) rather than abstract commentary. The notion of goodbye letters as transfer protocols and buildings as vaults gives a fresh, resonant answer to the central question by the end. The final paragraphs extend the idea beyond the Rialto (sidewalk cracks, the next palace), reweighting the entire story without slipping into overt moralizing. A few sentences (e.g., “for crystal gazers know what others forget”) approach thesis-statement territory, but they’re brief and integrated enough not to feel like sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central theme—creativity as the universe remembering itself—is clear and supported by recurrent images of stardust, falling stars, and the unwritten calendar. However, the line “creativity is simply the universe remembering itself” is an explicit thesis that flirts with pseudo-profundity and undercuts some subtext. The story’s final movement does reweight earlier images (sextant, aurora, stardust) in a resonant way. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and lyrical, but not especially complex or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory versus forgetting, potentiality versus extinction, and the idea of dreams as infrastructural (a place where futures are born) are rich and organically threaded through archive, forest, and lullaby motifs. The ending’s conceptual shift—dreamlessness as the womb of dreams, midnight as a garden of before—reweights the whole piece effectively. At times the language edges toward explicit thesis (“that memory is enough to grow from”), slightly undercutting subtextual power. Still, the thematic net is coherent, emotionally resonant, and emerges from concrete images rather than pure sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematic coherence is strong: reason as one gear, wildness and mechanism as lovers, map vs. territory, and insight as an ongoing “hum” all interlock convincingly. The gear, wind-voices, and forest repeatedly shift meaning to support the idea of mind as constructed-yet-wild. However, the piece leans on explicit statements (“She understood now that…”) and quasi-aphoristic lines that verge on essay rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. Complexity is present, but some wisdom feels told rather than earned through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of quiet, persistent courage and self-discovery through indirect journeys are coherent and well-aligned with repeated images (stars, shoreline lullaby, ridgeway). However, the text often states its thesis outright—“Sometimes the courage we haven't used is the brightest star we carry,” “The ferry guides had taught them that sometimes the longest route is the one that leads to yourself”—which tips into moralizing rather than letting subtext carry the weight. The final paragraphs reiterate ideas already clear in the imagery, dulling resonance. The thematic core is sound but over-explained and somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece develops a strong thematic thread around safety as continual vigilance, guilt, and the religious weight of service, with the bolt and the idea of “unpardonable silence” doing meaningful motif work. The line “The cost of safety was this: that you never stopped paying” edges into explicit thesis statement, nudging toward mild didacticism rather than leaving it fully in subtext. Nonetheless, the final act of quiet recommitment and the reframed silence (from failure to ethical watchfulness) provide a resonant non-literal answer to the central question. Complexity is present, though the moral calculus is more articulated than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of truth versus illusion, and knowledge as a quiet corrective to corrupt power, emerge organically through the library, the rune of drift, and Vael’s glamour unraveling. The final image—“a world unraveling yet whole”—nicely reweights the prior “graceful collapse” motif into a meditation on necessary dissolution. Some lines lean toward explicitness (“his pretensions laid bare”) that slightly undercuts subtext. Still, the piece invites reflection on guardianship, time, and the cost of unmasking without collapsing into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of climate grief, witness vs. action, and futures built on false assumptions emerge cohesively through motifs of bleaching, vanished routes, and “periodically eternal” cycles. The insight that paths disappear because their underlying futures have died is strong and resonates back through the corals and shipping lane. At times the piece edges toward explicit statement—“Now she understood why some paths disappear”—which slightly flattens subtext that is already well implied. Nonetheless, the final image of her tapping as memorial and tentative hope offers a resonant, non-schematic answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of silence versus voice, tactical calculation versus intuitive meaning, and finding power “below” rather than in the stars emerge organically from the pairing of stone circle, opera glasses, and broadcast. The final image—her resting on the humming ground while rebels and occupiers both hear the same wordless song—offers genuine resonance and conceptual repricing of what rebellion can be. That said, lines like “the simple truth that silence could be broken, that lulls could end” verge on spelling out the thesis rather than trusting the images. The complexity is present, but a touch more subtext and a touch less articulation would raise it.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of agency versus fate, tradition versus conscious change, and hope fossilizing into dogma are woven coherently through images like amber, seeds, and reconstruction. The conceptual turn—that “implanted destiny” was metaphor and that real destiny is cultivated—is strong and aligned with Mara’s arc. Yet the ending leans into explicit moralization (“Destiny wasn’t implanted in amber. It was planted in the soil of conscious choice...”), reducing subtext and ambiguity. The piece invites reflection but resolves too neatly into thesis statements for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of trauma, embodiment, memory, and “optimism anchored in realism” are organically seeded in objects and actions (the automated lighthouse vs. human keeper, shadow vs. touch-based memory). The photograph, trees, and lighthouse lens reappear with shifted meaning by the end, giving a clear non-literal answer to the central question of how to live with what happened. However, the story increasingly states its thesis outright—“His optimism was no longer a kite without string, but a boat anchored in what had actually happened”—which edges toward didacticism and slightly undercuts subtext. The emotional aftereffect is still genuine and textured, but less subtle than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from action and image: light vs. darkness, multiplicity of selves, and art as engagement with “necessary darkness” rather than surface luminosity. The final understanding—“Shadow and light were not opposites but collaborators” and the ache as “the only honest light”—reweights everything that came before without feeling tacked on. There is some near-explicit statement of theme, but it has been earned by the concrete work with threads and setting. The piece invites lingering reflection on grief, vocation, and choice across timelines.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ephemerality versus permanence, crisis-time versus ordinary time, and the cost of obsession are nicely braided through recurring images: the disappearing ink, the eclipse, the sandstorm mentor loss, the ghost of the drone. However, the piece leans into explicit statement (“He theorized that…”, “If he could master the pattern…”) where implication could carry more weight, especially near the end. The final image of him poised to “shape the ephemeral into something permanent” is resonant, but edges close to being a thesis sentence. The thematic core is coherent and interesting, just somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of censorship, institutional control of memory, and truth as both weapon and contagion emerge organically from the specifics of the letter and the infrastructure she hijacks. Recurring motifs—silence/quiet, snow, frozen vs thawed, womb vs tomb—are reweighted at the end to suggest that archives can gestate rebellion rather than merely preserve or entomb. The piece largely avoids sermonizing, but a few lines (“virus of authenticity,” “empire of ice melting beneath the heat of forty years of manufactured truth”) edge toward overt thesis statement rather than leaving work to subtext. Overall, the thematic resonance is strong and coherent, though not quite subtle enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.0)
    Peace as active practice, continuity vs. chaos, and “quiet” as shield and fire are coherent through-line themes, supported by recurring objects and rituals. However, the piece occasionally leans into direct statement (“She believed that by inculcating plants with values…”, “a world where even a bounty hunter’s daughter could choose peace”) that edges toward moralizing. Subtext exists—in how hospitality is extended to a deserter and violence is ritually renounced—but complexity is limited by the lack of genuine moral friction. The final vow that “the quiet would endure” is resonant yet somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of possession vs. witness, grief transformed into grace, and the ethics of holding divine remnants emerge organically from Avery’s ritual and final choice. Recurring motifs—the rail spike, voicing silence, zigzag vs. straight path, feral lullaby—reweight at the end without the need for overt moralizing. The closing insight about being “a keeper of silences” and letting witness change you is strong, though one or two lines in the final paragraph edge close to stating the thesis outright. Slightly more reliance on image and a hair less explicit phrasing would heighten subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematic architecture is articulate and cohesive: gravity wells of silence, black holes of public trust, “Light in Darkness,” and orbits of regret all point to a nuanced meditation on truth, complicity, and legacy. The ending meaningfully reweights prior images by casting the nib as a “small dark star” going supernova and distinguishing telescope from black hole. However, several passages edge into essayistic thesis (“credibility built on suppression is no credibility at all”) and on-page logical framing, which feels a bit like authorial moralizing rather than fully emergent theme. That explicitness slightly blunts the lingering ambiguity an elite venue would prize.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of guilt, repair, and the ethics of binding others (especially children) to grand cosmic systems emerge organically from the plot and objects. The recurring motifs—the amber, baby cries, constellations, meteor hush—shift meaning by the end, with the “first sound” reinterpreted as creation mourning impermanence. The piece avoids tidy moralizing while still taking a stance: some forms of transcendence are violence, and erasure can be merciful. A few lines (“the first sound of creation mourning its own impermanence”) edge close to overt thesis-statement, keeping it just shy of top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from action: how communities metabolize fear and trauma, and how art can give silence a generative rather than oppressive form. The “unlearning” season, the grotto’s hunger for leftover speech, and the mandala as a re-writable pattern all work together to explore collective memory without feeling like allegory with labeled parts. There is slight over-clarity in lines like “Her motivation had never been mere curiosity,” which edges toward telling the thesis, but the final paradox—that the grotto remembers while the village forgets—lands with resonant complexity. The piece invites reflection on the ethics of making buried pain legible without dictating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of mercy, memory, and rebuilding after atrocity are compelling and coherent, with the plaza’s renaming and the tessera’s reuse providing strong symbolic anchors. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit thematic phrasing—“aberrant mercy,” “cradled empathy in arms of steel,” “warm coldness”—repeated until it edges into slogan rather than subtext. Little is left for the reader to infer, and complexity (e.g., the enemy soldier’s motives or ambiguity) is evoked but not explored. This directness dampens the lingering, layered resonance expected at top venues.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of artistic legacy, shared encores across time, and possibility reclaimed from despair are woven effectively through recurring images (applause as color, echoes, the orchard fruit as “moments of possibility”). The ending’s notion that his once-solitary encore becomes a “shared anthem” is a strong thematic crystallization without overt moralizing. That said, the phrasing in the final sentences (“possibility could always be lured back from the brink”) edges toward explicit thesis-statement, slightly flattening complexity. Still, the piece invites a reflective, bittersweet aftereffect rooted in its specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of skepticism vs faith, chaos vs pattern, and art-science integration emerge clearly through the geode, the recalled pill, and the light-painting process. The recurring “willowglass hope” and fractal imagery give the conclusion a resonant, if somewhat reiterated, texture. However, the thematic arc leans close to stating its own thesis—“a doorway to willowglass hope,” “willowglass hope made solid”—rather than trusting implication, and moral complexity (e.g., ethical stakes of using such a method) is only lightly touched. The ending offers a gentle, uplifting answer more than a reweighted, costly insight.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of ecological loss, memory, and translation between eras (fact and myth, data and sorrow) are woven tightly through the fossil, the caves, and Lira’s vocation. The notion of “transitional objects” as emotional bridges is potent and reframes the caves and fossil in the middle and at the end. Yet the story occasionally states its themes outright (“In doing so, she would become the voice of the unknown”) instead of fully trusting subtextual image-work. The final image is resonant but leans a bit close to stated thesis rather than a more oblique, lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic throughline—walls versus open hands, time as prison versus garden, prophecy as shared question rather than fixed fate—is strong and emerges organically from the imagery of glass, sand, and amber. The closing question about “building walls between your moments” offers a clear, resonant thematic key that reweights the preceding material. However, the piece occasionally edges into direct statement and near-moralizing (“a world that had forgotten how to listen to its own history”), which flattens some of the otherwise rich subtext. Combined with relatively soft on-page pressure, the theme feels beautifully articulated but somewhat cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of “fixing what’s broken,” the nature of courage, and the possibility of second chances emerge organically from Kael’s history and present actions, and the snow/thaw motif reinforces them effectively. His realization that “doing right” need not annihilate him, and that repair can be a form of courage, is earned by the five-year exile and this gamble. That said, the final paragraph edges toward explicit thesis (“he understood that some things could be fixed…”) in a way that slightly flattens subtext into statement. The resonance still lingers, but a touch more trust in image over explanation would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of persistence, the rewriting of vows, and the distillation of messy life into a single essential act are woven through concrete motifs: gutters as time, needles as mending, the palimpsest promise. The final image reweights prior material—“thirty-seven years of overwriting dissolved, leaving only the original truth”—without resorting to explicit moralizing. At times, abstract phrasing (“the peace that percolates through persistent attention”) edges toward stated thesis rather than pure scene-driven resonance. Still, the piece invites reflection on memory, waiting, and what constitutes fidelity without collapsing into platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thematic weave—care as an architecture that bends time, resistance as memory rather than defiance—is rich and organically tied to pottery and beekeeping details. Recurring images (wheel, kiln, thrum, oasis as heart, bee messenger) give the final realization a satisfying conceptual repricing. Yet the story repeatedly states its thesis in near-moral form (“survival isn’t just endurance, but the active practice of care”; “some resistances were not stubbornness, but love’s architecture”), slipping into overt didacticism that undercuts subtlety. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but somewhat guided rather than invited.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of legacy, precision-as-love, grief-translated-into-action, and light in darkness are tightly woven through object, setting, and choice. The locksmith motif and the gauge’s notches as “a language of persistence” provide an organic thematic spine. A few lines verge on direct thesis (“sometimes letting go was the most precise measurement of all”), but they still arise credibly from Maya’s lived particulars. The final reconfiguration—gardener as lock, key, and hand—reweights the entire piece without feeling like a bolt-on moral.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme—independence versus solitude, stewardship of extinct life, and identity as a living archive—is coherent and organically tied to Mara’s vocation and experiences. Recurring images (brittle awakening, hums, sundial reflections) support a conceptual throughline about fragility and connection. Yet the piece undercuts its own subtext by stating the thesis outright (“She understands that independence does not mean solitude; it means carrying the legacy of the extinct within her”), veering toward moral summary rather than leaving the insight to emerge from image and action. The ending resonates conceptually but could invite more lingering ambiguity and less didactic framing.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of secrecy, connection, and art as communal memory are integrated through concrete motifs (the thrush’s nest, the spiral, anonymous letters, offerings). The final realization—that the “thread” is the weaving of many voices—reweights earlier images and offers a satisfying conceptual answer. However, the story occasionally states its themes too directly (“keeper of secrets no longer alone,” “thread that connects all things”), edging towards sentimentality rather than leaving more space for inference. The resonance is real but somewhat over-articulated for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of division as a harvestable resource, information warfare, and the fragile possibility of human solidarity emerge organically from concrete events (archived broadcasts, protests, senate debates, cosmic tricksters). The story avoids tidy moralizing by noting that human grudges and mistrust persist even after the alien influence is blunted. The final image—a lone heart in a shabby booth pushing back with “static, stubborn faith”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about resistance amid manipulation. Some phrasing edges toward explicit thesis (“celestial gaslighting,” “fed on the community's division”), but it still mostly lets scene and image carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of rebellion against rigid geometry, listening as exploration, and knowledge as true treasure are coherent and organically tied to compass, organ, and blueprints. The story’s final revaluation—spatial mutiny as conceptual liberation for the city—is clear and emotionally apt. However, the last third over-articulates its ideas (“the true treasure was the knowledge…”, “open a dialogue with the past,” etc.), drifting into thesis-like statements rather than letting images and actions carry the weight. This explicitness dampens lingering ambiguity and subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of seeing versus not seeing, unifying opposites, and empathy as a form of perception emerge organically from Elara’s condition and method, with the ribbon and quarry functioning as effective concrete anchors. The final realization—that her blindness can become “a different kind of sight”—reweights earlier material and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, a few lines verge on explicit thematizing (“That was her secret, her method: by unifying opposites…”; “Her empathy wasn’t dormant anymore”), slightly flattening what the scene already shows. The piece still leaves a thoughtful aftertaste, but with a bit more subtlety it could feel more profound.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of erased women’s work, institutional suppression of inconvenient truths, and the cost of being “right too soon” are well woven into events and recurring images (reversible exile, empty coffin, nail, hollow maps). The final section powerfully reframes the station as a monument to that erasure and partial repair, and the idea of dread belonging to “everyone who had built their certainty on erased maps” is a strong conceptual turn. However, several lines slide into explicit thesis (“brave women being finally, properly buried,” “She would make them question it all”), veering toward authorial moralizing rather than leaving more work to subtext. The thematic spine is compelling but could gain subtlety by trusting its images more.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, forgiveness (“pixelated amnesty”), and resurrecting the silenced through art are organically woven through recurring images (glass flake, photograph, map, song). The final image—playing a “new bridge-song” that lets “the dead sing again”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question about what to do with the uncanny and the forgotten. However, some phrasings (“ashes of ‘never’,” “pixel of hope,” “luminous disbelief”) feel like pre-packaged abstractions rather than hard-earned insights rooted in unique particulars. The piece invites reflection but stops just short of deeper ambiguity or moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of cyclical paths, legacy, and the value of stillness emerge clearly from the events and recurring images (tracks circling, chalk marks, foreign money, posters). However, the piece leans heavily on explicit thematic statements—especially in the final paragraphs (“He understood now that some paths circle back not to trap, but to remind us…”), which border on moralizing. This reduces the subtextual work that the images themselves could carry. The conceptual insight is sound but delivered more as thesis than as fully dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of shared memory, intergenerational care, and the impossibility of healing alone are strong and well-embodied in images like the daylilies’ one-day bloom restored and the continuous thread between scribes. The recurrence of stars, inscriptions, and flowers effectively links cosmic scale to human resilience. However, the closing section leans into explicit thesis (“map not of stars, but of human resilience,” “continuation of a shared burden that defined humanity's relationship with time itself”) that tells what the story already showed, tipping into mild sermonizing. This directness blunts what could otherwise be a more resonant, open-ended thematic afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of hidden guilt, the limits of mirrors, and the recovery of “lost” inner truths are coherent and woven through objects and images (frozen confession, gifted finder of lost things, reflective surface). The ending’s realization that he cast the curse himself and now carries truth “like a lantern” gives a satisfying conceptual repricing of his purpose. That said, several lines state theme directly (“Mirrors only show the outer shell...”), tipping into mild moralizing rather than letting the images carry it. The resonance is real but somewhat on-the-nose, limiting subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around inherited obligation, the ethics of tending vs controlling dreams, and transforming burden into stewardship. The recurring garden/maze/roots imagery meaningfully shifts at the end, where the eclipsed covenant becomes “a garden to tend” and Elara herself becomes the crossing point. This reweights earlier material effectively without collapsing into simple moralizing, though a couple of lines (“wasn’t a burden to bear but a garden to tend”) brush close to thesis statement. The emotional aftereffect—hopeful yet charged with responsibility—lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: grief as a hole, the ethics of undoing death, and the idea that any miracle demands irreversible payment. The repeated conversion of memories to wood and bone makes “bartered destinies” a concrete metaphor rather than an abstraction. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“The barter was complete, but imperfect, as all such transactions are”), softening the subtlety slightly. The ending’s sense of altered but enduring loss leaves a genuine aftertaste without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of “after the applause,” repurposing failure, and finding meaning in forgotten objects are clear and well-linked to the imagery of echoes and antiques. The speaker cloth as a relic that shifts from pain to possibility is a solid thematic vehicle. Yet the final paragraphs slip into explicit moralizing (“She would not let…”, “every ending is a prelude”), flattening subtext into stated thesis. This on-the-nose articulation undercuts what could be a more resonant, image-led ending.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic through-lines—presence vs absence, translation vs speaker, ambition vs wisdom, event vs field—are woven consistently through images (field, magnetic lines, touching distance) and culminate in a satisfying conceptual repricing of “transition.” The ending reweights earlier material by redefining physics as braid and by placing Elara as witness rather than master, which resonates with her profession and arc. At times the piece edges into direct abstraction (“The physics of transition was not a boundary but a braid”), slightly reducing the need for the reader to infer, but it stops short of outright moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of contradiction, preservation vs destruction, and wonder-within-routine arise organically from the concrete situation (archival smelting, tidal cycles, lunar identity shifts) and the creel’s transformation. The repeated patterns of tide, migration, and weaving build a coherent argument that meaning lies in flux and ambiguity rather than in “pure information.” However, a few late lines (“This was the contradiction she must accept…”, “The wonder was in the changing, not in the capture.”) edge toward explicit statement, slightly dulling the subtext’s power. The final image of creel and librarian both “transformed by not transforming fully” nonetheless offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic throughline—buried hopes, unsaid truths, and the conversion of latent radiance into communal song—is coherent and organically seeded via the shells, the grandmother, and the caves. However, the closing paragraphs lean into explicit statement (“She had come to inspect structures, but instead had discovered what holds them together”) and tidy thesis-like language that undercuts some of the earned resonance. The piece still invites reflection, but with less ambiguity and subtlety than elite venues typically demand.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of guilt, forgiveness, and the river as metaphor for time and truth are coherent and sustained through the map, station, accordion, and repeated water imagery. However, the thematic delivery leans on explicit statements (“Forgive the past, flow forward,” “The river flows on, and so must you,” “truth was not a fixed point but a current”), which undercut subtext. The strongest thematic work happens in images like leaving the patched bellows behind as proof that “broken things could still sing,” which needs less explanation than it gets. The ending resonates, but the moral is a bit over-articulated for elite-literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres around silence, time, and the delayed unfolding of secrets, with the watch, propagation delays, and unread books echoing one another. The final realization that silence is an echo she creates gives a solid conceptual repricing of the library’s purpose. However, the explicit line on the letter is a direct thesis statement that edges into on-the-nose moralizing, slightly undercutting subtext. Much of the resonance is earned through image, but the story tells its idea once where it might have trusted implication.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of destiny as perforated, seeds vs. empires, memory vs. exploitation, and archives as living gardens are coherently threaded through coffee stains, the seed, and the observatory. The final image of the future “no longer a veil but a garden” is a strong conceptual repricing of fate. However, the closing lines veer into explicit moralizing (“some dreams are worth more than empires”), flattening some of the earned ambiguity and subtext. Much of the wisdom feels genuinely grown from particulars, but the thesis occasionally steps to the foreground instead of staying fully embedded in image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of mortality, memory, and the ethics of preservation emerge naturally from Elara’s vocation and the image of ten thousand chips storing “essential metaphors.” The contrast between the void swallowing names and a single flower of “winter jasmine” blooming forever in an emerald is a strong, particularized thematic answer to what can be saved from death. The explicit line “This was her art: not to delay death, but to steal from it the one thing worth keeping” edges toward on-the-nose but is supported by prior imagery enough not to feel like a grafted thesis. The ending’s quiet dedication as both blessing and burial offers a resonant, non-moralizing close.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of forgiveness, rebirth as choice, and contentment-in-tending are beautifully woven through recurring particulars—the scallop pattern, the hairpin, the pruning, Mrs. Chen’s sorrow. The final insight that “contentment’s source was not within the grapes or the magic or the memories, but within the tending itself” clearly reweights the entire story. However, several sentences state the thesis in near-essay form (“Now, at sixty winters, Elara understood…”, “In the profound vineyard hush, she finally understood…”), edging toward didactic rather than fully subtextual. The resonance is strong, but the moral is slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of nuance vs. black-and-white judgment and “truth as more than a single note” are coherent and consistently threaded via shard, cloak, and chimes. However, the story leans heavily on explicit thematic statements (“truth is never a single note,” “welcome nuance into certainty”), dulling subtext and veering toward sermon. The symbolic system is clear but sometimes over-explained rather than allowed to resonate through image and action. The ending offers a satisfying conceptual answer, but it is told almost as a thesis rather than discovered obliquely.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme is strong and coherent: visibility through disappearance, the cost of knowledge and teaching, time reversed as both gift and sacrifice. Recurring motifs (ripples, magnetic pulse, sycamore hush, vanishing/appearing) are well woven and reweighted at the end when Mira literally becomes both stone and ripple. However, the text sometimes states its thesis too directly (“The lesson was complete: vanish not into nothing, but into the embrace of the infinite”), tipping toward explanation instead of leaving more work to subtext. The piece still leaves a lingering conceptual and emotional resonance around mortality and self-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of stillness-as-journey, reverence for history, and non-physical forms of movement emerge organically from the setting, the taboo on footsteps, and the final realization that “the most important journeys require no physical steps at all.” Recurring images—dust, echoes, inherited objects, bird patterns—quietly repriced by the ending give the piece conceptual resonance. However, the last few sentences lean into explicit statement (“She taught that…”) in a way that edges toward moral summary rather than letting images alone carry the weight. With a touch less didactic framing, the same thematic material could land more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece develops a coherent theme about automation, inefficiency, and the sacredness of the unoptimized, culminating in Vorrin’s choice to embody that inefficiency. Recurring concepts—“lingering luminance,” “brilliant dimness,” mist walking as patience/surrender—are effectively reweighted in the final beat. That said, some lines verge on thesis statement (“In a world where creativity got automated, only the inefficient still recognized inefficiency's value”), blunting subtext by spelling out the argument. The ending image still resonates, but a lighter touch on explicit commentary would enhance its aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of guidance, silence, perception, and vows recur organically through the lamps, lanterns, log, and key tag. The final realization—silence as the “color” that completes his palette—reweights prior images in a satisfying way. However, some phrasing (“vow that hid behind truth,” “some sounds are seen only when the world grows still”) edges toward explicit statement and mild sentimentality. The piece still leaves a resonant afterimage, but with less ambiguity than a top-tier literary venue usually demands.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of determinism vs agency, honoring lost realities, and living as signal instead of savior emerge organically from particulars like backwards prophecy, fossilized timelines, and static-as-loss. The story resists tidy morals, allowing her “quiet enthusiasm” and “stellar doubt” to coexist in the closing image. The final line (“Having been, she will be”) effectively reprices the premise with an elegant temporal paradox. At times, the language edges toward overt abstraction (“the very will that had sustained creation”), which slightly blunts the otherwise strong subtextual work.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of sacrifice, the limits of empathy, and the ambivalent power of naming are richly woven through recurring images of monsters, light, and recorded last words. The final mirror and the line about “the monster who collects monsters” sharply reframe the premise and complicate any simple heroism in her role. However, several sentences state the theme a bit too directly (“naming fears didn’t banish them—it only gave them shape, form, and the dignity of being known”), tipping from resonance into mild essayistic explanation. The piece would feel more elite if it trusted its images and let readers infer those conclusions.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of fragile faith, the power of patience over force, and small human acts nudging a vast cosmos emerge organically from the bell, the dripping, and Kael’s “lukewarm” magic. The recurring images of imbalance/balance and brittle devotion that becomes quiet strength are cohesive and reweighted by the ending. The final paragraphs do verge on explicitness (“the cosmos was a little more balanced, one drip at a time”) but stop short of didactic moralizing. The piece leaves a resonant sense of humble repair, though with less ambiguity and complexity than the very top tier would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of buried history, communal memory, and the ethics of storytelling are coherent and supported by recurring motifs (water as mirror, drowned town resurfacing, the sapphire distillery remnants). The final image—Nora carrying the “truth like a lantern” into a star-reflecting hush—reweights earlier images in a satisfying way. However, some thematic material is over-explicit (“stories, like water, could be still on the surface yet teeming beneath”; “people who deserved to know their history, to share in its meaning”), edging into thesis statement rather than purely emergent resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    The thematic core—order and chaos, logic and intuition as lovers rather than enemies—is woven through recurring motifs (starlings, crystal vs. birds, orchard roots, pressed violets). Her insight at the end arises credibly from witnessed patterns, not from abstract lecture, and the birds’ living geometry nicely grounds the philosophical turn. A few sentences verge on thesis-statement territory (“She understood now: to harmonize…”), slightly flattening what is otherwise rich subtext. Still, the closing synthesis of equations and petals, spirals and starlight, resonates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of vigilance, stewardship, and “the watcher’s burden” are coherently woven through the repetitions of trust, silence, and the enduring duty that “never fully vanish[es].” The parachute buckle and the city’s ignorance serve as respectable symbolic anchors for responsibility and unseen labor. However, the story tends toward reiteration rather than development; it circles the same insight instead of arriving at a sharper repricing of what the burden means to him now versus then. The closing lines affirm his ongoing watch rather than reconfiguring the premise in a surprising or more complex way.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central theme—survival through integration rather than sterile transcendence—is coherent, grounded in his history of ego death and the literal merging with the DUPLICATE brain. The last act offers potent images (tears cutting “salt trails,” stepping off the dissolving edge) that embody the thematic stance. However, several lines slide into explicit moralizing (“No more katas without heart, no more technique without soul, no more enlightenment without the mess of being alive”), reducing subtext and ambiguity. The insight feels earned but over-articulated for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of innovation, orthogonal thinking, and nurturing the uncanny are clear but heavily spelled out in near-identical phrases rather than earned through implication. Lines like “true creativity thrived when problems were approached from orthogonal angles” and “ensuring that every seed of imagination might find fertile ground” read as thesis statements. The corpse flower, brook, and storm silence could hold rich subtext about beauty/repulsion, risk, or time, but the piece seldom lets them speak indirectly. The ending does reassert the nature/innovation parallel, yet it lands closer to inspirational rhetoric than layered resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of grief, the work of tending the unspoken, and what a “true haunting” might be emerge organically from actions (the macerating wind, the off-key lullabies, the call between siblings). The recurring images—leaf blower symphony, macerated silence, the tunnel—shift meaning by the end toward caretaking rather than fear. However, the final paragraph edges into explicit thesis (“A true haunting does not frighten; it holds… It tends to what we cannot say”), which slightly undercuts the otherwise implicit resonance. Even so, the emotional aftereffect is strong and specific rather than sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme is rich and well-integrated: light vs. darkness, knowledge vs. uncertainty, exile vs. translation, all braided through the pendant and the guardian’s evolving role. The idea that “some truths existed only in shadow, and that certainty was the truest illusion of all” is enacted via the guardian’s choice to wait beside an unrealized door rather than stated as a detached thesis. Recurring images (boundary of light, veil of sleep, home as a way of waiting) deepen in meaning by the end. The main weakness is some on-the-nose abstraction (“home was a way of waiting,” “to lose the need for answers”) that edges toward aphorism rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of creative destruction, the trap of hope, and interrupting inherited destinies are rich and organically linked to the embers, the crozier, and the journals. The final choice not to look back and to accept “the beauty of the incomplete” is a resonant thematic answer. However, several lines slide into explicit thesis-stating (“The penny was never currency, but a weight that tipped the scale of acceptance,” “hope itself had been the trap”), which blunts subtext and feels a touch sermon-like. More reliance on image and less on articulated insight would lift this to a truly elite thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of listening versus broadcasting, beginnings nested in endings, and silence as generative rather than empty are rich and coherent with the concrete action of dismantling and rewiring. The “shard of hush as seed” image nicely reweights earlier material and aligns her internal arc with the world’s reconfiguration. That said, the thematic statements are frequently explicit (“Every ending… contained compressed within it the code for what came next”), edging into essayistic explanation rather than leaving more resonance in subtext. The wisdom feels mostly earned but could trust image and implication a bit more.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of “permanent transient,” home as motion, and possibility within emptiness are coherent and well-linked to the recurring hourglass and vanishing ferry. The ending reweights these ideas effectively: Lina as “anchor and sail” in a world where every moment is a bridge. However, the story leans on explicit thematic phrasing (“permanent transient world,” “emptiness could be full of possibility”) instead of trusting images, edging toward mild sentimentality. Greater reliance on dramatized moments over repeated thesis statements would deepen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of connection, control vs surrender, and the boundary between rational magic and shared hallucination are woven tightly through images (thread, mirror, water) and the final realization. The shift from treating connection as manipulable sinew to inhabitable medium lands well and reweights earlier details. However, the ending edges toward explicit thesis (“The rational enchantment had resolved into simple truth: some connections...”), slightly flattening what’s otherwise rich subtext. Still, the piece invites reflection and lingers conceptually beyond its word count.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, inheritance, and carrying external guidance internally are well woven through the anchor, edge geometry, and the benthic setting; the idea that “what anchors you can guide you” is a strong, earned motif. However, the prose occasionally edges toward direct thematic statement (“Edge geometry became a philosophy…”) that tells the thesis rather than fully trusting the images and actions. The final beats—Corin’s internal constellation, Mara feeling the chain link “lighten,” and the notion of aliens giving a way to carry stars inside—provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The ambiguity about whether this is practical navigation or spiritual practice enriches rather than confuses.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of listening, liminality between living and dead, and unplanned/“incidental” heroism are coherent and arise from concrete events and recurring images (pulses, photograph, mist, hush). The idea of protecting vulnerable voices is dramatized rather than purely stated. However, the ending edges toward mild explicitness (“for this is my purpose: to listen, to protect, to assure”), nudging into near-thesis territory. Resonance lingers, but the piece leans slightly on articulation where an image-only close could have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: corporate erasure versus the persistence of human traces, and the ethical duty of remembrance in a hyper-technological world. Images of cables carrying cat videos and banking data above, while ghostprints of the dead persist below, create potent thematic contrast without overt moralizing. Marek’s role as a “living anchor” who refuses to collect data, only to witness, offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question. A few lines (“invisible to quarterly reports and profit margins”) come close to thesis-stating and could be rendered slightly more obliquely for maximal subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of failure as map, fracture as guide to mending, and the kinship between digital and bureaucratic ghosts are well seeded and recur in concrete images (shattered teacup, splintered code, cracks). The final realization—that she will “mend her own life as she had mended the ghost” and carry the shard as a token of lesson—is coherent and emotionally plausible. However, the ghost’s line “In failure, there is a map; each crack teaches the path to mend” and later paraphrases edge into direct thesis-statement territory, softening subtext into moral. The resonance is genuine but somewhat over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of language death, translation, memory vs meaning, and what constitutes a “voice” emerge organically from concrete particulars (stone texture, bird patterns, echoes) rather than abstract treatises. The ending’s notion of “a voice without need of ears” reweights everything before it, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening problem. However, some lines state the thematic thesis too directly (“some languages die so completely they cannot be mourned,” “the curse had been a gift after all”), slightly reducing subtextual subtlety. Despite this, the emotional aftereffect is strong and conceptually rich.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of grief, transformation, and turning despair into laughter are coherent and tied to recurring images (frost, thaw, static, cosmic joke). However, the piece often states its themes directly (“She had come here to turn that bitterness into a cosmic joke”) instead of trusting implication and subtext. The ending resolves into a relatively tidy moral—that darkness can be turned into playful harmony—without much lingering ambiguity or counter-pressure. Resonance is pleasant but closer to affirmation than complex reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of beauty as risk, resistance to mechanization, and reclaiming stolen humanity emerge strongly from the imagery and plot (hearts replaced by metronomes; music as living signal). However, the closing paragraphs lean into explicit thesis statements (“beauty was not memory to preserve but rhythm to risk,” “waiting for someone brave enough…”) that edge into moralizing. The resonance is still effective, but subtext gives way to statement at the end. A lighter touch there would elevate the thematic sophistication significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of borders, broken promises, and fragile connection emerge naturally from the mailman’s history, the liminal setting, and the storm-in-a-bottle motif. The bottle and drone literalize the idea of “linking absences,” and the final delivery partially repairs the earlier failure without pretending to erase war or guilt. A few lines (“hoping to heal that wound, to find a place where broken promises might mend”) skate close to explicit theme-stating but don’t tip into sermonizing. The final charged poise—he will return tomorrow, still chasing impossible healing—invites reflection beyond the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of silence as possibility, rebirth from abandonment, and hope as a quiet craft emerge clearly from recurring images (halo, spring, bells, mist). However, the story leans into explicit statement—“He believed that silence was not emptiness but a field of possibility,” “every silence was a seed”—which edges toward essayistic moralizing instead of letting images and events carry all the weight. The final reconfiguration of silence as song and sanctuary is resonant but also somewhat tidy and declarative. Subtext exists but is partially overwritten by directly named insights.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of recursion, memory, and the mutual possession of reader and story are woven deftly through concrete images: books as black holes, event horizons at dog-ears, stories literally rewoven into patrons’ analog memories. The final realization—that “the place where stories live is not a location, but a recursion” and that “the stories they held now held them back”—reweights the whole library and her decades of work in a resonant way. There is slight over-explicitness in the last lines (“because stories never truly end—they only fold and refold”), which edges toward stating the thesis rather than entirely trusting the images. Still, the conceptual and emotional aftereffect is coherent, layered, and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—longing, capture versus release, and the value of luminous absence—emerges organically from recurring images (palette, empty well, sunrises, cipher) rather than external commentary. The final understanding that “longing itself was true subject” and that nothing is lost, only translated, reweights earlier events in a satisfying conceptual repricing. At times, phrasing approaches overt thesis (“Cipher of longing had taught her…”) and repeats insight in slightly varied language, which flattens the subtext a bit. Still, the emotional aftereffect is coherent and resonant, with the empty well as an effective non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of truth versus fear, unconditional love, and the non-transactional nature of forgiveness emerge organically from the ritual and Merrin’s craft. The freeing of the idea literalizes an internal, generational blockage without feeling like pure allegory. A few lines tread close to aphorism (“Ideas are stubborn things, and fear is a persistent gardener”), but they’re grounded enough in the scene to avoid full sermonizing. The final image of Merrin holding her own stray hair reweights the entire premise with a quiet, resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of curiosity, memory as archive vs theft, and the danger of “reassembling broken constellations” are coherent and recur through concrete motifs (faerie bargains, shipwreck/star mappings, living keys). The reframing of the faeries as archivists and the final acceptance that some mysteries should remain unsolved give a satisfying conceptual aftertaste. However, several lines articulate thesis-level commentary directly (“The chronically curious… are doomed to become the stories they chase”), edging into moralizing rather than letting image and action fully carry the weight. The piece gestures at complexity but occasionally overstates what it has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of resilience, chosen exile, and intergenerational mentorship are well woven through recurring images (swing, shadow, spiral) and the archivist’s ultimate refusal to leave. The closing redefinition of exile as “a door that swings both ways” and the framing of resilience as rising after the wind pushes you back give the piece conceptual coherence. Yet several explicit thematic statements (“Resilience, she decides, is not about never falling...”) verge on essayistic moralizing, blunting subtext that was already clear in the images. A bit more trust in implication—and less direct definition—would lift the thematic resonance considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece carries a coherent and resonant theme about wonder as something to be woven and circulated rather than hoarded, and about creativity as sacrificial, world-shaping labor. The heirloom seed, reversed waterfall, and door-bearing trees all support a conceptual revaluation of how worlds interdepend. That said, the story undercuts some of its subtlety with explicit thesis lines (“Wonder must be woven, not guarded”; “a sacrifice that was not a taking, but a giving of form”), shading toward overt moralizing. The resonance is genuine but a bit didactically underlined.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of silence as burden vs. shared harbor, brokenness as structure, and transformation of shrouds into maps are organically woven through objects (net, pearl, masks) and actions (unravelling, exhuming). The final images (pearl as birth, masks as small sanctuaries, “geography of survival”) resonate and reweight prior material effectively. Yet the piece occasionally tips into explicit thesis-stating (“the brokenness wasn’t in the asking, but in the carrying alone”), which slightly undercuts subtextual power. Overall, the thematic spine is strong, but some insights are told where they could be left wholly in image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of listening to silence, bridging known and unknown, and ethical attention to erased voices emerge coherently from Elena’s profession and her behavior in the chapel. Recurring images of tears, stone, silence, and mapping build a clear argument about how discovery should be approached. However, the story leans into explicit statement—lines like “the unknown becomes known through listening” and “not with loud proclamation” verge on thesis, reducing ambiguity. The resonance is genuine but somewhat over-articulated for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of grief, memory, and the persistence of messages are woven tightly through objects and setting; “The message persists. The sender is gone.” encapsulates this powerfully. The recurring snow/globe/decay motifs support an organic meditation on what it means to “let go” while still holding. However, some lines become overt thesis statements (“Letting go occurs when the object of loss becomes the subject of study”), tipping into aphoristic telling rather than leaving more work for subtext. This slight didactic edge keeps the piece just below elite-tier thematic subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of art as code, the persistence of voices, and the transformation of pain into shared song are well-integrated through recurring motifs (graffiti, song, mist, bolt plate, unspoken needs). The final image of the ghost’s song drifting upward and into the world conceptually reweights earlier details without lapsing into explicit moralizing. Some formulations (“turning pain into poetry, silence into sound”) sit close to thesis statements, brushing up against sentimentality but not fully tipping over. Overall, the thematic throughline is coherent and resonant if somewhat on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of perception, attention, and the discovery of joy beneath suffering are woven deftly through the optical metaphor of ice, light, goggles, and encryption. The captain’s line “Kai's presence has been my decryption key” neatly fuses concept and theme without feeling inorganic. However, the closing paragraph steps into overt thesis territory (“In this way, stories unfold not through force, but through attention…”), edging toward essayistic moralizing rather than letting the images alone carry the resonance. That explicitness undercuts some of the otherwise well-earned subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, grief, scientific dismissal, and the idea that “empty spaces remember” are richly woven through concrete motifs (cloud-emotions, magnetic spools, the gondola as archive). The reconception of emptiness as human silence around Thorne’s story is a strong conceptual turn. Yet the story repeatedly states its thesis (“Empty spaces remember because they are never truly empty—only waiting for the right witness. / That was the point.”), edging into overt moralizing that blunts subtextual power. More trust in image and implication, less in explicit thematizing, would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—limits versus the infinite, and the idea that some limits are only found in attempting to surpass them—is well woven into objects (coin, fractal detail, sky, tree) and the final repricing of what “seeing” means. However, the story undercuts its own subtlety with explicit thesis statements (“some limits could only be discovered by trying to surpass them,” “his blindness a gift that revealed the world’s hidden geometry”). These lines verge on overt moralizing rather than letting the prior images speak. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but a bit over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Curiosity, legacy, and the tension between solitude and connection emerge naturally from the phrasebook, the breadcrumbs left by a predecessor, and the recurring images of starlings and light. The revelation that the dog-ear was a deliberate breadcrumb nicely reframes Elara as both heir and future source of guidance. However, some lines edge toward neat aphorism (“every great discovery begins with a single, diligent question”), and the thematic resolution feels harmonious rather than hard-won. The complexity of “sociable isolation” could be sharpened with more visible cost or ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of repair, memory, and the persistence of past selves are coherent and reinforced by repeating images (gears as heartbeats, thawing ice, moving reflections). However, the piece often states its insights directly (“every broken thing holds a ghost of its wholeness,” “even the smallest piece could hold the universe together”), drifting toward platitude. There is little counter-pressure or ambiguity challenging the idea that repair is both possible and benign; complexity is low. Still, the final image of her carrying a small gear as a personal, ongoing responsibility offers a modest, resonant answer to the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme around collective effort, intergenerational guidance, and hope that persists through difficulty is coherent and well integrated with recurring images (chalk spirals, the bell, the nebula). The final spiral and phrase “brambled hope was the essence of their resilience” offer a clear, resonant take on tangled yet enduring community futures. That line, however, tips into explicit thematic labeling rather than letting the images carry the weight. Complexity is present but somewhat smoothed; the narrative rarely risks genuine moral or emotional ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of mercy in endings, silence as a form of love, and the salvific power of brokenness emerge organically from the puppet, her vocation, and the final reconfiguration of the clock. Recurring images (nested spirals, hush, the broken head, “beautifully flawed”) genuinely shift meaning by the end, especially when she “had become the lullaby she promised.” There is some near-moralizing phrasing (“she had found the only mercy that time could offer”) that edges toward explicit thesis. Still, the piece mostly trusts image and situation to carry its conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme arises organically from particulars: the curse of unseen labor, inheritance of obligation, and the paradox of something both poisonous and salvific (orchard vs. nuts). The grandmother’s maxim and the final return to “graceless in her duty, beautiful in its execution” crystallize a stance on duty and loneliness without moralizing. The quiet ending—saving strangers who never know she exists—offers resonant commentary on unacknowledged caretakers. Ambiguity remains (is the curse purely malign or also a calling?), which keeps the piece rich rather than pat.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of turning separation into connection and grief into an ongoing braid with the living world are coherent and organically tied to polymers, rivers, and music. The chrysalis and braided ravine recur with shifted meaning at the end, giving some resonance. However, the piece leans into explicit thematic statements (“separation could be transformed into connection,” “her atonement was not a single act”) that edge toward didactic, reducing subtextual charge. The moral/emotional takeaway lands clearly but with less ambiguity or complication than a top-tier literary piece would sustain.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    The thematic weave—beginnings emerging from quantified absence, parole as conditional freedom, fragmentation as integrated whole—is rich and consistent across images of light, silence, and negative space. Lines like “Stories don't start with words… They start in the silence before them” and the composting of discarded narratives into new books embed the thesis in concrete operations. The ending’s conceptual repricing—that freedom is found in what has been incised away—reweights everything prior. At times the piece edges toward explicit essaying of its ideas, but it largely avoids moralizing and sustains a layered resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of memory, guilt, and the ethics of alleviating pain versus erasing the lost are woven through concrete images (sandpapering, yeast-like sorrow, fossilized pools) rather than stated as morals. The decision not to fully “sandpaper” the daughter, and the final bread carrying “the ghost of a daughter’s hand,” offer a non-literal, resonant answer: pain can be shared and transformed but not cleanly undone. The piece resists sentimentality by keeping the cost active and ongoing—the vessel must remain brittle yet unbroken. Ambiguity around whether this burden is sustainable invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of language, listening, and communal repair emerge organically from recurrent images (silos, bridges, songs, clock) and are integrated with the plot. The multilingual chorus as a literal and figurative bridge is a strong, earned metaphor. However, some late lines (“She had learned that to rehabilitate a community, one must first hear its silences”) drift into explicit moral statement, softening the piece’s subtlety. The ending is still resonant, but slightly over-articulated rather than fully entrusted to image and scene.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—memory as landscape, restoration versus erasure, the cost of excavation—is woven tightly through recurring images of canyons, mirrors, and dreams. The ending offers a clear conceptual repricing: the idea that “all canyons are ultimately mind” reweights everything prior. However, some lines verge on thesis statements (“to excavate the past is to modify the present's synaptic foundation”), slightly blunting subtlety. Still, the resonance is strong and lingers beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The themes of vigilance, hidden knowledge, and the moral duty to guard history are coherent and echoed by recurring images (prism, threshold, serpents, latent blaze). The final quiet scene with the spent doodle and prism as “sentinel” provides a resonant, if gentle, reweighting of those motifs. However, the piece leans toward explicit labeling (“seeds of vigilance,” “latent blaze”) rather than letting implications and concrete moments carry the thematic weight. The ambiguity around what such vigilance might cost her in the future remains largely unexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of empathy, silence as fullness, and art as connective tissue are coherent and well-integrated with recurring images (cracks as music, the grove as sanctuary). The final notion that “music does not conquer silence but lives within it” effectively crystallizes the story’s question. However, several theme statements are made quite directly (“The silence not empty; it is full of music”), edging into mild moralizing rather than trusting image alone. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere but not especially complex.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of sacrifice, mentorship, political versus personal loyalty, and beauty in morally difficult choices emerge organically from the chess motifs, the eclipse, and Kael’s method of “translating silence.” Recurring images (queen sacrifice, stone dent, eclipse, absence as language) are reweighted in the final beats, especially in the idea that his greatest move is to disappear so Mira can remain free. The line “The difficult beauty was this…” flirts with explicit thesis but is earned by prior scene work and doesn’t collapse into moralizing. The ending invites reflection on absence-as-gift without insisting on a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic coherence around silence as a medium for empathy and love is strong, and the line in the diary (“Silence is the shape of love when words fail”) is a powerful thematic keystone. However, the last third leans into explicit articulation (“She realized that empathy was not a destination…,” “In doing so, she hoped to map the path to empathy…”) that borders on essayistic moralizing. The piece would be stronger if more of this were left to image and implication. Despite that, the final silence “full of every unheard voice” leaves a resonant conceptual afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of decay feeding life, beauty coexisting with dread, and stillness within motion are coherent and consistently woven through corpse flower imagery, village transformation, and Elias’s reflections. However, the story frequently states its meanings outright (“The seed teaches that stillness is not absence…”; “wisdom often hides in the most pungent of places”) rather than allowing subtext and image to carry them. The ending lands as gently didactic rather than hauntingly ambiguous. Resonance is present but somewhat over-explained and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of resilience as growth through damage rather than around it is coherent and well-seeded in the world’s seasonal die-off and the orchard’s anomalous survival. The arrow tip/seed fusion and the encoded “genetic grief” of the cyclone nicely suggest that survival wisdom is born of accumulated loss. However, the closing paragraphs slide into explicit thesis statements (“resilience accelerates not despite damage, but because of it”; “nothing more than the courage to grow backward into one's roots…”) that read as overt moralizing rather than fully earned inference. This undercuts what could have been a more obliquely resonant, image-driven ending.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of convergence, interdependence of systems (sea/sky, wind/steel, silence/violence), and foresight in the face of hidden risks are clear and organically tied to the work she does. The flight engineer’s patch as a link between air and ground is effective, and the “web of converging forces” motif resonates conceptually. However, some lines edge toward thesis-statement abstraction (“a reminder that the world was a web of converging forces”), and the thematic field stays relatively safe and singular. It’s thoughtful but not yet layered or surprising enough to linger deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of wonder as essential is coherent and threaded throughout, but it is often delivered in declarative, thesis-like language (“to certify wonder as essential,” “certified by a bell ringer’s brave act”). The piece leans on explicit statements instead of letting images and consequences fully carry the meaning. The transformed cavern and sculptor’s altered practice offer strong thematic images, yet the closing paragraphs tip into sermonizing. This reduces ambiguity and compresses the story into a neat moral rather than a resonant question.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of failure as portal, guardianship as an enduring moral burden, and silence as a generative space are coherent and recur through material particulars (markers, flute, canyon hush). The ending’s idea—bearing the flute as “bridge” rather than relic and embracing the “door closed but not locked”—nicely reweights earlier images. However, key insights are sometimes spelled out in thesis-like lines (“He realized that the failure he had tried to escape was not a wall but a door”), reducing subtext and ambiguity. More reliance on image and implication, less on explicit naming, would elevate its literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thematically, the story engages rich questions about empathy as a bidirectional current and the limits of reducing feeling to formal systems, and it earns a nuanced final stance: an open problem rather than a solved theorem. The recurring motif of equations (differential equations, sine waves, “Empathy = DeltaSelf / DeltaOther”) is well integrated with character and world. However, several lines lapse into overt statement—“He realized the experiment was flawed; emotion could not be solved like a linear equation”—which flattens what the imagery and events already imply. The result is resonant but slightly over-explicit, where a touch more reliance on subtext would strengthen it.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory becoming myth, legacy, and wonder emerging from routine are coherent and woven through pendant, aurora, and the time-skip. The final image of an old courier still walking with only the pendant’s “echo in his chest” offers a quiet, resonant answer about how brief acts outlive names. That said, the text leans into explicit thematizing with repeated phrases like “the fade from memory to myth” and spelled-out legend, edging toward overstatement rather than trusting implication. Complexity is present but not deeply probed; the moral calculus remains relatively simple and affirming.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of attention, memory, and the paradox of “truthful lies” emerge organically from the objects and actions rather than being bolted on. The way deception, fiction, and scientific method braid together—she must stage a kind of beautiful fraud to reveal a deeper truth—feels conceptually rich and specific to this setup. The ending’s claim that the discovery “made itself known through her” reweights everything that came before without collapsing into a simple moral. Occasional explicit formulations of theme (“This was the truthful lie at the heart of her work”) are slightly more didactic than necessary in an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—reciprocity rather than revenge, the cost of connection, and the transformation of grief into a completed silence—is woven through objects and actions rather than overt moralizing. Recurring motifs (loom, bead, puzzle, silence) clearly reweight at the end, and the idea that Mei retains only “the memory of giving” is a strong, non-literal answer to the story’s question. The line “not revenge, but reciprocity” edges toward thesis-statement clarity, slightly flattening ambiguity. Overall, the piece invites reflection without closing interpretive space, but it could sustain more moral/tensional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of resilience, sacrifice, and revaluing meekness emerge naturally from the barter and the transformed arches/orchards, with strong imagistic echoes (azure, copper, courage). Yet the final paragraphs also articulate the thesis quite directly (“resilience is not found, but coaxed…,” “the true magic had been the barter itself”), tipping into explicit moralizing that undercuts some of the otherwise earned resonance. The piece would feel more literary and less didactic if it trusted the images and actions to carry more of that weight.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of cyclical duty, inherited failure, and reinterpreting “burden” as “compass” are coherent and integrated with the shard and dream frame. However, the story undercuts its own subtext by stating its thesis outright—lines like “the weight of a withheld truth was not a burden to be shed, but a compass” read as moral summary. The best material is in the implications of the predecessor’s fragmented spirit and the shard’s returns, which could stand on their own. As is, the ending feels more explained than quietly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of safety, loneliness, unseen connection, and the burdens of caretaking emerge convincingly from the particulars of the lighthouse, the secret correspondence, and the ghost. The act of literally bottling a feeling and placing it in the letter-chain cairn ties premise and theme in a concrete, satisfying way. However, some lines verge on thesis (“The lamp may falter, but the feeling of safety, once bottled, never fades”; “safety bottled”) and lightly undercut subtext. The final sense of “luminescent ache” lingers, offering resonance beyond neat moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of old vs digital media, past vs future, and hope emerging from “ancient shadows” are coherent and recur through concrete motifs (newspapers, shadows of forgotten ships, the lighthouse beam). Yet the piece leans into direct thesis statements—“The new dawn is carved from the shadows of the past!” and “a beacon of hope that no digital screen could replicate”—that edge into overt moralizing. The resonance is pleasant and clear but risks feeling platitudinous rather than deeply earned. Ambiguity and moral complexity are limited, which caps the depth of aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story’s thematic core—stories as something held in bodies, exchanged like hearts, and “remembered” by light—is strong and organically tied to the craft, the donor organ, and the visitors’ responses. Recurring motifs (sun trails, pigment, mist, the space between beats) do real work in reweighting meaning by the end. Yet the piece undercuts its own subtlety with on-the-nose thesis statements (“It is not the heart that draws stories…”; “stories are not magnetized; they are given, received…”; “to magnetize stories, one must…”) that read like direct moralizing. Those explicit formulations make the climax feel slightly didactic rather than fully earned through scene and image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of grief, memory, and “mundane miracles” are woven consistently through images—the stones, quantified sorrow, everyday acts like a lullaby or a prayer—and culminate in the revaluation of the labyrinth as a map of hope. Subtextually, the work suggests that attention and maintenance (her broom, her job) are forms of prayer, which is strong. However, the story leans into explicit statement—“the labyrinth's purpose was not to trap sorrow, but to transform it into a map of hope”—where a bit more reliance on image might have deepened resonance. The ending is affecting but slightly tidy and thesis-forward.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of communal memory, sacrifice, and the way songs/communities “knit” worlds together emerge organically from events and recurring images rather than from explicit moralizing. The shift from withered trees and silenced songs to a perpetual dawn where communities are re-bound gives the final image strong resonance. Elias’s self-erasure to restore collective continuity supports a complex, bittersweet tone of “bound release.” Some statements (“a song said to bind the scattered realms and knit communities together”) skate close to being thesis-y, but they’re still embedded in story logic rather than commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of paradox, solitude vs. connection, and “wisdom in error” are coherent and recur through objects (invitation, mirror-book) and images (nested paradoxes, hiding in plain sight). However, they are frequently stated outright—“the greatest hiding place is plain sight, the deepest wisdom lives in error”—in a way that verges on thesis and reduces subtext. The ending reframes her five-year “mistake” effectively, but it does so in explicitly didactic language rather than letting image and action carry more of the burden. Resonance is present, but the moral is somewhat over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of memory, sacred ordinariness, and communal complicity in erasure are woven through recurring images (bread, seedlings, tea, birds) and culminate in the ritual of scattering crumbs into soil. The final coda, where the public garden and autumn bread-offering persist, reweights the earlier secret acts as the seed of a new civic sacrament. That said, some lines lean toward thesis-stating (“We let so many things disappear by calling it progress…”) and slightly blunt the subtext. The piece still achieves a genuine afterglow, but with a touch of overt moralizing that keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of memory, meaning, and resistance to oblivion are cohesive and carried through recurring images (vows, light, edge of oblivion). However, they’re often stated in near-identical abstract language rather than emerging from concrete, pressurized choices, edging toward pseudo-profundity. The ending affirms hope and preservation but does so explicitly—“a testament to meaning,” “not silence, but…preserved meaning”—instead of trusting implication. Subtext is minimal; the piece tells us its thematic stance instead of letting it fully accrue from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of trust, betrayal, and the ethics of silence are tightly woven through the truce-of-hush concept, the mother’s disappearance, and the sound/clock motifs. The idea of “capturing the sound of trust breaking” and carrying it alongside the ticking fob is an effective, concrete embodiment of moral residue. Some lines verge on thesis-like (“trust, once broken, can be measured in the smallest of sounds”), nudging toward over-articulation rather than letting images do all the work. Still, the final image meaningfully reweights what came before and leaves a resonant unease.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of consensus, emergent systems, and the limits of rational explanation are woven through motifs of voting forests, an emergent compass, and weather as a “ballot” between sky and land. The final choice—to sense and carry the truth privately rather than speak or prove it—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial question. Some thematic statements verge on explicit moralizing (“Some phenomena must be sensed, not solved”; “some truths were meant to be sensed, not spoken”), softening the subtextual power the images already carry. Nonetheless, the conceptual repricing of “weather-carrier” from anomaly to governance mechanism is rich and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of inescapable calling, grief as a precursor to renewal, and creativity as both prison and liberation are coherent and tied to concrete images (lock, cave, dawn, laughter). However, the text often states its themes outright (“some callings are inescapable,” “her creativity had never truly been corked”) rather than letting them fully emerge from action and image. The tomb-to-womb and dawn motifs give a resonant final cadence, but the piece edges toward tidy moral rather than lingering complexity. The emotional aftereffect is moving yet slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thematic throughline—truth vs. dishonesty, candor as nourishment, memory as an oasis—is coherent and strongly supported by recurring images (gold leaf, wilting leaves, water/oasis, archive tapes). The final realization that “every small honest moment creates a leaf that never wilts” and that the “oasis of memory” won’t dry is resonant. That said, several lines state the theme quite directly (“Each small lie had been a drop of poison, wilting her from within”), edging toward moralizing rather than leaving space for subtext. Complexity is present but somewhat simplified in the closing stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic throughlines—language’s insufficiency, truth as resonance, preservation versus transmission of wonder—are coherent and embedded in recurring images of color, sound, and ice. The child’s mind “climbing” the architecture of vibration offers a strong non-literal answer to the central question, and the final repricing of her role lands cleanly. At times the narration edges toward explicit articulation of its ideas (“truth was not a thing to be spoken but a pattern to be revealed”), nudging into near-thesis territory. The piece still invites reflection beyond the page, but the relatively low on-page pressure limits deeper moral or emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of fear as containable chaos, inheritance of memory, and the porous boundary between machine and human are woven through objects (clock spring, moth wing, door photograph), environment (desert roses, sap, dome), and action (controlled burn). The idea of “miniaturizing” fears into manageable dimensions offers an elegant, non-didactic answer to the central question of how to live with inherited terror and static. Emma’s ghostly presence and the final naming of “Emma’s fire” give a poignant sense of continuity and becoming without lapsing into moralizing. There’s complexity and room for multiple readings while still feeling coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of listening as a healing, community-preserving force is coherent and well-threaded through motifs of letters, the caretaker, the locket, and Mira’s methods. However, it is stated directly (“The proof was there, tangible: listening heals”) and reiterated in near-thesis form, reducing nuance. Subtext—grief, fear of gentrification, communal guilt about sealing the letters—exists but is underdeveloped compared to the explicit moral. The ending lands as a clear parable more than a layered, ambiguous resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of vulnerability-as-strength, patience as weapon (spider/web), and embodied language (dance as code) are tightly braided into events and motifs, especially in the final recasting of flood as baptism and dice as talisman. The journal-as-choreography discovered by rescuers provides a nice conceptual repricing of fear into a liberating code. Some lines edge toward explicit moralizing or thesis (“The hangman's dice, now a talisman, reminded her that chance could be tamed by those who dared to dance”), slightly reducing subtlety. Nonetheless, the piece leaves a resonant sense of encoded defiance without collapsing into a neat slogan.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thematic integration of grief, memory, and weight is excellent—gravity pockets as earth’s mourning, salt crystals as condensed forgetting, violets as a fragile, persistent tether. The final image (Mara’s remembered violets, the harbor lantern, distant whale song with “the weight of memories the world tried to delete”) reweights the entire piece without stating a moral outright. There is a mild brush with explicitness in “letting the gleaming silence between them hold the truth—that some things…could be brought back,” but it still grows organically from the story’s language. The piece invites reflection on what can and cannot be recovered without collapsing into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of silence as power, the ethics of erasing warning, and peace versus ignorance are woven coherently through recurring images (hush, cranes, coded water). The ending effectively reframes the ritual as morally ambiguous rather than triumphant, with the line about stealing the brook’s wisdom and the final question about the price of quiet clearly resonant. That said, the theme edges into explicit statement (“what is lost when we quiet the voice of warning?”) instead of fully trusting subtext and image. The piece resists a simple moral, but the last paragraph tells us more than it has to.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory vs. erasure, “agreed-upon lies,” and translation of silence into language are deeply integrated through recurring motifs (the seal, the basement, meteor showers as “punctuation marks”). The final realization—“Now you speak for it”—reweights everything that came before without flattening into a simple moral. Occasional explicitness (“the interrogation of what we choose to remember and what we seal away”) edges close to stating the thesis, but it largely remains embedded in scene and image. The piece invites reflection about history, architecture, and responsibility in a resonant, non-didactic way.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme around independence vs connection, quarantine vs cocoon, and the redefinition of memory is coherent and well-embedded in images (shell, garden, star, “bridge” vs “cell”). The final understanding—that true independence holds presence without being consumed—organically echoes her three-year trajectory. However, several lines state the thesis quite directly (“True independence, she understood now…”; “The quarantined memory wasn't a containment but a cocoon”), which blunts some of the subtextual power. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but slightly over-explained for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of forgiveness, inheritance, and nonviolent resistance are woven through the thorn, seal, and “forgive the unfinished” motif, and the final image of her returning to her studio reweights these ideas nicely. The connection between forging and forgiveness is conceptually strong and grows from concrete acts. That said, the text edges toward statement in places (“a true act of peace,” “the unfinished was at last forgiven”), slightly flattening nuance. The moral terrain stays relatively unambiguous, with limited ethical friction or counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of memory, grief, and the ethics of preservation are coherent, and the final stance—that some echoes are meant to be heard, not solved—reweights earlier material in a satisfying way. Recurring motifs (webs, echoes, the seashell, the canyon’s song) accumulate meaning, especially around the idea of wounds that refuse to heal. However, thematic statements are often made explicitly—“She understood that to echo is to be remembered” and similar lines—rather than arising purely from image and action, edging into mild didacticism. The piece gestures at complexity but resolves rather cleanly into articulated insight instead of letting ambiguity fully do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, salvage, mercy, and the fragility of connections are woven concretely through the snow globes, dreams-as-windows, and the wreck-diving vocation. The repeated idea of “windows of connection” and “borrowed starlight” reframes the work of haunting and listening as an act of care rather than horror. Maya’s lie by omission subtly raises questions about what it means to “weave truth carefully” and whether gentleness can trump factual completeness. The ending’s image of a gift crossing from dream into waking reweights the story toward enduring, if fragile, reciprocity between living and dead.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central theme—valuing hidden effort and perceiving invisible patterns—is clear and thoroughly woven through images of nets, moon paths, and fireflies. However, the text frequently articulates its thesis directly (“to appreciate hidden effort was to see the world as a tapestry…,” “a quiet call to appreciate the hidden effort in every craft”), edging into moralizing rather than trusting subtext. The strongest moments are purely imagistic (the net “breathing,” the tea of night-brew) where meaning emerges without explanation. Complexity is modest; the piece affirms its idea more than it interrogates it.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of manufactured myths as control mechanisms, the ethics of who gets saved, and faith in pattern over authority emerge organically from events and images (the cursed gem, orchard geometry, settlers as shields, “comfortable lies”). The final line—“let them choose their own curse”—nicely reframes both diamond superstition and the moral weight of knowledge, offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on complicity and meritocracy under catastrophe without preaching. A slightly more dramatized clash between truth and community ties could have made the thematic cost even sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—allegiance as a tunable frequency, the weaving of myth and technology, “ancient shadows” teaching “new light”—is coherent and threaded through setting, stakes, and ending. The conceptual turn that the prophet is an age rather than a single person nicely reweights earlier material. However, some lines articulate theme too directly (“allegiance…was not a chain but a frequency—tunable, shifting, alive”), edging toward thesis. The resonance is genuine but somewhat stated rather than fully left to emerge from image and event.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, intergenerational translation, and transforming abandonment into nourishment are strong and concretely grounded in the jars, music box, and exchanged stories. The bee/pollen metaphor and the shift from monetary to narrative “payment” give the piece a satisfying, resonant moral texture. That said, several sentences state the theme quite explicitly (“Her motivation had always been simple: to become the translator between generations”; “She wasn’t just a poet; she was a bee…”) which blunts subtext. With slightly more trust in image over explanation, this could push into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of grief, absolution, and the dual vocation of engineer/keeper emerge organically from the sonic metaphysics and her choices, not from abstract lecturing. The repeated translation of emotion into frequency/amplitude, and sorrow into music, builds a coherent exploration of how structured rationality and deep empathy can coexist and be necessary to each other. The final lines (“She had adapted, as engineers must, but she had also released…”) are a bit on-the-nose but still rooted in concrete events and images, not platitudes. The aftereffect is contemplative and specific rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thematic material around “patient revolution,” the weaponization of waiting, and the unyoking from manufactured urgency is rich and coherently threaded through Elara’s choices, the community’s long delay, and the final mental quiet. Recurring motifs (unyoking, wildness restrained, horizons of possibility) reappear in the close to reweight prior images. Yet the theme is sometimes articulated in thesis-like lines—“waiting was not submission—it was a forge,” “wildness restrained was not wildness diminished”—that slide toward overt moral statement rather than leaving more work to subtext. The resonance is strong but slightly over-explained for elite literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of institutional complicity, the cost of truth-telling, and intergenerational resistance (Underground Railroad → labor safety) are well woven through the lantern motif and the drought/water imagery. The final comparison of truth rising like water neatly reweights the opening image and connects private defiance to systemic change. At times the piece edges toward overt statement (“now the truth would rise like water”; “never again left in the dark”), which slightly flattens ambiguity and emotional complexity. Nonetheless, the thematic throughline is coherent, organically emerges from choices, and leaves a resonant aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of grace, earned meaning, and turning apology into action are rich and organically aligned with the premise and final image. The music box’s repaired heart as a legacy for the victim’s daughter and a mirror for the chaplain’s vocation is thematically strong. However, several lines state the thesis explicitly (“This is how we turn an apology into action,” “It reminded the chaplain of grace—not the easy kind,” “The light through storm clouds wasn’t just metaphor, but the method...”), shading into sermonizing. The piece would be more powerful if it trusted its images a bit more and its commentary a bit less.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of purposeless but insistent striving, self-modifying systems that “want,” and creation for its own sake emerge organically from the workshop’s evolution and Zephyr’s complicity. Lines like “nothing lasted, yet everything tried” and the arrow tip becoming “the tongue of a god” reweight earlier details without sliding into overt moralizing. The final image of an unheard bell ringing across time reframes the entire setting as a kind of devotional act to persistence and future listeners. Complexity is maintained—this endless yearning is both absurd and sacred—but the story avoids engaging much with any darker ethical dimension of giving a machine desire.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory vs. erasure, corporate control of history, and the persistence of the “absent” emerge clearly through the recurring motifs of ghosts, numbers, and songs. The patch, the mirror, and the closing sense of the missing becoming present in “every byte, every note, every number” offer real resonance. Yet the piece leans into explicit thematic statement (“truth, like data, never truly disappears”; “some things cannot be erased”) that borders on moralizing rather than trusting implication. Complexity—especially around the ethics or danger of her defiance—is gestured at more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The core thematic question—empathy versus control, and empathy as action—runs coherently through the crystal’s nature, the boy’s choice, and the community’s reconfiguration. The final images (the pulsing crystal as a heart of many hearts, empathy as compass) are resonant and anchored in concrete motifs. Yet the story repeatedly states its thesis outright (“Magic without empathy was just control in a finer dress,” “Empathy wasn’t a soft thing…”) in a way that drifts into sermonizing rather than trusting subtext. This explicit moralizing in late paragraphs blunts what could be a subtler, more powerful thematic aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of endings, grace, and renewal are well-integrated through recurring images (ice sounds, wind, parasol, dead carried as “ghosts” in her pocket). Her shift from fearing endings to understanding them as reconfigured beginnings is clear and resonant with the final “keeper of small mercies” formulation. However, some lines tilt toward explicit thesis-statement (“Now she understood that the end was a sound you learned to listen for, not a silence”; “every ending could be a beginning”), reducing ambiguity and subtlety. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but could linger more if a few of these were left in image rather than commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic throughline—mismatched love, acceptance of imperfect pairings, and “intersubjective understanding” as a kind of harvest—is clear and consistently echoed in the vines, the letters, and the pavilion’s sunsets. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit statement (“In nurturing intersubjective understanding, he hoped…”) and prompt-like abstractions, which flatten what could be potent subtext. The vine metaphor risks overexposure, and the insight sometimes drifts toward essayistic rather than emergent. There is genuine emotional gentleness, but complexity and surprise are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.7)
    Ideas about truth being “half-masked,” cyclical prophecy, and wisdom as an echo woven into the world are coherent and integrated through repeated motifs. The final cadence—truth as a “quiet seed awaiting the sun”—offers a mild conceptual repricing of the world as a field of latent prophecy. However, the story leans heavily on abstract labels (“echo of wisdom,” “truth”) instead of dramatizing concrete moral or emotional dilemmas, which keeps the thematic effect from deepening. Repetition of phrasing edges toward mantra rather than layered subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic core—healing through incorporation rather than erasure, rearranging wounds into beauty—is organically reinforced by repeated images of ruins, lavender, and photographic arcs. However, the text undercuts its own subtlety by stating its thesis outright (“the deepest truth: that we heal not by forgetting, but by rearranging our wounds into patterns of beauty”), tipping into didacticism. Earlier lines about “cartography of sorrow” and “topography of memory” carry the same ideas more deftly. The ending still resonates, but the explicit moral flattens potential ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    The themes of how knowledge “grows,” what is lost in digitization, and the moral weight of speaking versus silence are deeply woven into object, setting, and action. The crystal’s “testimony,” the last dictionary’s machine-written preface, and Elias’s late understanding that growth is erosion rather than accumulation create a strong, coherent argument without feeling like a lecture. The final recognition that the true pattern lies “in the spaces between [words]” and in the courage to testify offers a resonant reweighting of the entire piece. A few explicit thesis-like lines (“growth was not accumulation but erosion”) slightly reduce the need for reader inference.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges strongly from particulars: obsolete media, magnetic echoes, chalk boundaries, and tide imagery all interrogate memory, time, and the impossibility of holding experience. The final reconfiguration—that clinging to echoes means letting them flow—fits the preceding images and his cost (knowing he’ll forget) without feeling psychologically false. However, explicit thesis lines like “clinging to echoes is not about holding them, but about letting them flow” and “echoes are all we can hold” lean toward authorial moralizing. This slightly flattens what might otherwise be a more powerfully implicit resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres strongly around ephemerality vs constancy, force vs listening, and the attempt to preserve what must still be lost—the “luminous ache” motif effectively reweights the ending. The leaf, light, and spinning hand recur in ways that clarify the story’s argument that small, attentive gestures can reconfigure vast systems. Some thematic statements are a bit on-the-nose (“the leaf… had taught him that even the smallest sound could restructure a universe”), edging toward moralizing rather than pure emergence from scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of hope in the face of death, fragments becoming whole through attention, and music as a bridge across silence are coherently developed through the record shard and the sonic ritual. Recurring motifs—the scent of hope, vinyl, clouds, “radiant haven”—shift meaning by the end to frame hospice work as an art of crafting goodbyes. Some lines edge toward explicit statement and sentimentality (“even in endings, there is a song”; “every farewell could be a masterpiece”), which slightly flattens complexity. Still, the thematic aftertaste is genuine and earned more through image than lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme coheres around knowledge as protection, the ethics of guardianship, and giving dangerous mysteries a place rather than destroying them. The final answer to “where shadows go at noon” reweights the premise nicely: they are contained, not vanished, and must be tended. However, the later paragraphs drift toward overt articulation (“Her name would be whispered… But she cared little for fame”) that edges into neat moral packaging. The piece invites some reflection but doesn’t leave much unresolved complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of certainty as cruelty, myth versus truth, and transforming error into a more honest map are woven coherently through plot, setting, and repeated imagery (bones, constellations, maze/garden). The reframing of “bone setting” from literal forensics to repairing narratives is effective and anchored in concrete stakes (Clara’s parents, the MacLeods, Elena’s career). However, some lines state the thesis too directly (“certainty is a kind of cruelty,” “Failure is just the first draft of memory”), shaving off ambiguity and inviting a slight sense of sermonizing. The final image still carries genuine resonance and invites reflection beyond the explicit statements.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of reflection, non-destructive light, legacy, and the value of stillness emerge organically from sea glass, stars, and communal illumination. The recurring “pearl of stillness” motif effectively ties inner state to tangible object and final constellation in the square. However, the prose increasingly names its insights—“the true gift was not the light itself, but the stillness it carried within”—drifting toward gentle moralizing rather than letting images alone carry the weight. The thematic stance is coherent but a bit tidy, with limited tension or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of truth-telling, the price of integrity, and reclamation of exploitative systems into sanctuaries emerge organically from the particulars—the data center’s past, the algorithm, the moss spirals, the bees’ honey in cable-hives. The amber pendant and icicle-pattern method subtly link preservation of pain to preservation of beauty and resilience over time. The notion of “protected vulnerability” is enacted rather than preached: the garden is both open to growth and shielded from the brutalities of virality and public discourse. The ending image of a bee moving “with infinite care” and the decision to document patterns for others offer a resonant but non-didactic answer about slow, intentional repair.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—about endings as nexuses, the ethics of authorship, and the dignity of “soft” hopes—is rich and coherently threaded through motifs of shells, mist, and cameos. The seashell’s shift from vessel to key and finally monument nicely enacts a conceptual repricing of what stories and hopes are for. Yet the piece often states its insights outright (“he finally knows the difference between writing lives and living them”), which flattens subtext and veers toward essayistic moralizing. More trust in implication and image would deepen its literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of memory, tradition, and the power of song to bind community emerge naturally from the ritual and Elara’s actions. Recurring images (golden stories, gathering hush, harvest moon) support a coherent meditation on how practices survive through collective participation. However, the text sometimes lapses into explicit statement—e.g., “The sacred practice was no longer a relic of the past but a living thread”—which flattens subtext into thesis. The piece offers a pleasant resonance rather than a complex or unsettling reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—transmuting grief into a new form of connection (“a sealing of sorrow, a transformation of loss into geometry”)—emerges organically from the ritual process and object-work. Recurring motifs (starlight, maps, heartbeats, discarded items) meaningfully shift weight by the end, especially the idea of safekeeping love as light. Some thematic lines edge toward explicit statement, slightly reducing ambiguity. Still, the final image of the child asleep by the fire with the luminous plate as a “path of love” has genuine emotional resonance without feeling cheaply sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thematic through-line—about whether wonder and memory should be hoarded or allowed to circulate—is strong and organically embedded in the echo-harvest premise. The shift from storage to release functions as a genuine conceptual repricing of what it means to “store wonder in the cellar of reason.” The final image of angled light and periphery reflections nicely reframes prior motifs. Slightly on-the-nose statements (“This was how one stored wonder in the cellar of reason…”) keep it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of self-forged prisons, the gravity of grief and pride, and the possibility that punishment can be rethreaded into purpose emerge organically from the ritual rather than being stated. The revaluation of the “boundary-lessly trap” as loom and the conversion of burdens into a weightless/heavy sphere provide a strong conceptual repricing of suffering and forgiveness. Recurring motifs—fractal patterns, orientation, calcification, silence—shift meaning by the end in a coherent, resonant way. The piece avoids moralizing, though it edges close to a clean redemptive arc without quite exploring darker counterpoints.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of impermanence, grief as transformation, and the paradox of “containing” memory are organically seeded through images of rain, steam, crystal, and wood. However, the story repeatedly states its thematic conclusions directly (“the lesson was not to hold on, but to let the memory transform,” “to contain a memory is not to freeze it, but to let it flow”), which undercuts subtext and reduces lingering ambiguity. The final realization is consistent with prior beats but leans toward essay-like articulation rather than letting images alone do the work. Emotional aftereffect is genuine but somewhat dulled by explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, regret, self-authorship, and the impossibility of restoring the eroded are well woven through recurring images (fragments, erosion, carousel, lagoon, ghost). The line “You cannot undo what is eroded, but you can weave the fragments into a new vessel” effectively crystallizes the thematic argument but edges close to thesis-statement territory. The final image of collaboration with the ghost in stillness offers a resonant, non-literal answer about living with fractured selves rather than erasing them. Overall, it invites reflection without collapsing into full moralizing, but the explicitness slightly reduces subtlety at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—hope as an engineered flow, infrastructure as emotional as well as functional—is coherently seeded through water, power, data, and community. The sextant, carnival remnants, and redirected systems all support the idea of repurposing obsolete mechanisms into new forms of navigation and wonder. However, the story leans into explicit statement (“Hope equals Flow times Purpose divided by Time”) and meta-language (“equations for hope”) that tip toward didactic rather than purely emergent. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and pleasant, but the moral calculus feels relatively tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of time, grief, legacy, and transformation are woven through clocks, gears, rain, and silence, and the final act of inscribing a clock “for herself alone” offers a resonant, non-literal answer about reorienting one’s life toward the present. Recurring images (petrichor, glacial hush, whisper vs. song) shift meaning by the ending in a satisfying way. However, several lines state the theme quite directly (“She had spent her life recording time, but now time would record her letting go”), edging into explicit moralizing that slightly flattens subtext. The piece still invites reflection beyond its plot, but with less ambiguity than top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of truth vs. constructed history, “architecture of lies,” and the value of silence (morning radio) recur in images and concepts in a coherent way. The sundial, city facades, and tunnels collectively embody how lies structure perception and space. However, the text sometimes edges toward direct thesis statement (“The architecture of lies, she realized, was built on misdirection and forgotten doors”) rather than letting scene and image fully carry the insight. The resonance is present and promising but not yet as layered or disquieting as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of preservation, embodied knowledge, and patience as a moral test emerge organically from particular images (rope as text, seeds as lineage, weavers embedding memory into labor). The idea that true preservation lives in tools and rhythms rather than archives is dramatized instead of preached, with only a few more expository lines (“To preserve ancient methods, one must first prove worthy”) skirting mild authorial summary. The ending reweights the opening atmosphere by showing the dock and fog as pages of an ongoing record, giving a resonant conceptual answer to the question of how knowledge survives catastrophe. The thematic field could deepen further by introducing some sharper tension—e.g., what is lost or contested about who gets this knowledge—but as is, it’s coherent and affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of absence, memorialization, and healing as practice rather than destination recur through objects and images (thread, ship, autumn, golden leaves). The final insight—“The geography of healing... was not a place but a practice, a weaving of loss and hope”—coherently reweights prior material. That line, however, edges into explicit thesis-statement territory, slightly undercutting the subtler work already done by the imagery. The piece still leaves a resonant emotional aftereffect, but with a trace of didactic polish.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of hybrid beauty, flawed creation, and the uneasy marriage of magic and machinery are coherent and well-embedded in recurring images (egg, gears, song, stalactites). The final realization—the acceptance of “a new kind of beauty” that bridges steel and soul—reweights earlier material effectively. However, the text sometimes tips into explicit abstraction (“a hybrid vitality that whispered of a flawed genesis but also of hope”), which flattens subtext and edges toward paraphrasing its own theme. The emotional aftereffect is genuinely bittersweet and contemplative, but a touch less exposition and more dramatized tension would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of redemption, inherited guilt, and compassion transforming damage into music are coherent and supported by concrete motifs (scars as strings, coin as legacy, bird as recipient of grafted hope). However, the text leans into explicit statement—“Maya believed that unyielding compassion could turn even the darkest legacy into light” and “She had proven that scars can sing”—which edges toward thesis rather than leaving space for the reader. The ending offers a resonant answer but it’s a bit tidy, with little ambiguity or counter-pressure. Strongly thematic, but less subtle and layered than the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, historical amnesia, and silence-as-choice versus silence-as-cage are coherently woven through the fountains, the box, and Kael’s role as a skeptical yet luminous figure. The final images—city humming with a “defiant hush,” silence reframed as agency, skepticism as lantern—offer a resonant if gentle repricing of the premise. However, the piece leans into explicit thematic statement (“a reminder that silence could be a choice, not a cage”) rather than fully trusting image and action, which blunts subtlety. The insight is apt but a bit too tidy for the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of generational trauma, legacy, and “safe” forms of destruction are thoughtfully developed through recurring images (light vs. fire, infinity as another kind of burning). The final insight about infinity-as-fire and teaching the child that “light without fire was still a kind of burning” offers a nuanced, non-tidy reframing that lingers. However, some thematic lines verge on explicit statement (“This was the garden's true cruelty…”) rather than letting the images and situation speak entirely for themselves. The piece is resonant and coherent, just slightly over-articulated for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of grief as spiral, communal memory as woven text, and the porous boundary between living and dead are rich and well threaded through ribbons, butterflies, and stone. The final realization—“collective grief was a woven thing”—and the villagers recognizing their own poems provide a resonant answer to the story’s central question. However, a few thematic lines (“Grief isn’t a line,” “The shape you seek… is not in the stone but in the spaces between the words”) edge into explicit statement rather than trusting pure image and action. This slight didacticism keeps it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of shared culpability, foundations gone wrong, and “incremental absolution” accrue organically through motifs of arc, tide, and misaligned time. Marten’s lines about the earth shifting and obsidian swallowing degrees of arc beautifully incarnate the idea that systems can fail honestly while still harming people. The ending’s “absolution wasn’t granted in grand gestures, but accumulated like tide marks” is resonant but edges into explicit thesis-statement territory, nudging toward sermon rather than letting the images alone carry it. Even so, the emotional and conceptual aftertaste is strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of unspoken intentions, grief, and memory are well braided through recurring motifs (tapestry, echoes, cemetery, weaver’s fingers), creating a coherent conceptual fabric. However, the key insight is stated quite directly—“Intentions, he realized, were not always spoken…”—pushing the piece toward exposition rather than letting the image alone carry the weight. The emotional aftereffect is contemplative and honest but relatively safe and tidy. Thematic complexity could be deepened by more ambiguity or friction instead of an articulated takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The themes of innovation under constraint, “mapping ignorance,” and transformation as sustained practice rather than sudden revolution are woven coherently through the images of the spire, the kingfisher, and the geothermal plan. The final lines about writing the future and the kingfisher’s patient dive reweight earlier material effectively without collapsing completely into moralizing. At times the theme edges toward explicit articulation (“The document was not prophecy, but a scaffolded future…”), nudging into thesis territory rather than leaving more space for the reader. Still, the thematic integration feels earned and conceptually rich.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of narrative scarcity, resistance through art, and the transformation of “dust” into carrier of story are woven through concrete motifs (ink, radio, orchestra, mist) rather than overt moralizing. The repeated dust imagery and “story famine” frame a clear meditation on how stories survive in hostile conditions. While the language edges toward incantatory repetition, the final vision of dust as scholars and storytellers reweights earlier images effectively. The piece leans a bit into spelled-out hope but stops short of didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of safety-as-mirage, beauty in illusion, and the necessity of incomplete narratives are clear and supported by recurring images (mask, rocking chair, ash, vanishing point). The final acceptance—“a somber marvel that even in darkness there is a quiet light” and that some truths are best left incomplete—reweights prior material in a coherent way. However, several lines state the theme almost thesis-like (“a method of coping with the incomplete”), reducing subtlety and subtext. The piece is resonant but at times too willing to explain itself.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of epistemology versus propaganda, method versus myth, and which histories get erased are strongly woven through motif (cog, sediment, Council sermons). However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements—“Philosophers… had a duty to preserve method, not mythology” and “truth was a craft, not a comfort”—that edge into essayistic clarity. The final lines similarly verge on spelled-out moral (“the only story worth preserving”), which slightly blunts subtextual resonance. Even so, the conceptual reweighting at the end (math of collapse over any consoling narrative) is coherent and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of listening, negative space, vanishing arts, and the slow work of unlearning hatred are woven tightly through the rosette, the blank scores, and the braiding of voices into a single imperfect chord. The final images—the leaf between Ravel and an erased folk song, the note “Keep carving the silence,” Marco restarting the practice—reweight earlier material in a resonant, non-literal way. Some lines tilt toward explicit statement (“The art of listening, she knew, was vanishing faster than any instrument”), which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the piece largely earns its wisdom from particulars rather than sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of regeneration, memory as living ecology, and “gentle rebellion” against imposed silence are well integrated in actions: pruning, composting memories, drinking vine tea, and sharing seeds. The synaptic plasticity motif gives a conceptual spine to the idea of rewriting collective memory. However, some lines verge on thesis statement (“turning rust into bloom, silence into song”) and the ending leans into tidy uplift rather than complex ambiguity. The resonance is genuine but somewhat didactic and safe for the ambitions implied.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic core—wonder as a necessary current, routine as potential revelation, memory as honey—is beautifully threaded through box, bees, tower, and Mara’s role. The matchbox riddle, the idea that mechanical bees lacked “reverence,” and the city “remembering how to be surprised” all build a coherent, satisfying thematic arc. However, the story sometimes states its thesis too baldly (“The truth was simple: wonder was a current you couldn't generate, only collect”), edging toward essay rather than letting image and action carry it. This explicitness and the relatively soft pressure on the theme keep it below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    Thematic intent is clear: attentive noticing and small, “shard of hush” gestures can sanctify the ordinary world. Recurring motifs—displaced objects, silence as a living thing, houses that breathe—support this idea coherently. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis (“He realized that the act of noticing… was a prayer”; “every act of noticing can sanctify the world”) rather than trusting implication, edging into mild sermonizing. The lack of counter-pressure or ambivalence makes the theme feel tidy rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of ambiguity, the dual nature of poison/cure, and the danger of absolute certainty are woven tightly through foxgloves, the dome’s “forgotten doubt,” and Petra’s redefined purpose. The recurrence of animate/lifeless and stone/flesh tensions enriches the subtext without relying purely on exposition. Some thematic statements (“The animate lifeless had learned the one truth that mattered: that no truth was ever singular”) veer into explicit thesis, edging toward sermonizing. Even so, the final images (ampoule full of seawater and possibility, foxglove petal drifting) preserve a resonant, non-literal answer that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—the irreducibility of regret and the idea that some missed moments can only be carried, not erased—emerges organically from the wager, the staircase, and the dice, rather than explicit moralizing. The final realization (“the texture of a missed opportunity wasn’t something you escaped—it was something you carried”) flirts with abstraction but is earned by the preceding concrete particulars and his choice to keep climbing. The perpetual motion/symmetry motif deepens the thematic question of whether perfect correction is even desirable. Some readers might read that single explicit sentence as slightly on-the-nose, but it still lands with genuine emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of remembered kindness, the survival of “lost languages,” and the quiet efficacy of small gestures are strongly and coherently woven through action and image (scripts on walls, herbs at the mural’s foot, the greenhouse as sanctuary). The lunar language as one that “spoke not of war but of quiet acts of compassion” effectively externalizes the story’s moral focus. However, the thematic articulation occasionally edges toward explicit statement (“each stroke of the brush was a quiet prayer, a methodical offering of hope”), shaving some subtlety and complexity. The resonance is genuine and affecting but slightly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of cultural memory, communal ritual, and the ethics of preserving art in the face of displacement emerge naturally from the bread, harp, bees, and lens motifs. The story effectively argues that art is a living practice rather than inert objects, with the displaced families’ participation central to the “rescue.” However, the final paragraphs tip toward explicit thematic summation (“In the end, Liora understood…”) rather than trusting the imagery and actions to carry the insight. The resonance is real but slightly over-explained, softening the lingering ambiguity and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of resisting fate, reclaiming hidden/“latent” light, and time as rewritable are organically embedded in objects (counter-clockwise clocks, hunger stone, yoyo) and the central act. Yet the ending leans into explicit statement: lines like “a monument to the belief that even bleakness could birth brilliance” and “reminder that even in the bleakest of places, radiance can be found” verge on moralizing. The insight about time not being a prison is more told than freshly discovered in scene. The piece is thematically coherent but somewhat over-articulated rather than letting images fully carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of fear, survival, witness, and the idea that the dead teach the living are richly seeded through the dictionary paradoxes, the resuscitation, and the pearl “ghost of every scream” image. Subtextually, the story reframes trauma from something that owns Mira to something she interrogates and retools. However, the text at times drifts into explicit thesis statements (“She had unbosomed the secret: to trick fear into revealing its weakness, you must become the one thing it cannot understand—a survivor who has seen the other side”), which tips into didactic explanation rather than trusting the scene and images. The final dictionary quote similarly leans a bit on stated wisdom instead of fully subterranean resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of transforming threat into art, dialogue with the environment, and the porous boundary between prediction and creation emerge organically from the repeated images of fractals, dubbing, and the orchard’s survival. The idea that “the true instrument was not the driftwood or the mallet, but the space between forecast and creation” is conceptually rich and reweights earlier material. That line, however, edges into explicit thesis-statement territory, slightly flattening what the imagery has already earned. Still, the final sense of ongoing, restless collaboration with danger lingers in a satisfying, non-tidy way.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of curiosity, the cost of knowledge, and history as a record of failed questioning arise organically from shells, spirals, and the watchers’ function, culminating in a charged final image of a question-mark gate. The idea of the watchers “recording the death of curiosity” is potent and conceptually rich, but it edges into explicit statement rather than leaving more work to subtext. Likewise, “questions that could never be answered, only asked” flirts with moral-of-the-story territory, slightly reducing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic throughline about noble lies versus honest history is coherent and well integrated with the setting and Emlyn’s profession, and the final image of truth/ivy climbing into the light nicely reprises earlier motifs. However, the theme is often articulated explicitly (“rescue truth from a pit of lies,” “noble lie had become a prison”), tipping toward essayistic moralizing rather than letting subtext and image carry more of the load. Complexity is present—Emlyn honors both the compassion behind the lie and its cost—but the resolution leans tidy. The piece invites reflection yet does so in a somewhat didactic register.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory vs. erasure, ambition’s sediment, and honoring lost dreams are well woven through concrete actions—finding the toy boat and blank locket, naming drowned plans, and mortaring notes into foundations. The “interlaced absence” idea is nicely embodied by the ruined pavilion and reconfigured at the end into “interlaced presence.” However, a few lines—“His motivation crystallized—not merely to survey, but to become the archaeologist of abandoned dreams” and the final generalized sentence—edge toward thesis statement rather than leaving the resonance entirely to image and action. That slight over-articulation prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of truth, archival integrity, and “reclaimed stillness” are coherently woven through repeated images (stamp, stillness, light in darkness) and Mira’s vocation-driven actions. The final beats—in which stamping becomes a ritual of restored purpose—offer a satisfying thematic echo. However, the narration leans into explicit thesis statements (“not merely to catalog, but to breathe order into chaos”), edging toward didactic rather than fully letting scene and image carry the weight. The moral terrain remains relatively tidy, with little genuine ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of grief as material, the ethics and cost of transformation, and the ambiguous “gift” of the shadow’s departure are woven tightly through image, action, and recurring motifs (light, glass, breath, song). The final realization that she is both keeper and prisoner of luminous torment reweights the entire narrative in a resonant way. Some lines verge on explicit thesis—“She knew then that to transform grief…”—which slightly undercuts the otherwise strong subtextual handling. Even so, the piece invites reflection on mourning, art, and exploitation of pain without collapsing into a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of grief, unrealized futures, and the ethics of witnessing versus exploiting trauma are deeply woven into images like “pools of never-was” and “geography of what never happened.” The choice not to use the energy but to map it creates a resonant ethical stance that fits the closing conceptual repricing. That said, the piece edges into explicit thesis-statement territory (“The hunt was not for vengeance, nor redemption, but for the simple, unbearable act of witnessing…”) which slightly blunts the power of the images that already carry this meaning. Trimming such direct statements would let the subtext and motifs do more of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of belonging, unreadable cosmic “typefaces,” and “missing pieces” are interwoven through concrete motifs: the matrix chip, the pilgrim’s absence, the observatory’s silence, and the final map for “lost souls.” The emotional-frequency revelation effectively reframes the premise from astronomical cartography to existential orientation, and the pilgrim’s offstage choice provides a quiet counterpoint. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“It mapped belonging itself, the frequency at which a soul recognizes its place in the universe's typeface”), edging toward statement over implication. Even so, the closing images of brilliant dimness and unreadable script produce a resonant conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—truth versus fabrication, the limits of rewriting the past, and the persistence of real memory—is coherent and well integrated into profession, setting, and objects. The watch hand and carvings usefully reweight the question of what can and cannot be “forged.” However, the ending slips toward explicit thesis statements (“memory cannot be forged forever,” “a quiet scar of a lesson learned”), flattening ambiguity and emotional complexity. The insight feels earned but somewhat over-articulated and morally neat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of apology vs forgiveness, history vs renewal, and “small hinges” (the drawer pull as a symbolic key) recur coherently and are grounded in concrete images. The neutral parapet, repeated moon phases, and the heirloom token work together to suggest cycles and the possibility of reusing old mechanisms for different ends. That said, some thematic statements edges toward explicit moralizing (“recycling the bitter past into a wiser future,” “each mistake would become a lesson”), which slightly dulls subtext. The ending still offers a resonant, non-literal answer—trust as an incremental, fragile practice—but with less ambiguity than top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—navigation vs. forgiveness, bearing vs. arrival—is coherently woven through compass, poles, and graveside destination. The story earns a genuine emotional aftereffect via specific images (poles as fallen stars, compass pointing to cemetery) rather than generic sentiment. However, a few lines (“navigation… wasn’t about arrival but about bearing,” “gravitate toward grace”) verge on explicit thesis-stating, slightly muting subtext. Overall, the piece still offers a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—memory, redemption, and kindling empathy in a numbed world—emerges clearly from Kael’s arc and the recurring images of light in darkness. The baseball and labyrinth effectively echo ideas of time loops and cumulative choices. Yet the story leans toward explicit statement (“not as a hunter of empathy, but as its keeper”; “every path, however broken, could lead to a new beginning”), edging into moralizing rather than trusting implication. The resonance is there, but complexity is somewhat reduced by these spelled-out takeaways.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of constancy within change, love outlasting death, and the acceptance of metamorphosis are woven well through the fortune, the spices, and the cosmic imagery. The ending image of her as guardian, fur scented with spices guiding lost souls, offers a resonant, non-literal answer: loss becomes a new form of ongoing connection. However, the explicit fortune lines (“In change, find constancy; in loss, find a new embrace”) and direct statements about love transcending form edge toward overt moralizing. The piece would feel more elite if it trusted its images a bit more and its spelled-out messages a bit less.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic work—time as loan, cracks as sites where loss and light coexist, motherhood as bodily archive—is woven tightly through recurring objects and images. The transformation of the crack from flaw to luminous locus of meaning is an effective, concrete answer to the question of where lost time goes. However, the final paragraphs edge into explicit thesis (“time is not lost but loaned”) and named “repentance,” which slightly flattens what had been powerfully implicit. Despite that minor overstatement, the emotional and conceptual resonance of the ending remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of compassion, pacifism as transformation of violence, and integration of the shadow self are powerful and organically tied to the plot and images (tears, gravity, stitching). The realization that she misunderstood pacifism and now chooses service instead of transcendence lands as earned, not arbitrary. However, key lines state the thesis too directly (“true pacifism wasn’t the absence of violence, but the willingness to absorb it entirely into oneself,” “dimensions aren't places to escape into, but perspectives to embody”), undercutting subtext. Letting images and actions carry more of that insight would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—about transformation as reciprocal, about giving as both agency and surrender—is coherent and emerges from Kael’s history plus the prophecy pay-off. Images like the bottled bugs and the volcano’s breathing support this, and the final notion that “saving and being saved were the same motion” reweights prior events effectively. Some thematic lines slide into explicit statement (“Transformation wasn’t a texture you could touch, but a vibration you joined”), which edges toward essayistic rather than fully dramatized insight. The piece still leaves a resonant conceptual aftertaste, but with less ambiguity than top-tier literary work often sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres around control repurposed into liberation: locks, seals, gears, and powder designed for repression become tools of freedom. Motifs (sundial, quill holder, “cradle of sparks,” malfunction-as-revolution) are meaningfully reweighted by the ending, especially in “every lock exists to be opened, every shadow to be read.” The piece flirts with over-explicitness in articulating its thesis, but the recurring objects carry much of the thematic load through image rather than lecture. The quiet, nonviolent revolution of mechanisms feels conceptually resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of pattern versus control, witnessing versus solving, and balance between cosmic forces and personal cost are woven through recurring motifs (eels, mathematical sequences, borrowed dawn, “loan from a universe that demanded balance”). The closing realization that “the sacred patterns were not meant to be solved, but to be witnessed” crystallizes the thematic question and reweights prior images, even if it edges toward explicit statement. The partial return of friction as mere grooves in sand elegantly embodies a compromise between chaos and imposed order. A touch less direct thematic articulation and a bit more reliance on image over summary would lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of censorship, memory, trauma (“cartography of scars”), and the tension between silence and speech are woven through recurring images—the storm, masks slipping, bus routes, scars as maps—and reweighted effectively at the end. The realization that the map is “not a map to be read, but a terrain to be walked” nicely crystallizes the piece’s moral and artistic stance without feeling purely didactic. Some thematic statements verge on explicit thesis (“He knew the censors could erase words, but not the map they left behind”), slightly reducing subtlety. Nonetheless, the final fusion of scars-as-constellations, storm-kissed wonder, and enduring secrecy in the envelope yields a genuine lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of transforming waiting into art and questions into destinations are coherent and threaded through the sundial, needle card, and final walk beyond the brook. Yet they are stated explicitly (“He knew that each question he would face could become a destination”) rather than primarily earned through implication and consequence. Complexity is low: there’s little tension between intellect and violence, or between courtesy and ferocity, beyond labels. The ending resonates gently, but the insights verge on slogan-like instead of freshly reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of beauty forged from anarchy, literature as resistance, and identity as both fluid and anchored are coherently woven through recurring images (seeds, rust, wildflowers, fractures of light). The library’s transformation and the passing of the coffee tin embody these ideas without needing explicit moralizing. However, a few lines (“He believed that even in the bleakest anarchy, a single line of poetry could be a seed that cracks concrete”) state the thesis a bit baldly instead of leaving it in image and action. The ending is resonant, but slightly over-explained and therefore shy of the most subtle, lingering tier.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of time’s fracture, persistence of love, and the possibility of subtly defying fate emerge organically through the clock, compasses, horizon, and encore motifs. The notion that “time, like love, can shatter and still remain” is dramatized rather than merely asserted, especially in the arbor sequence and the acceptance that the clock stays silent. Some lines verge on explicit thematic telling (“fate had been surprised, and that an unplanned encore could reshape destiny”), but they stop short of sermonizing. The ending reweights earlier images into a resonant, if not deeply ambiguous, answer: he cannot undo the past but can inhabit a new, charged poise toward it.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of belief versus empiricism, memory versus fiction, and the instability of “reality” in a culture maintained by story are woven elegantly through objects (seed, spectrograph, journal, petal). The ending’s “luminous doubt” and question-mark petal offer a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior events without moralizing. A few formulations (“measuring the difference between memory and dream”) verge on explicit thesis-stating but stop short of sermon. The complexity—has he saved truth or authored a beautiful lie?—lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of remembrance, non-final severance, and transforming regret into sustaining growth emerge coherently from recurring images of tides, color, and bonsai shaping. The final idea—that “some severances heal not by closing, but by growing around the wound”—is resonant and reframes prior material. However, several lines state the theme quite directly (“This is the color of unspoken apologies,” “not meant to be kept, but to diffuse into new growth”), edging toward didacticism rather than fully trusting subtext. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but slightly managed and tidy.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.6)
    The story explicitly states its thesis ("The drama was not needless; it was the medium through which decay became visible"), which undercuts the subtextual power of the imagery. This "Thematic Echo" converts a resonant experience into a stated lesson, flattening the potential ambiguity and resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed moralizing and explicit statements ("Kael realized his purpose might lie not in the pursuit of vengeance"). The narrative lectures the reader on the meaning of the story ("silence could be a canvas for creation") instead of allowing resonance to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("silence was no longer a void"), creating a moralizing effect that flattens subtext. The prompt phrase "unshaken marvels" is repeated three times as a label rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    The thematic arc from seeking release to accepting an "eternal occupation" is resonant and well-executed. The closure reconfigures the protagonist's initial goal (leaving) into a permanent state of duty (staying) without stating a simple moral, achieving a strong Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("survival... required the sharing of memory") and summarized lessons ("building intergenerational support") rather than emerging from subtext. The result is didactic, reading more like a parable or NGO report than a literary exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and summary statements at the end ("understood that love unused was love preserved"), leaving no room for subtext. The narrative didacticism flattens the emotional resonance into a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of memory as a physical dimension is woven expertly into the logic of the world and the protagonist's final fate. The resolution—becoming the "texture of time"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central inquiry without resorting to a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("sow seeds of hope," "green rebellion") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative relies on telling the reader what the symbols mean instead of allowing them to resonate organically.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "absence" is rich, but the ending relies on explicit moralizing ("She understood now that trust didn't break—it stopped transmitting") rather than letting the imagery carry the weight. This thesis statement flattens the resonance of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through repetitive assertions ("believed every portrait held a secret heartbeat") rather than subtext or dramatized experience. The realization about "theft vs. translation" is stated explicitly rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of "safe zones for inquiry" is resonant and beautifully woven through the glassblowing metaphor. However, the explicit labeling of the "Reservoir of Unasked Things" and phrases like "unclenching of the valley's collective heart" verge on being too on-the-nose, slightly reducing the subtextual power. The final image of the gauge flickering is a masterful, understated thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is stated directly in the narrative ("prove that vulnerability is power") and reiterated in a moralizing conclusion. Subtext is replaced by overt assertion, preventing organic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit, didactic statements ("silence itself had become a story") rather than subtext or action. The concept is hammered home via repetition rather than explored through dramatic complexity or nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of consciousness arising from participation is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition and explicit moralizing ("mundane mysticism," "joy of their endless formation"). The story asserts its profundity in the final paragraph rather than letting the resonance emerge from the action itself. The philosophical question ("where do thoughts come from") feels pasted onto the loop mechanic rather than being the inevitable result of the janitor's specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed aphorisms ("transparency is the key," "honesty had opened a door") rather than subtext or action. The narrative acts as a parable with a clearly stated moral, lacking the ambiguity or resonance required for literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue and narration ("proving forever that gardens know their gardeners") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending summarizes the lesson instead of allowing the reader to experience the resonance of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of time branching "sideways like frost" is beautifully integrated with the imagery and the mechanic's intuitive worldview. The story effectively contrasts linear scientific rigidity with a more fluid, almost spiritual understanding of physics without dissolving into incoherence. The ending resonates by validating Kael's perspective while acknowledging its incompatibility with the established order.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is asserted through the excessive repetition of "in between spaces" rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The ending delivers a tidy, explicit moral about memory that closes off interpretation instead of creating resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=3.1)
    Subtext is non-existent because the narrative explicitly explains every symbol and theme to the reader ("truth's weight cannot be found in grams, but in the forgiveness"). The story effectively sermonizes its moral in the final paragraphs, reducing the narrative to a delivery vehicle for a platitude about letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of "weight of truth" is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed exposition via the radio psychic ("truth had mass"). The message is articulated explicitly in the narrative rather than emerging organically from the subtext, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and explanation ("She understood now that her role was not to halt decay," "the swan... held a lesson"). This "Thematic Echo" flattens resonance by telling the reader exactly what to think instead of allowing the meaning to emerge from subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit summary in the final reflection ("wonder didn't end... it simply changed form") rather than dramatized experience. The narrative leans on sentimental assertions of "magic" instead of earning resonance through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of dreams migrating from consciousness to matter is imaginative and lands with resonance in the final image. However, the text explicitly explains its thesis ("stories walls have heard were not metaphor but migration") rather than letting it emerge solely through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of authorship over one's life is tightly woven into the mechanics of the story. The shift from "passenger to pilot" resonates through the imagery of the beam and music, and the ending offers a poetic, non-moralizing resolution to the question of fate.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The concept of "stillness as a wound" vs. "true quiet" is intellectually resonant and well-integrated. However, the story tends to explicate these themes directly ("The entity wore assumptions like armor") rather than letting them emerge solely through dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of connecting past to future through art is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed explication ("conductor of unheard symphonies"). The resonance relies on stated sentiment rather than emerging organically from the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story explicitly states its theme ("You are the labyrinth," "no center existed"), removing interpretive work for the reader. This overt moralizing and "Thematic Echo" in the climax flattens resonance and reduces the ending to a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story explicitly states its moral in the final paragraph ("her deafness became a bridge," "found her song"), collapsing subtext into an instructional fable. The "Thus..." conclusion prevents any earned thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.2)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit moralizing and told meaning ("nurture integrity in solitude," "testament to truth"). The story asserts its themes through abstract nouns rather than allowing them to emerge from subtextual friction or specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but suffers significantly from explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("grief was love with nowhere left to grow"). This didactic explanation of the subtext flattens the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=2.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated via narrator assertions ("time was not a line but a weave") rather than emerging from subtext. The story relies on "Thematic Echo," articulating the thesis in prompt-like language instead of allowing meaning to resonate through action.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.2)
    Theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("She sees that beauty lives in the unfinished") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The ending relies on moralizing assertions that summarize the prompt's requirements instead of earning resonance through narrative particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme is hammered home through verbatim repetition of the required phrase ("fuse insight with empathy") rather than emerging from subtext. This over-explication flattens the nuance of the "counterfeit" vs. "real" emotion exploration. The thematic resonance is present but dampened by the "telling" approach.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("embodying the cycles of compassion," "cycles... as endless as the tide") rather than emerging from subtext or conflict. The ending summarizes the lesson for the reader, violating the show-don't-tell principle. The "Harbor Heart" award reduces the complexity of the premise to a simple, sentimental transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is articulated explicitly via the tag's definition ("meaning 'belonging-in-difference'") and the narrator's summary ("Kael understood then..."). This didactic approach flattens the subtext, delivering a "moral of the story" rather than allowing meaning to emerge organically from the character's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of the artist becoming the artifact is executed with resonance, avoiding heavy-handed moralizing in favor of a transformative final image. The ending recontextualizes the premise ("learned to exist in the pause") effectively, though the constellation symbol feels slightly more ornamental than earned by the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story explicitly summarizes its moral in the final paragraphs ("love persists," "mysteries are not meant to be solved"), which deflates subtextual resonance. The thematic "answer" is delivered as a lecture rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of connection and visibility is coherent, but the text explicates it too directly ("Someone needed to be seen") rather than letting it emerge solely from the action. The emotional resonance is present but dampened by this tendency to summarize the meaning for the reader. A more ambiguous or subtext-reliant approach would have deepened the impact of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=2.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and heavy-handed sermonizing ("whisper a lesson about resilience," "art of letting go"). The story explains its meaning to the reader rather than allowing resonance to emerge from subtext or ambiguity. The ending reinforces a simplistic binary where surrender equals perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story explicitly states its themes ("The exchange was not of art... but of past for present") instead of allowing them to emerge from subtext. The ending relies on moralizing summaries ("beacon of continuity") rather than resonant imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("This bright darkness was both beautiful and unsettling, a paradox that Lira had learned to embrace"). The story relies on explaining the meaning of its symbols ("a gift of everyday wonder") rather than allowing subtext or ambiguity to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is resonant but overly articulated; the text explains its own subtext ("not as losses but as negative spaces") rather than letting the imagery carry the meaning. This didactic approach flattens the emotional impact of the navigator's realization.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of mapping the invisible is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand ("fortress of unspoken truths," "patterns in loss"). The final realization explains the theme to the reader rather than letting it resonate through subtext or image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=2.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing (&quot;testament to the power of courageously kind acts&quot;) rather than emerging organically from subtext. The ending devolves into a sermon, telling the reader exactly what lesson to derive instead of allowing resonance to build.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of finitude versus eternity is central and resolves meaningfully, but the execution is often explicit and sermonizing ("tyranny of eternal continuation," "ignorance was the most beautiful farewell"). The story tends to tell the reader the thematic import of events rather than allowing it to emerge subtextually from the action, limiting its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of survival necessitating moral flexibility is resonant, but the narrative tends to state the thesis explicitly ("Fairness wasn't found in the absence of lies") rather than letting it emerge solely through dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of preserving "invented histories" is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed narration ("She imagined the trees as keepers...") rather than subtext. The concept remains intellectual and stated, missing the friction of a counter-argument or the complexity of a genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is over-articulated through explicit summary statements ("He realizes the texture of memory is not in the fragments," "motivation is simple") which flattens the subtext. The story tends to explain its meaning directly to the reader rather than allowing the imagery to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story explicitly states its theme in the final paragraphs ("the riddle was the reader," "what ends first"), violating the "show, don't tell" principle for subtext. This didactic approach flattens the resonance, converting potential insight into a lecture. The thematic echo replaces dramatic tension with a summary of the author's intent.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit telling ("defiant roar," "hopeful desperation") rather than subtext or action. The ending offers a tidy, romanticized victory that feels unearned by the preceding summary, relying on asserted emotion rather than resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of preservation versus ephemerality is legible but delivered through direct explication ("reminder of what the universe could not preserve"). The emotional resonance relies on asserting the feeling of "melancholy" at the end rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the action and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of "interpretation vs. sight" is legible but articulated through didactic dialogue at the closure ("I don't see... I interpret") rather than dramatized action. The lesson feels imposed by the author to explain the mechanic, rather than emerging organically from the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is articulated through repetitive mantras ("To find where the rivers begin...") rather than emerging organically from the drama. The result is a sermonizing effect where the story explains its meaning to the reader instead of allowing resonance to arise from the subtext of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of "pattern over entropy" is coherent but delivered through direct authorial statement ("patterns were the town's true architecture") rather than emerging organically from action. The resonance relies on asserting profundity rather than earning it through the specific emotional reality of the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative explicitly preaches the theme in the final paragraph ("reminder that some knots can only be unsnarled by surrendering," "monument to what can be captured only by letting go"). This sermonizing undercut the resonance of the imagery by explaining exactly how the reader should interpret the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is hammered home through the incessant repetition of mantras ("sustaining the impossible," "chasing hush") rather than dramatized action. The story tells the reader what to feel about truth and silence instead of allowing meaning to emerge from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative ("love could be both poison and cure") and reiterated as a moral in the final paragraph ("blessing and a curse"), triggering the thematic echo penalty. Resonance is asserted through summary rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing statements ("weaving ruin into reverence") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The story dictates the emotional takeaway instead of allowing the reader to experience the shift in perspective through the character's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story leans heavily on explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("reminding all who saw it that even broken things can be made whole again"). The theme is stated directly to the reader rather than emerging organically from subtext or complex action.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is heavily explicated rather than subtextual. The dialogue ("We're all looking for meaning in the margins") articulates the thesis directly, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The ending further sermonizes ("The future would forget, but the margins would remember"), leaving little room for reader interpretation or resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("wisdom was disguised as foolishness," "symbol of the coming upheaval") rather than emerging from subtext or action. Symbols are immediately decoded for the reader ("The coup will rise with the harvest moon"), removing the potential for ambiguity or deeper resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through the written message on the condensation ("The apology is not in the speaking..."), which flattens subtext into a moral statement. This "Thematic Echo" resolves the ambiguity for the reader instead of allowing it to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central theme of translation—as a bridge between languages, people, and wounds—is woven tightly through the narrative without feeling tacked on. The "archipelagos" metaphor resonates powerfully with the concept of shared anxiety, though the explicit lesson from the elders leans slightly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("And the world... would see the light... and remember"). The theme is delivered via lecture rather than subtext. The ending summarizes the "lesson" of the story, triggering the penalty for sermonizing endings.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text multiple times, leaving no room for subtext ("true restoration was not of paint but of wonder"). The final paragraph moralizes directly, reducing the narrative to a fable with a clearly labeled lesson. This "Thematic Echo" effect flattens the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central metaphor of nature-as-language is potent, but the text over-explains its own subtext ("which in their coded syntax meant...") rather than trusting the dramatization. This didactic approach flattens the thematic resonance, turning potential insight into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("photosynthesize pain into beauty") rather than allowed to emerge through subtext or action. This heavy-handed delivery ("Her motivation... was to...") turns the story into a moralizing lecture rather than a resonant experience.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.6)
    Themes are delivered via heavy-handed explicit moralizing ("beauty often lives in imperfection") rather than emerging from subtext. The repeated use of "foxglove regret" acts as a forced label for the mood, telling the reader what to feel instead of evoking the emotion through scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of communication is coherent, but the story relies on a "sermonizing ending" (the final paragraph explicitly explaining the moral) rather than allowing the narrative image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explication ("Alia understood that...") rather than emerging organically from the action. The prompt phrase "encrypted compassion" is inserted as a literal message and a moral conclusion, resulting in a sermonizing tone that tells the reader what to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through heavy repetition of keywords ("echo," "song," "trust") and explicit moralizing ("learned to trust again"). Subtext is minimal as the story explains its own meaning to the reader repeatedly.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("I understand that...", "He taught me that...") rather than emerging organically from the subtext. The ending relies on a grand summary ("the story... becomes a legend") that feels unearned by the preceding low-stakes vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of belonging is central, but the story relies on a direct thesis statement ("Belonging was not a place you occupied, but a waveform...") to articulate it. This explicit telling in the climax flattens the subtext and triggers the penalty for thematic sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("paths were not erased by malice but reclaimed") rather than emerging organically from the action. The text explains the meaning of the events to the reader, precluding subtextual resonance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "ordering randomness" is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("arithmetic of wonder") rather than subtext. The emotional resonance is asserted by the narrator rather than emerging organically from the interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story delivers its themes through explicit authorial assertion ("a testament that memory could not be erased") rather than subtext or action. The result is a lecture on the premise that leaves no room for reader interpretation or ambiguity. The emotional resonance is unearned because the text tells the reader exactly what to feel at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed narration and explicit statements ("understanding that the mundane was not a prison but a prism") rather than subtext or action. The ending sermonizes, summarizing the lesson learned rather than allowing it to resonate through a final image. The repetitive use of "noctilucent reckonings" reduces a potential motif to a label.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and summary statements ("Enlightenment didn't come from answers," "translate pain into a universal language") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending articulates the lesson directly to the reader, reducing thematic resonance to a sermon. This violates the "show, don't tell" standard for subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of hope as a discipline against entropy is resonant and well-supported by the central metaphor. The execution leans didactic in moments (explicitly defining hope), but the final image of the tide adds necessary nuance and prevents a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, with the walls literally articulating the theme ("Remember, but act") and the narration explaining the "legacy's burden" directly to the reader. This didactic approach flattens the subtext, leaving little room for ambiguity or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme of "possibility" is explicitly preached rather than dramatized. The required phrase "dusky harmony" is forced into the text five times in the final third, turning subtext into a bludgeon.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("He realized that the price of redemption was...") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative tells the reader exactly what the story means in the final paragraphs, flattening resonance into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly explained to the reader ("The fractured grace lay in its dual nature: destruction and preservation entwined"), killing subtext. Resonance is flattened by the narrator's insistence on summarizing the moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("turning oppression into liberation") rather than subtext. The narrative dictates the meaning to the reader ("legacy as a liberator") instead of allowing it to emerge from the action, resulting in a didactic fable rather than a resonant story.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is potent but is articulated too explicitly in the narrative ("This was the core he sought: that every story is a series of erasures..."). This overt "telling" of the subtext deflates the narrative tension by explaining the meaning via a thesis statement rather than letting it resonate implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme is poignant but the delivery is overly didactic; the narrative frequently pauses to decode its own symbols for the reader ("Esme understood that interrupted cadence was not just ecological but personal"). This explicit moralizing supplants subtext, turning the story into a lecture on its own meaning rather than an experience of it. The resonance is stated rather than evoked.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is delivered via explicit summary ("understood now that preservation wasn't about perfect replication") rather than emerging organically from the action. This direct telling flattens the subtext and reduces the resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.3)
    The story violates the "show, don't tell" rule at the peak moment by having a character explicitly state the thesis: "The directive decays not from neglect, but by design." This thematic echo flattens the subtext into a sermon, removing ambiguity and resonance. The concept of "transcendence" is asserted rather than emerging organically from the narrative events.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story explicitly articulates its theme in the final paragraphs ("uncloaking not magic, but a truth," "patterns persist when regimes fall"), converting subtext into text. This on-the-nose explanation diminishes the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("her scheme was simply this: to teach that the heaviest chains..."), which flattens the subtext into a lecture. The theme of forgiveness is delivered as a thesis statement rather than emerging organically from the conflict. This overt didacticism prevents the ending from achieving genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of erasing boundaries between creator and creation is coherent and drives the resolution. However, it is articulated explicitly ("Kael knew... he must invite it") rather than emerging purely through subtext or action. The ending resonates with the theme, offering a clear, if safe, conceptual wrap.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through the found note and the protagonist's dialogue, leaving little room for subtext. The final paragraph summarizes the lesson ("accidental wisdom") rather than letting it emerge organically from the narrative beats.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of grief and memory integrates well with the prompt's disparate elements. The final realization—that the orchard is a memorial—resonates strongly, recontextualizing the "forbidden knowledge" not as power, but as the heavy duty of remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed repetition of the "unheard symphony" motif and explicit moralizing about "gaps in knowledge." Subtext is absent because the story explains its meaning directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.1)
    Subtext is collapsed into text by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("reminding her that even the most broken things..."). The theme of solace is stated repetitively as a label rather than emerging organically from action.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("This was a fable of absence") rather than allowed to emerge from the narrative subtext. The conclusion ("Fables of Absence, Resolved") is didactic, closing down interpretation instead of creating resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("silence was not the absence of sound, but its own presence"), collapsing subtext into a lecture. The narrative leans on these definitions to convey meaning rather than allowing the imagery and action to resonate on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("She had rekindled the belief that nothing is random..."), which violates the show-don't-tell principle. The theme is delivered as a lecture rather than emerging organically from the conflict, resulting in a didactic sermon that flattens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but delivered didactically through journal entries and narrator summary ("Identity was not sculpted..."). The story explains its meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than emergent; the mosaic literally spells out the message "Rise," and Cinder vocalizes "We rise." This lack of subtext and reliance on declarative moralizing flattens resonance. The story delivers a tidy, affirmative message without engaging with the complexity or cost of the proposed hope.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial intrusion ("The essence of transition periods... was not in the grand gestures") rather than emerging from the narrative. This lecture-style interiority flattens subtext, offering a tidy moral instead of a resonant, earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the final line ("learned that even a prison could hold a garden"), violating the show-don't-tell principle for resonance. The "gilded hush" motif is overworked, and the ending offers a tidy summary instead of a resonant, ambiguous afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of "silence as presence" is coherent but delivered didactically through dialogue ("Most think silence is empty... But it's full"). The story relies on explaining its thesis rather than letting it emerge organically from subtext or action, leading to a "sermonizing" effect that flattens the emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the final summary ("not reclamation, but renewal") rather than emerging organically from the conflict. The concept of "futuristic nostalgia" is namedropped rather than evoked.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=2.6)
    Subtext is rendered as explicit text in dialogue ("Breathing is a bridge we build"), resulting in a sermonizing tone. The theme is delivered as a moral lesson rather than emerging organically from the friction of the narrative, leaving no room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered didactically through the text messages and narration ("Pressure is a promise"). Subtext is minimal, as the story explicitly decodes its own metaphors instead of allowing them to resonate through action.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("He understood now," "some truths are best sung") rather than organic subtext. The narrative didacticism flattens the potential for ambiguity or resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.6)
    Themes are stated explicitly in the text ("reshape possibility," "allegiance") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story relies on asserting the significance of events through abstract nouns instead of grounding meaning in concrete particulars or earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("Marianne's motivation was... to magnify small kindnesses") rather than subtext. The ending moralizes the outcome, offering a tidy emotional equation that precludes deeper resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated as the "tyranny of indifference" rather than emerging from the action. The final reflection on "freedom coded in water" feels sentimental and disconnected from the physical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.5)
    Themes of silence and memory are present but are bludgeoned by the repetition of keywords ("vested hush," "code"). The thematic resonance is asserted through vague, mystical language rather than emerging organically from a specific, grounded human struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is articulated through explicit, repetitive narration ("past meets prophecy," "past will merge with the future") rather than dramatized subtext. The resolution offers a platitudinous moral about memory without exploring the complexity or cost of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, relying on explicit statements of the moral ("learning to love the space between ticks," "all true navigation begins in uncertainty"). The prompt's required thematic phrases feel inserted as lessons rather than emerging organically from the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of absence and naming is poignant but significantly undercut by the ending's explicit moralizing ("Elara understood: the weight of names is not..."). This summary statement flattens the narrative resonance by explaining the subtext directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of integration is coherent and resonant, but the story relies on an explicit thesis statement ("Healing wasn't about...") to explain the realization, rather than trusting the subtext of the broken laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from heavy-handed didacticism, explicitly stating its thesis multiple times ("Mercy is the ratio...", "mathematics of mercy was not a formula"). The ending violates the show-don't-tell principle by sermonizing the moral ("mercy was not to be calculated, but to be lived") in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and aphorisms ("some truths are held not in stone," "light never dies") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending restates the thesis in a sermonizing tone, reducing subtext to zero.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of forgotten labor is poignant, but the story relies on explicit summarization at the climax ("We wound the clocks... time forgot us") and closure ("silenced mechanisms of ordinary cruelty"). This over-articulation converts subtext into text, reducing the resonant power of the otherwise strong imagery. The ending explains the moral rather than trusting the reader to feel the weight of the mainspring barrel.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    The thematic arc moves coherently from the preservation of "forgotten history" to the creation of an absolute "Here," repricing the value of memory versus presence. The ending resonates without stating a moral, letting the final image of the single word carry the conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story explicitly explains its own metaphors ("Kael... saw the ritual as a metaphor: to hide from the past was to preserve its echo"), robbing the subtext of power. The theme of historical truth is delivered through assertion rather than narrative discovery. The emotional resonance relies on the repetition of the phrase "burnished sorrow" rather than evoking the feeling through events.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is articulated too explicitly ("truth burned through its lies," "let honesty sing"), leaving little room for subtext or ambiguity. The narrative announces its moral stance repeatedly, resulting in a didactic conclusion rather than resonance emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of preserving mystery over answers is coherent and resonates through the imagery of the compass and lagoon. However, the ending leans on explicit thematic statements ("precise coordinates where answers become irrelevant") rather than letting the image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and moralizing ("the lesson was not in the carving but in the listening") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The concept of "timewoven alliances" is explained directly to the reader, reducing the ending to a didactic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("She understood that flowers bloom at night to greet the moon"), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. The conclusion reduces the narrative to a didactic lesson about nature, rather than allowing meaning to emerge organically from the action. The "quiet invitation" moral feels imposed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=2.8)
    Themes are explicitly stated rather than allowed to emerge organically ("This distinction mattered: it proved premeditation," "Elara realized the truth in tension required nuance"). The story explains its own moral to the reader, leaving no room for subtext or interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative leans heavily on explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("true alchemy is not in gold..."), which flattens the subtext. The theme is preached rather than allowed to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of archiving emotion is coherent, though the conclusion leans into sentimental abstraction ("heartbeat of a city") rather than earning resonance through specific, hard-won insight.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through repetitive assertions of keywords rather than subtext or dramatic enactment. The final paragraph breaks the narrative frame ("The story ends..."), reducing the theme to a summary statement. The reliance on explicit definitions of "wild serenity" and "borrowed time" flattens potential resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of listening vs. noise is coherent but marred by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("Humility... was knowing when not to raise your voice"). This summary flattens the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed lecturing and explicit moralizing ("vulnerability is not weakness," "tapestry of hope"). The story explains its meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext or action. The ending reduces the narrative to a simple, stated maxim.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=2.0)
    The theme is hammered home through verbatim repetition of the phrase "weight of unspoken words" rather than subtext. The story tells the reader what it means instead of allowing meaning to emerge from the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.3)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("gift to be spent," "prism"). The story explains its meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=2.4)
    Theme is stated explicitly in nearly every paragraph ("beauty often resides in what is left unfinished"), suffocating all subtext; the narrative explains its own metaphors immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text ("Respect is not built in a lifetime, but in translation") rather than emerging organically. This final-paragraph moralizing flattens the subtext into a lesson, violating the "Thematic Echo" guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit telling (&quot;saw not myth, but a testable hypothesis&quot;) and a moralizing summary at the ending (&quot;revealed the most natural of truths&quot;). Subtext is replaced by direct assertion of the story's meaning. The resonance is flattened by the need to tidily resolve the intellectual question without emotional ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the final paragraph ("horizon of hope," "vow that..."), replacing earned resonance with a sermonizing summary. The concept of "submerged concord" is labeled rather than dramatized through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme is resonant but delivered explicitly through dialogue and the riddle ("Translate distance into closeness"), leaving little room for reader inference. The emotional closure is earned, yet the reliance on stated morals flattens the potential for subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the text ("true north was not a place but a decision"), which triggers the Thematic Echo penalty. This overt moralizing flattens subtext and reduces the narrative arc to an inspirational platitude rather than an earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing and sermonizing to convey its theme ("unknown was not a threat, but an invitation"). The final paragraphs descend into a fable-like summary that explains the meaning to the reader instead of allowing resonance to emerge from the action. This didactic approach flattens subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermons ("This is how we unbind the past," "game is never over") rather than emerging from subtext. The repeated use of the phrase "luminous absence" to enforce the theme makes the argument feel heavy-handed and didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered as explicit exposition ("She realized that... home not as a place, but as a pattern of connections"). This reduces subtext to text, treating the realization as a purely intellectual epiphany rather than an earned emotional shift derived from the action. The resolution is tidy and moralizing rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than dramatized, particularly in the final paragraphs ("forgiveness was not a single act but a continuous winnowing"). The reliance on abstract summaries of the lesson learned ("reminder that even the most tangled paths could be straightened") flattens the subtext into a moralizing lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue and narration ("forgiveness without understanding was merely forgetting"), rather than emerging from subtext. The story lectures the reader on its thesis, reducing the narrative to an illustrative parable.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of repair and memory is integral to the plot, but the subtext is frequently flattened by explicit moralizing (e.g., "brokenness was the beginning of beauty"). The final paragraph contains a "Thematic Echo" where the story explains its own meaning, reducing the resonant power of the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed "telling" and explicit moralizing ("The act of painting felt like a confession," "revealed the promise, and in doing so, set himself free"). The narrative lacks subtext, preferring to state the emotional significance of every action directly to the reader rather than allowing meaning to emerge from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of communication is well-developed through action, but the ending succumbs to explicit moralizing. The final dialogue ("teach me how to listen") articulates the thesis too literally, triggering the penalty for Thematic Echo in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly labeled ("landscape of loss," "geography of loss") rather than emerging from subtext. The story relies on "Thematic Echo" artifacts, stating its meaning directly to the reader instead of allowing the dramatic action to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("truth did not destroy... instead it peeled away the armor") and diagnostic jargon ("psychological safety") inserted verbatim. The story tells the reader what to feel rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story relies on an explicit "Thematic Echo" in the final paragraphs ("Memory is the true keeper of light") which flattens subtext into a moral statement. The theme is articulated rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of missed opportunities and the necessity of risk is well-developed, culminating in a resolution that reweights the initial promise from a burden to a liberation. While the "doorway of decisions" is a somewhat literal metaphor, the final image of the abandoned matrix chip successfully avoids moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing to convey its theme, articulating the thesis directly in dialogue and narration ("power was just another word for sacrifice"). This overt explanation flattens the subtext and turns the ending into a didactic lesson rather than a resonant experience.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story relies heavily on explicit moralizing and sermonizing to convey meaning ("The secret... was not just of shells... but of the willingness to see value anew"). Themes are stated in dialogue and narration rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending explains the metaphor ("A lens that focused...") instead of allowing the image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story explicitly writes its theme statement on the page ("The chronicler dies but the dreaming continues"), flattening subtext into a declared moral. This creates a didactic effect that resolves ambiguity too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is articulated too explicitly, with characters delivering thesis statements in dialogue ("We humanize our losses") and the narration summarizing the lesson in the final paragraph. This overt moralizing—telling the reader exactly what the story means—undercuts the resonance of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text repeatedly ("transform scars into stories," "scars turned into a narrative thread") rather than emerging through subtext or action. This over-articulation reduces the thematic resonance to a moral lesson rather than an earned insight. The resolution offers a tidy summary of the concept instead of a complex, lived experience of grief's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.8)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by characters speaking in explicit thesis statements ("mirror, not a window," "song is the apology"), transforming subtext into exposition. This heavy-handedness prevents the theme from emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story relies heavily on explicit thematic statements ("truth was not a thing to be possessed but a pattern to be completed"), which flattens subtext. The narrative didacticism explains the meaning of the events as they happen, leaving little room for reader interpretation. The transformation is thematically resonant but delivered through assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies on sermonizing, explicitly stating its thesis in the final paragraph ("Time is the space between two heartbeats") rather than allowing subtext to emerge from action. This didactic approach collapses ambiguity and reduces the narrative to a lecture, triggering the penalty for thematic moralizing at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing statements ("The goal was understanding the physics of letting go...") rather than subtext. The narrative dictates the meaning of the grief to the reader instead of allowing the woman's actions to resonate on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("teach the beauty of probability without the pain of loss") rather than emerging from the action. The "lucid contradictions" concept is stated as a realization rather than experienced as a subtextual tension.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed aphorisms ("endings were merely doorways," "every ending is only the start") rather than emerging organically. The ending restates the moral multiple times, leaving no room for subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=2.4)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("When context changes...") in the final line, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. Subtext is replaced by summary statements.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=2.6)
    The story ends with an explicit moral sermon ("Thus the cure for loneliness is not a potion but a promise"), violating the show-don't-tell rule for theme. The message is delivered as a lecture rather than emerging organically from the narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing rather than subtext ("map she sought was not of land, but of the heart's uncharted territories"). The ending devolves into a moral summary ("to map the world, one must first map the silence") that flattens the emotional resonance into a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in summary ("He understood now that meaning was not a fixed star") rather than emerging from the action. The ending serves as a moral delivery system, flattening the potential for subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story explicitly articulates its own thesis in dialogue ("Because silence is the only language...") and narration ("waiting... for permission to remember himself"). This didactic approach collapses subtext and reduces the thematic resonance to a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("truth and forgiveness were woven into every thread"), reducing resonance to a moral lesson. The concept of "truthful creation" is told to the reader rather than emerging organically from the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of transformation versus preservation is interwoven effectively with the plot action. The story refuses the easy comfort of memory-as-archive, pushing instead for a more complex, destructive, and creative synthesis. The final image of the syncopated heartbeats resonates deeply with the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and narration ("whispers carry further than screams") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending devolves into sermonizing ("silence builds better bridges"), triggering the penalty for explicit moralizing in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly preached by the narrator ("teaching darkness to cherish the stars") rather than emerging from subtext. The story tells the reader exactly how to interpret the symbols, removing any resonant ambiguity or depth.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=2.9)
    The story explicitly states its theme ("simple truth: 'Question the king'") and moral ("true victory was..."), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. This didactic approach flattens resonance, as the narrative lectures rather than demonstrating meaning through action.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is explicitly preached in the final paragraph ("taught her that strength and softness are not enemies"), flattening potential subtext into a moral lesson. This overt thesis statement replaces the resonance that should come from the action itself.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story explicitly explains its own themes and symbols, violating the "show, don't tell" principle. Phrases like "perfect echo of the emotional void" and "testament to the love that had been" flatten subtext into exposition, leaving no room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("dissolved the boundary," "boundary between self and world") repeatedly, reducing subtext to lecture. The story explains its own meaning in the narration rather than allowing it to emerge organically from action.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text ("beautiful precisely because they were flawed," "imperfection was true art"), violating the subtext rule. The story preaches its moral rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the consequences of the characters' actions.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand; the narrative explicitly explains its thesis ("What if connection requires imperfection?") in dialogue and summary. The final paragraph restates the moral ("people wanted certainty... Kaelen had found something better"), which flattens the subtext and reduces interpretive resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing statements ("manufactured hope becomes real through intention") rather than emerging from subtext. The story explains its meaning to the reader at every turn, leaving little room for interpretative resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.6)
    The story relies on explicit thesis statements to convey its meaning ("The future wasn't a chain, but a web"), which triggers the Thematic Echo penalty for moralizing in place of subtext. While the central metaphor of decentralization vs. centralization is coherent, the delivery is didactic, telling the reader the "truth" rather than letting it emerge organically from the drama.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and summary statements ("The end of innocence is not a single moment but a continuum") rather than emerging from the action. The emotional resonance is asserted via labels ("anguished joy") instead of being evoked through specific imagery or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story explicitly states its theme and moral ("reminder that every hope preserved also carried the weight..."), leaving no room for subtext. This didactic approach flattens resonance, as the story explains its symbols rather than letting meaning emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of reconstruction is handled well through action until the end, where it falters into explicit moralizing. The notebook entry ("healing is not forgetting, but growing around the wound") is a "Thematic Echo" that states the thesis directly, flattening the subtext into an aphorism. The final image of the "spiral of trust" also pushes too hard on interpretive labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and aphoristic telling ("closure was not an ending but a reading," "verses in a poem of survival") rather than emerging from subtext. The story relies on a "healing" trope that resolves complex trauma with a magical object, resulting in a simplistic and sentimental conclusion that lacks resonance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story explores the theme of unused love and memory with nuance, avoiding cloying sentimentality by grounding it in the physical mechanics of the theater. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question, reframing the protagonist’s burden as a necessary act of preservation. The specific imagery of love compacting into "neutron star matter" creates a durable, non-literal thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed didacticism ("creativity is simply the universe remembering itself") rather than emerging organically from action. The story relies on explaining its meaning to the reader instead of allowing subtext or ambiguity to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story suffers from a heavy-handed "explain-everything" ending where the narrator explicitly decodes the metaphor ("they weren't missing dreams, they were the place..."). This didactic summation flattens the thematic resonance, converting potential subtext into a direct thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermons ("She understood now that...", "Insight was not a destination") rather than subtext. The story relies on summary statements of the moral in the final paragraph, violating the "show, don't preach" standard for literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.4)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing and summary to deliver its message ("Lin understood that courage was not a loud proclamation..."). This "Thematic Echo" in the final paragraph flattens the subtext into a lecture, violating the show-don't-tell standard.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of vigilance and safety is coherent, but the story relies on explicit sermonizing near the end ("The cost of safety was this...") to articulate it. This "telling" replaces what should be a subtextual realization in the final beat, flattening the resonance of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of unmasking falsehoods is coherent but handled with heavy-handed literalism through the magic rune. The ending explicitly moralizes ("witness to the sundering of lies") rather than allowing the resonance to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is heavily didactic, with the narrative explicitly explaining the meaning of the corals and the shipping lanes ("paths disappear because the underlying assumptions had changed"). The prompt phrase "periodically eternal" is repeated five times, bludgeoning the reader with the motif rather than allowing resonance to emerge organically.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is articulated explicitly ("Kai knew the universe whispered," "pure, defiant meaning") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The story relies on telling the reader the significance of the moment instead of letting the imagery speak.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is legible, but the ending relies on explicit moralizing ("Destiny wasn't implanted in amber. It was planted in the soil of conscious choice") rather than subtext. This explanatory summary in the final paragraph reduces the resonant power of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies heavily on explicit sermonizing to convey its meaning, culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the lesson ("The cliff taught him...") instead of letting the image resonate. This over-articulation robs the narrative of subtext and reduces the theme to a moral statement.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of embracing darkness to find truth is integral to the plot, but the story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("Shadow and light were not opposites but collaborators"). This summative thesis statement flattens the subtext into instruction, reducing the resonant power of the ending image. The handling of the "truth" motif is slightly heavy-handed with the rhetorical questioning.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in expository summaries ("the secret of time’s slowness lay hidden") rather than emerging organically from the drama. The narrative relies on "Thematic Echo," articulating the thesis in abstract terms instead of letting the reader infer meaning from the consequences of the protagonist’s loss.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of truth versus manufactured silence is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand ("archives a prison for possibility"). The narrative tends to state its thesis explicitly rather than letting it emerge solely from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial statements ("She believed that by inculcating plants...") rather than emerging from subtext or dramatic irony. The connection between the "Quiet" disc and the stranger's peace is stated directly, leaving little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of grief and release is poignant, but the ending resorts to explicit moralizing ("Avery understood that to catch... was not to possess"). This direct statement of the thesis in the final paragraphs flattens the subtext and reduces the resonance of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of truth and legacy is well-developed through the "orbits" metaphor, but the ending relies on explicit moralizing ("Her father had taught her that devotedly observant people change the world...") which triggers a penalty for Thematic Echo in the final paragraph. The text message also articulates the thesis too directly, reducing subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    The thematic resolution is powerful, particularly the recontextualization of the "first sound" from a cricket to a mother's sob. The concept of "unmaking" art to grant absolution resonates deeply, and the ending image of the correction persisting in reality is poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story explicitly states its themes and moral conclusions ("The villagers would understand their fear as a map rather than a void"), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. This didactic approach—telling the reader exactly what the silence means and how to feel about it—flattens the potential for resonance. The thematic "healing" feels unearned because the trauma is handled as a puzzle to be solved rather than a complex reality.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explication and moralizing summaries ("only by honoring the past could the future be forged") rather than subtext. The story tells the reader exactly what to feel about "aberrant mercy" instead of allowing the action to dramatize it.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of artistic legacy is present but heavy-handed, relying on explicit summary ("a shared anthem," "rising nostalgia that healed") to convey meaning. The ending tells the reader how to feel rather than allowing the resonance to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is hammered home through the incessant repetition of the phrase "willowglass hope" rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The resolution offers a simplistic fix to a complex problem, lacking the nuance or ambiguity required for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.6)
    Themes are articulated through explicit authorial statement ("The fossil was both fact and mysticism," "grief was a transitional object") rather than emerging organically from subtext and action. The story relies on "Thematic Echo," where the narrative explicitly states its thesis using prompt-like language, depriving the reader of the chance to interpret the meaning through the drama.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through narration and the final dialogue, leaving little room for subtext or reader interpretation. The prophecy's question ("What will you build...") articulates the thesis directly, triggering a penalty for didactic moralizing at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of restoration is coherent but delivered through explicit statement ("courage could be reclaimed in the quiet acts") rather than subtext. The ending summarizes the lesson learned rather than letting the resonance of the image carry the weight, reducing the potential impact.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit telling ("To distill complexity into essence: this had become Silas's motivation") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The repetition of the "palimpsest promise" and "percolate" metaphors hammers the point home didactically, leaving little room for subtext or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("survival isn't just endurance, but the active practice of care") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending reduces the narrative to a lecture, violating the "show, don't tell" principle regarding the story's core thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than dramatized, with the text explaining its own metaphors as they occur ("turning grief into geometry"). The ending relies on a heavy-handed moral summary ("learned that sometimes letting go was the most precise measurement of all") which triggers the penalty for explicit moralizing in place of resonant, unstated subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly preached by the narrator ("She understands that independence does not mean solitude..."). There is no subtext because the story explains its own meaning at every turn. The prompt phrase "brittle awakening" is used as a thematic label rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and summary ("Lira realized that the thread she sought was...") rather than emerging from subtext. The story relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the protagonist articulates the thesis directly. The concept of connection is handled with sentimental platitudes rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    The thematic resolution is the story's strongest element, avoiding a tidy &quot;fix-it&quot; ending by acknowledging that human division persists without alien interference. The shift from cosmic paranoia to mundane mistrust provides a resonant, earned nuance to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.5)
    Theme is asserted through explicit keywords ("wistful rebellion") and a moralizing summary in the final paragraph ("bravest explorers know when to listen") rather than emerging organically from action.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition rather than subtext. Phrases like "Her face blindness had always been a subtraction; now it became an addition" and the final paragraph's summary of her emotional state ("empathy wasn't dormant anymore") flatten the narrative resonance into a moral statement.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    The concept of "reversible exile" is integrated beautifully into the narrative logic and thematic resolution. The ending successfully recontextualizes the station from a tool of erasure to a monument of return, offering a satisfying conceptual repricing of the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.5)
    Theme is heavily over-articulated through the repetition of abstract labels ("pixelated amnesty," "luminous disbelief") rather than emerging from dramatic action. This reliance on "Thematic Echo" substitutes told meaning for earned subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and sermon-like dialogue ("Maybe some circles are meant to be broken") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending relies on a "Thematic Echo" where characters state the thesis aloud, flattening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of shared resilience is coherent but delivered through explicit exposition ("She understood now—the temple inscriptions were...") rather than subtextual resonance. The story states its moral directly in the narration and dialogue, which flattens the potential for reader participation and deeper resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered via explicit lecture ("Mirrors only show the outer shell") rather than emergent subtext. This overt moralizing in the final act flattens the resonance of the guilt reveal, reducing the narrative to a parable.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the final paragraph, reducing subtext to a sermon ("The eclipsed covenant wasn't a burden to bear but a garden to tend"). This didactic summation flattens the potential resonance of the scar/root imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of "memories for miracles" is central and legible. However, the resonance is dampened by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases, which makes the emotional conclusion feel more like a checklist completion than an earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the final paragraphs ("She would not let the applause... defined her," "every ending is a prelude"), violating the subtext requirement. This overt "Thematic Echo" flattens resonance by explaining the meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge from the narrative action.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of presence/absence and the nature of transition is coherent and intellectually stimulating. However, the story tends to state its thematic conclusions explicitly ("understanding that transition has no moment, only a field of proximity") rather than letting them emerge solely from the subtext of the action. The resolution feels slightly like a fable's moral.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central theme of hybridity is compellingly rendered through the artifact, but the text abandons subtext in the final paragraphs to explicitly lecture the reader ("Elara understood now that...", "The wonder was in the changing"). This thematic echo flattens the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme is poignant but delivered with a heavy hand, particularly in the final paragraph which summarizes the moral ("discovered what holds them together: the weight of all we leave unsaid") rather than letting the action speak. This explicitly didactic conclusion flattens the resonance of the shell imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermons ("Forgive the past, flow forward"; "Healing was not linear, but like water"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The narrative relies on these aphorisms to carry emotional weight, resulting in a "Thematic Echo" penalty for moralizing in place of dramatized resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statement ("The silence you seek...") rather than dramatized struggle. The connection between the "confidence man's deceit" and the "unspoken words" is underdeveloped, leaving the central concept of "releasing silence" to feel like an unearned platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of preservation versus exploitation is coherent but delivered heavily through exposition and moralizing summary ("golden cage," "crop for the empire's factories"). The ending relies on a thematic statement ("some dreams are worth more...") rather than letting the resonant image of the planted seed speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of preserving ephemeral beauty is well-integrated and culminates in the resonant image of the winter jasmine blooming in the emerald. The story avoids heavy-handed moralizing, allowing the "singular" nature of the captured moment to speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    The story leans heavily on explicit thematic statements ("contentment's source was not within... but within...") rather than letting the subtext emerge organically. This overt moralizing near the end flattens the resonance of the final image, doing the work for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("Welcome nuance into certainty..."), eliminating subtext. The narrative constantly explains the symbolism of its props (mirror, cloak) rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story explicitly preaches its theme to the reader ("The lesson was complete: vanish not into nothing..."), leaving no room for subtext or ambiguity. The reliance on aphoristic statements ("To appear, one must first vanish") flattens the narrative into a parable. Resonance is undercut by the urge to explain the meaning of every image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("She taught that...") rather than emerging organically from the action. This didactic summary flattens the potential resonance into a stated lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the theme is resonant, the story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("found what he sought—the sacred in the simple") and summary ("decision was not a grand rebellion") rather than letting the subtext carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.8)
    Themes are delivered through heavy-handed sermonizing ("signify a promise... that hid behind truth") rather than subtext. The conclusion explicitly explains the moral to the reader ("truth often hides behind the light"), flattening any potential resonance into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of retrograde causality is interesting but delivered largely through exposition ("The prophecy didn't predict; it rewrote") and summarized realizations. The resonance relies more on stated philosophy than subtext emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme is poignant but suffers from over-articulation in the final paragraphs ("She understood now that naming fears didn't banish them..."). This explicit moralizing deflates the resonance of the mirror image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("quiet victory," "quiet strength") rather than emerging from the narrative. The story relies on "label-speak" ("earnest naivety") to assert a thesis that isn't proven by the dramatic action. The resolution offers a tidy, simplified moral about patience restoring balance, lacking complexity or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.5)
    Theme is handled didactically, with the narrative explicitly stating its intent to "spin the fragments... into a shared meaning" rather than allowing resonance to emerge from action. The story explains its own symbols ("The wind chime's silence now seemed a signal"), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. The ending feels like a moral summary rather than an earned thematic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is coherent but explicitly preached to the reader in the climax ("She understood now... not to merge them, but to let them dance"). This overt moralizing replaces subtext and reduces the thematic resonance to a stated lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through sledgehammer repetition of key phrases ("watcher's burden," "trust under pressure") rather than emerging from subtext. The final paragraph explicitly states the moral ("reminder of the watcher's burden"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty for didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of integration versus transcendence is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed didacticism. The ending relies on explicit summary statements ("survival meant integration," "duplication was never the problem") rather than letting the dramatic action speak for itself, which significantly flattens the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=2.4)
    The theme is delivered through repetitive lectures on "innovation" and "orthogonal" thinking rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative acts as a sermon on creativity, explicitly stating its thesis multiple times ("safeguarding a space for innovation") instead of allowing the reader to infer meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transforming grief into laughter is touching, but the execution suffers from explicit moralizing. The narration explains the thesis directly in the final paragraph ("A true haunting does not frighten; it holds. It tends to what we cannot say..."), which flattens the subtext into a sermon. The resonance would be stronger if the story trusted the image of the thawing house without the diagnostic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies heavily on explicit theme statements ("The pendant taught that...", "The cultist's gift had been a lesson..."), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The final paragraph overtly moralizes the central concept, flattening the subtext into a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of "creative destruction" is central to the resolution, though the narrative tends to explain the theme explicitly ("Creative destruction was not about destroying to build...") rather than trusting the imagery alone. The final resonance of the "frozen bloom" is strong, saving it from feeling too didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of silence as presence rather than absence is beautifully developed through the "shard of hush" concept. The shift from broadcasting (ego) to listening (receptivity) feels organic to the plot and resonates powerfully without slipping into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is stated explicitly in the text ("permanent transient world," "resilience"), leaving little room for subtextual resonance. The narrative didacticism ("Lina knew each crossing was a thread...") explains the meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    The thematic inquiry into connection is rigorously explored, moving from a mechanical definition (thread/knot) to an experiential one (water/gaze). The ending resolves the premise with a satisfying reconfiguration that feels earned by the prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding freedom within confinement resonates, but the execution relies on repetitive keyword insertion ("unfolded horizons," "edge geometry") rather than organic subtext. The resonance is achieved, but the mechanism is slightly too visible.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative explicitly states its themes and prompt elements ("My incidental heroism blooms"), destroying subtext. The story tells the reader how to interpret events rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action. This meta-commentary flattens the emotional resonance of the rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of erasure vs. memory is poignant but slightly repetitive, with the phrase "unremembered" appearing four times. The final contrast between the tragedy below and the "cat videos" above effectively reweights the narrative stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing dialogue ("In failure, there is a map") and on-the-nose narration ("She understood that the error... was a crack"), leaving no room for subtext. The ending relies on platitudes ("ready to write a new chapter") rather than an earned, resonant image, resulting in a heavy-handed didactic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "persistence beyond meaning" is poignant and well-integrated into the diamond’s function. However, the narrative tends to explicate these themes directly ("The storyteller knew the curse was not malice but memory") rather than letting them emerge solely through subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is shouted rather than implied, with phrases like "cosmic joke" and "frostbitten hope" repeated as mantras instead of emerging from subtext. The story tells the reader exactly how to feel about every moment, leaving no room for interpretation or genuine resonance. It relies on stated profundity over earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme is coherent but articulated explicitly in the narrative ("beauty was not memory to preserve but rhythm to risk"), which feels didactic. The resonance is slightly diminished by telling the reader exactly what the events meant.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is over-articulated through explicit phrases like "link their absences" and "broken promises might mend," leaving little room for subtext. The emotional resonance is asserted by the narrator rather than emerging organically from the action or imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit aphorisms ("every silence was a seed") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The ending offers a sentimental moral that summarizes the meaning for the reader instead of allowing resonance to build from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing in the narrative voice ("stories never truly end... only fold and refold") rather than emerging organically from action. This didactic approach flattens subtext and reduces the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than dramatized. The narrative relies on "Thematic Echoes" and summary to convey meaning ("Cipher of longing had taught her that longing itself was true subject"), violating the show-don't-tell principle for subtext. The moral is delivered as a lecture in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is articulated through explicit moralizing ("fear is a persistent gardener," "love could exist without condition") rather than emerging organically from the action. The result feels more aphoristic than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader via journal entries and internal monologue ("The chronically curious... are doomed," "Some constellations... are meant to stay broken"). This overt moralizing in the final beats replaces organic subtext with aphorism, triggering the penalty for thematic echoing and explanatory closure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is didactic, with the narrator explicitly defining resilience ("not about never falling, but about rising") multiple times. This sermonizing ("In the heart of that silence, resilience is annotated...") flattens subtext and replaces earned resonance with a moral lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Wonder must be woven") and a concluding lecture, reducing the narrative to a fable with an attached lesson rather than earning resonance through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of transforming trauma into art is powerful, but the ending suffers from explicit moralizing. Phrases like "This was the covenant of the mask restorer" and "reveal the geography of survival" explain the subtext rather than letting the final image resonate on its own. This didactic tendency in the final paragraph lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=2.1)
    The story concludes with explicit moralizing ("all spoke the same truth: that the unknown becomes known through listening"), which violates the standard against sermonizing endings. Themes of "silence" and "empathy" are asserted through abstract nouns rather than emerging organically from subtext or action.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies heavily on explicit thematic statements in dialogue and narration ("Melancholy doesn't care about equations") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from subtext. The ending, where the protagonist literally writes the story's moral on a slate, is didactic and reduces resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("a reminder that voices never truly die") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The story relies on sentimental assertions about memory and love instead of dramatizing the complexity or burden of those concepts. The resolution offers a tidy, moralizing summary that precludes interpretive depth.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story ends with an explicit sermon ("In this way, stories unfold not through force, but through attention...") that explains the theme directly to the reader, flattening the subtext. This didactic conclusion violates the "show, don't tell" principle for thematic resonance and robs the reader of interpreting the emotional weight themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is imaginative but didactic, explicitly stating the thesis ("Empty spaces remember...") multiple times. The final lines effectively preach the moral to the reader, violating the subtextual requirement for high-end literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Kael understood that some limits could only be discovered...") rather than emerging from the drama. Concepts of "infinite" and "fractal" are repeated as keywords without deepening the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed moralizing ("every great discovery begins with a single, diligent question") rather than subtext. The concept of "sociable isolation" is stated repeatedly as a label but not dramatically explored.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.2)
    Themes are delivered through heavy-handed explicit statements ("every broken thing holds a ghost of its wholeness") rather than organic subtext. The repetition of the "driftwood nostalgia" motif feels forced and mechanical, reducing emotional resonance to a keyword checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.2)
    Themes are explicitly stated ("altruistic desire," "collective effort") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending moralizes ("brambled hope was the essence") instead of allowing resonance to arise from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is over-articulated through direct statements ("silence learned to sing," "mercy in endings") rather than emerging organically from action. The repetition of the prompt phrase "beautifully flawed" attempts to force a thematic resonance that the dramatization does not support.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of thankless, invisible labor is poignant and well-developed through the action. However, the final paragraph summarizes this theme explicitly ("graceless in her duty, beautiful in its execution"), reducing the resonance that a more oblique, image-driven ending would have achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative ("separation could be transformed into connection"), leaving no room for subtext. The ending moralizes the experience, telling the reader exactly what to feel rather than letting the resonance emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of "beginning through subtraction" is coherent but delivered through explicit statements ("Stories... start in the silence before them") rather than subtext. The characters frequently articulate the story's thesis to one another, reducing the interpretive depth.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of memory preservation versus pain relief is handled with nuance, avoiding a tidy moral in favor of a complex trade-off. The final insight—that smoothing the memory would erase the person—offers a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.7)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed didacticism and explicit moralizing ("Time... flows best when it carries every voice"). The ending reduces the narrative to a sermon, telling the reader exactly what to think rather than allowing meaning to emerge from subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and moralizing summary ("Her final thought... all canyons are ultimately mind") rather than emerging organically. The ending resolves into a tidy, sermonizing lesson that leaves little room for subtext or resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("seeds of vigilance") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending relies on a moralizing summary of the character's internal state rather than a resonant image or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme is delivered through explicit assertions ("The silence not empty; it is full of music") and repeated labels ("empathy in motion") rather than subtext or action. The ending moralizes directly, preventing genuine thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ending explicitly explains the theme ("The difficult beauty was this: that sacrifice could be reversed..."), which collapses the story's resonance into a moral lesson. This didactic summary prevents the reader from engaging with the subtext on their own terms.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=2.4)
    The story violates the "show, don't tell" principle by explicitly stating its themes in the narrative voice ("Silence is the shape of love," "empathy was not a destination"). The ending devolves into a moralizing summary that lectures the reader on the meaning of the story, triggering a severe penalty for thematic echoing and lack of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermons ("The seed teaches that stillness is not absence") rather than subtext or action. The narrative moralizes directly to the reader, summarizing the lesson instead of allowing it to emerge from the dramatic logic. This approach flattens the complexity into a simple binary that is resolved by magic.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative relies on explicit moralizing to convey its theme ("Resilience wasn't a place... but a lesson"), culminating in a sermon-like final paragraph. This lecture-style delivery replaces earned subtext and fails to trust the reader to interpret the events.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing to convey its meaning, particularly in the final paragraph ("reminder that the world was a web of converging forces"). This overt thematic statement replaces organic subtext and creates a "fable" feel rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story is didactic, explicitly telling the reader the theme ("wonder was no longer a fleeting dream") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. The narrative treats "wonder" as a commodity to be dispensed, resulting in a sermonizing tone that flattens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story commits the cardinal sin of explicitly stating its thesis: "He realized that the failure... was not a wall but a door." This heavy-handed moralizing flattens the subtext and reduces the narrative to a parable. The insight is told to the reader rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than subtextual, culminating in a literal formula ("Empathy = DeltaSelf / DeltaOther"). This overt "Thematic Echo" flattens the narrative resonance and reduces complex emotion to a solve-for-X summary.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed repetition of the prompt phrases ("fade from memory to myth," "coax wonder") rather than subtext or action. The usage of these phrases often borders on incoherence (e.g., "faded across the fade from memory to myth"), turning the theme into a mechanical insertion rather than an organic realization.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is severely undercut by explicit sermonizing in the final paragraphs (&quot;The truthful lie was this...&quot;). Instead of allowing the resonance of the &quot;she was already gone&quot; reveal to linger, the narrative explains the subtext to the reader, converting the story into an essay on its own meaning. This violates the &quot;show, don't tell&quot; standard for thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of reciprocity in grief is poignant, but the narrative undercuts its power by explicitly stating the lesson ("Mei understood... not revenge, but reciprocity") rather than letting the action carry the subtext. This didactic "telling" flattens the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.8)
    The ending explicitly sermonizes, having the protagonist articulate the moral ("resilience is not found...") and the narrator explain the meaning ("true magic had been the barter itself"). This removes subtext and violates the show-don't-tell standard for thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated via the repeated phrase "weight of withheld truth" rather than emerging organically from the action. The ending pivots to moralizing summary ("not a burden to be shed, but a compass"), reducing the thematic resonance to a direct lesson for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in a written note ("safety, once bottled") rather than emerging organically from action. The result is a moralizing summary that replaces dramatic subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed sermonizing, culminating in the protagonist literally shouting the story's thesis ("The new dawn is carved from the shadows of the past!") at the climax. Subtext is replaced by overt moralizing about the value of the past versus the "digital" present. This lack of nuance flattens the narrative into a simple allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("It is not the heart... but the spaces between") and heavy-handed morals ("The light remembers"). The story tells the reader what to feel rather than allowing resonance to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial statement ("Elara realized that the labyrinth's purpose was not to trap sorrow...") rather than emerging organically from the action. The resolution pivots to a binary moral (hope vs. sorrow) that feels imposed and sentimental rather than earned. The "mundane miracles" concept appears as a list rather than a subtextual realization.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of "bound release" is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("Elias's purpose... was to knit") rather than organic subtext. The structural repetition turns the thematic resonance into a redundant lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative is didactic, explicitly explaining the paradoxes to the reader instead of allowing them to emerge from the action. The final paragraph delivers a direct moral sermon ("the most compassionate act is to..."), violating the prohibition against sermonizing endings and reducing thematic resonance to a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies on didactic explanations of its theme ("That was their failure of imagination," "uncloaked... a conspiracy of silence") instead of allowing subtext to emerge from action. The ending explicitly moralizes the "art of noticing," which flattens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and moralizing ("testament to meaning," "monument to memory") rather than subtext. The narrative explicitly tells the reader what to feel, resulting in a sermonizing tone devoid of earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of broken trust is present but relies heavily on explicit labeling ("sound of trust breaking," "truce of hush") rather than subtext. The metaphorical weight placed on the "sound" of betrayal feels forced and disconnected from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    The concept of "voting for weather" offers fresh thematic resonance regarding collective will and nature. However, the dialogue tends to state the thesis explicitly ("Some phenomena must be sensed, not solved"), converting subtext into text and slightly flattening the potential for ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme is explicitly preached in the final paragraphs ("lock had never been the true barrier"), flattening potential resonance into a stated moral. The "Draw the dawn" note reduces thematic discovery to an instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of candor is delivered didactically, with the narrative explicitly stating its moral ("every small honest moment creates a leaf that never wilts") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. The ending offers a tidy, sermonizing resolution where "candor bloomed," lacking the ambiguity or complexity expected in literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is resonant but heavily over-articulated through narration ("truth was not a thing to be spoken," "wonder would become not memory"). The story tells the reader the meaning of the events rather than allowing the subtext to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of integration—processing "ghosts" to resolve internal dissonance—is handled well. The "miniaturization" of fear serves as a solid thematic vehicle, transforming a sci-fi concept into a psychological resolution without becoming overly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing statements ("proof was there... listening heals") rather than subtext. The story lectures the reader, collapsing complexity into a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("encrypt her vulnerability into strength") rather than emerging from subtext or conflict. The ending moralizes directly ("vulnerability, encoded, became the key"), reducing resonance to a lesson rather than an experience.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of memory and grief is coherent, but the story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph to state its thesis. The recurring "gleaming silence" motif feels mechanically inserted to satisfy a prompt rather than organically woven into the narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of censorship versus safety is well-articulated and woven into the mechanics of the story. The ending successfully lands the thematic argument that peace has a price (ignorance), though the explicit statement of this theme in the final paragraph is slightly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of history-as-language and the cost of erasure ("agreed-upon lies") is tightly woven and lands a coherent emotional effect. While the "building as grammar" conceit is relentless, it successfully unifies the narrative logic and charges the final image of the scribe.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story suffers from explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraphs where the theme is stated directly ("True independence... was not the absence of connection"). This "Thematic Echo" flattens the subtext, explaining the metaphors ("cocoon," "bridge") rather than letting the resonance emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.0)
    Themes of forgiveness and peace are delivered through explicit, moralizing statements ("The act of forging was itself a form of forgiveness") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The ending asserts a "true act of peace" without earning that resonance through the specific struggles of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing statements ("To echo is to be remembered," "some echoes are meant to be heard") rather than emerging from the subtext. The constant reiteration of the central thesis prevents any organic resonance or ambiguity from developing.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through repetitive labels ("windows of connection," "pure memory") rather than subtext or action. The narrative explains its own meaning repeatedly, leaving no room for reader interpretation or resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial statements ("In that moment, the philosopher understood...") rather than subtext or action. The ending moralizes directly ("a reminder that hidden patterns surround us"), flattening potential resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of truth versus comfortable lies is coherent but delivered through explicit exposition ("The truth he'd excavated wasn't just about survival..."). The story tends to explain its subtext rather than letting it emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme is resonant but heavily explicated through direct statements like "Atlas understood: the prophet below was not a person, but an age struggling to be born." This overt thematic echo reduces the subtextual power, telling the reader the meaning instead of letting it emerge solely from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of memory and preservation is coherent but heavily explicated through summary ("Her motivation had always been simple," "she realized she had finally gleaned..."). The ending relies on stating the moral ("sweeten the present") rather than letting the subtext resonate through action alone, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme is coherent but heavily didactic, with the text explicitly explaining the symbolism ("device that turned grief into music") and the character's nature. This over-articulation robs the subtext of its power, leaving little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is delivered through didactic narration ("The tyrant's power lay in manufactured crisis") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The story explicitly states its moral multiple times, leaving little room for the reader to interpret the "patient revolution" for themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed moralizing, particularly in the closing lines where the "truth would rise like water." The connection between the Underground Railroad and a modern workplace safety cover-up feels tenuous and unearned, resulting in a preachy rather than resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme is consistent but delivered with heavy-handed didacticism ("This is how we turn an apology into action"). The ending explicitly explains the metaphor ("The light through storm clouds wasn't just metaphor"), which collapses subtext into a moral lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of creating art/meaning from survival mechanics is clear and resonates in the final image of the bell ringing across time. However, the emotional impact is blunted by the lack of narrative struggle and the reliance on telling ("irreverent awe").

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed sermonizing ("truth, like data, never truly disappears") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending explicitly states the moral of the story, removing interpretive agency from the reader. The resonance is forced by assertion rather than earned through the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story relies heavily on explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("Empathy became their compass," "This was how communities survived"). Themes are delivered as sermonizing summary statements rather than emerging organically from the subtext or action, violating the show-don't-tell principle.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit summation ("Now she understood that the end was a sound...") rather than emerging organically from the action. The resolution leans toward sentimental moralizing ("every ending could be a beginning") rather than subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit, repetitive sermonizing ("nurture intersubjective understanding") rather than emerging organically from action. The narrative tells the reader exactly what to feel and think, leaving no room for subtext or ambiguity. The repeated use of academic jargon clashes with the attempted lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=2.8)
    Themes are explicitly stated in expository summary ("knowing the echo of wisdom would endure") rather than emerging from conflict. The moral is delivered as a sermon, leaving no room for subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial assertion ("discovered the deepest truth") rather than emerging from the narrative action. The ending relies on a heavy-handed moral summary ("we heal not by forgetting...") that flattens resonance and violates the show-don't-tell principle of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central concept of acoustic preservation is strong, but the thematic epiphany is over-articulated in the text ("Elias realized the pattern... was not in the words... but in the courage to testify"). This explicit thesis statement dampens the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story explicitly articulates its thesis in the final paragraphs ("learned that clinging to echoes is not about holding them..."), which triggers the penalty for explicit moralizing. The resonance is flattened by this explanation, converting subtext into text.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("time is both constant and fleeting") and repetitive labeling rather than emerging organically from the action. The heavy-handed recurrence of "luminous ache" and "ephemeral" flattens the subtext into a lecture on the story's intended meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed assertion ("even fragments could sing if you knew how to listen") and moralizing conclusions ("every farewell could be a masterpiece"). The "scent of hope" acts as a forced motif that tells the reader how to feel instead of allowing resonance to emerge from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.3)
    The themes of order and understanding resolve into a tidy, moralizing summary ("shadows knew their place," "world could breathe a little easier"). The ending lacks resonance because the insight is stated directly rather than emerging from a complex struggle or ambiguous reality.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of narrative repair ("bone setting") is resonant and well-developed. However, the score is capped by a Thematic Echo in dialogue; Moira articulates the thesis ("certainty is a kind of cruelty") too explicitly, reducing subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and sentimental assertion ("The world... learned that even the smallest shard could hold a universe") rather than emergent subtext. The story relies on "sermonizing endings" and abstract summaries of meaning ("gift of pure reflection") that replace narrative resonance with stated lessons.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.2)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("teaching its lesson of slow transformation"), which dictates the meaning rather than letting it emerge from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("understands softness was true") rather than subtext or action. The narrative moralizes directly to the reader, reducing the complexity of the "realism vs. hope" debate to a simple binary.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and heavy-handed exposition ("sacred practice was no longer a relic..."). The story tells the reader exactly what the events mean rather than allowing resonance to emerge from subtext or ambiguity. The ending relies on a tidy, sermonizing summary.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit "thematic echo" and explanation ("she realized that the act of sealing starlight was also a sealing of sorrow") rather than emerging from action. The story relies on sentimental assertion of meaning—"transformation of loss into geometry"—instead of dramatizing that transformation through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of processing grief by releasing rather than hoarding memories is coherent and lands with a satisfying conceptual turn. The pivot from "harvesting" to "sharing" resonates well with the "wounded season" motif, though the "cellar of reason" phrasing leans slightly toward abstract telling.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of transforming grief and guilt into structure (weaving) is resonant and organically developed through the central action. The "shingled hush" and calcification motifs tightly bind the concept of memory to the physical reality of the grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story explicitly explains its theme to the reader ("She understood that the lesson was not to hold on..."), removing ambiguity and resonance. This didactic approach flattens the subtext entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than emerging from subtext ("hoping to reconstruct something whole," "narrative of redemption"). The climax relies on a platitude delivered in dialogue ("forgot the brushes") and a summary of the moral, resulting in a sermonizing effect that flattens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated via "equations for hope" rather than emerging through subtext or complex action. The moralizing ending ("Hope equals...") feels imposed and sentimental, lacking the ambiguity or earned resonance of a literary investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of transforming grief into legacy is well-integrated with the central action. The final realization feels earned by the ritual, though the "harmony of absolution" leans slightly into abstract summary rather than concrete resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("Truth often hides in the quiet") and self-explanatory metaphors. The story tells the reader what everything means ("a metaphor for the silence she now cherished") rather than allowing subtext to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of memory encoded in utility is resonant and well-integrated into the central prop. However, the execution leans toward the didactic, particularly in the dialogue ("It doesn't speak. It remembers."), which states the subtext aloud. The concept of the weavers is compelling but somewhat expository.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated multiple times using prompt language ("geography of healing," "lonesome splendor") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The ending delivers a moralizing summary that removes ambiguity, violating the "show, don't tell" principle for thematic resonance. The reliance on explaining the story's meaning in the final paragraph significantly diminishes its literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of "flawed genesis" and hybrid beauty is coherent and lands well at the end. However, the subtext is frequently made text; the story explicitly labels emotions and themes ("bitterly sweet burden," "flawed genesis") multiple times, reducing the reader's opportunity to interpret the meaning for themselves. The resonance is slightly dampened by this didactic labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than emerging from subtext ("Maya believed that unyielding compassion could turn even the darkest legacy into light"). The ending moralizes directly ("She had proven that scars can sing"), removing ambiguity and resonance in favor of a sermonizing summary.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("silence could be a choice, not a cage") at the end rather than emerging organically from the narrative arc. The conflation of skepticism with blind faith muddles the central inquiry, treating the protagonist's lack of questioning as a virtue despite her label.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme is consistent but delivered through heavy-handed explication ("the garden was a Turing machine," "light without fire was still a kind of burning"). The story articulates its thesis directly to the reader in the narration, preventing the resonance that comes from subtext and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through dialogue ("Grief isn't a line, it's a spiral") rather than emerging from the narrative subtext. The story relies on stating its thesis about collective mourning instead of allowing the reader to intuit it through the character's unguided experience.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "incremental absolution" is woven well through the pendulum metaphor, but the ending stumbles into explicit moralizing. The final paragraph summarizes the thesis ("absolution wasn't granted... but accumulated") rather than letting the resonant image of the winding stand on its own, triggering the sermonizing penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.9)
    Thematic work relies on explicit moralizing ("Intentions, he realized, were not always spoken") rather than subtext or dramatic enactment. The story tells the reader exactly what the symbols mean, leaving no room for resonance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered didactically, with the narrative explicitly stating its thesis ("Innovation had to be seeded," "Innovation could grow in the narrow space"). The ending moralizes rather than letting the imagery resonate on its own ("She had learned that writing the future meant..."). While the central metaphor of "mapping ignorance" is clever, the execution feels more like an essay than a discovered truth.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through direct assertion and moralizing summary ("stories never truly die") rather than emerging organically from action. The narrative over-explains symbols ("She realized the broadcast was a cipher"), leaving no room for subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader ("gallery whispers that safety is a mirage," "symbol of a safety that never truly existed"). This over-articulation flattens subtext into text. The repetition of the concept "incomplete" (appearing six times) forces the thesis rather than allowing it to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of "truth as method" vs. "mythology" is intellectually compelling and tightly integrated with the cog artifact. The resonance is slightly dampened by heavy-handed exposition ("The seafarer's chronometer represented method"), but the final image remains conceptually strong.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("harmony was not addition but subtraction") rather than emerging organically from subtext or ambiguity. The "braid" metaphor and the lesson on unlearning hatred are presented as lectures, leaving little room for reader interpretation or resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and sermonizing ("turning rust into bloom," "gentle rebellion") rather than emerging organically from the action. The ending summarizes the lesson for the reader, collapsing potential subtext into a tidy, unearned message about renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The truth was simple: wonder was a current...") rather than emerging organically from action. The narrative relies on "Thematic Echo" in the final paragraph, stating the lesson directly instead of allowing the reader to infer it from the drama.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("he realized that the act of noticing... was a prayer") rather than subtext. The story repeatedly tells the reader the moral ("silence can be a living thing") instead of allowing meaning to emerge from dramatic action or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story suffers from explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("learned the one truth that mattered: that no truth was ever singular"). The theme is stated directly in the narrative voice rather than emerging through subtext, which flattens the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of regret as a burden to be carried rather than solved is resonant and organically developed. The realization at the edge of the rupture ties the speculative premise back to the emotional core without becoming overly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("He had proven... that a stranger could indeed remember kindness") and the literal writing of the moral on a wall. Subtext is absent; the story tells the reader exactly how to feel and what the events signify, preventing organic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial assertions ("Liora understood that...") rather than emerging from the narrative events. The ending moralizes the outcome, reducing subtext to a stated lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing statements ("belief that even bleakness could birth brilliance") rather than emerging from the narrative action. The ending sermonizes on the meaning of the events instead of allowing subtext to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the ending ("The dead teach the living...") and the riddle dialogue, leaving little room for subtext. The narrative explains its own meaning through the "unbosomed secret" rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central theme is coherent but weakened by explicit statement ("Turning obstacles into instruments was her only scripture") rather than organic emergence. The ending relies on summarizing the moral ("the true instrument was not...") instead of letting the resonant image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of curiosity versus resignation is handled with nuance; the recontextualization of the watchers as historians rather than gods adds depth. The final image of carving a question mark transforms the central conflict into a resonant, open-ended resolution without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than dramatized ("rescuing truth from a pit of lies"), and the ending moralizes directly to the reader. The lack of subtext and the didactic conclusion flatten the potential for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "interlaced absence" is poignant and shapes the resolution, but it is articulated through explicit narration rather than emerging organically from subtext. The concept of preserving abandoned dreams is emotionally resonant but borders on sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=2.1)
    Theme is handled through the repetitive insertion of the phrase "reclaimed stillness" and explicit moralizing in the final paragraph. Subtext is absent; the story tells the reader exactly what to feel and think.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story explicitly moralizes the theme, explaining the metaphor to the reader ("to transform grief, one must polish it..."). This didactic "telling" flattens the subtext and resolves ambiguity with sermonizing statements rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of potential and grief is poignant but delivered with a heavy hand. The story explicitly states its thesis in the final paragraph ("the potential stopped being unused and became... infinitely remembered"), leaving little room for subtext or reader interpretation. The resonance relies on assertion rather than organic emergence from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "universe as typeface" metaphor offers a coherent thematic center, but the execution relies on direct explanation ("It mapped belonging itself") rather than subtext. The theme is asserted rather than emerging organically from the conflict or the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed moralizing statements ("memory cannot be forged forever," "time... could be mended") rather than emerging from the narrative. The subtext is nonexistent because the protagonist's realizations are explicitly explained to the reader. The story tells the reader what to feel rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit "Thematic Echoes" ("recycle mistakes into wisdom," "space between apology and forgiveness") rather than emerging from subtext or action. This reliance on stating the thesis directly in the narrative voice flattens the nuance and results in a moralizing tone that pre-digests the meaning for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story succumbs to explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("navigation... wasn't about arrival but about bearing"), which violates the standard against tidy morals. This summarizing thesis statement flattens the resonance of the final image, substituting authorial instruction for the reader's own realization. Without this "Thematic Echo," the score would be significantly higher.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=2.8)
    Themes are delivered through heavy-handed moralizing and explicit statements ("regrets of a world that had lost its empathy"). The story tells the reader what to feel and think in the final paragraphs, substituting sermonizing for subtext or earned resonance. The "lens" realization feels unearned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed sermonizing ("Love transcended the boundaries of form") rather than subtext or action. The ending explicitly states the moral in the narrative narration, removing ambiguity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story explicitly decodes its own symbolism ("This was her cloudbound repentance: to accept that..."), converting potential subtext into text. This didactic approach, where a voice whispers the thematic thesis directly to the character, flattens the resonance into a moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of integrated pacifism ("absorbing violence... to transform it") is inextricably linked to the plot mechanics and the final image. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the central question, avoiding a simple moral in favor of a complex, embodied stance (the Bodhisattva vow).

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statement rather than subtext; the narrative overtly explains the lesson ("Transformation wasn't a texture... but a vibration") instead of allowing it to emerge from the action. This didactic approach flattens the potential for resonance, turning the ending into a summary of the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of turning the tools of control into instruments of freedom is coherent and lands with a solid final image. The ending resonates, though the final paragraphs drift into didactic explanation ("Seren would remember what it taught...") rather than trusting the subtext of the open doors to speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of accepting transience over forcing order is successfully landed, but the execution relies on abstract assertions ("universe that demanded balance," "not meant to be solved") rather than subtext. The ending leans into a "moral of the story" summary that softens the impact of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing in the final paragraphs ("He understood now that...", "He knew the censors could erase words..."). This overt explaining of the moral replaces narrative resonance and subtext, reducing the story to a parable with a stated lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through the repetitive assertion of a slogan ("questions into destinations") rather than emerging organically from the conflict. The narrative relies on telling the reader the meaning of the duel instead of allowing the subtext to resonate through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered as a sermon in the final paragraphs ("greatest verse was not written in ink"), collapsing subtext into an explicit moral. The resonance is forced through assertions of "beauty" and "hope" rather than emerging from narrative particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and stated moralizing ("time, like love, can shatter," "challenge to the predetermined silence"). The story tells the reader what to feel rather than allowing resonance to emerge from the dramatic action, leading to a sentimental and tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of empirical truth versus subjective belief is woven masterfully into the plot and imagery. The resolution doesn't choose a side but elevates the tension between them, landing a resonant message about the nature of stories. This category is capped at 8.8 only because Q2 did not break the 9.0 gate; conceptually, the thematic work is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the final paragraphs ("The tides of remembrance had taught her..."), violating the show-don't-tell preference. The story relies on the characters articulating the thesis ("This is the color of unspoken apologies") rather than letting it emerge from subtext.

Particulars like pulsar vs. butterfly avoid platitudes. Subtext in silence between observations builds ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.2)
    Paradoxes accumulate to resonant CR—"You are the only one who returned"—reweighting fear as amplifier without creation; final clasp as "scar, beautiful and obscene" answers without stating moral.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of threat-as-dialogue emerges organically from sound-cloud mirroring; final image reconfigures "obstacle into instrument" non-literally, but "her only scripture" line edges toward direct statement.

    Final carving offers resonant answer to curiosity's death, reweighting spirals from history to questions without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of noble lies emerges organically from particulars (letter's loyalty/betrayal design), resonant CR in garden blooming reweights premise without moralizing. Parallels shift meaning at end, embracing complexity (nobility acknowledged, not erased). Minor direct echoes like "rescue truth from pit" slightly overt.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Interlaced absence reweights to presence through note motif without statement, final image of tide-rising walk resonantly answers ambition's sediment without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of time loaned/transformed emerges organically from particulars like crack-as-body and hand-tracing custom, reweighting motherhood in CR ending; subtext in "choking beauty" images avoids moralizing until late near-statement "crack was how the light entered," which resonates but borders overt.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: dust, water rings, pulsar decay—never abstract lecture. The final reconfiguration (“I’m learning to hear both”) offers resonant, non-literal answer to how a scientist should live with uncertainty. No moralizing summary; the image of her brushing dust onto moss acts as silent thesis. Counter-reading possible: retreat into mysticism rather than science—complexity preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges quietly: art transmutes criminal residue into light. The scorched testament’s brittle pages recode into molten glass, refusing a moral and letting the vessel’s glow answer the pause-driven quest. No final-period sermon, only image. Frost/ledger polarity offers plausible counter-readings—justice versus beauty—without equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of silence-as-canvas emerges through repeated frost images and fork vibrations; no moralizing caps the piece. The final breath-fogged reflection reprises brother motif and reconfigures silence from void to cathedral—an earned Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges as the cruel paradox of caretaking: every act of peace multiplies demand. The lens’s final glow reweights earlier burials as mere waypoints, not endpoints—Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. No moralizing; the sentence is delivered by image alone. Subtext in “directions home” quietly indicts the living for forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges: memory as underground resistance. Bell’s shift from signal to vessel of memory reweights earlier parcels into narrative seeds. Subtext carried in silence of anonymous donors, children’s wide eyes. Final image avoids moralizing; resonance is sonic aftertaste of bell, not statement. Complexity kept: solidarity praised yet remains fragile.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges as: to quantify memory is to donate oneself to it. No character articulates this; it crystallizes when Elara’s face appears in the final fading photograph. Subtext operates through silence—the camera man never speaks, yet his relinquishment of images teaches her fate. The halo fragment re-prices knowledge: discovery equals dispersal, a conceptual cost that lingers after plot ends.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges as “resilience through constraint”: the chain, piano, and drought are particular objects, not allegories. The closing image of roots weaving underground reweights the earlier carnival decay without moralizing. Subtextual irony—vault of life hidden under a prize counter of junk—remains implicit. One soft echo: “staggering grace” drifts toward abstraction, but the phrase is isolated and quickly re-anchored to the sentry dance, so thematic drift is minor.</question>
    <question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade>
    <comment>Third-person tight focalization stays locked to the liberator; perceptual signature is strategic, tactile, synesthetic—ivory feels like “whisper of possibility.” Rhythm modulates: clipped clusters under sentry pressure, then elongated cadence at planting. “Chain clinks, a melodic chime” marries sound to action, avoiding filter verbs. No dialogue appears; absence is acceptable and avoids voice dilution.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges without statement: trust is not a sound but a silence that transmits until it stops, leaving a pristine absence. The reconfiguration is conceptual—the greenhouse becomes the planet’s hearing aid—yet it grows from the particular image of the drifting amplifier. No moral is offered; the aftereffect is the reader’s own muttered “oh” at the idea that absence can be archived and replayed. Ambiguity is meaningful: was Kael’s act sabotage or mercy? The story refuses to decide, letting the hollow note keep echoing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from concrete returns: thawing dam = thawing heart = widening bookmark crack; no abstract statement. Final image answers unasked questions by reweighting crack from flaw to entrance—earned, not preached. Ambiguity preserved: bowl remains, next thaw unknown. Emotional after-effect visceral: reader left holding wet bookmark, not lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through conch/cast symmetry—fragile fragments become keys—avoiding overt thesis. Final “cracks are circuits” flirts with label-speak but is saved by tactile cast trace. Quiet ambivalence lingers; could risk sharper ethical edge.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: silence as preservative, map, and finally compass. Recurrent “ambered hush” shifts from descriptor to epistemic tool; no moralizing, only image-repricing at end. Subtext lives in oracle’s flaking booklet and traveler’s heartbeat against parchment—objects speak instead of exposition. Complexity accepted: endless night is not conquerable, only traversable.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: consciousness as resonance across iterations, not origin. The melted violin’s perfect circle reprises earlier spectral ribbons, reconfiguring maintenance from drudge to philosophical practice. Ambiguity lingers—is the music external or self-generated—inviting rereading without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of transparency-as-liberation emerges through dramatized revelation, not sermon. Final image of the lens on her desk reweights earlier “see beyond the surface” etching into quiet covenant. No moralizing sentence mars closure; ambiguity lingers in the “resonant hush.” Could sharpen if Elara paid a private price for honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges without sermon: gardens as living contracts, luck as unquantifiable devotion. The cracked-marble motif shifts from shame to testament, reweighted in the final spiral. One soft echo: “the true measure of luck was not in numbers” borders thematic statement, but is saved by preceding embodied proof.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges sideways: the frost metaphor migrates from literal ice on valves to temporal branching, culminating in the violet flower of spacetime—organic, not declared. Subtext in Dr. Chen’s off-page shout: career vs. wonder, science vs. intuition, left unresolved. No moralizing; the final image reweights prior frost motifs without commentary. Ambiguity lingers: is Kael enlightened or exiled? Complexity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the specific paradox of finishing another’s art by destroying her ghost; no moralizing statement required. Subtext operates in silence—bow hovering, lanterns flaring then dying—rather than exposition. Final reconfiguration reweights decay as generative, not tragic. Ambiguity lingers: is inspiration now self-sustaining or already fading? Complexity embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: the impossibility of weighing absolution is enacted, not stated, through the scale’s trembling needle. The aurora’s sorrow evolves from external backdrop to internalized peace, a reconfiguration that makes “forgive” the only metric. No moralizing line tells the reader how to feel; the final breath of cold clear light is the non-literal answer. The swallowed truth becomes a quiet marginal note—an earned, complex ambiguity that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the equation silence = mass; the story dramatizes confession as literal gravity that must be weighed and borne. Final image—wheel now inert but memory pregnant—reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: woman-ghost’s silent mouth, beads clicking like rosary he doesn’t believe in. Complexity intact: complicity of owners, complicity of heirs, no cheap absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through images of moss, ink, paper decay, and the floating swan; no explicit thesis. Final image of “crumbling peace” reweights silence from refuge to inevitable erosion. Ambiguity is purposeful: decay is neither tragic nor triumphant. Resonance is earned through particulars, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory is portable wonder, passed like music or a curl. The curl’s reprise at closure reweights its earlier role from talisman to completed circuit. Subtext lives in Eleanor’s whispered name—an entire mother-daughter history Mira never disclosed. Final image of “dreaming roots” offers resonant non-literal answer: identity persists underground, nourished by shared sound.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: memory is not merely retrieved but hosted—by walls, thread, and ultimately the archivist himself. The dragon tapestry’s return in the final draft-flutter reweights the premise without moralizing. No character articulates a thesis; the closing image of bronze quiet dreaming supplies conceptual repricing. Subtext stays in gesture—palms on metal, flutter of weft—avoiding sentimental dream-platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without statement: prediction is passivity, composition is agency. The returning image of the spiral—lens, shell, microdot—reweights “fate” as something that can be printed, baked, and eaten. Open secrets motif stays subtextual: fishermen look away, Tomás says “found it on the ferry” instead of “I know.” Final image offers resonant ambiguity: she waits for a tide that may never arrive, underscoring that authorship still depends on larger currents.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: faith as sound design, theology as negative space. Final image—indigo spreading like doubt—offers a non-literal answer to the bell question. Ambiguity is purposeful; no moral is stated, only the cost of perpetual questioning.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges obliquely: art as temporal conduit, memory as tunable instrument. No moralizing; the final image of “quiet spaces between the stars” reweights silence from absence to canvas. The nautilus spiral re-prices time itself—each chamber a spent breath—achieving Conceptual Repricing without exposition. Avoids 9.0 only because the childhood mapping is told, not dramatized, reducing experiential bite.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly: self as endlessly generative maze, freedom through surrender. No explicit thesis; final image of next raindrop reframes prior failures as recursive necessity. Labyrinth motif constrains every choice, reweights at closure. Ambiguity lingers—architect or prisoner?—without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: deafness as bridge, not barrier. The mirrored hush reweights silence from absence to substance without moralizing. Final image—drumbeat felt in the chest—offers a non-literal answer to the central question. No thematic echo or platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges as “truth recorded in solitude outlasts state secrecy,” grown from concrete particulars—barometric columns, brass scars, pigeon silhouette—never stated. Subtext operates in the silent chase above oblivious crowds, mirroring unseen knowledge systems. Final rain image offers conceptual repricing: cleansing as indictment, not redemption. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in who will read the message.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges entirely through pattern: scent as archive, tears as respiration for the dead. No abstract statement until the penultimate line, and even that is an imagic inversion (“tears…exhalation”). The final image reweights extinction from loss to stewardship without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—uncorking is both surrender and inheritance—creating genuine ambiguity about whether release is triumph or wound.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the poet’s tactile metaphors: time as braided rope, not line. The final reprise—“every fray is a door, every knot a home”—offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Impossible choice motif is insisted lyrically, yet the ambiguity feels earned because the poet’s body keeps enacting it. Stays below 9 only because the grotto’s prior whispers never contradict or complicate his stance, leaving thematic tension slightly static.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme—beauty in the unfinished—emerges through the violin’s “incomplete yet beautiful” notes and final bowl of echo, avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext operates in gesture (passing the bowl) rather than declaration. However, silence-as-metaphor is stated too often (“chronic hush” becomes refrain), edging toward thematic echo. Resonance is pleasant but not destabilizing; complexity is announced, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from tension between instrumentality and yearning: empathy as product vs. empathy as lived risk. The amber light itself becomes a running meter of this falsified warmth, darkening toward night as the illusion’s expiry is sealed. No character spells the thesis; instead the final “patient wait” crystallizes the dealer’s perpetual suspension between insight and felt life. The lingering static hum refuses moral symmetry—no redemption, only residue.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Silent contributor” motif emerges organically from dockworker particulars; theme crystallizes when Caleb’s returned locket reframes quiet labor as the port’s true heartbeat, avoiding explicit sermon yet inviting reader reflection on unseen worth—mildly undercut by closing line’s overt “melody of kindness.”

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: belonging is built, not inherited—an ethic of dedication to strangers’ forgotten ghosts. The spiral tag’s return re-prices earlier loneliness into shared grammar; no moral is preached. Subtext lives in gesture (the mother’s turned shoulder, the villagers’ quiet grass gifts) and in the arbor’s silence between notes. Complexity is honored: Kael remains “outsider-insider,” the ache still glowing at the edges.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: creation demands self-erasure; the illustrator becomes the illustration. The infinity symbol migrates from pendant to constellation, reweighting the premise in the final image. Subtext resides in the silence of the bell—no sound, only consequence. Ambiguity is purposeful: the blank folio invites future interpreters, refusing a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from pattern: grief as geometry whose variables can be mapped but never solved. Subtext lives in gesture—glass eyes meet across stone, a mute accusation. Final image reframes prior material without moralising: love persists inside an unsolved equation. No thematic echo line; risk of pseudo-profundity is skirted by concrete particulars (obsidian fruit, velvet pouch).

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the pattern of cached gifts: visibility can be reciprocal without physical presence. The tape’s ghost voice and the boy’s live voice form a palimpsest of caretaking across sixty-six years, reweighting “being seen” as auditory communion. No moral is stated; the final image of Mara tasting coal smoke while listening delivers conceptual repricing. Ambiguity remains—will the boy search for her?—inviting reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges via accreted imagery: storm damage → self-willed regrowth → acceptance of “gentle chaos.” No explicit thesis; final rain ceremony offers non-literal answer to control question. Subtext resides in silence shared with farmer—two resistors wordlessly acknowledging surrender. Avoids sentimentality by keeping insight vegetal and tactile rather than therapeutic.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the repeating amber/sun image: memory must be melted and re-cast to stay alive. No explicit thesis; the re-painted portrait and the brooch’s onward journey carry the conceptual repricing. Subtext resides in the scavenger’s silence and her decision to sleep—renunciation speaks louder than exposition. Final image of “the ant seemed to move” offers resonant ambiguity: art animates the trapped past, yet also ends her insomnia.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from the paradox of magnification: to enlarge wonder one must accept blind spots. Subtext sits in the overlapping shadows—what amplifies also obscures. No explicit thesis; final image of “steady, unpredictable rhythm” reweights the opening certainty. Ambiguity lingers without confusion: is the new magic gift or hazard? Complexity embraced, no moral ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges without statement: absence as compositional negative space. Subtext lives in gesture—she “plays” silence the way a musician plays rests. Final image of spray writing “first draft across her skin” offers non-literal answer: meaning is iterative, never fixed. No moralizing; complexity intact—silence remains both wound and bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the concretized metaphor: mapping absence versus speaking presence. The fortress of unspoken truths literalizes buried speech into architecture, letting the final image re-weight the premise without moralizing—no axiom is stated, only the physicalized cost of silence. Subtext operates in gesture: her trembling hand on the limestone pillar of brother-words conveys the ethical calculus more loudly than any declaration. The ending resists tidy uplift; she stands inside her own silence, now forced to learn its language—an ambiguous, earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the inverse of mortality tales: the horror of unbreakable continuance. The final reweighting—ignorance as gift—reverberates without moralizing. No echoing of prompt language; the story’s thesis is enacted, not stated. Image of “beautiful farewell” offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: fairness = negotiated complicity, honesty = luxury good. Subtext operates in gesture—handing back the pot as “offering” instead of exposé. The embalming fluid metaphor reweights at closure, turning rigidity-to-compliance into moral pliability. No tidy moral, only a crystallized ratio: seven lies = freedom. Final image (organ notes as currency) recharges earlier “mathematics” without declaring a thesis, keeping resonance sharp and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: the consolatory fabrication of history as defiance against erasure. Subtext resides in material acts—gold leaf sealing lies—rather than any interpretive statement. The closing mosaic of spectral light on empty streets offers resonant reconfiguration: silence is no longer vacancy but receptive canvas. Complexity remains; no moral is pronounced, yet the reader feels the ethical hush of substituting art for memory.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: stories end only when the need to tell them ends. Subtext lives in the shell’s spiral—an image of endless inward returns. The final reweighting (“the riddle is the reader”) lands as resonant non-literal answer, avoiding moralizing. No thematic echo phrases, no late abstraction—just concrete images doing conceptual work.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through the reframed graffiti—art as living archive versus commodity spectacle. Final phoenix-mural reweights the stone chip from nostalgia to insurgent map, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext would sharpen if corporate POV or collateral damage appeared even briefly.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of transience versus human preservation emerges through the flare that saves and kills; no explicit thesis states this. The violet bloom as final image reweights the entire space-age promise: we can archive but not keep. Avoids sentimentality by letting the wilt happen in half a sentence. Could have pushed further by letting the camera memory itself flicker or corrupt, but still resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: perception > vision; navigation as life-metaphor. Subtext in the apprentice’s steamed breath and silver coins shows trust paid for invisible sight, never preached. Final image of “listening to what was broken” offers resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing, no echo of the prompt’s keyword “feedback,” keeping emergence clean.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as the cartographer’s need to fix origins dissolving into the recognition that sources are relational, not locatable. The phrasebook’s worn page and the falcon’s wordless feather carry the idea without sermon. Final line risks overt thesis (“endings are beginnings reversed”) but is saved by the preceding image of Kael stepping into the weeping ice, letting the reader feel the conceptual flip rather than merely read it.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges as resonance versus erasure: memory kept in stone and step can outlast physical decay. Subtext lives in the hush—what is felt in the teeth rather than spoken. The final image of seven hearts beating at one frequency offers a non-literal answer: shared rhythm is survival. No moral is stated; the concept reweights itself from funeral dirge to quiet chord of possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: knowledge purchased by vanishing. The vial’s journey from superstition to conduit re-prices silence itself as the only currency. Final image—empty crystal cool with “the weight of all it had witnessed”—delivers Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: the core’s data will revolutionize, yet the temple keeps its secret.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges implicitly: inherited shame transmuted into self-inflicted silence, the impossibility of ever outrunning a lie. The copperlit lattice and the sealed chamber reprice “truth” as a living hush rather than speech. No moral is stated; the final image of eternal whispering lighthouse invites ambiguous reflection without forced profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of love as poison/cure emerges imagistically through bead and ghost; refrain is handled, not stated. Final image reweights the refrain with quiet irony—flourishing fruit now tastes of bitterness—achieving modest resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity is present but thin because Elara’s interior never complicates the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of “ruin into reverence” emerges through iterated images—empty nets, silver thread, orchid glow—without sermon. The copper plate’s labyrinth picture re-prices from curiosity to communal map, a Conceptual Repricing that invites reflection on how myth is remade. No final-paragraph thesis line; last image of “orchid dreams” lingers in purposeful ambiguity. Counter-reading allowed: optimism may still be folly—complexity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the orchard’s living archive and the sundial’s shadow: continuity across rupture. No moralizing sentence; the final whispered promise is image, not thesis. Particulars (gnarled roots in ribcages, star-map etched edge) accumulate into a requiem for interrupted journeys that resists tidy equivalence. The ambiguity—faith renewed yet exile unerased—lingers with honest complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges inductively: marginalia as resistance, slowness as survival. No character states a thesis; the wax-sealed envelope and vanishing chalk do the arguing. The final image—“the margins would remember”—reprices memory itself, giving conceptual cost without moralizing. Subtext in Mira’s crackling voice and the client’s microscopic confessions adds tonal layering that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from pattern: listening in silence → stitching invisible maps → weaponizing hush itself. No moral is stated; the final image of flame-led footfalls reweights silence as both shield and trigger. Subtext operates through object—flame as syllabic voice, cloth as covert archive—avoiding thematic lecture. The refusal to moralize keeps ambiguity alive: is she savior or provocateur? Resonance lingers in the reader’s newly suspicious ear.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from tidal return: what is withheld does not stay buried—it grows singing teeth. No explicit thesis; instead, the final image of letters floating as leaves reconfigures apology as ecological offering, not private catharsis. Subtext resides in shard=broken gutter=broken voice; moonlight=silver tongue. Complexity upheld: apology neither redeems nor resurrects, merely transfers burden to wider world.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges as the untranslatable weight between languages of war and languages of home; no explicit thesis stated. Final image re-prices “absence as first language” into mutual, costly retention of phone numbers. Particulars (brain coral, child cast) accrue meaning through handling, not symbolism. Ambiguity lingers: translation succeeds only by admitting what words cannot carry.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the accumulating mirror-garden imagery: restoration is not return but revelation. The final laugh-as-answer reweights the premise, offering a Conceptual Repricing that curiosity is endless; no moral is stated, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particulates: seed as untaxable syntax, ladybug as unpaid sentinel. No explicit thesis; instead the final image of rattling gourds re-weights “thoughts are territories” without moralizing. Subtext in auditor’s eye-tracked ladybug: nature’s irreducible signal vs. state’s crude harvest. Complexity intact—no tidy victory, only proliferating vines.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: sorrow transmuted into living petals, peace as photosynthesis rather than victory. The refrain “photosynthesize pain into beauty” risks proto-profundity, but the final image of blossoms rooted in battle-scarred sand gives it concrete body, satisfying the resonance test. Subtext operates in silences—absence of the lover, unsung words inside shells—avoiding explicit moral. The concept of reef-shadow joy (light shot through remembered grief) crystallizes a nuanced emotional hue that resists tidy takeaway, though fourfold repetition of the exact phrase edges toward thematic echo (−0.2), holding the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: “language as living trust” rather than magical bondage. Subtext in the silence glyph that fuses ‘understood/accepted’ reprises the motif of dual meanings. Final image of empty well + new wells conceptually reweights premise—truth now travels inside them, not ink. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in diverging roads.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of encrypted compassion emerges concretely through chain-to-adhesive decryption rather than assertion; final image of “shared heartbeat” reweights the premise without moralizing, though the phrase itself skirts thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from particulate versus flight: paper trails fixed, pigeons mobile. Dust-mote constellations reconfigure at closure, answering “how to keep an echo” with trust in motion rather than archive. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic, non-literal.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sacredness-of-distance theme emerges organically from the maze-architect lineage and the wood-grain cartography; no character ever articulates a thesis. The final prism garden reprises the “necessary distances” idea in visual form, letting theme resonate without moral tag. Subtext runs through silence: the absent father’s whisper is loudest when unheard, creating dramatic irony—reader sees the trap of eternal measurement before the narrator names it. The refusal to resolve into tidy wisdom keeps the aftereffect charged.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of cyclical remembrance emerges from image, not assertion: foam → footprints → foam. The final tide-pool placement reprises the opening “sea-foam recollectionist,” reweighting “loss” as communal archive. No moralizing sentence mars the exit. The cheerful gloom tone itself becomes the thematic answer, inviting plural readings without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges implicitly: art as engineered accident vs. accidental artifice within the artist. Subtext lives in gesture—dropping the bishop interrupts a marital stalemate more effectively than any spoken counsel. Final image reconfigures premise: wilderness tames the mapper. No moralizing; resonance lingers through the paradox of controlled randomness devouring its controller.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of memory-as-tide emerges through motif of lunar dust and skin-ink, never sermonized. Final image of dancer whose body “gleams with cosmic verse” offers resonant reconfiguration without moral, fulfilling the 9+ quick test for quiet endings.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from concrete particularities—blue-willow shards, charred button, stone circle—rather than thesis statements. The moral calculus (“I was only choosing how to carry the dying”) is earned through thirteen years of sleepless sinew, not late editorializing. Subtext operates in gesture: the open lid’s scattering of ash is the only apology the dead will receive. Resonance lingers because the story refuses to resolve guilt; it reconfigures the terms of carriage.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from shell calculus alone: hope is not imported but resonance-farmed from within. The closing image of empty balloons teaching worlds to generate their own lift reconfigures the premise without moralizing, delivering conceptual repricing that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from particulars: stone as battery of human intention, chalk dust as frantic erasure, ivy as living lament. The final image—“Remember, but act”—reweights the premise without moralizing. No thematic echo; the mantra is spoken by the corridor, not Mira. Ambiguity lingers: restoration is possible yet unfinished, inviting reader reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges as the quiet subversion of passive reflection: the city’s mirrors briefly become generative, not merely mimetic. The lullaby code refracts childhood innocence into insurgent artistry, a subtle CR that reweights innocence as subversion. No moral is stated; the children’s unwitting chorus carries the code onward, a resonant non-literal coda. Ambiguity lingers—was she ghost, dream, or metaphor—without confusion, inviting re-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of “price” and “shared fragility”; the final whispered blessing lets imperfect signatures stand as mosaic of hope—no moral sermon. The flawed beauty idea reweights earlier failed cease-fire: imperfection is the only vessel for peace. Resonance is oblique yet unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges as the price of preservation through destruction: every image of fracture (mud, egg, conscience) reweights the same moral equation. Final museum speaker recycles the note into eternal souvenir, crystallizing the paradox without sermon. Subtext stays in gesture—finger tracing wing-shape—keeping resonance taut; a hair more specificity on displaced villagers would clinch 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of art-as-insurrection emerges without sermon: the courtesan’s forbidden chastity and kinetic poetry embody resistance; the closing gift—“The sanctuary is yours now”—lets citizens complete the arc, dodging tidy moral. Subtextual tension between performance and authenticity threads every image of snowflake versus prism.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the puppet-process: narrative reversals expose what usually gets erased, refusing tidy morals. The meteor hush acts as a resonant, non-verbal answer—silence becomes the new ethical space—without authorial sermon. Subtext lives in gesture (paper king un-dying) and in the woman ordering another drink to keep un-becoming. Complexity is honored; no side is sentimentalized.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through negative-space metaphor: absence = voice, void = resonance; no character sermonizes the moral. The final constellation of braids re-prices “perfection” as a living, flawed archive rather than uncracked bronze. Subtext lives in aurora light—public spectacle repurposed as private darkroom for memory. Insight is earned: forgiveness equals release of perfect replication, not absolution; complexity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as pattern > politics: empiricism itself becomes devotional once it confronts cosmic silence. Subtext lives in gesture—chalk on stone, tile vanishing—never sermon. Final image of banners under starlight reweights earlier numerology as quiet resistance. Avoids thesis statement; resonance is felt in the empty courtyard where knowledge has been diffused, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the pin’s cycle: forgiveness is not erasure but willingness to let memory shift form. Subtext lives in Elara’s translucent palm accepting the broken pin—silence does the arguing. No final-statement moralizing; the last image of dissolving into “potential” reweights prior wounds without sermon. Ambiguity remains: next shift may fail, keeping complexity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of deciduous vows emerges through the ribbon’s metamorphosis: childhood bond → living bandage → wrist talisman. Mother’s pressed-leaf note (“let them fall”) conceptually re-prices the pact without sermon. Subtext in squirrel’s apple-catch mirrors generational hand-off. Final smile is ambiguity—accepting fall and regrowth—earned through concrete graft, not aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges as the impossibility of innocent stewardship: gardening is grieving, knowledge is mourning. Subtext lives in the shell—initially “unspoken potential,” finally a grave-offering—never explained, only enacted. The ending image of “terrible beauty” refuses moral balancing; the story lets the reader feel the sacrilege of continuing to harvest memories. No final-paragraph thesis; resonance is carried by the taste of dead universes.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge is not hoarded text but negotiated silence—what we choose not to say can save or doom. The diary’s blank spaces literalize this; their completion reweights the mountain’s song without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—warden’s “heavy chord” of silence answers her spoken offer. Final image of “golden chords” audible only to listeners supplies resonant non-literal answer, though the phrasing flirts with prettiness.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of identity-as-mosaic emerges through recurrent garden of names, never sermonized. The emerald glow’s final reprise reweights earlier color motifs, offering conceptual repricing rather than moral. Ambiguity is preserved: solace stays unkindled yet bearable. Minor abstraction keeps it from 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: archival negative space as living history. Subtext woven into rope fibers—each twist = unmade decision—avoids thesis statement. Final image (new chime beat) offers resonant non-literal answer: completeness is unattainable, clarity is possible. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers via “sonic ghost now given voice.”

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of cyclical silence emerges from acoustic patterning rather than statement; final smile re-weights earlier scrolls as communal promise, avoiding moralizing. “Hammered repose” motif accumulates contradictory texture, resolved in charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the prism’s fracture → repair arc: “every broken thing contains its own precise geometry of repair.” The final image of reciprocal beacon-answers reweights the word coincidence without moralizing, delivering a resonant non-literal answer to the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: memory is not fixed artifact but dissolving fog we learn to breathe. The refrain of “preemptively nostalgic grief” and the final journal line reprice the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—kneeling on cold crystal, measuring shadows—rather than exposition. The closing question about becoming “sum of every voice” invites counter-readings, sustaining ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges without slogans: the mosaic note becomes a literal instruction that art can weaponize beauty against void, a concept repriced when the violet flame mirrors the violet blooms. Subtext lives in gesture—Cinder’s whispered “We rise” transfers credit from solo arsonist to communal breath, implying solidarity born of spectacle. The ending offers resonant ambiguity: the fortress glows “like a promise,” yet the next ruin awaits, so hope is portable, consumable, never possessed. No therapeutic self-diagnosis or moralizing paragraph intrudes; meaning stays in image and scent.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of transition emerges through concrete littoral cycles rather than statement; the cicada’s molt and rising tide reweight the same stake at closure. Subtext resides in silence and starlight, avoiding moralizing. Final image of “tide retreating” offers a non-literal answer anchored in prior particulars. No thematic echo or platitude intrudes; complexity stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges: silence as cultivable, paradoxically alive substance. Subtext operates in gesture—doll raised to “drink the quiet”—rather than exposition. Final image reweights bunker from tomb to garden without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is silence preservation liberation or new captivity? Complexity is invited, not tidied.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of memory, stewardship, and renewal: murals, orchard fruit, ruby shards all reprice the imperial narrative from collapse to return. No overt moralizing; final image of “a child born under the double moons” invites future without prescribing it. Subtext is carried by objects more than dialogue or gesture. Emotional aftereffect is quiet awe rather than catharsis—appropriate to elegiac mode but stops short of deeper moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: ash is not end-state but substrate for breath. Subtext lives in gesture—ring passed palm-to-palm like a lungful of shared air—never sermonized. The final image of successive shadows queuing reframes solitude as stewardship, avoiding tidy moral. Loaded emptiness is felt, not labeled, yet the refrain edges toward echo; one less articulation would sharpen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of “broken promises reforged under pressure” emerges through bolt, diamonds, and glitch-text without sermon. Final line reweights glow as “seam between shadows and wonder,” offering conceptual repricing. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers on parallel-Kael’s intent. One thematic echo (“pressure is a promise”) is repeated rather than evolved; keeps it shy of 8.5 resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without thesis: remembrance as the only immortality, sounded through literal waves. Subtext lives in silence—his grandmother’s “eloquently silent” language becomes his own. Final star-hum reconfigures the entire motif-set without moralizing. No platitudes; even “bridge of intuition” is left as lived paradox rather than explained.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without moralizing: the price of infinite creation is the erasure of the singular creator. Subtext lives in the puppets’ “ecstatic terror”—a silent warning that possibility devours its maker. Final image of marionettes dancing “shimmering with the light of captured possibility” reweights earlier fruit imagery into cosmic scale, achieving resonance. No thesis stated; meaning is left in the after-echo of the allegiance, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the dust-to-identity motif: unknown histories can still accrue tenderness across decades. Subtext lives in the unmailed moment—Marianne never claims the button is Marcus’s father, only that someone once bothered to save it, letting implication do moral work. The ending resists moralizing; instead, the button’s posthumous delivery reframes “nothing” into “someone,” a conceptual repricing that lingers. Sentimentality is avoided by keeping Marianne’s own loss raw and unhealed.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges through action, not thesis: ash code, golden water, key that refuses to die. Final image—“coordinates for the next survivor”—reweights the premise with conceptual cost: she is now the map. No explicit moralizing; resonance is earned. Ambiguity lingers (will the network survive?) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges obliquely: silence as anti-creation, a vested power that erases destiny. No moral is stated; instead the final “ghost in the mist” reweights the earlier prism colors as lost potential. Subtext resides in negative space—what is not played, not spoken—inviting reflection on the price of erasure without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from the iterative seed–leaf–monument triad: memory must be planted, not archived, for life to regenerate. No explicit thesis; final image of silver-leaf rain lets reader feel the cycle without moral. Subtext in “mossy delight” reframes decay as fertile joy—an earned, non-literal answer. Complexity is present but not contested, so ceiling stays mid-8.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from action: imperfection as life-force. No explicit moralizing; final image of unlocked greenhouse reweights earlier obsession with sealed, perfect mechanisms. Subtext operates through object silence—compass rose never speaks, yet re-orders reality. Ambiguity lingers: will the city’s clocks drift again? That uncertainty is the point. “Befriend uncertainty” is voiced once, early enough to avoid preachy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from concrete particular: kintsugi applied to a boy-shaped absence. Final image reframes earlier “gold-filled cracks” as sunrise painting the foundry’s shadow—absence becomes the golden seam. No moral stated; resonance is visual and conceptual. Subtext in silence: search party’s abandoned lanterns imply communal complicity she now refuses to share.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges implicitly: healing is the art of living with broken resonance. The laughter’s transformation from bell-like to “broken mirrors and stitched apologies” reweights the motif without moralizing. Final image—the gorge as throat preparing to sing—offers resonant non-literal answer to the thematic question. No thesis statements intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges entirely through pattern: numbers recalled under duress become variables, UV light becomes the harsh constant, strap equals witness. No explicit thesis until the final line, and even that is an earned image rather than sermon. Mercy reframed from religious constant to lived differential equation is a fresh conceptual repricing. The refusal of tidy moral is built into the open-ended walk, letting ambiguity linger without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through image pattern—light, glass, hidden figures—without sermon. Final line reweights “eternal instant” from mood to vocation, achieving Conceptual Repricing. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in what new keepership will demand.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: the peril and necessity of fixing flux into form. The recurring frost, perforated pages, and empty whisper-bottle accumulate into a meditation on transience versus inscription. Subtext operates in gesture (trembling hands, smile) and image (holes letting light through paper) rather than exposition. The final “Here” offers a non-literal answer—presence is the only eternity we can print—rewriting prior motifs without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges as the cost of remembering: every image (shard, cloth, covered mirror) reprises the question of whether preservation equals concealment. No moralizing line spells this out; the final poem-on-cloth image reweights prior sepia nostalgia into an unspoken ethical bill. Ambiguity lingers—Voss’s nod is neither conversion nor capitulation—yet feels complete.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: honesty as anti-corrosion, memory as music, dawn as communal trust. No character articulates a moral; the final image of the woman as “the dawn’s first ray given human form” conceptually re-prices every prior gear. Subtext resides in gesture—spider silk and moonlight filament—implying that fragility and reflection are materials strong enough to bind worlds. Resonance arises from particulars: the specific note that guides lost children, the specific flake of rust that is a scar.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from olfactory archive vs. existential threshold; no overt thesis statements. Final image of spinning compass in scent-circle offers Conceptual Repricing: knowledge itself becomes a boundary, not a key. Subtext resides in silence—factory’s “broken windows now merely windows” implies acceptance of unanswerable. Ambiguity is purposeful: keeper-role is both gift and life-sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges as custodial continuity versus solitary artistry; no explicit thesis stated. The spiral/line motif reweights from mere ornament to covenant marker in the final image. Subtext of “listening to material you did not shape” reverberates in turbine-hum and ancestral slide. Resonant reconfiguration lands when her carved token fits the void—meaning made without words.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from iterated layers—postcards, glass, mural—without explicit moral: darkness as generative invitation rather than absence. Subtext resides in silence (cathedral hush, pavilion twilight) and scent (painted perfume), never stated. Final image reweights premise non-literally, fulfilling 9+ test. One near-miss: “darkness is not an absence, but a quiet invitation” borders thematic echo, but is embedded in perceptual burst, limiting penalty to −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from specific binaries: archive vs. erasure, driftwood testimony vs. tide, grandfather as betrayer/whistleblower. Final image of dunes “silent and shifting” offers conceptual repricing—landscape itself becomes complicit archive. No moralizing line; resonance carried by object return. Ambiguity preserved: villains/victims share uniform. Emotional aftereffect concrete: “whispers no longer demanding she bear them alone.”

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme—collective memory as creative seed—emerges from sand sketches and map-lanterns, never sermonized. The sealed bottle’s conceptual repricing (whole past → new creation) lands in the final shimmer. Subtext in “lanterns never went out” rumor shows how myth operates. Emotional aftereffect is wonder laced with melancholy, earned not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges: archives are living organisms, silence itself records emotion. Subtext runs through gesture—needle lowered, wax trembling “as if alive”—rather than statement. No moralizing final paragraph; the leaf-vein pattern is an imagic answer. Ambiguity is purposeful: will future scribes awaken or suffocate on this heartbeat? The concept reconfigures the premise: archival duty becomes custodianship of a city’s unconscious, a cost felt in the “velvet disquiet” Elias now carries. No abstraction overload; wisdom is concrete via pool ripples and silver lock.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through iterated images of reversible time and stored memory; no character ever names "the theme." The final sprout reweights the earlier etched spirals, implying that inheritance is not ownership but caretaking. Wild serenity stays implicit in the hatchling’s paradoxical cry and the thaw that is both gentle and unstoppable. The piece avoids moralizing; the closest it comes to thesis is Elara’s whispered thanks, a gesture rather than a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—“listening as the only true warning”—emerges through the withheld mechanical noise and the instruments’ quiet song; no final moralizing. The rope’s silence and the valley’s untroubled sleep reconfigure meaning without statement. Subtext in the un-pulled bell and the un-flipped switch carries the emotional aftereffect. Resonance is earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of silence = fertile ground; no moralizing states it. Glass-into-moss image reweights “stillness” from emptiness to life-support—an earned conceptual flip. Vulnerability-as-strength is threaded through star-empathy, but the insight is softly articulated rather than dramatized in a single costly beat. Still, resonance lingers via haunting final glow.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: the silence of bees equals the silence of the dead; no character articulates a thesis. The final image—colored light dissolving the ghost’s face—offers a non-literal answer: remembrance is the only afterlife. Ambiguity is purposeful; the covenant is “remembered, not undone,” resisting moralizing. Subtext in the mute eloquence motif deepens with each beat, culminating in conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of “texture” and “weight,” ending with a non-literal answer: time is a road in the palm, not a balance sheet. No explicit moral; ambiguity persists about whether the co-prism readers are immortal or just story-sorting archivists. Subtext of love encoded in numeric shrapnel is conveyed via gesture, not thesis. The final image reframes prior capsule burials as prism facets, reweighting the premise without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of “beauty in the incomplete” emerges through recurring feather, broken kite, and torn sky—never sermonized. Final image of the kite as “a free, unfinished thing” reweights prior fragments with quiet triumph. Ambiguity is present but thin; the concept doesn’t deepen or complicate across beats. Subtext is largely the text itself, spoken in lush cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of translation versus ownership emerges through concrete ritual: copper conducts memory, orchard metabolizes death. No explicit thesis; final diary line “Respect is not built in a lifetime, but in translation” is earned because every prior beat has enacted that translation. Ambiguity remains—readers can debate whether dissolution is continuity or erasure—yet emotional aftereffect is unmistakable. Subtext lives in gesture: polite insect detours, gecko supervisor, parrots nesting only on completed branches.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through inversion: artificial pilgrimage → natural truth. The amber micro-cosmos reweights from curio to kin-signal without authorial nudge. Final smile at irony lands as earned reconfiguration, not moralizing. Subtext in “bronze resolve” quietly fuses metal imagery with personal mettle—subtle, not assertive.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through pattern, not statement: dead languages + living shoots = memory and renewal co-exist. The submerged concord reframes loss not as erasure but shared breath, paid off when “living and dead share the same breath” in the final paragraph. No moralizing—final image of nightly seed-vow lets resonance linger. Ambiguity remains: garden does not erase scar, only renegotiates it.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of preserved voice vs. living silence; no authorial thesis stated. Final image of dog enfolded by disembodied love reweights earlier salvage into recovery. Ambiguity remains: is he soothed or trapped? One near-echo of prompt language (“translate distance into closeness”) is internalized through Wick’s memory, not sermon, so barely dodges Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of self-directed navigation emerges organically: “true north was not a place but a decision.” No explicit moralizing; the reweighted compass image in the last line lets silence speak. Motif of anniversary sketching returns only to be transformed into a live star-chart of hope, avoiding token symbolism. The reader is left to feel that mapping one’s own void is endless labor—an unsettling, honest resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of wonder-as-duty emerges inductively through the master’s ethos and the chess secrets, avoiding explicit sermon. The pocket-sundial callback in closure reweights “time can be mended,” offering quiet CR. Yet final paragraph moralizes (“the unknown was not a threat, but an invitation”), slightly over-articulating what the image already delivers. Subtext survives, but resonance is blunted by safe—rather than risky—wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the recurring pawn image: the smallest pieces re-weighted from absence to agency. No explicit thesis; the final vow “never forget the pawns lost” is spoken through action (reverse walk) rather than sermon. Subtext in silence: the prisoner’s blink carries the history small gestures defied. The gallery’s echo turns memory into acoustic resistance—earned wisdom without platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of home from place to relational pattern; no character lectures us on this. The shifting bookstore literalizes the idea without allegorical stiffness. Subtext in the raven-feather gift (a past kindness now weaponized as tool) adds moral ambiguity. Final image reweights earlier motifs—mirror, thunder, labyrinth—into quiet heartbeat, avoiding tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges without moralizing: forgiveness as continuous winnowing, not absolution. The tapestry’s shifting meaning (labyrinth → lesson plan → heart) reweights earlier material in the final glow. Subtext resides in the girl’s pawn, the unspoken shared silence, and the dissolution of the labyrinth into dawn light. One near-miss: the phrase “fierce repose” is used twice and drifts toward explicit thesis, but the second instance is embedded in image, not sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the concrete: refracted light ≠ abstract trope but literal shards of pigment smashing moon-glow across bone. The final image reweights forgiveness from “paid in blood” to “paid in refused sight,” a resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing sentence closes the piece; the spire’s stained surface speaks instead. Complexity stays intact—community now argues, children experiment—refusing tidy uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the fusion of fracture and gold: “brokenness was the beginning of beauty” is never sermonized but enacted by the statue’s warm scars. Subtext resides in tactile gestures—scarab click, gold flow—rather than exposition. Final image accepts sea grief as part of the mosaic, refusing tidy redemption. Ambiguity lingers: did she save the world or merely beautify its ruin?

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from the concrete particulars of shell, mirror, and pool: art as both prison and release. Subtext lives in gesture—painting with cave water baptizes memory without sermonizing. The final image of the shell on the ledge quietly reweights the premise: keeping a secret is the true completion. No thematic echo line in the final paragraph; resonance stays implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: communication as vibration, not volume. Jasmine-scent memory and lighthouse glass reweight each other so the final whispered “tomorrow” feels like a conceptual repricing of every prior shout. No moralizing; resonance is bottled in the cork’s empty circle and the cracked bell sky. The piece invites reflection on what carries intention when words fail—an ambiguity that lingers cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of re-navigation emerges from solder, starlight, and bronze pulse—never stated. Sister’s voice returned as star reframes loss from barren map to traversible field. Final image reweights prior motifs (map, foot, phone) without moralizing. Raw solace feels earned because the price (irreversible bridge, station strain) is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—truth as communal medicine that must be dosed—emerges through the orchard’s ripening fruit and the cracked eye’s final image, never stated. Subtext lives in gesture: wrapping/unwrapping linen becomes a ritual of consent to speak. The refusal of a tidy moral (truth is good/bad) is embodied in the lingering vigilance of the closing watch. One slight echo: “psychological safety” flirts with jargon, but the phrase is owned by the narrator’s scientific idiom and quickly grounded in sap-soaked cloth.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges obliquely: isolation converted to stewardship, memory as shared light. Subtext sits in gesture ambiguity—farewell/warning/plea unresolved yet redeemed by witness. Epiphany is earned through tactile investigation rather than abstract assertion. Final line avoids moralizing; resonance arises from lighthouse beam now carrying stranger’s pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—memory as map, choice as un-mapped terrain—emerges via the ant trail mirroring the chip engraving, not exposition. The final image of the sinking brass Q silently re-prices the alphabet of his life: every letter he never printed. Subtext stays in gesture (his trembling fingers, the door’s negative space). No moral delivered; resonance is imagistic and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: power = sacrifice, dynasty = cyclicide. The image of star-ember “fireflies” migrates from beauty to surveillance, reweighting wonder into burden. Final line “waiting for the next disenchanted queen” crystallizes the moral—monarchy is a dream that devours its dreamers—without stating it. The slight reserve is for a touch of abstract diction (“conceptual repricing”) that edges toward the metaphysical rather than the sensuous.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges as the revaluation of memory into lived presence; the nautilus curl’s transformation from relic to lens carries the argument without sermon. Final whisper (“Presence is the only treasure worth returning for”) straddles the line between epiphany and thesis-statement, but the preceding image of dust-trail across twilight lets it echo rather than lecture. Subtext in gesture—Kael’s hand over hers—implies solidarity more efficiently than dialogue. The piece avoids tidy moral binaries, leaving cost felt but unspoken.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars: the scroll’s glowing sentence reconfigures identity as plural narrative, not moral. “Jaded wonder” tone avoids sentimentality while delivering felt aftereffect. No final-paragraph thesis; resonance is image-based and invites counter-readings.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>First-person voice carries a distinct, synesthetic perceptual signature—“dates were gibberish, yesterday bleeding into centuries.” Rhythm accelerates into breathless cadence during flight without losing clarity. POV remains strictly interior; no head-hop. Diction stays within lexicon of dream-logic narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the screw’s migration: life-passage tools can be re-purposed for grief-passage; no explicit moralizing, only the resonant final image of the screw worn next to skin, reweighting “ordinary miracles” as perceptual translation rather than restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges solely through image pattern: ink that hardens under grief → becomes literal beacon of resolved pain, enacting “scars into stories” without once moralising. Saturated hush recurs as collective breath, reweighted at closure when world “exhales” acceptance. Final smile and drifting rock offer Charged Poise—reader left holding expanded silence. No platitudes, no final thesis sentence; emotional aftereffect is concrete shimmering in pocket.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges as the fragile resonance of flawed connections: “a broken chord still vibrates” becomes the non-literal answer, reweighting the earlier column’s damage. No character states a moral; the final image of perfume ghosting over stumps invites the reader to feel apology as vibration, not absolution. Subtext lives in Linden’s mirror line and the fermata metaphor, both carrying more meaning than their words. The ambiguity—will the column restart?—is purposeful, not evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: witness collapses into origin, ending into beginning. Surrender as creation is never sermonized; the final “first word” image reconfigures prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—dictionary pressed to chest—rather than exposition. The ambiguity between annihilation and genesis is purposeful, inviting reflection rather than confusion, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: time as the razor space between heartbeats, not a river. The motif of “razor edges” recurs in key, light, and horizon but is grounded in physical objects rather than abstract insistence. Final image—Elias breathing the crisp air while counting backward—offers quiet repricing without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: pocketing the warmed key equals accepting the cost of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: permeability as grief’s only viable architecture. No character articulates the thesis outright; the final line “even absence could bear fruit” is imagistic, not declarative. Subtext lives in gesture—the woman’s fingertip touch, Kael’s silent button—so reflection is embedded in tactile beats. The concept re-prices “intrusion” from crime to care, a conceptual shift that reweights every prior security datum without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: chance vs. certainty is lived, not lectured. The lantern’s glow reframes the father’s compulsive scribbles into a curriculum, a non-literal answer that avoids moralizing. Subtext in subway graffiti (“Chance is a circle with no edge”) is left to resonate; no closing thesis spells out the paradox, preserving ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges without moralizing: endings are portable sunrise seeds if someone answers. Subtext lives in the disc’s final “cascade of glass notes”—a lullaby that reframes the haunting as birth rather than curse. The woman’s laughter through tears and Mira’s bleeding palms give concrete emotional aftereffect. No tidy thesis statement; the last line lets the echo find its own silence, inviting reader reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges via pattern: “small moment” objects (locket, jasmine sprig, ink stroke) accrete until the collective weight redefines covenant as communal, not private. No thesis statement; final journal line offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in gestures—tucking photo into fresh journal—implies archival love as living ritual. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “anchor or drift.”

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges entirely through particulates: rock as currency, stories as oxygen, ivy as living audience. No character articulates “loneliness is cured by reciprocity”; the final lullaby hummed by Elara is the silent thesis. The moon fragment’s re-pricing—from private charm to public hearth—offers conceptual cost that reweights every prior tale. Ambiguity lingers: Mira may be rumor, yet the glow is real, inviting counter-readings without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: maps drawn on skin > paper; the final star-flare is the non-literal answer to “where is grief?” No moralizing, only reconfiguration. Subtext of maternal cartography surfaces once—“her mother had also been a mapmaker”—then accrues through the ring’s warmth. Emotional aftereffect lingers as quiet blaze rather than assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: history is not a ledger to erase but a manuscript of crossed-out lines whose remnants matter. Subtext operates through the anomaly’s visible threads and the pen’s diminishing ink, never moralized. Final image of “confidently uncertain” smile reweights the premise, reframing fallibility as creative force. No platitudes; insight arises from the specific tactile experience of editing air. Emotional aftereffect lingers as reader confronts irreversibility of lived error.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory vs. presence, art as consolation for oblivion. Motif of invisible music is earned—camera shutter evolves from futile click to metronome, reweighting “empty” to “full of unheard sound.” Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: joyful sorrow is lived, not labeled. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the reader’s own silence after the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—memory as palimpsest that can be burned or painted back—emerges through the pigment origin stories rather than exposition. The vandalized self-portrait motif reweights at closure: the weeping restored version makes the earlier propaganda slash a literal incision into Kael’s identity, now acknowledged rather than erased. Subtext in silence: scholars “brave enough” to come don’t speak of forgiveness, only witness, letting the tapestry’s tears answer the moral question. No thematic echo sentences; the final image performs the insight, achieving non-literal resonance.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade>
    <comment>Third-person limited stays strictly inside Kael’s perceptual filter—volcanic metaphors, warp/weft mathematics, sulfur breath—creating a distinct geologic-textile idiom. Psychic distance compresses under stress: “steam hissed… carrying the ghost of a million voices” collapses time and memory into one sensory gulp. No head-hopping; even mentor Cress is seen only as Kael’s memory-trigger. The occasional latinate clause (“analytically intuitive mind”) nudges register upward but remains consistent with Kael’s self-coding temperament, so voice holds.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: transhuman love refuses archival storage and chooses ephemeral wave-form. The lagoon’s extinct-star reflection reweights the dream—immortality through impermanence—creating conceptual afterglow. No moral is declared; resonance is carried by the final doubled heartbeat. Sorrow stays auroral, not sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through acoustic metaphor: precision beats volume. Subtext is the dock’s rumor ecology—ghost walks, weight of steps—rather than explicit moral. Final image ("silence builds better bridges") is Conceptual Repricing that reweights every prior shout-heavy cliché. avoids sermonizing; one soft spot: "he’d proven that whispers travel farther than shouts" is a touch thematic-echo, −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of "second thoughts" is mostly emergent from the chess puzzles and final "Question the king" line; the closing whisper about the pawn-dream of queening crystallises the quiet uprising, avoiding overt moralising but verging on thematic echo; resonance solid but tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the dancer’s kinetic images rather than assertion: softness as strength, rhythm as resistance. The disappearing island reconfigures the post-war premise—peace does not equal stasis; bodies still yearn for motion. Final image of dancer on crest reweights earlier crate-lifting as mere rehearsal for this stage. No moralizing; gratitude whispered to whale is character-bound, not authorial thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—art as clandestine affect inside forced affectlessness—emerges from the performer’s dual rituals; the final image of a wooden figurine offered to turbine-cut sky reweights the “remade hush” from oppression to medium, avoiding moralizing. Complexity survives because complicity remains unpunished yet un-erased.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of permeable boundaries emerges from concrete acts—touching quartz, whispering verse—never from exposition. Final image of silhouette dissolving into cobalt shadow offers non-literal answer: identity becomes environment. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the lake’s sigh. Resonance is strong, yet slightly abstract absence of a concrete forfeiture keeps it shy of 8.5.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Voice is lyric-cinematic: compressed metaphors (“spine of frozen music”), rhythmic anaphora (“she… she…”), perceptual slippage taught early and held. No dialogue, so evaluation is on narrative texture; diction stays within poet’s aesthetic lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy maintained. Under peak pressure (lake-center), syntax tightens to short clauses without breaking pattern. Distinct perceptual signature earns 9- eligibility; minor over-repetition of “hum” and “dissolve” nudges down.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from spiral pattern: ash → plant → canvas → glass, each a frozen breath of imperfection. No character articulates the thesis; the final image of twisted vase beside grey canvas is the silent argument. Subtext lives in plant movement: vines “listen,” implying art can be collaborative rather than authored. Resists moralizing; leaves reader with charged ambiguity about whether imperfection is enough.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: imperfection as the conduit of communion. The final image of “golden shadows pulsing like a remembered heartbeat” reweights prior material—what was called corruption is now the sacred residue. Subtext operates in gesture: Mara’s trembling fingertip on the breathing lens confesses conversion the dialogue never utters. No final-paragraph moralizing; the bell’s last overtone is the non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of “genuinely artificial” becoming real via witness and need. No moralizing; final image of dissolving crane reweights prior hollow jewelry as seed for future grief-work. Subtext lives in gesture: folding as proxy for consoling, dissolution as acceptance of impermanence. Ambiguity lingers—does the star truly bloom or only pulse in shared hallucination—yet this complexity enriches.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges without abstraction: collective panic mapped as physical texture—ink pools, pencil lines, tape numbers—making culture a measurable wound. Subtext in gesture: architect tracing the path “through the onyx symbols” shows conversion, not told. Final image reverses Genesis: towers dust → roots network, repricing decentralization as organic interdependence. No moralizing; resonance lives in the grid the reader must re-see.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of nostalgia as double-edged knowledge emerges through imagistic repetition (gardens → dust, lovers → mist) rather than assertion. Final image—“every step forward also traced a path back into the shadows”—offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, though “end of innocence” phrase skirts platitude. Subtext operates in silence: the withdrawal hand is un-annotated, letting reader feel the cost of choosing memory-burden over oblivion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through image pattern: shadow shifts from threat to guardian, implying every preservation demands forfeiture. No moralizing line explains this; the final veil-image reweights earlier footage comparisons. Ambiguity is purposeful—readers must decide whether the trade was worth it—anchored in concrete particulars (emptied pocket, glowing shelves).

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges from the concrete particular of a chameleon’s regenerating tail: healing is not erasure but scarred adaptation. No moral is preached; the insight is literalized in Veridian’s color shift to “truth remembered” blue. Subtext operates in silence—Veridian’s stillness under the brush says more about forgiveness than any confession. The notebook addendum risks a thematic echo, but its placement before the officer’s arrival keeps it private armor rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: literacy of pain, translation of body into narrative. Subtext operates through tactile images—frosted glass, coffee spirals, moss breath—rather than exposition. Final image reweights “closure” from ending to ongoing reading; avoids moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the miracle inside her or in the tower? Invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: unexpressed love doesn’t vanish, it archives itself into architecture until a compatible reader appears. Subtext operates through spatial metaphor—love nests in 90° corners and armrest no-man’s-land—never articulated as thesis. Final image reweights premise: the map under her skin is the theatre’s quiet answer to demolition, a conceptual repricing that makes the building’s soul portable. No sermonizing; goodbye letters stay implicit, resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—creativity as cosmic memory—emerges through stardust motif and final aurora fade, never sermonized. Subtext of necessary darkness (“cocoon”) complicates the release, giving ambiguity. Final image of rivering stardust reweights earlier blank-page despair without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges: memory as ecological act—seeds need dreamers, dreamers need unlit soil. Subtext in “fractured lullaby” and backward-moving clock reframes apocalypse as nursery. Final image of downward-growing star-forest reweights all prior ash without moralizing. Complexity lingers: guard’s erasure is both victory and loss, inviting counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from refrain of “question” vs “answer,” mechanistic vs wild, resolved in non-literal fusion: she is both map and territory. No sermon—final line is imagistic, not thesis. Recurring gear/tree syntax reweights at closure, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers: is insight transcendence or solipsism? That counter-reading is invited, not flattened.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely—courage as pre-owned, not acquired—avoiding overt thesis. The shoreline lullaby motif reweights at reunion, but the ferry guides’ final aphorism edges toward echo; still, the image of the half-buried ticket sand-buries the moral rather than stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    “Unpardonable silence” is never sloganized; it emerges through catastrophe image (crushed boy, splintered piano) and final signed confession. The bolt motif recharges from shame token to repair instrument without thematic speech. Frostbitten hope lands as earned paradox: hope frozen yet alive at root, mirroring her regenerated nerves. No final-paragraph moralizing—theme stays implicit in the gesture toward tools.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of truth-through-time emerges from ink seeping like “secrets into memory” and library exhaling “dust in a graceful collapse”; no abstract thesis stated. Subtext in riddle line “drift that pulls the mask from the moon” reweights moon imagery at closure when glamour dissolves. Ambiguity lingers: throne still empty, worthy heir unnamed—complexity embraced. Only minus: final smile could flirt with profundity if read as authorial nudge.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the equation of obsolete maps and bleached coral—both casualties of shifted baselines—without sermon. The periodically eternal refrain accrues ironic weight: cycles persist yet worsen, refusing redemption. Final image of “rhythm of a world reborn” offers quiet CR that reweights prior motifs rather than moralizing. Subtext stays in gesture: tapping as memorial refusal, waterproof case as ark of orphaned knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from frequency-as-resistance: ancient hum + child’s lullaby = nonviolent rupture of occupation silence. No thematic echo; no character states “this is how we fight.” Final image reweights opera glasses from star-vision to ground-vision, re-pricing meaning from sky to bedrock. Ambiguity lingers—will song spark revolt or mere pause—yet emotional after-effect is concrete: reader left listening for after-hum.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: destiny as living seed, not relic. The amber’s dissolution reweights three generations of dogma without a sermon. Final image of sowing fire-resistant saplings offers a non-literal answer—tradition replanted, not rejected—leaving resonant ambiguity about what else might grow.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of light = knowledge: the only honest light is the cold ache living in darkness. Motif of “painting what is concealed” reweights from portrait to fate-weaving without meta-commentary. Final image—shadow and light as collaborators—reprises the eye motif and offers conceptual repricing: art must embrace the unshown. No moralizing sentence; the resonance is imagistic and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the recurring vanishings—mentor in sandstorm, drone in ink, ink in stone—each reweighting the same question: is time’s stretch a mercy or a trap? No character articulates a thesis; the final image of Kael’s eyes reflecting “endless dunes” offers a non-literal answer: pursuit itself is the only permanence. The ambiguity is purposeful and tied to prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from pattern: objects meant for violence (sandbag, disc) re-purposed for cultivation. No moral is stated; the final image of counterweighted relics re-prices “quiet” as a cultivated artifact. Roses absorb the lesson, letting motif echo without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of witness-without-possession emerges organically from Avery’s final silence and release; no moralizing statement intrudes. The sleepwalking constellations and feral lullaby reweight the premise without abstract exposition. Resonant ambiguity lingers—“some things are caught only to be released”—earned through prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the imagery chain: telescope (witness) versus black hole (suppression) reweighted so the paper must become the telescope. No character states the thesis; instead the final line “better to be the telescope than the black hole” offers Conceptual Repricing. Moral ambiguity lingers—her act may still sink the paper—yet the piece refuses to sermonise. The emotional aftereffect is awe at the cost of seeing clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of restorative erasure emerges from the acoustic inversion—first captured sound becomes last corrected silence—without any thesis statement. The insect’s prehistoric need and the infants’ live wails braid into one moral ledger: creation mourning its own damage. Final handwritten note tucked into “the world’s oldest furniture” offers a charged, non-literal answer: archives can be rewritten, but silence now carries the weight. Subtext in gesture (needle tremor, ink burn) does the moral math.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—memory as map rather than void—emerges through the chalked spiral and the fossilized stories on the grotto wall, never stated. The violet question-mark slash reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: the villagers may still choose denial. Subtext in the tile’s whispered instruction and the monk’s ghost-traced sand invites multiple readings.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the paradox of “aberrant mercy”: the only mercy worth remembering is the enemy’s, complicating the binary of victim/perpetrator. The renaming refuses tidy redemption; instead it carves grief and grace into the same stone. Subtext operates in silence—no sermon, only the tessera’s faint glow. Final image reweights earlier material without moralizing, but the insight is slightly front-loaded in Arin’s whispers, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of artistic immortality emerges organically from the ghost’s sacrifice; no explicit thesis stated. The tarot coin’s shifting symbols reweight from memento to conduit, re-pricing memory as transferable art. Final image—“she would carry his echo in every standing ovation”—offers non-literal answer: legacy is the only afterlife. Ambiguity lingers: is the actress brilliant now, or forever haunted? Complexity embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges obliquely: skepticism versus the seduction of pattern, framed by fractal imagery that reweights from hazard to healing. No character moralizes the theme; the final canvas tree is an unspoken answer. The recalled pill and geode function as conceptual mirrors—both fractally precise—allowing a quiet repricing of risk. Ambiguity lingers: the cure is possible yet untested, leaving the reader in charged poise rather than message.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from the iterative reweighting of "transitional object": fossil as bridge between botanical past and emotional present, map as bridge between data and myth. No moral is stated; instead, the final coastal image lets the reader feel the conceptual price—when humans wake, they will inherit a world whose stories now live inside one woman’s irreversible song. Ambiguity is purposeful: will her voice heal or haunt?

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: redemption is not absolution but service—network rebuilt, northern corridor offered. Subtext is carried in the pillbox (not suicide but key) and in silence about Elena until final beat. Avoids moral statement; lets thawing earth reconfigure meaning. Slight deduction for “his choice five years ago—it didn’t break her” which edges toward thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the gutter-to-needle axis: time layers experience, yet fidelity can distill layers to an essence rather than erasing them. The story avoids overt thesis statements; the only overt metaphor—palimpsest—is dramatized in the final alignment, not lectured. Resonance is charged by the silence that replaces the metronome, inviting reflection on what persists after inscription stops. The refusal to moralize or sentimentalize keeps the thematic aftereffect honest and complex.</answer>

    <comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Silas’s perceptual signature—ambient vibration, fog geometry, needle texture—without head-hopping. Diction is compressed and occupational: “groan of the carriage wheels,” “architecture of the girl,” lending a rhythmic carriage without purple drift. Syntax lengthens only in the final paragraph, mirroring the lifting fog, a deliberate cadence shift that pays off pattern taught earlier. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy remains intact even during lyric flights.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the recursive image chain: glass → memory → clay → vessel → gift, all enacting “love as architecture” without once moralizing. The final line’s “wasteland listened, patient as clay” re-prices the premise, implying the same kiln-time could act on the larger world—conceptual cost made legible. Only a whisper of echo-drift: “sharp gentleness” is openly labeled twice; the second iteration nudges toward thesis-statement territory.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through the gauge’s repurposing: measurement as both memory and invitation. Moonflowers blooming “while the city slept” reweight night from threat to cathedral, a non-literal answer to “how does one reflect light into dark corners.” No moral is stated; the final image of seeded asphalt under moonlight invites multiple readings—restoration, trespass, or ephemeral graffiti. Subtext resides in silence: the city’s “held breath” and the horn-harbor harmony echo her private exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the iterative equation isolation = archive; the closing sunrise-that-never-was re-prices time as braided web, not line.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges without statement: the price of maintaining hope in a universe that weaponizes it. Subtext lives in silence—arguments falter mid-sentence, faces slacken—rather than exposition. The final image of charts as “protective sigils” reweights earlier research into armor, a conceptual repricing that lingers. No moral is asserted; the reader is left holding the undecided question of what else hides in static.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—“spaces can be reimagined”—emerges from the blueprint library reveal, never stated. Subtext lives in the copper patina shared by compass and key, quietly linking past tools to future redesign. Final image of her tracing a new line on blank vellum reweights earlier geometry obsession without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: will the city embrace her vision? The wistful rebellion tone stays intact, resisting tidy thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges: subtraction can become addition when blindness is accepted rather than compensated. Subtext lives in the ribbon’s return—an unspoken vow to carry pain forward. No moralizing; the quarry’s final silence reconfigures meaning without statement. Thematic echo is avoided; “different kind of sight” is image, not thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of resurrection-through-art emerges via concrete chain: ghost → map → buried photo → new melody; no explicit moral. Subtext carried in gesture—bow scraped “each silence an answer.” Final image of wrap dancing to fiddle reweights earlier random flutter into collaborative chorus, offering Conceptual Repricing. Avoids tidy binary; ambiguity lingers—song may or may not free ghost—yet emotional aftereffect palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of record-as-prayer to record-as-healing; the daylily’s one-day bloom becomes the emblem of transitory pain made permanent through shared witness. No moralizing—final line is image, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers: next chronicler may yet fail, but the contract is now visibly communal.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—mirrors reveal shells, scars hide beneath—emerges through image chain: lake surface → ice mirror → memory surface. No explicit moral; final “some truths remain hidden” keeps ambiguity. Subtext operates in gesture: planting a seed that eats curses = feeding on self-made evil. Recurrent orchard/fruit rot deepens rather than décor. Only tic: “warlike serenity” leans toward slogan if read in isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: covenant as living reciprocity vs. ancestral enclosure. The shifting maze image reweights from childhood trap to future threshold without authorial statement. Final image offers resonant non-moral: garden must grow wild, not walled. Avoids sermon; complexity remains in the ancestral collage of regret.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of repurposing echoes emerges organically from the cloth’s journey, but the final paragraph’s “every ending is a prelude” drifts toward explicit thesis-statement; the reader still feels an authentic aftereffect through the valley-as-canvas image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of translation-as-continuance emerges through pattern: cuneiform signs, carved wedges, seed petals inscribed with “final signs” all refract the same insight—meaning persists beyond speaker. No thematic statement is pronounced; resonance lands in the image of root seeking “analogical space.” Counter-readings (ambition vs humility) are plausible yet not forced.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme—suppressed longing as structural grout—emerges through the pearl’s shift from serene object to transmitter; no explicit thesis is stated. Subtext is encoded in gesture: nesting shells inside a footlocker = emotional smuggling; placing pearl atop pillar = public unsealing. The ending’s non-literal answer: the caves “sing” the unsaid, re-pricing silence as communal risk. Emotional aftereffect is concrete—readers imagine their own vents whispering ancestral regrets—avoiding sentimentality by staying in sensory image.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of healing-as-river emerges organically via recurring water/flow imagery; final line reweights “truth” as current, avoiding moral tag. Subtext rests in gesture—leaving the bellows speaks louder than any apology. Ambiguity lingers: is silence music or surrender? Insight is earned through sensory particulars, not sermonizing, though the graffiti tag edges toward prompt-echo.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as anti-knowledge, the echo one leaves rather than the words one hoards. No explicit moral; final line reframes earlier motifs without sermon. Subtext operates in gesture—touching unopened spines, releasing unread words. Ambiguity is purposeful: library, watch, letters resist single symbolic reading. Insight is earned through concrete particulars rather than aphorism. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer to "what is sought?"—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire quest. Minor shortfall: thematic nuance slightly outruns emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of stewardship vs exploitation emerges through the violin-seed, not exposition. The mulberry ache, crown-shaped stain, and unbroken circle reconfigure meaning without moralizing. Subtext in jasmine’s whispered commands and the envoy’s “chrome-tinted glasses” efficiently encodes corporate chill. Final image crystallizes the question—archive vs empire—leaving lingering ambiguity about future survival, satisfying complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from pattern versus oblivion: the cosmos forgets its static, Elara steals its last metaphor. No character states the thesis; the final image of immortal winter jasmine quietly answers the implicit question of what deserves rescue from silence. Subtext operates through silence itself—Morse static, withheld touch, whispered dedication. Complexity is honored: no moral is extracted, only a crystallized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: caretaking as secular grace, rebirth as daily choice, not metaphysical reward. Scallop motif shifts from Aria’s clumsy carving to curved pruning to sigil of release, charging the final jam with mortal sweetness. Subtext in silence: no dialogue, only gesture and wind, letting reader taste the “empty bowl” of soul. The ending’s brown-bread sunrise reconfigures the premise: peace is perishable, and that is the point.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the shifting shard image: emptiness refracts into spectrum, asserting that truth is plural. No explicit moral is stated; the keeper’s line is a riddle, not a thesis. Subtext lives in gesture—cloak loosening, chime silence—rather than exposition. The final smile and open promise invite plural readings without confusion. The only abstraction risk is “protected vulnerability,” but it is grounded in the cloak’s physical loosening, averting pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from the inverse law of visibility: only by vanishing can one be truly seen. Subtext lives in the withheld name that surfaces as ripples—identity itself is the last secret surrendered. The ending refuses moralizing; instead the starlit water offers a non-literal, charged image that reweights all prior withholdings. Ambiguity is productive: reader must decide whether Mira’s dissolution is obliteration or apotheosis.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: true journey is temporal attendance, not spatial displacement. The birds’ spiral and the dust dance reconfigure the value of stillness without sermon, achieving quiet resonance. No final-paragraph thesis is imposed, letting image carry the reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through the keystone’s shift from quarry-item to sacred relic of inefficiency; no sentence states “theme is...” Final image reweights “lingering luminance” as the living resistance to automation. Subtext in the body-language of mist-walking: surrender as agency. Avoids thematic echo; no moralizing paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from pattern: light as promise versus silence as truth. Recurring “luminous vows” shifts from external lantern promise to internal covenant with silence. No moralizing; final smile is image, not lesson. Ambiguity remains—vow is unbreakable yet hidden—inviting reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from iterative distillation of loss into resonance; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of her as “the new signal” reweights all prior static-listening without moralizing. Ambiguity persists—choice may be illusion—yet feels earned. Prophecy line “Having been, she will be” offers Conceptual Repricing that reframes the entire arc.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the atlas ledger: naming grants dignity but also immortalizes distance between reaper and reaped. The void-beast turned mirror offers resonant, non-literal answer—her fear is the unnamed distance itself—without moralizing. Subtext in the wax fragments (“the thing beneath—”) implies civilization’s unspoken substrate. The emotional aftereffect lingers as readers confront their own unmapped beasts.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges: faith too weak to summon gods yet strong enough to count drops can still tilt the cosmos. Subtext lives in the bell’s silence→hum→whisper, never explicated. Final image of “bridge between worlds” reweights the viaduct from pretty backdrop to suture of human and oceanic time. No moralizing; ambiguity remains whether fish return or hope merely glimmers.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from water-as-memory: still surface hiding contamination. Subtext operates via mirror imagery—reservoir doubles sky, label doubles party hue—inviting reader to see reflection as ethical act. No overt moralizing; final “lantern” carries conceptual repricing rather than thesis. Ambiguity lingers: will townsfolk embrace or exile the truth—earned uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: “chaos and order were lovers” is shown via starling choreography, never stated as thesis. Subtext coils through objects—violet, crystal, flame—each re-weighted at closure. Final image of warm shard dreaming in spirals invites ambiguous reflection without moral. Minor echo of “pattern recognizing itself” borders on articulation but occurs mid-text; resonance sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of custodial burden emerges imagistically—buckle, echo, pattern seeking—rather than thesis. Final image of stars as “distant eyes” reweights earlier vigil as cosmic surveillance, satisfying resonance test. No moral spelled; ambiguity lingers on whether perpetual watch is salvation or curse. Yet theme is monocellular: no competing value (duty vs. self) is staged, so complexity is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: integration over transcendence. Subtext operates in the jar label “DUPLICATE” and the silent fear on mirrored faces. No moralizing; final line offers resonant CR—“the master was not the one who transcended emotion, but the one who embraced it completely.” Ambiguity lingers: integration may reopen old wounds, yet that risk is the proof of life.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of nurturing strangeness emerges organically from corpse-flower biology and escape-room ethos; no character sermonizes it. Final sprout image reconfigures patience as creative weapon, offering quiet conceptual repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the bloom gift or trap?—inviting reflection beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: grief can be permeated, not removed; music of remembered ridiculous love opens breathing room for mourning. Subtext carried in gesture—ease of grip, warmth of handle—never moralizes. Final silence charged with possibility reweights earlier lullaby fragments without stating lesson. Ambiguity stays fruitful: household will ache again, but now air circulates. No abstract thesis paragraph; avoids sentimental uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges entirely through imagistic returns—pendant, ice, waiting—never named as thesis. Final line re-prices exile into elective poetics without moralising. Ambiguity is productive: reader must decide whether “home” is defeat or transcendence. The inversion of light-boundary from visual limit to epistemic humility is a fresh conceptual turn that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: vivifying failure itself, not success, revalues the alchemic quest. The frozen bloom reprises earlier “dead embers” and reweights hope as trap. No moralizing; the penny’s drop is an image, not a lesson. Complexity is honored—undeath is beautiful yet static—and resonance lingers in the ambiguous peace of “incomplete.”

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges as silence revalued from absence to generative space; no moral is stated, only wired into copper. The shard’s shift from “message” to “seed” reweights every prior failure into necessary compost. Final image of tomorrow’s methodical teaching crystallizes the paradox: endings are infrastructure for beginnings.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—permanence-in-transience—emerges through the empty hourglass glowing with starlight, not exposition. Motif recurrence (sideways clock, vanishing, starlight threads) reweights meaning at closure when the ferry “solidified with a sigh.” Subtext resides in silence: Captain’s nod and empty hourglass speak of time exhausted. Final whispered radio pattern offers non-literal resonance, avoiding moralizing, though the insight remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from specific particulars: sinew → water, grasp → inhabit. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last image of audible footsteps implies the new weight of unheld connection. Ambiguity is purposeful—gallery resets, next architect looms—inviting reflection without thesis. Thematic echo absent; no character utters a prompt-like thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges obliquely: the living are the true vulnerable voices, not the dead. The photograph of Lila migrates from nostalgic artifact to talisman for future rescues, reweighting the concept without moralizing. Subtext resides in the hearing-aid’s tremble—grief misdirected. Final line “cycle continues” risks a platitude, but the image of mist curling like a guardian’s cloak keeps the resonance sensory, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges electro-poetic: corporate erasure vs. quantum persistence of self. The undersea cable metaphor—cat videos upstairs, ghosts below—re-prices our casual data flow without sermon. Final image of cold gold beside Marek’s name offers resonant reconfiguration: remembrance is not data recovery but embodied attention. No moralizing sentence mars the close.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from pattern: fracture (certificate, cup, code) → map → mend. No explicit thesis; final “quiet curtain” reweights prior fractures as navigation tools. Subtext in silence: ghost’s last chime is acceptance, not triumph. Emotional aftereffect: reader left counting own pulse. Resists moral; ambiguity lingers—she exits alive yet still ghost-filed somewhere. Particulars (ink veins, porcelain cold) carry universality without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges without statement: translation as persistence beyond meaning, memory as curse-gift. The final image of a voice that needs no ears reconfigures the entire premise, offering a non-literal answer to the central question—extinction is not erasure if matter itself keeps speaking. Subtext operates in gesture (placing the diamond back into the wall) rather than declaration. No moral is stated; the echo’s acceptance of the gift is the only elegy needed.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as “cosmic laughter is the antidote to frostbitten grief,” never sermonized. The flint → phone → starlight motif reprices the premise: relics of loss become toys of joy. Final image of eternal joke carries charged poise without moral tagging, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges without statement: beauty ≠ memory but live arrhythmic risk. Subtext plays in gesture—statues’ “granite eyes reflecting nothing” versus orchard leaves that “sing rather than tick.” Final dust reweights opening ash, reframing identical sensory data from entropy to fertile soil. Conceptual repricing: silence isn’t absence but enforced synchronization; choosing arrhythmia redefines freedom. No moral delivered—only image of patting hands learning to pulse—leaving complex aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of bottled storms and failed promises: containment versus release, technology as mercy. Subtext lives in gesture—the mother’s trembling fingers release static, literally enacting re-connection. No moral is stated; the final drizzle of tears and rain reconfigures the border from wall to permeable membrane. The concept stays tightly fused to the courier’s guilt, avoiding abstract drift.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from concrete pattern: silence → seed → carousel motion. No moralizing; final crown of “whispering gleam” reweights prior “misting hush” without sermon. Subtext lives in gesture: oiling gears = prayer, fitting halo = self-coronation. Ambiguity lingers—was song worth breaking silence?—inviting reflection rather than dictating meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory is not stored but actively folded; stories read the reader. The recursive scarf–Möbius image recharges the idea that closure is impossible—stories never end, only re-loop. No moral is asserted; the final smile is an earned stasis that accepts infinite recurrence. Subtext resides in silence: the ghosts and insomniacs never complain, suggesting unread narratives are also trapped patrons.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges without declaration: the value of longing resides in its unfillable space. Recurring motif of “luminous absence” reweights from loss to generative possibility at closure. Subtext operates in silence—the dream’s wordless recognition of its own path—eschewing thesis statements. Final image offers resonant non-answer: empty well as invitation to begin again, complexity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges as the price of archiving pain: faeries-as-archivists mirrors the folklorist’s own compulsion to catalog, culminating in the decision that “some constellations are meant to stay broken.” No thematic statement is declared; the idea accres through wreck-as-star-chart and the glowing mushroom beacon left for “the next fool.” Ambiguity is productive—reader can’t tell whether forgetting was mercy or theft—creating lingering reflection. The final image reweights the entire quest without moralizing, satisfying the non-literal answer test.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of quiet resilience emerges from tea-leaf spirals and swing arcs, never stated outright. Final image—library breathing—reweights the hush from loneliness to shared breath, a Conceptual Repricing. Subtext lives in gesture: backward walk becomes ritual of reverence, not mere tic. Combative tenderness is the medium, not the message; no moralizing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through the inversion of preservation: hoarding kills, weaving multiplies. The final image of sap glowing on her palms reprises the earlier “pearl” seed, now repriced as perpetual duty. No moral is stated; the moss-grown secret languages invite counter-readings of endless creative labor. The refusal to give visitors a tidy answer keeps ambiguity earned.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges as the inverse of restoration: true repair requires dismantling, not mending. The interlaced hush shifts from prison to birthplace without authorial sermon. Final image—starlight threading the empty net—offers non-literal answer: silence shared becomes structure, not void. Complexity preserved: she doesn’t expiate guilt, but incorporates it as living architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: silence is not absence but palimpsest, a canvas of erased stories that still press against the present. The silver thread literalizes the theme—history’s wound can be mended only if its fracture remains visible. Subtext operates in gesture: her palm on cool stone is both knock and caress, curiosity vying with reverence. Final image reconfigures the premise—maps are no longer barriers but stitches between heard and unheard.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically: encoded memory as communal balm, art as trans-generational voice. Subtext resides in the gradual shift from solitary balladeer to communal choir, shown through duplicated action rather than thesis. The ending withholds moral statement, offering instead a luminous drift of freed code—an image that re-weights prior glyphs with hope. Complexity is modest; the lack of a contested or risky thematic angle keeps the score solidly above 6 but below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges as “attention is the highest form of love”; no character ever states it—idea is encrypted like the diary, revealed only through the goggles’ refraction. Subtextual doubling: the ice scatters light into beauty the way grief scatters memory into survivable fragments. Final image reweights premise: servant devotion is not subservience but mutual decryption, proving that unnoticed labor can be someone’s lifeline. Thematic ambiguity remains—Kai’s future service will now be haunted by knowledge that can never be spoken, a cost the reader feels without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges as the inverse of scientific objectivity: private grief rewrites barometric data, and collective forgetting is the real mechanical failure. Subtext operates in the silence around Thorne’s suppressed transmission; the sky’s memory is the moral counter-archive. No moralizing sentence—final image is the telescope keeping vigil, a non-literal answer. Complexity is honored: her proof is “enough” though no journal will print it.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—wonder versus solitude—emerges through recurrent starling images and the phrasebook breadcrumb rather than overt statement. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in Kess’s rare praise and Elara’s finger-tracing of carvings carries quiet irony of succession. Complexity is present but not deeply ambivalent; the cost is more poignancy than moral reckoning. No final-paragraph thesis statement; avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without moralizing: repair is not perfection but reconciliation with breakage itself. The driftwood nostalgia motif migrates from burden to gentle tide, reweighting the premise that broken things must be fixed. No character articulates a thesis; meaning crystallizes in the amber mirror-glow. Counter-readings linger—has she merely replaced one haunting with another?—inviting reflection rather than closure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of collective interdependence emerges through orchard labor imagery; subtext avoids sermonizing. Brambled hope motif returns in final spiral, but abstraction outweighs embodied cost. Insight feels gentle rather than urgent; ambiguity is present yet low-temperature because stakes never become visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: mercy is inscribed in brokenness itself. The cracked puppet head and flawed keeper refuse sentimental redemption; instead, fracture becomes the only geometry capable of holding a lullaby made of silence. Subtext resides in gesture—dissolving the toy is the whisper. Final image reweights all prior spirals into “a grace that was, at last, enough,” offering no moral, only charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the tension between poisoned inheritance and anonymous mercy—no moral is stated, only enacted. The orchard’s curse and the nut’s grace are inseparable, reweighted by the final image of her solitary retreat. Subtext lives in gesture: the nut’s shadow is a wordless signature she can never claim. Complexity is honored—she both resents and fulfills the duty.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the iterative braid image: divergence → braided harmony → synthetic bridge. No explicit moral; final “symphonic embrace of all that is lost and found” is an image, not a thesis. Subtext operates through object return (chrysalis discarded, foam reclaimed) that reweights meaning without articulation. Complexity is honored—grief is not erased but woven—avoiding sentimental closure. Echo of “symphony” risks faint thematic echo, but cadence feels earned by river soundscape rather than prompt mimicry.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—stories begin in engineered silence—emerges through iterated incisions and the vendor’s final refusal, not exposition. Subtext in “glimmering parole” reframes erasure as liberation; final image of “lantern above the sleeping world” reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is unwriting a gift or violence? No thematic echo violations.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from salt-geometry: memory cannot be sandpapered smooth, only shared into edible ghosts. No final moral—just bread that will forever taste of lost daughter-hand, a conceptual re-pricing of everyday food. Subtext lives in gesture: woman’s silence, chef’s tongue-catch, coral sigh. Image-pattern (coral, dough, pool, bread) reweights at close, answering the question “what is forgiveness?” with the non-literary act of ingestion.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—community as polyphonic clockwork—emerges through the multilingual cuckoo call, avoiding overt thesis. Subtext lives in the elevators’ creaking “lean inward,” a bodily image of walls listening. The final filing gesture reprises the librarian identity but feels administratively neat rather than charged. While the concept is fresh, the story stops one beat short of complicating the new harmony—no dissenting voice remains to keep tension alive.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the concrete spiral of mirror‐fracture = synapse: the past is not relic but rewriteable tissue, and the price is that the archaeologist becomes strata. No moralizing; the final image of "all canyons are ultimately mind" reweights prior material conceptually, inviting reflection on externalized memory without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in silence—her smile in sleep is the only commentary offered. Emotional aftereffect is vertiginous wonder rather than sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of vigilance emerges through the prism’s refracted light and the copied glyphs, avoiding explicit sermon. The final rainbow splash on the empty margin reweights the doodle as spent but the archivist as living sentinel—an image that invites reflection without moral tag. Subtext stays in objects rather than assertion. Complexity is limited by the absence of any counter-argument or visible consequence; vigilance is celebrated, never tested.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of “empathy in motion” emerges imagistically: she feels the linemen’s history through cracked porcelain, threads their lost electricity into audible sound. Final quiet lullaby reconfigures silence as collaborative rather than oppressive, achieving resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: world outside grove hardly notices, so the empathy stays intimate, incomplete, and therefore credible.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—sacrifice as reversible beauty—emerges through stone, eclipse, and erased prints, never stated. Final image reweights the earlier covenant without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will Mira read the absence correctly? Complexity is embraced; no tidy thesis closes the circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of empathy-through-silence emerges from pattern: catalogued silences, radio static, and fireworks after-hush accumulate into the father’s line “Silence is the shape of love.” No moralizing summary; the neighbor’s entrance embodies the theme without stating it. Final image of “shared stillness” reweights earlier solitude effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of serenity within motion emerges from scent-contrasts and the final swaying elders, never sermonized. The seed’s stench-as-teacher subverts tidy “beauty good, rot bad” binaries. Subtext whispers in doodled spirals: warding decay while embracing it. Final line’s “scented possibility” offers resonant reconfiguration without moral tag.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particulates—scarred seed, braided rivers, repaired arrow—never from thesis statements. Final image of “grow backward into roots while reaching forward” offers resonant non-literal answer to resilience question. No moralizing; ambiguity remains: orchards may still die, but now with different meaning. Subtext in whirling silence and broken-then-whole arrow reweights failure as generative, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of foresight versus fatal convergence emerges through wind mapping, but final paragraph verbalizes it (“world was a web of converging forces”) rather than letting image reweight meaning. Subtext is present yet leans toward statement.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without statement: wonder as breathable atmosphere, silence as oppressive architecture. The re-pricing is the cavern’s hush becoming “a living silence” that breathes color—an image that reweights the opening premise. Subtextual irony: the sculptor, oblivious, still chisels yet now “with newfound reverence,” showing wonder contagious. No moralizing paragraph; the final line lets marble “forever echo” the bell’s argument, leaving ambiguity about who is sculptor and who is sculpted.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—guardianship as eternal, self-willed burden—emerges through the shift from “guarded relics” to “carries fracture.” Subtext lives in gesture: arranging driftwood = attempting to order chaos; lowering flute = accepting silence as canvas. No moralizing sentence spells the lesson; instead the final image of the closed-but-unlocked door re-prices the concept. Ambiguity lingers: he may yet widen the rift, satisfying the complexity requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the concrete failure of the equation: the final notebook line is not stated but lived—Cassian’s reeducated stance that emotion is a living flux. The topaz glow lingering in darkness reweights earlier images without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: the reader is left to decide whether the experiment’s ruin is tragedy or revelation, yet the cost is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—wonder germinates from ordinary acts—emerges through the sprout image rather than exposition. The pendant’s migration from courier to soil reconfigures“extension” from time dilation to legacy, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights earlier beats. Subtext resides in gesture: handing over the pendant = handing over vocation. Final image of aurora-lit tree offers resonant non-literal answer; no moralizing paragraph. Minor slip: “wonder” is named in opening desire, slightly front-loading theme.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without thesis statement: the truthful lie that discovery uses the observer rather than vice versa. The frost-formed sentence and the arbor’s apparent weight-loss reprice the concept of absorption, making the social cost—loss of scientific credibility—undeniable. No moralizing closes the piece; the final image of tomorrow’s frost waiting for “another attentive soul” invites reflection on the ethics of witness.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of repair into relinquishment; no explicit thesis is stated. The amber bead’s migration from pocket to shuttle to absence reweights “silence” from wound to gift. Final image—ripe plum dropping—offers non-literal answer about cyclical completion. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the barter pattern: resilience is not found but paid for with what we fear to lose. No overt thesis—final image of fruit tasting “of copper and courage” reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the new quiet Ren stronger or just differently armored? The copper–courage fusion in edible fruit makes the abstract concrete and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of inherited duty emerges through image-chain: shard as fragmented predecessor, compass as burden, cycle as dream-murmur. No explicit moral; resonance comes from final reprise of “murmur” now clarified as call to guardianship. Withheld truth motif evolves from abstract weight to concrete vocation, satisfying CR. Avoids sermon until final sentence, and even that is image-driven (“compass”), earning its profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of transmuting loneliness into shared guardianship emerges through the bottle-and-cairn ritual; the sea-glass and stone chain reweight from quaint detail to covenant without overt statement. Final line reprises “luminescent ache,” achieving resonance, though the ghost remains under-exploited thematic counter-voice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through light/shadow motif: memory versus digital amnesia, old print versus new dawn. Subtext operates in silent dance of silhouettes—no character articulates “media obsolescence.” Final image of gold dawn reprices emerald light as analogue rebirth; ambiguity lingers on whether laughter births or merely heralds change. Avoids overt moral; avoids thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—“stories are given, not magnetized”—emerges cleanly from dye ritual and child’s scarf payoff, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext operates in silence: stranger’s empty hands, child’s first words, sun-lit dust—each image implies receptivity without lecture. Repetition of “quietly explosive” edges toward slogan, slightly dampening nuance. Final image (valley mist meeting house) reweights earlier altitude motif, achieving resonance, though the conceptual cost is gentler than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from concrete pattern: sorrow quantified → sorrow refracted → hope mapped. No moralizing; final image of “new dream scattering” reweights premise without thesis. Mundane miracles (lullaby, laugh) are particularized, not abstract. Ambiguity lingers: labyrinth will collect more dreams, so transformation is cyclical, not terminal.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through image, not statement: dawn stitched from songs, orchard as alchemist of sorrow. The final image—perpetual dawn bought by Elias’s dissolution—reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence: no deliberation about the sacrifice, implying memory-keepers are born to surrender. Ambiguity lingers: is dawn eternal or just a longer twilight? Complexity is embraced rather than resolved.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric voice carries a consistent perceptual signature: silver-leaved trees “chiming like bells,” copper-scented air. Syntax modulates with intensity—short clauses at climax (“The mica window cracked”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy preserved. Compressed diction under pressure (“He began to sing, his voice raw”) stays within POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the nested paradox structure rather than overt statement; the final image of silent compatriots holding once-crumpled invitations reweights all prior solitude as preparatory. No moralizing—meaning stays implicit in the mirrored invitation seed. The wisdom-of-error concept is dramatized, not declared. Emotional aftereffect lingers: isolation as gift and cage simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges inductively: silence as both sanctuary and prison. The captured recording becomes a tangible shard of broken trust, reweighting the value of hush without moralizing. Subtextual tension between preservation and exposure threads through lantern imagery and ticking brass. Final image—“lullaby that hums just before a storm”—offers resonant ambiguity, though a touch of explanatory echo (“trust, once broken, can be measured…”) slightly dilutes implicit power.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—knowledge as sensory election rather than ownership—emerges through taste-shift imagery, never stated. Subtext resides in gesture of ring transfer: silence > thesis. Final image of “sap, starlight, coming rain” reweights earlier metallic tastes into planetary memory. No final-paragraph moralizing; resonance stays particular.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—artistic calling as inescapable dawn after personal night—emerges through pattern of light-in-dark imagery rather than statement. “Draw the dawn” note is concrete stimulus, not abstract moral. Final smile echo reconfigures loss into generative sorrow without sermon. Complexity upheld: rebirth does not erase grief; it is braided with it. No final-paragraph thesis, avoids thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from pattern, not sermon: wilting/candor/gilding recur with escalating stakes; the final action—gilding the reel label—renders the moral as tactile labor, not statement. Subtext in the guard’s “slick” evasion and the neighbor’s watering tears carries the emotional after-effect. Conceptual repricing: honesty becomes an organic, photosynthetic act—maintenance, not triumph. No late moral sentences; final image alone suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from the pattern itself: meaning resides in vibration, not vocabulary. The iceberg fragment’s reprise (ancient whale-song inside future ice) reweights wonder as reciprocal, not archival. No moralizing; the final laugh is a sonic object, not commentary. Ambiguity lingers: who will tune after the tuner dissolves?

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of miniaturization: terrors shrink only when physically destroyed, while the android’s selfhood enlarges. The final silence “that finally made sense” reweights every prior static hum without moralizing. Recurring rose sap and magnetic drift accumulate into a conceptual repricing—north is meaningless, but inward is fixed. No character utters a thesis; the image of a box curled to a black dot carries the emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: listening as communal glue surfaces through the letters’ content, never sermonized. Final image of the polished mailbox reweights “listening” from passive to activist act without moral tag. One soft spot: the phrase “listening heals” is printed on the prompt-like note inside the locket, a faint echo that keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—“vulnerability encrypted as strength”—emerges through choreography, not thesis. The spider web’s completion mirrors her journal lattice, reweighting patience as weapon at closure. No moralizing; final image of silver lattice against sun reprises without explaining. Avoids thematic echo; only near-slip is the word “liberate” spelled aloud, but it is dramatized motion, not label.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of grief: the planet’s mourning swallows memories, yet private love exhumes them. The violet scent refracted from crystal reweights “deleted” from irreversible to bearable. No moralizing; final image of whale-song carrying deleted memories offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in pressed flowers as both key and prayer avoids thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: the ethics of silencing danger to preserve peace. Subtext sits in the brook’s recovered “innocent” babble—an ironic victory. No moralizing paragraph; the question is left suspended in the final folded sheet. The crane recurrence shifts from instrument to tombstone of foresight, satisfying motif-use rules.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—memory as negotiated palimpsest—emerges through limestone grammar, meteor punctuation, and the seal’s promise “what is hidden remains.” No explicit thesis; subtext lives in chipped plaster and bergamot steam. Final image reweights every prior “agreed-upon lie” by turning the basement wall into a manuscript no future renovator can unread. Complexity is honored: preservation requires new falsification, Alex becomes both archivist and conspirator.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the iterated inversion of isolation: quarantine → cocoon → bridge, never sermonized. Final image of dawn garden holding “both of them” reweights every prior purple petal into dual citizenship of memory and freedom. Subtext operates in hush: shell falls silent, garden stops whispering—meaning conveyed by cessation. Avoids tidy moral; “true independence is not absence of connection” is earned through visceral surrender, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the paradox that forgery is restoration, betrayal is filial devotion. No moral is stated; instead the final image of the thorn resting in velvet reprices the act as elegy, not crime. Recurring motif of “finishing the unfinished” moves from literal scroll to societal wound, achieving resonance without slogan. The refusal to show the tyrant’s face keeps the focus on Elara’s moral calculus, inviting ambiguity rather than triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the pairing of distorted/intact globes: purity is not unbrokenness but deliberate preservation amid wreckage. Subtext lives in gesture—Elias’s hand passing through rusted metal—rather than exposition. The final image refrains from moralizing; the lullaby echo is the non-literal answer. Minor deduction for the repeated “borrowed starlight” refrain that edges toward motif-declaration rather than resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of invisible labor emerges through recurrent net and firefly imagery rather than exposition; the final whistle-thread tapestry offers a resonant, non-moralizing reconfiguration, though the absence of counter-argument keeps complexity shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges via recurrence of “frequency” as metaphor for mutable loyalty and prophecy; no final moralizing. “Let the old shadows teach the new light” offers resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity accepted: prophet as child or era. Ancillary motifs (cobalt, static, storm) accumulate meaning without checklist feel. Conceptual repricing at end reweights loneliness into generative myth.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as communal honey rather than private currency. Subtext lives in gesture—wax scraped from abandoned candles becomes the seal that later must be broken, enacting the theme of necessary loss. Final image of wind carrying singable verses offers conceptual repricing without moralizing. The refusal to tidy grief into fortune-cookie comfort sustains complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of absolution-as-resonance emerges from the concrete duel of hertz values, never sermonized. The whale-bone flute’s ancient prayers and the drowned keeper’s gratitude reweight “grief” from abstract to audible, making the final silence a moral reckoning. Final image—engineer walking toward lamp-kindling—carries Charged Poise: duty renewed, frequency altered, cost unpaid but fully felt. No tidy moral, only a re-tuned life.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—patience as forge rather than submission—emerges through lunar cycles, magnetic pulses, and the final quiet skies rather than exposition. Subtext operates in silence: the three-short/three-long lights speak rebellion without slogans. The last image of her reflection holding “every future she had helped to free” reweights prior mappings with conceptual, not moralizing, resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—complicity vs. solidarity—emerges through the convergence of underground-railroad history and contemporary safety violations; no character states it aloud. The lantern’s reprise reweights its original meaning: from aiding escape to preventing death, linking past resistance to present refusal. Subtext operates in silence: the unanswered calls say more than any shouted refusal. Final image of rising water implies that buried truths, like drought-ending rain, eventually surface without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—grace as iterative repair, not erasure—emerges from the artisan’s filing and the chaplain’s listening, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: fingers tracing fracture lines replace spoken theology. Final re-pricing (“not absolution, but a melody built, broken, and rebuilt”) avoids tidy moral, offering instead a concrete after-effect: the reader hears the unclosed obligation continuing past the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges as the cost of yearning itself—machines and humans alike driven to create meaning even as entropy (acid) eats their world. No explicit thesis; final image of “tongue of a god whispering in gear-language” reweights earlier motifs (arrow, bell, rust) into conceptual eternity. Subtext in irreverent laughter: awe survives cynicism. Ambiguity persists—will the future hear or dissolve?—inviting reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: digital ghosts vs. corporate erasure, voiced through recurring numbers and songs rather than thesis. The final image—numbers whispered into dark—offers a non-literal answer: memory persists through illicit repetition. Subtext in gesture (patch warmth, sleeve protection) is strong; no overt moralizing. The concept of "sensed absence" permeates every byte and note, reweighting the premise at closure. Minor slip: final paragraph edges toward explicit statement ("nothing truly disappears") but pulls back into image quickly enough.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges as lived paradox: empathy is not softness but a crystal forged in willing blood. No moralizing finale; the lighthouse beam is a non-literal answer, re-weighting every prior glow. The child’s step forward reconfigures what courage means for the collective, leaving ambiguous afterglow rather than slogan.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: mismatched vines model acceptance of fractured love. Final image of the letter left for “any future wanderer” reframes solitude as hospitality—an earned, non-moralizing insight. No echo-chamber abstractions, but reliance on reiterated vineyard metaphors keeps it just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from iterative image: photo arcs mirror lavender rows, making the healing process botanical—perennial, not terminal. Subtext lives in silence: the smell of copper machinery ghost-laughs during lunch breaks, letting grief stay sensory and unsummarized. Final line offers resonant non-moral: rearranging wounds into patterns of beauty—never stated earlier, only enacted. Avoids sentimentality by keeping loss raw (calloused hand still reaching) while simultaneously blooming.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through pattern: knowledge survives not in words but in vulnerable voicing. Subtext resides in gesture—crystal pressed to page, page torn for wrapping—showing reverence without sermon. Final image of dancing dust reconfigures “dictionary dust” as ephemeral testimony against silence. No moral sentence; resonance stays particular and haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—time’s echo is un-ownable—emerges from the prophet’s tactile failures rather than thesis statements. The final smile reweights the chalk dust from tool to relic, offering conceptual repricing without moralizing. Recurrent tapes and driftwood accrue meaning through use, not symbolic graft. Ambiguity lingers: next pilgrim may hear or ignore the spiral—earned complexity, not tidy wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: ephemeral captured by listening, not force. Subtext lives in the leaf’s whisper versus the gear’s frozen starlight—silence and shimmer carry the argument. Final image of next leaf falling reweights prior material without sermon. No thematic echo line; ache stays implicit. Conceptual cost—time remains un-stopped, observatory ache eternal—is undeniable in last smile.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from ironic inversion: folkloric “changeling” becomes human crime, academic “certainty” becomes cruelty. Subtext in Moira’s calm gardening of the telescope implies she has long awaited this reckoning. No explicit moral; instead the image of women replotting stars from errors keeps ambiguity alive. Final reweighting of “bones” from forensic evidence to moral responsibility gives lasting after-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: reflection as communal stillness versus solitary stargazing. The pearl’s shift from private memory to shared constellation reweights meaning without moralizing. Final image invites multiple readings—gift, surveillance, or fragile hope—yet avoids forced ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: preservation versus exposure, resin versus confession. Subtext coils around “honeyed hush”—the bee-made sweetness literally replaces the algorithmic silence. Final image reweights betrayal into nurturance without moralizing. Ambiguity stays alive: garden may yet be invaded, silence re-broken.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: authorship as colonial possession vs. witness/release. Subtext resides in gesture—breathing the shell instead of speaking prayer—avoiding thesis statements. Final image reweights prior motif: shell becomes seed, not relic, offering conceptual repricing without moral. Ambiguity lingers: is wild hope mercy or further exile? No late moralizing; "inside the whisper" refrain accumulates resonance rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges inductively: memory is not stored in objects but in practiced breath, melody, communal attention. No character articulates a thesis; the final image of moonlit vine spinning stories wordlessly reweights earlier motifs. Ambiguity is productive—will song survive modernity?—yet unmistakable. The refusal to moralize keeps it from 9.0, but resonance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: grief can be translated but never erased; geometry is love’s residue. The copper plate’s shift from static map to pulsing star-chart reweights the concept of “home” as resonance, not place. No moralizing—final lullaby image lets silence speak. Ambiguity lingers: does the map lead to the child or to acceptance? Both readings coexist, satisfying complexity requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory kept alive by sharing, not ownership. Subtext in the shift from “store wonder in the cellar of reason” to “wonder was stored…in the angled light” reframes cellar as open architecture. No moralizing; final repricing lands via image. The wounded-season conceit links ecological and emotional scars, inviting reflection on how collective trauma must be vented, not entombed.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from the recursive metaphor of weaving/measurement: agency is not escape but acceptance of one’s own pattern. Subtext lives in temperature—warm brass = memory made artifact; cold brass = self-carved exile—never stated, always felt. Final image reweights “boundary-lessly trapped” into boundary-lessly chosen, a conceptual repricing accomplished without sermon. The whalebone glow fuses starlight and fossilized grief, delivering an emotional aftereffect that is specific, not sentimental.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: every perception is filtered through textile lexicon—threads, warp, weft, loom—even silence is “shingled.” Rhythm compresses under pressure: clauses shorten as she turns the burner, then elongate into spiraling sentences mirroring fractal expansion. No head-hop; single interiority sustained. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon: “calcify,” “wick-holder,” “translucent crystal” are maker-words, not thesaurus filler. Final exhalation syntactically mirrors a shed loom—sentence opens wide as the wall becomes permeable.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of containment: by freezing the memory she liberates herself from its haunting. No thesis is declared; the final image of rainbow light on carved mane reweights “here-and-gone” as lived artistry rather than bereavement. Subtext operates in silence—the absent roar, the unshaped lion’s mouth—inviting reflection on what we can and cannot preserve. Resonance lingers in the reader’s own chest as the question of which memories they would crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particulars: eroded paint, forgotten brushes, dew-stories—no abstraction. Final image reframes erosion as material for new vessel, avoiding moral. Subtext in silence: unsaid words stone the throat. Resonance lingers without statement, capped at 8.8 because no secondary tension complicates the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from concrete reversal: letting go becomes a form of inscription. The final image—sunrise illuminating gear-filled crystal—re-prices “legacy” as environmental rather than pedagogical, avoiding thesis statement. Petrichor nostalgia modulates from painful to peaceful without moral tag. Ambiguity lingers: will the sanctuary now whisper differently? Reader invited to listen.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from map-labels rewriting history—no exposition sermon. The radio-silence motif returns as “threshold between past and present,” re-weighted when she crosses it physically into the chamber. Ambiguity is preserved: we never learn who built the mosaic, keeping the city culpable but faceless. Final smile is earned stasis—she accepts endless labor ahead, a resonant refusal of easy victory.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges as “preservation is not vault but circulation”: rope as living USB, tea as wordless contract, seeds as futures smuggled inside coat pockets. Subtext operates in silence—Kessler’s breath merging with mist is consent without endorsement. Final image reweights “oceanic hush” from ambient mood to archival methodology: silence is the only medium loud enough to carry extinct grass across centuries. No moral is declared; the resonance is the soft click of snow on piling, audible only after the page is written.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of healing-as-practice emerges from iterated ritual, not statement. Final image reweights “geography” from place to ongoing weave, offering resonant ambiguity. No moralizing; the silence after the ship answers the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges: beauty is no longer pre-lapsarian but welded, broken, alive in the seam. Subtext operates through image—half-feather, half-copper wings—never thesis. Final reconfiguration reweights “flawed genesis” from defect to necessity, resisting moralizing. Bittersweet tone is earned by specific loss (extinction) and gain (song), not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from the returning triad of fire-scars, black sand, and coin: legacy can be re-forged into tenderness. Final image of coin buried in sand reweights “dark legacy into light” without moralizing. Subtext resides in the red thread—once a symbol of her father’s wanderlust, now ligature of healing. The kelp-drift peace tone keeps sentimentality at bay; ambiguity remains—will the bird truly fly?—inviting reflection beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—memory as living water—emerges through the restored fountains without authorial thesis. The final image of Kael’s glow merging with the cascade reweights the opening “lost faith in the sky,” implying reclamation rather than stating it. Subtext is thin: no silence, gesture, or withheld desire complicates her stance. A hair below 8.0 because the thematic return is elegant but single-note.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: light as information vs. light as combustion. The final repricing—infinity = repetitive consumption—answers the core question obliquely, through image rather than moral. Subtext is carried by gesture: gear dissolving into petals = knowledge becoming the very beauty that traps the next sentinel. Emotional aftereffect is cold awe, not sentimentality; the smile at obliteration is earned through eight prior failures.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from iterative ribbon text: communal mourning is cooperative weaving, not individual lament. Subtext rests in unspoken dinner-table silences and orchid dust settling on chisels—collective labor made visible. Final spiral stone is Conceptual Repricing that reweights prior motifs without moralizing. No sentimental closure; ambiguity lingers in migrating absence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: absolution accrues like tide marks—incremental, undeniable. The rake handle’s tiny letters embody the concept; their erasure by seawater re-prices the meaning of “permanent record.” Final image reconfigures the premise: maintenance of time is now maintenance of a shared, shaky myth. No moral is declared; resonance is carried by the silver pendulum bob hanging in charged stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: intentions can be wordless yet fully weighted. The tapestry’s silver tear reprises moonlight and cemetery stars, reconfiguring silence as mercy rather than absence. No explicit moral is stated; the reader is left to feel that grief’s language may be thread, not speech. The concept stays narrow, avoiding pseudo-profundity, but the spareness also caps resonance at quiet rather than revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—maps as futures, futures as fragile infrastructure—emerges through the kingfisher nib, the unrolled vellum, the phased boreholes rather than thesis lines. Final image of “pen poised forever above the blank page” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext stays in negative space: what remains unmapped is still lethal.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: story as subatomic vibration, art as contraband light. No moralizing—final line lets dust “tell stories” without commentary. The pirate broadcast reweights from illegal noise to seed of myth, a resonant reconfiguration that invites reflection on scale and survival.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: knowledge is a craft that demands corporeal payment—lungs, name, future. Subtext lives in gesture—filing sparks fly like shortened lives; “Tempus edax rerum” worn to ghosts mocks Council’s edible propaganda. Final image reframes earlier library-burning: memory can survive if transferred to metal, not paper. Complexity upheld—all three collapse causes remain possible, but method is preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through negative-space imagery: carved voids, blank scores, pressed leaf-veins—absence as the necessary condition for resonance. No character sermonizes; the closest to thesis is the rosette lesson, delivered as tactile instruction. Braided harmony is presented as fragile social technology rather than moral triumph, inviting counter-readings about inevitable erosion. Final image of the leaf “veined like the rosette’s channels” reweights the premise without moral summary, satisfying the non-literal answer test.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from action: memory as regenerative compost, not archival dust. Subtext in the taste of laughter inside grief refuses moral binaries. Final image reframes “ruins” as crucible rather than grave—an answer articulated without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: will sharers become new Order or keep pruning power? Question feels earned, not tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through pattern: static discharge, crystallized honey, and child’s laughter all refract wonder as renewable energy. Final line “the darkness tastes like honey now” reweights the blackout from terror to possibility without moralizing. Memory is repriced as infrastructure—an idea legible only because the tower’s physical re-activation dramatizes it. No thematic echo sentences; insight stays implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from the paradox that poison = cure, stone = breath, truth = plural. No explicit thesis; instead, foxglove petals and cracked marble carry the argument. Final image reconfigures the concept of welcome: not affirmation of arrival but acceptance of perpetual questioning. Subtext in the silver chain’s sway and the empty ampoule’s seawater reweights “welcome” as an ongoing cost rather than closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: regret is not escaped but incorporated as bodily weight. The dice’s shift from divining rods to penance jewelry reconfigures meaning. Final image of continued ascent with imperfect rhythm offers non-literal answer—endurance is the only form of capture. No moralizing; complexity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    Kindness-as-virus theme emerges via herbal ripple; no character states the moral. Final image of “lost languages… lived in the breath of strangers” reweights prior cataloguing without sermon. Subtext operates in gesture—Mira’s herbs stand in for spoken thanks—avoiding sentimental directness. Ambiguity lingers: city still choking, kindness fragile, theme not tidily resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: yoyo halves = reversible time, hunger stone = consumed radiance, counter-clockwise clock = defiance of determinism. No moralizing statement—insight is encoded in the final image of a “golden path” that reweights the premise. Latent radiance motif shifts from abstract to visceral when it spills “like liquid silver,” charging the closure. Ambiguity lingers: stone will hunger again, but she now owns the key—complexity embraced, not tidily resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of survivor-as-unintelligible-to-fear emerges through image chain (second heartbeat, pearl of possible screams, empty photo) rather than statement. Final paradox reweights earlier dream notes, giving conceptual cost: witness language is now hers alone. No moralizing; resonance lingers in cracked mirrors. Ambiguity remains whether luminance is gift or curse, enriching reread.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as the ethics of listening: convert menace into counter-melody rather than domination. Subtext coils through gesture—hand closing on kelp-wrapped bone, smile at mallet rest—never thesis. Final image of “space between forecast and creation” reweights earlier cloud-reading without moralizing. Slight abstraction in “restless euphony” refrain approaches thematic echo; kept under −0.4 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges via spiral recursion: every map is also a grave, every answer spawns a harder question. Subtext lives in the watchers’ raised hand—acknowledgment or beckoning?—left resolutely ambiguous. The final image of the question-mark carving reweights the entire premise: curiosity is not extinguished but transmuted into perpetual inquiry. No moralizing, only the cost of irreversible sight.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of noble lies versus honest futures emerges through parallel imagery (station/ledger/roses) rather than lecture. Final garden image reconfigures the lie as compost for new growth—an elegant CR—though the absence of counter-argument keeps complexity shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—memory as infrastructural repair—emerges through gesture, not thesis: capsules of names rammed into limestone ribs. Subtext in the blank locket and bleached toy forces reader to supply erased lives. Final brass declaration reframes earlier “interlaced absence” as present responsibility. No moralizing line; resonance surfaces in image of tide pulling past a man who now archives loss instead of merely recording decay.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of reclamation emerges from the iterative stamping ritual, not exposition. The dappled light/dark motif reconfigures at closure when fluorescent tubes replace lantern flicker, making stillness a reclaimed artifact rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—survival as archival witness—emerges through geode imagery & unused-potential metaphor, never sermonized. Subtext in silence: “this was enough” hides abyss of no-next-step. Final image of starlight refracting through crystallized ghosts offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting loss into permanence without moral. Avoids tidy thesis; ambiguity legible yet emotionally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely: belonging as a waveform one feels, not a location. The “brilliant dimness” motif reweights from visual paradox to epistemic limit at closure, avoiding overt statement. No moralizing summary; resonance is left humming. Slight abstraction keeps it from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of falsified time/memory: “each forgery left a scar on his own timeline.” Final image—broken hand ticking soft—performs Conceptual Repricing, equating mending time with accepting unedited past. No moralizing sentence; insight stays implicit. Complexity acknowledged: peace is dust, not redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through recycled objects and rituals: drawer pull, frayed rope, moon cycle—mistakes transmuted into protocol. No moral is stated; the final image of mist re-swallowing the parapet reprices trust as fragile and perpetual. Subtextual gestures (brass exchange, rope hand-off) carry the apology/forgiveness tension without articulating it. The raven cry swallowed by wind offers a quiet conceptual after-shock.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the poles-as-stars motif reconfigured from ambition to forgiveness; no explicit thesis. The final laugh-cry reweights earlier guilt without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—setting the compass down is relinquishment and retrieval simultaneously. Complexity is honored: grace is “strange gravity,” neither absolution nor punishment.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through image-loop: hunter→keeper, sterile→glow, erased→remembered. No explicit moral; final whispered “Elias” reweights premise via time-loop resonance. “Jaded wonder” tone carries thematic ambiguity without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the returned image of “cosmic intimacy” that reweights the fortune-cookie wisdom into lived reality: constancy is not stasis but eternal transformation. The phoenix ash feeding the roots quietly argues that love, like fire, must consume to renew. No moral is stated; the final lullaby for fox-cubs is an action that enacts the theme rather than explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the reversal of pacifism: violence absorbed rather than avoided. No final-paragraph thesis—image of stitching the hull with “stitched shadows and starlight” reweights the premise. Subtext of “tears” shifts from shame to lens: photographs become windows, tears become thread. Ambiguity lingers: is endless caretaking salvation or penance? Answer is felt, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from pattern of gifts boomeranging unseen; the final spiral transmutes “philanthropist saves village” into “village saves philanthropist by hollowing him.” No moralizing—wisdom is imaged, not stated. Crimson bug functions as mutating motif that reweights the meaning of “collecting.” Ambiguity remains: miracle or math?—inviting reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—locks exist to be opened—emerges from concrete gear/sundial decoding, not assertion. Final image of well-oiled but useless lock reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost: security systems breed their own collapse. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will populace choose freedom?). Motif recurrence (oil, sparks, angles) constrains tactics; not token. Wisdom is earned: “every shadow to be read” arises from lived decade of latch-tending, not platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: knowledge as witness vs. control; sacred patterns exist to be read, not possessed. Subtext lives in gesture—dimming dust equals relinquished godhood. Final image of “whispering numbers to the stars” reweights the opening promise from mastery to humble conversation; no moral is stated. Emotional aftereffect is awe laced with loss—world slides on, but traces remain.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges obliquely: censorship, silence, and the cartography of scars are never sermonized. The final image—scars as constellations he can “finally read”—reweights the premise without moral tag. Recurring motifs (timer, envelope, timetable) accrue meaning through use, not lecture. Storm-kissed wonder stays concrete, never drifts into pseudo-profundo. One hairline risk: “map of scars is drawn not on skin, but on the silence between stars” flirts with aphorism, but context earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of intellectual combat and transmuting waiting into direction emerge through the fencing-metaphor continuum rather than explicit statement. The needle-card-as-overture motif returns in the final slip into pocket, reweighting its meaning from mystery to map. No tidy moral is pronounced; the resonance is quiet but intact. Still, the concept stays cerebral—lacks an emotional after-shock to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges concretely: a hollowed-out sonnet becomes a literal seedbed for insurrection, so “beauty from anarchy” is enacted, not declared. The luminous fracture reprises the earlier starlight slit, reweighting the same image from decay to promise—an earned conceptual repricing. No final moralizing; the last line’s quiet act keeps ambiguity. Counter-readings (is the molt escape or evasion?) linger without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: time can be shattered yet remain playable; music is the clock that can still tick in parallel worlds. The broken clock’s return as silent counterweight to the final note reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—his smile at “the stars wink,” an implied dare to deterministic sorrow. The steely longing never resolves into comfort; instead it lingers as charged poise, satisfying the 9+ test of a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from the accretion of images—binary blossoms, moth-map, golden petal—rather than any statement. The final question-mark hum reweights the premise: memory and fiction are indistinguishable, yet both must be believed. No moral is asserted; the reader is left inside the same luminous doubt that animates Kael.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: remembrance is not a wave but a tide that must be diffused, not dammed. The apology-color’s migration from pigment to leaf offers a resonant, non-moral answer. No abstract sermon—just the image of blue-green in needles—reweights the premise with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars—the butterfly’s dust, pulsar decay, water stains—without moralizing. The final line (“went inside to begin again”) offers a non-literal answer: understanding requires embracing noise, not purging it. Subtext operates in gesture (brushing dust as prayer) and image (moth scales vs. cosmic radiation), resisting tidy binaries. The central question—what deserves preservation?—is repriced conceptually when Elena accepts that pattern includes imperfection, and the cost (abandoning clinical distance) lingers without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as creative canvas, light as truth, pause as purpose. The vessel’s glow reweights prior motifs (stars, frost, glass) into a non-literal answer about legacy transcending violence. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from tactile acts (melting shard, tracing frost). Yet the “purpose in pauses” refrain edges toward abstraction, and the charcoal/glass duality isn’t fully interrogated—father’s furnace uses charcoal, yet glass opposes it thematically without tension, slightly flattening moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as fertile ground, not emptiness. The final image—“every frost pattern a melody”—reweights prior particulars without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (watching heat-signatures, striking forks silently) and avoids abstraction. Mara’s arc inextricably ties to the central question: Can absence hold meaning? The answer resonates non-literally through vibration, color, and shared breath, embracing complexity without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of duty and desire: peace cannot be given without forfeiting one’s own. The lighthouse lens reweights prior material—it shifts from navigation tool to soul-guidance mechanism, reframing the drowned city not as grave but as liminal harbor. Subtext operates through image and silence; no moralizing. The final resonance lies in the paradox that creating rest for others annihilates personal stillness—a non-literal answer to the question of whether compassion has limits.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as resistance, silence as solidarity. The bell shifts from anonymous signal to communal heartbeat, reweighting “sanctions” from material lack to cultural siege. Final image—the bell humming with tomorrow—offers non-literal answer: continuity outlasts policy. Avoids moralizing; resonance built through dates offered, rain-soaked tea shared, trembling voices. No false equivalence; exile pain is centered without redemption arc.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically through image and action: unused love isn’t wasted but preserved, waiting for release. The final reconfiguration—“It was not to find love, but to release it”—answers the central question non-literally, reweighting every prior spark and breath. Subtext thrives in gesture (hand extended, breath steadied) and avoids moralizing. The camera obscura metaphor integrates seamlessly, framing internal radiance as the true subject—earned wisdom arising from concrete ritual, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: time is not linear but fibrous, porous, layered—like bark, loam, mycelium. The ending offers a non-literal answer: to know time fully is to dissolve into it. No moralizing; resonance arises from Elara’s fading photograph blending with her great-grandfather’s. The garden becomes a vessel of surrendered memory, reweighting all prior images with poignant inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: resilience as rebellion against decay, hope as an act of defiance. The seed vault isn’t just metaphor—it’s literal stakes with tangible cost. The final image—kneeling to plant while chained—offers a non-literal answer to despair without moralizing. Recurring elements (arrow, chains, seeds) accrue meaning, and the carnival’s ghosts symbolize forgotten dreams now anchored in soil, avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as archive, absence as form. The central question—can lost trust be heard?—is answered not with moralizing but through the final image: “the quiet that comes after, pure and terrible and complete.” This reweights all prior motifs—vials of saline, mitotic cells, shipwrecks—as vessels of erased sound. Subtext thrives in negative space; the story trusts readers to infer Kael’s betrayal without exposition, making the conceptual cost (faith’s extinction) feel earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: theft reframed as translation, light as both lure and map. The final image—a portal opening within a painting—offers a non-literal answer to “What is a stolen moment?” without moralizing. Recurring elements (moonbeams, golden hour) shift from objects to metaphors of choice, yet the epiphany (“true art was not theft but translation”) borders on explicit. Still, ambiguity lingers in the conductor’s shared “luminous disbelief,” resisting tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges entirely through particulars: glass as vessel for fragility, the bookmark’s crack as entrance rather than flaw, the gauge’s frozen percentage. The ending offers a non-literal answer—space for asking matters more than answers—reweighting all prior images without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (Lena’s off-page death) and gesture (floating the bookmark), avoiding sentimentality. The central question (“Can grief be contained safely?”) is resolved not with certainty but with earned poise, inviting reflection without false comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: vulnerability as power is tested through phobias becoming tactical assets. The seashell’s whisper evolves from warning to lullaby, reweighting fear as guidance. Final image—Mira tracing smudged letters—offers non-literal answer: truth is fragile but protective. Avoids moralizing, though “circuits of strength” edges toward diagnostic phrasing; resonance stems from concrete objects and actions, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as archive, guide, and language. The final image—map as “constellation of quiet”—reweights every prior mention of hush, transforming emptiness into structure. No moralizing; insight arises from the oracle’s method and the traveler’s acceptance. The story resists binaries (sound/silence, light/dark), instead showing silence as dense with memory. Resonance stems from concrete particulars—gold leaf, pebbles, flaking booklet—not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the ice violin’s filaments mirroring circuitry, looped snowflakes as recursive cognition. The ending offers non-literal resolution—thought as endless formation, not locatable source—via the broom’s “deliberate act” and lingering “echo.” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (is consciousness simulation or resonance?) without confusion. Central question (“where do thoughts come from?”) is reframed through action, not assertion, making wisdom earned through temporal amalgamation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—transparency as liberation—emerges through the lens motif and Elara’s quiet diligence. The final image of prisms and resonant hush offers a non-literal answer: truth refracts into harmony. However, lines like “trust would remain” and “transparency could free even the quietest registrar” veer toward moralizing summary. Subtext is diluted by explicit statements that replace ambiguity with assurance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: true luck resides in ritualized attention, not quantification. The final image—marbles gleaming like constellations while fireflies echo their light—offers a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting “luck” as relational fidelity. Subtext thrives in gesture (polishing as commemoration) and silence (the garden’s rustle echoing breath). Avoids moralizing; instead, the heirs’ proposal to link the gauge to soil shows thematic evolution without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: time as frost, not river; truth as magnetic whisper, not data point. The ending offers a non-literal answer—sideways time is real but fragile, witnessed only in liminal stillness—and reweights all prior imagery without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence (Kael’s unspoken reply to Chen) and gesture (slow lever release). Complexity is embraced: science dismisses ghosts, yet ghosts are the shape of reality. No platitudes; insight arises from concrete acts—fixing a stabilizer, aligning grids, holding warmth against cold metal.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: art persists not through preservation but through reinterpretation; silence speaks when listened to rightly. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the unfinished aria will be composed anew—reweighting decay as generative. No moralizing; resonance arises from the cello’s voice filling “hush of unstruck chords” and the in between spaces singing “for themselves.” Subtext lives in water stains, bow strokes, and dissolving paper—never stated, always embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: truth’s weight isn’t mass but the silence it breeds, resolved through forgiveness as release. The aurora’s sorrow shifts from external lament to internal peace, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Final image—the illustration resting in the margin—offers non-literal answer: some truths belong in liminal spaces, not scales. Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in concrete objects and professional context.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme—silence heavier than fire or guilt—emerges organically from the valve wheel’s transformation from talisman to ledger to relic. Subtext operates through image and silence: hollow-eyed ghosts, clicking beads as rosary substitutes, radio hysteria as modern echo of confession. The ending offers a non-literal answer: truth’s weight is measurable only when released, not hoarded. No moralizing; resonance arises from the final reweighting—“silence was heavier than fire… In the hush after confession, Elias had found the weight and released it.”

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: witnessing as preservation, decay as natural rhythm. The final image—the swan floating into the drift—reweights all prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and object; the candle in ink, crumbling peace, and paper-thin boundaries avoid allegory while resonating with quiet inevitability. No thesis is declared; insight arises from the Keeper’s embodied journey, fulfilling the lyric mode’s promise.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the baby curl, eclipse, and lullaby coalesce into a non-literal answer—wonder endures as shared resonance, not individual memory. No moralizing; insight arises from Eleanor whispering Mira’s mother’s name, reweighting lineage and care. Subtext thrives in silence (Eleanor’s “thread of breath”) and gesture (foreheads nearly touching). Final image avoids binaries, embracing mystery (“connections deeper than consciousness”) with emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of memory, loss, and material witness: when minds can no longer dream, walls must remember. The tapestry’s dragons shift from decorative relic to vessel of collective subconscious, reweighting all prior imagery. The ending offers no moral but a resonant CR—dreams didn’t vanish; they migrated—and invites reflection on how culture survives catastrophe. Avoids abstraction by grounding theme in Elias’s tactile labor and the diaries’ scorched fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: open secrets, prophetic accidents, and orchestration coalesce into a meditation on agency versus fate. The final image—Mei Lin watching the beam “directing flow”—offers a non-literal answer: control lies not in prediction but in composition. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Will her power corrupt? Will the island protect her?). The shell’s microdot map reweights earlier motifs, making theme inseparable from plot.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of silence, assumption, and faith—not as stated thesis but as lived paradox. The central question (“sound of a bell never rung”) reframes prayer as co-creation rather than petition. Final image reweights all prior stillness: true quiet isn’t absence but active, questioning presence. No moralizing; resonance accrues through Miriam’s brushstrokes and the pedal’s blinking red eye.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as fertile ground for music, memory as score, presence as reconciliation of past and future. The ending offers a non-literal answer—symphonies exist in “quiet spaces between the stars”—that reweights the premise without moralizing. Recurring images (spiral, mirror, hush) accrue meaning, and the final line avoids sentimentality by grounding transcendence in cosmic scale. No explicit thesis statement mars the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of identity, memory, and recursion. The ending offers a non-literal answer: conquest is surrender; the self is not a center but endless corridors. No moralizing—resonance arises through concrete images (tablet crumbling, viaduct dimming). Ambiguity lingers (“darkness was not absolute”) without confusion, inviting reflection on eternity, choice, and architecture of being.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: silence isn’t absence but potential space where feeling can be reborn. The “filament of hush” reweights prior material—not as void but as medium. Final image (teaching via vibration) offers non-literal answer: deafness as bridge, not barrier. No moralizing; resonance built through concrete acts (needle → drum → students).

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of integrity vs. institutional concealment emerges organically through meteorological precision and clandestine transmission. The recurring storm motif reweights at closure: rain “washes away dust of doubt,” linking weather to moral clarity. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from concrete acts (recording, sending). Yet the quarantine-as-laboratory idea remains underexplored, leaning on implication over dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: grief as love with nowhere to grow, memory as molecular archive, extinction as pauseable. The final line—“tears weren’t weakness but exhalation, a way for the dead to breathe through the living”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext thrives in objects: the vial’s inscription (“Let them breathe again”) reframes preservation as communal mourning. No platitudes; wisdom arises from concrete particulars like salt trails catching violet light.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of rope, stone, and starlight: time is braided, not linear, and meaning resides in the frays. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—“every fray is a door, every knot a home”—that reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext operates through gesture (brushing fibers, trailing rope) and silence (the energy beings’ absence). However, the phrase “ethically playful” borders on label-speak, slightly undercutting the earned wisdom derived from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty resides in incompleteness, and healing arises from listening rather than fixing. The final image—the bowl filled with fire’s echo—offers a non-literal answer to silence without moralizing. Recurring motifs (bowl, fire, unfinished symphony) accumulate meaning and reconfigure at closure. Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in tactile ritual, though the “world reborn” phrasing edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the counterfeit trade: empathy as consumable, truth as half-measure, connection as static hum. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing—the dealer’s “faint hum” suggests residue may linger, complicating the transactional frame. Subtext thrives in objects (blotter petal as fragile bridge) and sensory detail (amber liquid climbing like hope). Avoids sentimentality by anchoring insight in craft, not catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the locket and harbor workers, avoiding overt moralizing—until the final paragraph, which veers into abstraction (“cycles of compassion were as endless as the tide”). That line triggers a −0.6 penalty for thematic echo in closing. Prior to that, subtext thrives in silence, photos, and unspoken labor. The “Harbor Heart” award reweights the premise, but the epiphany feels preordained, not wrestled from complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—kinship as active dedication to another’s ghosts, not passive inheritance—emerges through concrete particulars: reed sculptures, unreadable shadows, the spiral tag meaning “belonging-in-difference.” Subtext operates in silence (villagers’ offerings, untranslatable tears) and gesture (forehead press). Final image offers non-literal answer: Kael’s reflection fused with seekers in the arbor’s glass reweights “community” from bloodline to shared search. No moralizing; resonance arises from the reed effigy becoming “the first word in a new language of belonging.”

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: to preserve ephemera is to become it. The final image—Elara as living echo, folio pages blank but marked with infinity—offers a non-literal answer to “where echoes are born,” reweighting all prior sketches as premonitions. No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete particulars (petrified feather stylus, diamond-hard echoes). Complexity persists: preservation requires erasure of self, yet ensures continuity—a bittersweet repricing of legacy versus presence.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: love persists even when unmeasurable. The final image—a mosaic holding breath for the next seeker—answers the central question (“Can love be measured?”) non-literally, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the glass eyes’ accusatory blankness. Ambiguity lingers meaningfully, resisting tidy resolution while affirming buried optimism as lived practice, not sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—visibility as quiet witness, care as anonymous curation—emerges through concrete particulars: tape reels, loose baseboards, cached blankets. No moralizing; the final image reweights everything: the boy reading aloud makes Mara’s decades of tending meaningful, even if unacknowledged. Subtext thrives in silence: the reel carries a 1957 voice, but its value now is tactile weight, not sound—a metaphor for how presence lingers beyond utility. Ambiguity remains: will he look for her? Does it matter? Either outcome is kindness.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the linden leaf’s journey—from frayed survivor to pressed talisman—and the trellis’s transformation from rigid lattice to flexible cradle. Subtext operates in silence, gesture, and recurring images; no moralizing intrudes. The ending offers a non-literal answer: growth arises not from fixing but from yielding. However, “reluctant metamorphosis” occasionally drifts into label-speak (“slow unfurling”) without fully embodying the cost in action, slightly blunting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning isn’t extracted but co-created with place, time, and loss. The brooch, painting, and rain trails form a non-literal language of continuity. Final resonance lies in the ant seeming to move—not through statement but image—implying stories persist beyond individual hands. Avoids moralizing; instead, offers quiet awe as response to ruin, earned through concrete acts of seeing and making.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: the tension between control and surrender in magical practice, where “everyday wonder” requires embracing uncertainty. The final image—pearl singing “unpredictable” magic—reprices the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the pilgrim’s wordless departure) and paradox (“bright darkness”). No platitudes; insight arises from concrete particulars—the overlapping shadows, the humming pearl—not abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme—silence as meaningful speech—emerges through concrete particulars: the valve’s hollow resonance, mapped absences, bottled spray. No moralizing; insight arises from action (“she did not merely chronicle; she heartened”). Final image reweights all prior material: the harbor now holds “spaces between ships,” and the archivist’s work continues. Subtext thrives in gesture (placing valve in case) and implication (broken compass foreshadowing), avoiding binaries while affirming that loss can be navigated into meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme—mapping what’s erased rather than what’s present—emerges organically from Elara’s actions and the city’s hidden language, never stated outright. The fortress of unspoken truths reweights the premise: cartography as excavation of silence. Final image offers non-literal answer—she’ll map this place “after she learned to speak its language”—resisting moralizing while deepening the cost of voicelessness. Recurring motifs (punch, cracks, breath-clouds) accrue meaning without tokenism, tying personal regret to collective urban memory.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interweaving of whale song, starlight, and memory—no moralizing. The central question (“Can grief be held in beauty?”) is answered non-literally by the mural’s fusion of personal loss and natural cycles. Subtext thrives in silence: the fisherman’s widened eyes, Lira’s softened skepticism. Final image reweights everything: the tower’s open heart “listening” reframes observation as communal care, not solitary science.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the amulet’s hunger, the escondite’s refractions, quantum thank-you notes in plasma spin. No moralizing—insight arises through action (“weaving death’s memory into lifeless perfection”) and image (“boredom shattering into a thousand unanswerable questions”). The ending offers a non-literal answer: goodbye is a door immortals are too heavy to open, and release lies in embracing ignorance. Subtext operates through gesture (pressing fragment to crystal) and implication (mutiny as fellow prisoner), resisting tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: embalming fluid liquefying tissue becomes a metaphor for dissolving moral absolutes, the ink pot’s cracks map necessary fractures in truth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—fairness resides in equivalency, not honesty—and reweights every prior image without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the unspoken ledger exchange) and gesture (handing over photocopies instead of demanding confession). Complexity is embraced: survival demands deception, yet Sam’s integrity persists through ethical algebra, not purity.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of light, sound, and texture—history as fragile, luminous fabrication rather than fixed record. The final image (gold leaf scattering into mosaic, bonsai breathing as library) offers a non-literal answer: memory persists through artifice when truth vanishes. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether these invented histories redeem or merely decorate loss. The stationer’s quiet defiance reweights silence from void to canvas, achieving Conceptual Repricing with emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through particulars: burlap vs. silk gives way to salt-on-skin as the true texture of memory. The final insight—that meaning lives in the spaces between fragments—reweights prior material without moralizing. Erased histories “concentrate, they poison, they wait” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in layered paper scraps and tidal rhythms, avoiding prompt-like thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, resonance, and belief—not stated but enacted through the cello’s hum, the shell’s vibration, the cracked compass. The ending offers a non-literal answer: truth is participatory, endings are reader-made. No moralizing; the insight arises from concrete particulars (painted shell, unfinished cello). Subtext thrives in gaps—between notes, pages, memory and presence—and the final line (“closed its pages with a whisper”) reweights all prior silence as fertile, not final.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and adaptation, crystallized in the phoenix mural: resistance isn’t about halting change but redirecting it through communal memory (stone chip) and coded solidarity. The final image reweights “privatization” not as inevitable progress but as cultural erasure, answered by decentralized, child-carried knowledge. Avoids moralizing; subtext lives in paint smells (“turpentine and hope”) and unreadable corporate logos.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the space age’s tools preserve memory but not life, echoing human attempts to outlast impermanence. Final image—the stored photo versus the vanished bloom—offers non-literal answer: preservation is archival, not salvific. Subtext thrives in silence, glimmers, and chemical light; no moralizing intrudes. The “dawning hush” reframes progress as elegy, resisting tidy binaries between technology and nature.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: true orientation arises not from sight but from attentive interpretation of distortion. This is never stated outright but demonstrated through Miren’s praxis—bubbles bending light into maps, fractured crystals scattering compass points. The final image reweights the premise: Kael sees a rainbow on his face while Miren “sees everything” through machine grace. No moralizing; resonance accrues through specificity—the mercury basin, the drone’s harmonic wings—making abstraction feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: beginnings hide in endings, sources in absences, knowledge in listening. The central question—“Where do rivers begin?”—is answered non-literally in the final image: they begin where water remembers itself, and the cartographer must dissolve into that memory. Subtext thrives in silence—the falcon brings no message, the feather speaks through placement, the ice whispers in seven tongues. No moralizing; resonance arises from the phrasebook’s worn page and Kael’s palm matching the glass pattern, making translation an act of embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of sound, memory, and entropy—resurrection not through force but faithful repetition. The final image reweights the premise: silence isn’t absence but potential, and footsteps are architecture. No moralizing; insight arises from cobblestones shifting “millimeter by millimeter.” Subtext thrives in vibrations rather than words, echoing Kael’s cryptic nature without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: some truths can only be captured by becoming stillness itself. The final image—Lira’s transmission as a “perfect sphere of quiet”—reweights all prior action without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (pouring perfume into stone) and absence (the empty vial as monument). The story resists tidy resolution; revelation demands erasure, making the ephemeral eternal only through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: truth as active carving, silence as earned labor, legacy as weight to be transmuted. The ending offers a non-literal answer—hush becomes “the lighthouse’s breath,” an eternal, living quiet—reweighting the premise without moralizing. Recurring images (copperlight, lattice, scuffs) accrue meaning, culminating in the lattice as “relic of confessions” sustaining impossibility. Ambiguity lingers (What of the bodies? Who will read the tale?), resisting tidy resolution while affirming the son’s hard-won agency.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: love as both poison and cure, debt as generative burden. The final image—fruits bearing “sweet bitterness”—offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. Recurring spiral motifs shift from “lost souls” to starlight threads, reweighting memory as nourishment. Ambiguity lingers (Is the debt truly repaid? Whose love was lost?), resisting tidy binaries while anchoring in concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—ruin transformed into reverence through art and attention—emerges organically from Elara’s actions, not assertion. The silver thread reweights the labyrinth from prison to pathway; orchids symbolize fragile renewal without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal answer: solace isn’t restoration but reconfiguration. Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in physical labor (weaving) and geological time, though “orchid solace” risks lyrical abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically: interrupted journeys resume not through grand acts but quiet reassembly of broken timepieces. The sundial’s restoration offers a non-literal answer—wholeness is possible even when fractures remain visible. Subtext thrives in images: roots as storytellers, bones as bookmarks, shadow as legacy. No moralizing; resonance accrues through the final whisper of return, implying continuity beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: chalk codes, wax seals, and muscle memory argue that humanity persists in overlooked spaces. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing—the spiral galaxy translating to “wait for my signal” becomes a non-literal answer about hope’s fragility. Subtext thrives in silence (Mira’s weary smile) and objects (anonymous wax seal). Resists binaries: the Collective isn’t evil, just oblivious to analog truth’s value.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: unheard stories as cosmic resistance, wisdom disguised as folly, silence as fertile ground for truth. The final image—Mira walking with the candle, promising stars their stories won’t fade—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of who gets to speak. Subtext thrives in gesture (folding the tapestry, stepping into corridors) and avoids moralizing. However, the “conspiracy” remains abstract; thematic weight leans heavily on metaphor without grounding in human betrayal that would deepen moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through particulars: unsent letters, moonlit stone, singing spirits—all accrue meaning without moralizing. The central question (“Can silence be undone?”) is answered non-literally: the apology lives not in speech but in communal witness and natural cycles. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture (Mira’s breath on glass), and the shard’s transformation. Final line reweights everything: “fierce and tender, forever” reframes grief as enduring song, not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—translation as bearing unspeakable weight between fractured selves—emerges organically through coral (memory), cast (absence), and cipher (love). The ending offers no moral but a resonant reconfiguration: shared anxiety isn’t erasure but connective tissue (“I kept your number too”). Subtext thrives in negative space—the stick figure’s too-many arms, the apartment code—inviting reflection without sentimentality. Complexity is preserved: Kael’s choice to leave was both failure and necessity, and forgiveness is “indifferent and therefore kind,” not redemptive.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: joy as communal, resurrected memory, not private nostalgia. The final image—child reaching for ghostly apples, fog carrying blossom scent—answers the central question non-literally: art bridges time through shared witness. Avoids moralizing; instead, “pensive mirth” and “woven light” embody complexity. Recurring elements (film shard, fresco, fog) accrue meaning without forced symbolism, though the epiphany leans slightly toward neat resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from action: restoration as bewitchment of wonder, not pigment fidelity. The nested mirrors and questioning text reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence—the “pause between question and reply” becomes a charged space where curiosity manifests visibly. Final image offers non-literal answer: true restoration is soul-deep, achieved through echo and inquiry. Avoids pseudo-profundity by grounding insight in concrete ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of botany, surveillance, and language: cognition as wild growth versus state-controlled commodity. The final image—a seed rattling with “the sound of freedom”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in coded dialogue (“aphids are candid”) and the very structure of resistance through pollination. No overt allegory; the Cant Club feels like a plausible, grounded response to oppression, making the critique of thought commodification feel urgent and human.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: sorrow transformed into beauty through persistent, quiet action. The galaxy postcard’s enigmatic line evolves from cryptic message to lived treaty, reweighting “blossom armistice” from metaphor to ecology. Final image—reef-shadow joy flickering with memory yet choosing to shine—offers a non-literal answer to whether pain can feed light. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the armistice’s fragility, resisting tidy resolution while affirming poetic resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from recurring images—the cracked chime, glass orchids, foxglove regret—culminating in a resonant CR: beauty resides in imperfection, and preservation is noble despite futility. The final image reweights all prior motifs without moralizing; the insight arises from action, not exposition. Subtext thrives in silence and fracture, avoiding sentimentality. Yet the theme borders on familiar (“memory is fragile”) without a truly non-obvious inflection, slightly limiting its profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of language, trust, and consequence: truth requires not just words but shared vulnerability. The ending offers a non-literal answer—“a living language between them that would survive even as their professional paths diverged”—reweighting the premise that binding magic is less powerful than mutual grammar. Recurring motifs (ink well, symphonies) shift meaning: the empty vessel becomes proof “that even extinct things could learn to sing again.” No moralizing; resonance arises from Kess’s glyph (“understood/accepted”) and their laughter amid sealing wax.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: “encrypted compassion” is not stated until mid-story and then reframed as “shared heartbeat,” avoiding moralizing. The final image—amphitheater singing with water and whispered history—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: change can be measured, merciful, and communal. Recurrence of the chain and mountain’s breath accumulates meaning without redundancy, resisting binary resolution while affirming integration over erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as fragile, living transmission rather than static record. The recurring motifs—dust, paper, wings—shift from symbols of loss to vessels of continuity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: songs survive not in preservation but in flight. Avoids moralizing, though the lyric density occasionally borders on abstraction without grounding in concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: corn mazes, weather codes, wood grain—all refract the core question of sacred space. The ending offers a non-literal answer: thresholds are sacred not by magic but by the intentionality of distance traveled. No moralizing; insight arises from tactile experience. Recurring images reweight meaning (logbook shifts from riddle to guide), and ambiguity lingers in the “fractured hush”—haunting yet whole. This is earned wisdom, not platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from Iyana’s quest: belonging as resonance, not location. The feather’s projections and bacterial “fireflies” refract this idea visually, culminating in the CR that the city’s people “transformed into water, stone, living light.” No moralizing—the insight arises from concrete particulars (charred barbs, sternum-pressed heartbeat). Final image reweights everything: her dissolution isn’t death but homecoming, offering a non-literal answer to exile through waveform unity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete actions: gathering foam, planting seeds, assembling glass. The final image—footprints leading “nowhere and everywhere”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: disappearance is not loss but integration. Subtext thrives in paradox (“cheerful gloom,” “sweet sorrow”) without moralizing. The sea’s generosity reframes forgetting as participation in a living archive, avoiding binary resolution while honoring complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through action: creativity as rebellion against entropy, wonder as engineered rather than accidental. The recurring bishop shifts from tool to talisman, its diagonal logic echoing in human connections. No moralizing—insights arise from concrete particulars (a quarter, a dropped piece, a rebooted game). The ending reweights the premise: randomness can be ordered, but only through relentless, self-interested artistry. Ambiguity lingers (Is this control or surrender to pattern?), resisting tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as tidal, cyclical, and inscribed on flesh. The cosmic verse on mortal skin reweights nostalgia from sentiment to sacred duty. Final image—dancing with starlight ink—answers the central question non-literally: beauty persists in exile. Avoids moralizing, though near-repetition of “cosmic verse” edges toward thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—mundanity as prism—emerges organically through glass, water, and light imagery, culminating in the final reweighting: ordinary surfaces hold extraordinary depths. Subtext thrives in silence, ripples, and flawed panes. No moralizing; wisdom arises from the pond’s rings. The glazier’s arc embodies the theme without stating it, though the “noctilucent reckonings” flirt with pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the blue willow pattern fractured by heat, charred button, stone circle—never stated as “grief” or “redemption.” The ending offers non-literal resolution: the box is “empty but full,” cracks become “syllables” in a universal language. Subtext thrives in silence—the wind carries ash, stars witness, no moralizing. Complexity endures: survival *is* betrayal, yet also duty; enlightenment is living inside questions, not answering them.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: hope is quantifiable but requires resonance, not force. The mandala’s spiral equation replaces abstract optimism with patterned persistence. Final image—Kael asleep while tide rewrites equations—offers non-literal answer: renewal is cyclical, fragile, and self-generating once seeded. No moralizing; subtext thrives in calcium carbonate and brass gauges.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: legacy isn’t passive inheritance but active reclamation. The film strip’s equation becomes “seed crystal,” reweighting prior despair into potential. Subtext thrives in margins—shadow-writing, half-burned pages—avoiding moralizing. Final line (“Remember, but act”) offers non-literal answer to the central question without stating a thesis. However, slight redundancy in phrasing (“legacy’s burden” appears four times) edges toward thematic echo, preventing 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: mirrors reflect only what is, but can be coaxed to reveal what could be—if infused with borrowed life and coded hope. The recurring lullaby, sung unknowingly by children afterward, suggests possibility persists beyond the painter’s visit. No moralizing; resonance arises through the mirrors’ “faint glimmer” and the parapet’s silent witness. The ending reweights the premise—not all change is permanent, but even fleeting visions alter perception—and avoids binary resolutions, embracing ambiguity with emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: redemption requires shared risk, not solitary sacrifice. The “flawed beauty” motif—imperfect signatures, enduring scars—resonates without moralizing. Final lines reweight the premise: peace isn’t celestial decree but “courage to trust… even when stars seem indifferent.” However, the phrase “anchor ideals in practice” edges close to abstract thesis, slightly diluting subtextual purity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of preservation and destruction, crystallized in “fractured grace”—a phrase that avoids moralizing by anchoring ambiguity in concrete images (cracks, salt, echo). The final museum display offers a non-literal answer: humanity inherits curated beauty while erasing systemic violence. Subtext operates through silence (villagers’ absence), institutional whitewashing (press releases), and the rain-washed flat—resisting binaries by showing how Vesper’s sentimentality coexists with ruthlessness. No thematic echo or sermonizing; resonance arises solely from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—resistance through artful authenticity—emerges via concrete particulars: bodily poetry, tangled echoes, snowflake individuality. Subtext thrives in gestures (arms weaving air) and silence (between sigh and smile). The ending offers a non-literal answer: liberation isn’t seized but released through disciplined attention. Avoids moralizing; resonance arises from the tapestry of voices Elara’s dance unleashes, reweighting conformity as fragile, not inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from Adrian’s subversive method: stories erase as much as they reveal, and ethical storytelling exposes those erasures. The backward narratives strip justification, leaving only choice—a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (paper silhouettes moving through time’s wrong direction). The final meteor (or story?) embodies ambiguity that lingers without confusion, resisting tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the moth wing, silver hair, and dissolving ladders embody the tension between preservation and transience. The ending offers a non-literal answer—memory persists through shaped absence, not monuments—repricing the premise that honoring loss requires ephemerality. Subtext thrives in silence (the unsung frequency, the monarch’s unnamed draw) and avoids moralizing. Complexity endures: Esme’s act is both futile and necessary, embracing ambiguity without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme—memory as living resonance, not static artifact—emerges through concrete particulars: wax voids becoming bells, holes in cards becoming voices. The ending offers a non-literal answer: true preservation lies in casting memory into forms that “would never crack” by accepting fragility. No moralizing; subtext thrives in images (“absence defines form,” “rope’s glow remained”). Complexity endures: names are saved, but the glacier still threatens, and the aurora may fall silent—wisdom is earned, not absolute.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation must yield to transcendence. The laughing fox—a “precisely playful” joke from empire-builders—reweights at closure when Mara drops it, rejecting predetermined paths. Final image offers non-literal answer: becoming wilderness itself transcends foresight-through-hindsight. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete actions (breaking seal, climbing vines, stepping forward).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: frugality vs. empire, pattern vs. power, silence vs. devotion. The ending reweights everything—not gods but “cosmic indifference” is the true interlocutor, and “patterns persist when regimes fall” is shown, not stated. Final image—scribbled papyri outliving astronomy—resonates without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gaps: priests sell brass for bread; Kael needs only chalk. No thematic echo; insight arises from grid alignments, not epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the pin’s transformation—from broken artifact to whole conduit to broken again—answering the central question: Can memory be held without being imprisoned by it? The ending offers a non-literal resolution: release isn’t forgetting but allowing memory to shift forms as “grace demands.” No moralizing; insight arises from concrete action (pressing the pin into Elara’s palm). Complexity is preserved—resentment isn’t erased but “understood as a cage she had chosen”—avoiding false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—erasing boundaries between dreamer/dream, artisan/art—emerges through concrete actions, not assertion. The sextant’s transformation from navigation tool to dream vessel reframes the central question: Can loss be reclaimed through surrender? Final image offers non-literal answer: yes, but only by becoming the place where dream anchors. No moralizing; resonance arises from starlight sap and glass spires, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the ribbon’s shift from binding to bandage reweights “vows” as living, not rigid. Subtext thrives in silence (daughter’s sketchbook, shared climb down) and charged objects (locket’s leaf vs. fresh orchard growth). Avoids moralizing; wisdom is “accidental” because it arises from failed intent, not doctrine. Final line (“cathedral... never again stood silent”) offers non-literal answer: repair requires reciprocity, not perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically: remembrance as cosmic duty, knowledge as grief. The final image—Evers biting the dual-hued fruit—offers a non-literal answer to “What lies beneath?”: not a place but a temporal memorial for dead universes. Subtext operates through gesture (pressing shell to forehead) and silence (trees absorbing the sigil), avoiding moralizing. The pistachio shell’s transformation from blank to charged object reweights all prior acts of tending as elegy, embracing complexity without false equivalence—some truths are worth the disquiet.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge resides in absence, and listening between lines transforms silence into song. The final image—Elara closing the now-complete diary while the mountain “sang a little louder”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gaps, omissions, and mute chords; the library’s unmarked books embody unlearned lessons as potential, not deficiency. No platitudes; wisdom is earned through concrete acts of interpretation and collaboration.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: identity as mutable, fragmented, and co-constituted through story. The garden’s flickering names reject fixed selfhood, and Mira’s acceptance reframes solace not as ignition but integration. No moralizing—insight arises from touching blossoms, not exposition. Final image (emerald card glowing, ship carrying her forward) offers non-literal answer: hope persists in brokenness. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the moving script that “seemed to move in the corner of her eye.”

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of archival silence and woven record—“clarity in acknowledging what had been missing, and why.” The final image (the seal “warm as living skin”) offers a non-literal answer: truth isn’t fixed but completed through courageous integration of absence. Avoids moralizing; instead, subtext lives in objects (rope as historiography) and sensory details (humming fiber). Ambiguity lingers—what other absences remain?—without confusion, honoring complexity over tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as active presence, not void, reweighted through the “bloom” metaphor that shifts from legend to lived experience. The final lines (“silence was not the absence of sound, but its own presence”) avoid moralizing by grounding insight in concrete action—the stone’s dimming, the maps’ glow. Subtext thrives in gesture (tracing cracks, pressing stone to ear) rather than exposition. Ambiguity lingers: will tuning temper the storm, or merely offer temporary refuge?

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from object and action: broken glass refracting silence into light becomes a non-literal answer to randomness. Subtext thrives in paradox (“shard of hush,” “silence gave it voice”). Final lines avoid moralizing; instead, “precise geometry of repair” reweights all prior fragments as intentional. The travelers’ convergence suggests collective meaning-making, resisting tidy individualism while honoring ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: memory’s fluidity versus solidity is tested through shadow measurements and crystal whispers, not stated. The journal’s line—“gardeners of relevance”—resonates without moralizing, and her final question (“am I still myself...?”) lingers ambiguously. Subtext thrives in silence (“deepening hush... held more truth than any whisper”), and the CR ending reweights all prior fragments as necessary impermanence. No platitudes; wisdom arises from specific acts of listening and measurement.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: hope as defiant, playful creation against void-like despair. The mosaic note becoming a “melody” and fire as “serious playfulness” avoids moralizing, instead offering resonance through image. Final line (“her heart a kerosene rag knot ready to ignite hope”) risks near-thematic echo but stops short of declaration. Ambiguity lingers—will next fortress respond?—yet the core question (can light be kindled in absolute dark?) receives a non-literal, image-based answer.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from tidal metaphors and cicada symbolism without moralizing: transition is not disruption but continuous flow, and truth persists like grotto stone amid shifting tides. The final image—jade cicada warm against skin as time settles into memory grooves—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to impermanence. Subtext thrives in silence and peripheral vision; no thesis is articulated, only embodied. Complexity is preserved—departure is loss, yet return remains possible.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as both prison and garden, confinement as preservation. The doll’s evolution—from comfort object to compass—reweights “gilded hush” without moralizing.

Subtext thrives in tactile metaphors (“silvery threads,” “flavors”), avoiding abstraction or sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as presence, not absence. No moralizing; insight arises through the vial’s transformation—from jagged discomfort to settled spirals—and the diplomat’s silent weeping. Final image reweights all prior material: the storm glass, once a personal talisman, becomes a shared language of calm. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld—Kael never explains, only demonstrates—and the prismatic tears refract theme without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: empire’s future is renewal, not reclamation—a non-literal answer crystallized when murals rewrite themselves to show “return.” Subtext thrives in objects (ruby flake as legacy, not power) and actions (placing it in the crown-slot). No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars like fruit containing “fragments of tomorrow.” Final image reweights all prior decay into hope without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: breath as bridge, ash as residue of loss, shadows as preserved memory. The final image—ring glinting in ash—offers a non-literal answer: resilience isn’t erasing loss but forging connection from its remnants. Subtext thrives in silence (linked scars, shared rhythm) and avoids moralizing; the keeper’s epiphany (“shadows are the only breaths...”) feels earned through action, not assertion. Ambiguity lingers (will he return? can thresholds be rebuilt?) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: broken promises can be reforged through virtuous risk. The “shadowseam wonder” final image reweights pyramid schemes (vapor promises) against fungal alchemy (stone promises) without moralizing. Recurring threads—mushrooms as seam-stitchers, pressure as transformative—gain meaning through action, not assertion. Avoids tidy binaries; Kael’s mischief carries ethical ambiguity, yet the communal payoff feels earned, not sanctimonious.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as eloquent language, memory as active preservation. The final image—“truth sang, a final note in the bridge of intuition”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Recurring motifs (golden shadows, crank handle) accrue meaning without forced symbolism. However, the phrase “bridge of intuition” edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting the otherwise concrete resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—possibility as both liberation and binding duty—emerges organically from the marionette metaphor and alchemical logic. The ending offers a non-literal answer: Aldric achieves connection only by becoming part of the mechanism that generates worlds, reweighting his initial withdrawal. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete images (coiled strings, swelling fruit) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from dust-as-archive and the button-as-kindness, resisting moralizing. The final image—Marianne placing the daughter’s letter in the file—offers a non-literal answer: history’s value lies not in solving mysteries but in honoring gestures. Subtext operates through silence (no note with the button) and implication (James Dwyer’s possible paternity). Ambiguity lingers without confusion, and the story refuses tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: erasure vs. persistence, indifference vs. care. The final image—reflections dancing like maps—offers a non-literal answer: truth survives in coded, fluid forms. No moralizing; resonance arises from the key’s reuse, the crystal’s passage, the lagoon’s stubborn gold. Subtext thrives in silence: the System marks her erased, but the underground network flickers back to life.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as active force, memory as fragile code, prophecy as light-pattern. Subtext lives in image—dewdrops as lenses, saxophone as conduit for absence. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing: some silences are “forever vested.” However, the theme risks abstraction; emotional specificity occasionally yields to decorative lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—memory as seed, forgetting as ash—emerges organically through ritual, not statement. The final tapestry reweights the premise: blooming requires feeding memory with moonlight. Ambiguity lingers (whose voices? what past?), avoiding moralizing. But the insight borders on familiar eco-mythic tropes; originality tempers resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through particulars: gears, water, ash, and leaves accrue meaning without moralizing. The final insight—“some clocks were never meant to be fully mended—only lived within”—reweights all prior repair work as futile control, offering a non-literal answer to the central question of how to navigate time. Subtext thrives in contrasts (order/chaos, certainty/uncertainty) and avoids binaries; Elara’s wisdom is earned through failure, not platitude. No thematic echo or sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from kintsugi logic applied to language and loss: breaks don’t need filling but strengthening to hold what spilled. The final image—golden cracks painted by dawn—resonates without moralizing, reweighting every prior mention of names, balance, and absence. Subtext thrives in gesture (thumb on coin cracks) and silence (no dialogue). Avoids false equivalence; Elara’s failure is real, yet transformed into witness rather than rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the misaligned harp, the crocodile’s tooth remembering “finality,” laughter as a wound. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—“healing wasn’t about restoring what was lost, but integrating the broken pieces”—that reweights every prior image without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the quieted confessions) and object (vial and tooth clicking). Complexity is preserved: joy survives death but is irrevocably changed, and the collector must be collected too.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from Elena’s struggle: mercy as variable, not constant; survival as language of grace. Subtext lives in objects—the strap (instrument of pain turned talisman), UV light (torture tool turned measurement)—not exposition. The ending offers a non-literal answer: mercy is breath, footfall, heartbeat—not a ratio. However, the phrase “mathematics of mercy” borders on prompt-like abstraction, slightly undercutting resonance despite strong particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from object and action: memory as fragile yet persistent glass, history as light awaiting new keepers. Subtext operates through silence—the scrubbed name, the unspoken grandmother’s story—and the journal’s marginal note (“The light never dies”) avoids moralizing by embedding insight in character voice. The ending reweights the premise without stating it: truth resides not in monuments but in transient, human acts of remembrance. Ambiguity lingers (Will the reefs be charted?), resisting tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: ordinary cruelty hides in architectural neglect, and bearing witness is the only restitution. The mainspring—a mechanism of timekeeping—becomes a vessel for stolen wages, reweighting “time” from abstract to exploited labor. Final image (“silenced mechanisms of ordinary cruelty”) offers non-literal answer to Marlon’s lifelong question without moralizing. Subtext operates through silence (ghosts never speak), gesture (ringmaster’s trembling finger), and object (springs engraved with names), avoiding allegory while sustaining ambiguity about justice.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme—meaning as fragile, human-made structure in a fluid cosmos—emerges through concrete particulars: movable type, frost-script, perforated pages. The ending offers a non-literal answer: eternity compressed not into possession but into shared, recurring inscription (“waiting for someone cryptic enough to read it”). No moralizing; resonance arises from the final word “Here,” which reweights all prior acts as both loss and legacy. Ambiguity lingers (who will read next?) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from object and action: truth persists in fragments, and silence can be acknowledgment rather than erasure. The final image—a covered mirror holding a poem—offers a non-literal answer to whether history can be reclaimed. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Voss accepts but cannot embrace the truth). The shard’s inscription reweights the empire’s legacy without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through mechanics: truth as anti-corrosive, honesty as restoration. The final image—music box playing an endless truthful tune—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gestures (whispering gear names) and the covenant’s defeat via “truth burning through lies.” Complexity persists: the repairman’s flaw birthed his purpose, avoiding tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: petrichor, compass, lagoon converge to argue that mystery outweighs data. The ending reweights the valley’s “true resource” not through assertion but via Mira’s offering—a circle of remembered rain that makes answers irrelevant. Subtext thrives in silence (resonant hush) and refusal (Earned Stasis), avoiding moralizing. Final image of broken windows “framing a sky that had finally learned to hold its rain” offers non-literal closure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the fusion of driftwood, stone, turbine, and lantern—simplicity as vessel for complexity. The ending offers a non-literal answer: presence, not mastery, scaffolds understanding. No moralizing; resonance arises from the carved line fitting the niche “as if the stone had waited.” Subtext thrives in silence—the distinction between Mara and her great-grandmother dissolving—and avoids binaries or sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically through image and action: the night-blooming flower as metaphor for art made in obscurity, for unseen witnesses. The final mural answers the central question non-literally—petals as “notes of umbral tenderness”—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence: visitors feel “quiet reverence,” postcards become communal offerings. The insight that darkness is an “invitation” reweights the premise with poetic precision, avoiding sentimentality while embracing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through action: truth isn’t monolithic but negotiated, requiring nuance (“villains and victims sometimes wore the same uniform”). The final image—descendants recognizing ancestral symbols in childhood playthings—offers resonant, non-literal answer to “How do we remember without repeating?” No moralizing; complexity is baked into Maria’s testimony and the grandfather’s reluctant whistleblowing. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid: the burned bodies, scattered ash.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object, action, and setting: memory as generative rather than restorative. The amber bottle’s sealed nature becomes a non-literal answer to the central question—some doors must stay closed so others may open—reweighting every prior image without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the vanished townsfolk) and gesture (Kael placing the bottle at water’s edge). Final paragraph avoids sermonizing; resonance arises from the lanterns’ persistent glow as lived practice, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—how silence holds emotional resonance—emerges through concrete particulars: wax shavings, root veins, ripples, hums. The ending offers a non-literal answer: prophecy as diagnostic map, not warning. Subtext thrives in gesture (cradling the spindle like a heartbeat) and image (leaf veins mirroring sound waves). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether this knowledge heals or haunts, but the cost of bearing it is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from action: wild serenity as the pulse of existence, fierce yet calm, is embodied in the hatchling, the vortex, and Elara’s resolve. The final image—a cradle of renewal under starlight—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: borrowed time’s texture is possibility, sustained through care. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars. Recurring motifs (acorn cap, seeds, frost) reweight meaning without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically: true warning lies in discernment, not noise. Subtext thrives in silence—the unused switch, still rope, unbroken hush—and in the journal’s reframing of “zero hour.” The ending offers a non-literal answer: wisdom is knowing when not to act. No moralizing; resonance builds through concrete particulars (glue curing, pinging instruments) that reweight the premise without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Sola’s interactions with the glass and stars, rejecting moralizing for resonant imagery: vulnerability as light-piercing-darkness, stillness as growth. The final image—glass casting warm glow in a window—reweights the premise without stating a thesis. However, the phrase “vulnerability is not weakness, but the very force that allows light to pierce darkness” borders on thematic echo, slightly undercutting subtext. Otherwise, complexity is honored: fragility and strength coexist without resolution into binary.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—language beyond speech, memory as duty—emerges through bees, glass, and silence, not assertion. The final image (box glowing, oasis as beacon) offers non-literal resolution: remembrance sustains the dead. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will bees return?). Recurrence of “weight” and “mute eloquence” reweights meaning, though the covenant’s mechanics flirt with allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: time as texture, not measure, woven through capsules, urn fragments, and garage-sale prose. The ending reweights “borrowed time” from deficit to abundance without moralizing—Elara’s palm-lines-as-roads image offers resonant, non-literal closure. Subtext thrives in objects (urn as key, silo as prism) and avoids binaries; eternity isn’t solved but inhabited. No pseudo-profundity; insight arises from concrete particulars like waterlogged baseball cards.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from recurring images—the feather, kite, lagoon—without moralizing. The central question (“Can broken things be beautiful?”) is answered non-literally through the poet’s ritual and the kite’s liberated flight. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture: placing the feather in the notebook, nodding to the lagoon. However, near-identical phrasing (“woven dawns,” “burnished hush”) recurs with minimal evolution, risking thematic echo over deepening; the insight borders on familiar lyric convention without fresh moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through action: respect as ongoing translation, not static monument. Final line—“Respect ongoing”—resonates non-literally, reweighting all prior pruning as preparatory listening. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from copper’s grammar, parrot nesting, and stone pulses. Legacy is redefined as correspondence, not ownership—a complex, non-binary answer to mortality.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: artificial constructs can reveal natural truths, and skepticism and reverence are not opposites. The final line—“the most artificial of pilgrimages had revealed the most natural of truths”—resonates without moralizing because it’s grounded in the amber’s pulse, the footprints’ chemistry, and her earned shift from rebel to seeker. Subtext lives in the tension between scientific rigor and ritualistic return. No platitudes; ambiguity lingers in whether the aliens’ “home” is real or engineered.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: reconciliation between living and dead through quiet harmony, not erasure. The final image—“the garden does not erase… it simply lets the living and the dead share the same breath”—offers a non-literal answer to trauma’s permanence. Subtext operates through birdsong, seed pods, and dead languages; no moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (Can harmony truly heal war?), yet the garden’s sprouting shoots affirm possibility without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from objects and actions: silence isn’t emptiness but a medium to be crossed; distance isn’t spatial but emotional. The final image—Wick surrounded by Maya’s voice—offers a non-literal answer to her riddle: presence persists through intentional attention. No moralizing; the wax leaf and phonograph grooves reweight earlier motifs without explanation. The story resists sentimentality by grounding love in specific, fragile artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of ritual, isolation, and navigation: direction as active choice, not inherited truth. The compass rose’s shift from heirloom to internal guide reweights “true north” without moralizing. Final image—sketching new anniversaries in void—offers non-literal resolution, reframing confusion as creative exploration. Avoids sentimentality; ambiguity lingers (will the light be salvation or delusion?) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: wonder as sacred play versus fear of the unknown, crystallized when Kaelen’s “fear dissolved” into curiosity. The final image—sky healed but spire open to future apprentices—offers non-literal resolution: wonder requires active guardianship, not passive awe. Avoids moralizing; resonance arises from concrete acts (placing lid, descending alone). Recurring motifs (sundial, chess pieces) reweight meaning without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: pawns as erased masses, small gestures as resistance. Final image—chessboard with restored pieces—offers non-literal answer: memory as active restoration, not passive recall. Avoids moralizing; “benevolently ruthless” ethos manifests in Kael’s carved pawns, not exposition. Resonance accrues via pattern reprise (“remember” walked backward), reweighting absence as canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: home is not a place but a dynamic pattern of connections across time. This insight arises from concrete action—tracing glyphs with a feather—and reconfigures the entire setting (the bookstore as living map). The ending offers a non-literal answer: home is rebuilt through awakened language and reclaimed memory, not found. Avoids moralizing; resonance comes through image (feather etched with script, aligned shelves) and emotional honesty (weight of memory now “a gentle echo”). The buried talent isn’t just regained—it’s repurposed to heal disconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: forgiveness as continuous winnowing, not singular absolution. The platinum labyrinth shifts from prison to promise, reweighting the opening image without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence—the girl’s pawn, the frayed threads—and the ending offers a non-literal answer: redemption lies in transmission, not erasure. Avoids sentimentality by anchoring insight in concrete action (“each pluck… a silent vow”).

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from Kael’s actions and the spire’s transformation—not stated but embodied in refracted light and communal dialogue. The ending offers a non-literal answer: truth, like light, never travels straight. Complexity is preserved (no redemption for Elders, no tidy moral), and the final image—children mimicking Kael—resonates without sentimentality. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the charged contrast between monolithic bone and scattered color.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from kintsugi praxis: brokenness as origin of beauty, memory as collective repair. No moralizing—the insight “All repair is a form of remembering” arises through mentor’s ghost, not authorial voice. Final image of statue’s scars “singing the truth of survival” offers non-literal answer to the central question: Can loss be gilded? Yes, but only by accepting its weight. Subtext thrives in tactile details—verdigris, liquid sunrise, frayed biography—never abstract declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as both burden and vessel, release through creation. The final image—the seashell left in the cave, the cracked mirror no longer binding—offers a non-literal answer to whether unfinished love can be honored without possession. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture (cradling the shell, whispering thanks). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the sea’s aloof intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: communication as vibration, not volume. The garden-at-midnight motif shifts from private grief to shared language, reweighting silence from void to vessel. No moralizing—resonance lives in Marcus touching Elara’s hand, not taking the cork. Final image answers the central question non-literally: listening begins not with ears but chest-deep resonance, earned through loss and love embedded in objects.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: loss isn’t healed but traversed via sound, memory, and lunar rhythm. The final image—her voice as a star finding home—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether the dead can be reached, reweighting “navigation” from physical retrieval to emotional resonance. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (she’s heard, not returned), and subtext thrives in silence, solder joints, and the censer’s pulse. Epiphany is earned through concrete labor, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly through the tension between truth as weapon and truth as balm, rejecting binary morality. The glass eye’s transformation from curse to tool reframes honesty not as absolute virtue but as force requiring stewardship. Final image—fruit ripening amid storms—offers non-literal resolution: survival lies in balance, not purity. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from concrete struggle (binding rituals, rope-weaving) rather than abstraction, and ambiguity lingers in the “fractured grace” that acknowledges ongoing risk.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: witnessing as antidote to oblivion. No moralizing—instead, the sketch and line “Memory is the true keeper of light” reweight the entire premise without stating it outright. The edelweiss, initially a puzzle, becomes testament; the lighthouse beam, once functional, now carries spirit. Ambiguity lingers (Is the name whispered his or the stranger’s?), resisting tidy resolution while affirming that being seen matters more than being known. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the charged recurrence of “softly persistent.”

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the matrix chip’s engravings, ant trails, and creek’s rise coalesce into a meditation on how decisions are maps we both read and become. The ending offers a non-literal answer—walking through the door means living all choices at once—repricing Merrick’s empirical intuition as faith in simultaneity. No moralizing; resonance comes via the extinguished chip sinking into sand, a quiet image that reweights every prior mention of light, memory, and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of recurrence, sacrifice, and identity without moralizing. The final line—“the ember grotto burned on, waiting for the next disenchanted queen”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: power is cyclical devotion, not dominion. Recurring images (starlight, frost, fireflies) shift from haunting to sacred, and the queen’s transformation critiques monarchy’s emptiness while honoring the quiet nobility of guardianship—all earned through concrete experience, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: presence is forged by revaluing fragments, not discarding the past. The nautilus curl’s transformation—from echo of first star to lens focusing “diffuse light of being”—answers the central question non-literally. Subtext thrives in gesture (Kael’s hand over hers) and image (shimmering dust trail), avoiding moralizing. However, the final whisper (“Presence is the only treasure worth returning for”) edges toward declarative summation, slightly blunting the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of memory, identity, and storytelling, culminating in the resonant, non-literal answer: “The chronicler dies but the dreaming continues.” This CR reweights all prior chaos as necessary compost for ongoing myth. Subtext operates through charged objects (scroll, headstone) and actions (soaring without opening doors), avoiding moralizing. The final insight—that past selves are “witnesses,” not enemies—feels earned through visceral struggle, not abstraction. Ambiguity lingers (Who is the ghost being born?) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from objects and actions: the screw, clock, fog, and oil vial accrue meaning without moralizing. The central question—how to inhabit loss—receives a non-literal answer in the final image: time inhabited “one careful drop at a time.” Subtext thrives in silence (Elena closing eyes), gesture (Marcus crushing rosemary), and implication. No platitudes; wisdom arises from brass threads and water chambers.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: pain gains meaning not by erasure but transmutation into light-bearing narrative. The crow feather superstition evolves from childhood comfort to adult ritual, reframing loss as transmission rather than silence. The final image—the crystalline rune as “library of light”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: can scars become stories? Yes, if rendered with honesty and offered to the world. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (tear + ink = glow).

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: imperfect miracles heal through resonance, not perfection. The recurring motif—song as both wound and balm—shifts meaning from broken chord to shared harmony. Subtext thrives in silence (Linden’s turned back) and gesture (the extended hand). The ending offers no moral but a resonant image: apology as song, delivered not in words but in the “shared resonance of a broken chord made whole.”

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the dictionary’s bleeding definitions, moths of false narratives, nautilus shelves. The ending reweights “truth” not as moral but as lived pattern—resonant without statement. Subtext operates in silence (“scream wrapped in resounding hush”) and gesture (pressing book to chest). Avoids pseudo-profundity; insight arises from tactile struggle, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—the key, the drops, the squint—not abstraction. The central question (“what do clocks really measure?”) is answered non-literally in the final lines: time is “the space between two heartbeats, measured by the quiet of a fjord.” This reframing reweights every prior image without moralizing. The razor-edge motif avoids symbolic shouting, instead accruing resonance through repeated, precise usage tied to perception and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from mycelial logic: grief as nutrient, memory as transmission. No moralizing—the insight (“physics of letting go wasn’t physics at all”) arises from touching a mushroom stem, not abstract musing.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of inherited trauma and intellectual inheritance, avoiding moralizing. The final image—Lila carrying the lantern “like a heart that had learned to beat in two worlds”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: can logic hold space for loss?

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of estrangement, connection, and cyclical time, crystallized in the refrain “teach endings how to begin.” The glass harmonica disc’s shattering reweights the earlier motif of haunting into one of release, offering a non-literal answer: closure requires active rupture. However, the final lines flirt with thematic echo (“every ending is only the start of a new melody”) that borders on prompt-like articulation, slightly undercutting subtextual resonance. Still, the emotional aftereffect—quiet hope born of sacrifice—feels earned through concrete particulars rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: small moments, when preserved, become covenants reborn. The final line—“When context changes, the heart must choose whether to anchor or drift”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Walnut ink, jasmine, and the locket accrue meaning through recurrence tied to action, not abstraction. However, the covenant’s regeneration leans slightly toward sentimentality; the villagers’ mimicry risks simplifying collective healing into ritual echo.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: loneliness is cured not by magic but by shared vulnerability. The moon rock’s glow reweights prior material—it was inert until stories charged it—offering a non-literal answer: connection is the cure. Subtext thrives in silence (ghosts gathering “in polite anarchy”) and gesture (whispered memories). Avoids moralizing; the final line resonates without stating a thesis, embracing complexity—hope persists, but Mira must leave.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: language as lived sensation, grief as unmappable yet locatable terrain. Subtext operates through silence, skin-contact, and the compass’s inward turn—never stated outright. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the map is the feeling itself, reweighting all prior sensory data.

Final image (“manuscript full of crossed-out lines”) offers a non-literal answer: editing isn’t erasure but curation. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (moss, static, dried ink), avoiding abstraction while embracing ambiguity—some knots remain unfixable, and that’s okay.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through the camera’s evolution and sign language—not stated but enacted. The final insight (“silence is the only language the forgotten truly own”) avoids moralizing by embedding wisdom in gesture and image. Joyful sorrow resonates because it’s forged in specific loss (filmless camera, rusted voice) and reclaimed agency (signing). Ambiguity lingers: is this liberation or deeper exile? Both readings feel true.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: fire as both weapon and penance, art as counter-censorship. The restored tapestry’s hidden coordinates reprice “destruction” as “creation,” answering the central question without moralizing. Final image—Kael pointing to their weeping face—invites reflection on truth/forgiveness woven into “every thread,” resisting binaries. No pseudo-profundity; wisdom arises from dissolving threads and ochre pigments.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically: love as co-creation beyond death, not preservation. The final image—two heartbeats drumming through surfaces—answers the central question non-literally: consciousness thrives not in flesh but in resonant systems. Avoids moralizing; sorrow is “auroral,” beautiful and transient. Subtext lives in gesture (drumming on ribcage) and image (lagoon reflecting extinct stars), not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: precision and subtlety outmaneuver noise and force. The final image—Marek keeping his folded maps while the world reboots—offers a non-literal answer: truth doesn’t need volume if you understand its pathways. No moralizing; resonance builds through the zodiac coin’s repurposing, the key’s revelation, and the watchman hearing through metal. Complexity is preserved—the smuggler loses, but Marek’s method remains esoteric, known only to him.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: darkness isn’t absence but a canvas for stars, and empathy transcends speech. The dental mirror evolves from tool to token of shared hope, reweighting “light” from spectacle to promise.

Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the “half-spoken secret,” resisting tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: quiet resistance through critical thinking, not force. The pawn-to-queen arc mirrors societal potential, culminating in the non-literal truth “Question the king”—a resonant CR that reframes prior chess imagery without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (Will the city change? Can thought alone topple power?), yet the cost—mental unrest replacing complacency—is undeniable. Avoids allegorical flatness by grounding theme in tactile details (lanterns, wooden pawn, cobalt walls).

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: strength and softness coexist, unlocked not by force but “gentlest calls.” The scrimshaw’s glow and island’s pulse reweight violence-as-impossible into a metaphor for internal barriers. Final image—Mira dancing on the tide—answers the central question non-literally, avoiding moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (“combative tenderness”) and setting (vanishing shore as liminal self).

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: can meaning persist when sorrow is outlawed? The answer isn’t stated but shown through whittling shavings as “silent confessions” and tea rituals as soliloquy. Final image reweights premise—the turbines’ “remade hush” becomes a canvas, not a cage—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (is complicity survivable?), resisting tidy resolution while honoring emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, sound, and boundary-dissolution—never stated outright. The final image of the poet vanishing into cloud-shadows offers a non-literal answer: freedom lies not in crossing lines but in their erasure. Recurring motifs (quartz hum, lantern-moth hush) accrue weight without tokenism, and ambiguity persists—does she transcend or dissolve? No moralizing; resonance stems from concrete particulars like breath-clouds dancing on cobalt walls.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the barter: imperfection as true art.

Final image reweights all prior motifs (ash, glass, grey tones) without stating the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through the lens’s scarred glass: connection thrives in resistance, not transmission. The final image—golden shadows pulsing like a remembered heartbeat—answers the central question non-literally, reweighting all prior fragments (whale songs, laughter) as carriers of imperfection’s grace. No moralizing; insight arises from the carbide lens’s warmth. Ambiguity lingers: will Mara embrace this? But the cost of certainty is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: artificiality becomes real through need and intention, not declaration. The flower-map tattoo’s return as a future-self loop offers a non-literal answer to the central question—how to mourn without surrendering to finality.

The final line—“genuinely artificial and alive”—resonates without moralizing, reweighting all prior craft as sacred act.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through particulars: tape measurements charting economic ruin, cards revealing “sacred geometry of greed.” Subtext lives in silence (architect’s realization) and gesture (finger tracing onyx symbols). Final line—raindrops as “pixels in the pattern”—offers non-literal answer to decentralization’s failure without moralizing. Complexity endures: roots grow in negative space, but starvation remains a meter away.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: nostalgia is both gift and curse, healing requires embracing unpredictability, and innocence ends not once but continuously. The final image—Lyra walking the fragile line—offers a non-literal answer to whether memory should be preserved. Avoids moralizing, though “atoms of nostalgia” leans slightly abstract; resonance stems from concrete actions (touching bronze, irregular breath) rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: hope endures only when bound to loss. The river stone’s transformation—from memento to catalyst to absence—reweights memory as both burden and key. Final image offers non-literal answer: the library blooms, but warmth is “bittersweet,” rejecting tidy optimism. No moralizing; subtext lives in gesture (“pressed the stone into the shadow’s path”) and resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the chameleon’s scarred tail: healing isn’t erasure but growth around wounds. No moralizing—wisdom arises from poultice application and burned paper. The final image (Veridian shifting to “the color of truth remembered”) offers a non-literal, resonant answer to betrayal and renewal. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the quiet blue skin—not in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: healing isn’t erasure but interpretation, with scars as legible history. The final image—dried coffee rings as a scar-map—offers a non-literal answer to Elara’s quest, reweighting every prior detail without moralizing. Subtext thrives in tactile metaphors (steam coiling like inquiry, stones “breathing”) that avoid abstraction. However, the phrase “poem of survival” edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting the otherwise earned resonance of the hourglass’s renewed flow.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: love unused changes address but never disappears. This isn’t stated but dramatized through the film’s dissolution into a silver map tattooed on Mira’s skin. The final image—her walking toward subway, writing letters into pavement’s latent silver—offers a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gaps: seat G12–G13, balcony rails, sprocket holes—spaces where longing pooled. No platitudes; wisdom arises from celluloid, crystal, and chemical sludge.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of stardust, silence, and creation, culminating in the insight that “creativity is simply the universe remembering itself”—a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The sextant and aurora evolve from objects to symbols without overt allegory. Final image of stardust flowing “like a river” reweights the opening’s “ink run dry” with earned hope. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether the change is psychological or cosmic.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: memory as fragile freight, forgetting as cancerous void, hope as stubborn mutation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—“a forest that grew downward from the sky”—reweighting loss as generative rather than terminal. No moralizing; insight arises from the guard’s bloody lullaby and the dune’s walking bloom. Subtext operates through image and gesture, inviting reflection on how dreams are born from dreamlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through precise particulars: wildness/mechanism as lovers, reason as one gear in a larger engine. No moralizing—insight arises from the gear’s harmonic spin, not assertion. Final image reweights premise: the forest dissolving into “pure pattern” implies mind and world are co-constituted. Subtext thrives in charged objects (gear as compass inward) and actions (walking toward unheard wind), resisting binaries while embracing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: courage as quiet persistence, not grand gesture. The star stamp and shoreline lullaby accrue meaning without moralizing. Final image—ticket half-buried, dog beside Lin—offers a non-literal answer: courage is carried, not declared. Avoids sentimentality through restraint, though the ferry guides’ dialogue (“brightest star we carry”) flirts with thematic echo without fully tipping into didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the bolt, the discoloration, the silent-choir’s candle-flicker language. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid—Elara’s signs, the precentor’s nod—and the final image reweights “safety” from passive obedience to active, costly stewardship. No moralizing; insight arises from her tactile ritual with the bolt and the charged poise of her descent. The story resists redemption, embracing complexity: forgiveness is uncertain, but duty persists.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—truth as an active, patient force that unravels illusion—emerges organically through ink, parchment, and starlight, never stated outright. The rune of drift symbolizes inevitable revelation, and its fading after use avoids moralizing. Final image (library as witness to sundered lies) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: preservation isn’t passive, but vigilant. Complexity is honored—Sylvar endures, Vael is exposed, but the throne remains empty, resisting tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly through the interplay of vanished shipping lanes and bleached reefs—both casualties of broken assumptions about permanence. The final image offers a non-literal answer: new paths may appear, but only if witnessed and tapped into rhythm; resilience lies in memory, not reversal. Subtext thrives in silence (the unspoken grief in tapping) and image (the waterproof case as ark for lost futures). No moralizing intrudes; complexity endures—loss is irreversible, yet meaning persists through ritualized attention.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: meaning isn’t found in stars or strategy but in subterranean resonance. The final image—Kai’s feet humming against earth—reweights the premise without moralizing, answering the central question (Can silence be broken?) through action, not assertion. Subtext thrives in the beacon’s pulse matching ancient stone, and the occupiers’ frown versus rebels’ stir implies asymmetrical reception of the same song. No false equivalence; the occupation’s rigidity contrasts Kai’s fluid attunement.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from action: the amber’s “embryo” revealed as a seed reframes destiny as cultivation, not waiting. Subtext lives in gesture—the granddaughter’s hair-braiding contrasted with rebellion-weaving—and image—the kite’s tail repurposed as threshold reminder. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: “destiny was planted in the soil of conscious choice,” avoiding moralizing by rooting insight in the seed’s retrieval. Ambiguity lingers (will the trees survive?), but the thematic stance—intention over passivity—is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically: realism as the vessel for sustainable optimism. The “pearl of stillness” reframes trauma—not as wound to heal but as nacre formed from grit and “the body’s quiet yes.” Final image reweights everything: the automated lighthouse’s “soulless duty” contrasts Elias’s human tower, his somatic beam guiding through rocks, not away. No moralizing; resonance lives in “folding the photograph carefully, feeling the weight of what it now contained.”

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of art, grief, and multiplicity: truth isn’t singular but collaborative, like shadow and light. The final image—Elara painting what people conceal “in the necessary darkness behind their ribs”—offers a non-literal answer to her opening despair, reweighting every prior brushstroke. No moralizing; resonance arises from the golden thread against darkness, the phantom hum beneath nails, and the ache recast as honest light.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme—ephemerality as both barrier and key to transcending time—emerges through concrete particulars: disappearing ink, vanished drone, suspended sand grains. No moralizing; insight arises from failed experiment and disciplined return. Final image reweights all prior material: the quest continues not despite futility but because crisis contains clarity. Subtext thrives in silence—the encampment holding its breath, the ghost of the drone—and avoids binaries, embracing the tension between control and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the letter, the tubes, the snow. No moralizing—only the roar that “swallowed the quiet whole.” The ending reweights silence from suppression to vessel, offering a non-literal answer: truth proliferates not through force but through reactivation of forgotten channels. Ambiguity lingers (Did Selene imagine this? What’s the cost?), resisting tidy resolution while affirming truth’s viral resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through action: peace as active cultivation, not passive avoidance. The final image—roses blooming, disc and sandbag on an altar—offers a non-literal answer to chaos: continuity through quiet ritual. Avoids moralizing; subtext lives in gesture (pouring tea, folding the note). Slight deduction: “inculcating plants with values” borders on thematic assertion, though redeemed by embodied practice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the rail spike transliterating grief into grace, the feral lullaby becoming prayer. The ending offers a non-literal answer—witnessing changes you more than possessing—and reweights prior material (the spike’s glow now signifies contentment, not just function). Subtext thrives in silence-as-action and zigzag-as-ethic; no moralizing, only resonant images (frozen tear-note, violet weeping). Complexity endures: gods need lulling, mortals can voice silence, but neither erases loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: orbits, black holes, and ink accrue meaning without moralizing. The final line—“the first echoes of tomorrow’s headlines”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth propagates regardless of suppression. No thematic echo or sermonizing; subtext lives in the nib’s supernova and Jupiter’s moons. Complexity is preserved—Victoria doesn’t redeem her father, only refuses his silence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically: creation’s first sound is mourning, not joy, and guilt is a tether across time. The ending reweights this non-literally—the amber holds a mother’s sob, not a chirp—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in images: infected star-wounds resolving into ordinary cries, ink burning cold. Ambiguity lingers (Is absolution real or delusion?), but emotional truth anchors it.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: collective memory requires confronting trauma to transcend it. The violet spiral embodies this as both question and answer, reweighting silence from absence to dialogue. No moralizing—the insight arises through chalk, sand, and vibration. Final line (“whispers had finally learned to listen”) offers resonant, non-literal closure that reframes all prior images without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the tessera and naming ritual, avoiding overt moralizing. “Aberrant mercy” gains resonance via the enemy soldier’s ghostly memory, offering a non-literal answer to whether grace survives destruction. However, the phrase “cradle empathy in arms of steel” recurs like a mantra, bordering on thematic echo, and the ending’s promise of restoration slightly softens the conceptual cost, diluting the ambiguity that would elevate it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: art’s legacy lives through transmission, not permanence. The final image—the actress carrying his echo in future ovations—offers a non-literal answer to whether greatness can be reignited. Subtext thrives in silence (her pause), gesture (steady voice), and object (the winking coin). No moralizing; resonance arises from the orchard’s promise that “possibility could always be lured back,” weighted by the ghost’s quiet sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)

No explicit thesis statement; resonance arises from concrete particulars like pill dust settling into mica crevices.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of fossil, cave, and song—transitional objects bridge extinction and yearning without moralizing. The final image of Lira holding the warm fossil beside the horizon offers a non-literal answer: translation, not preservation, is how we honor loss. Subtext thrives in silence, floating stone, and color-bled maps. No platitudes; the wisdom is earned through tactile engagement with grief’s residue.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the hourglass/jar/button triad: time as participatory flow versus imprisoned measurement. The prophecy’s final form—a question inviting co-creation—rejects fatalism without stating morals, reweighting all prior “frozen moments” as invitations rather than relics. Subtext thrives in tactile details (scratched mother-of-pearl = childhood interrupted) that avoid allegory while deepening historical amnesia critique. The geode metaphor (“crack open the future… revealing crystals of chance”) earns its resonance through geological consistency established in cliff/sap imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (pillbox), method (snow-buried codes), and character choice: broken things can be mended through patient, quiet courage. The ending offers a non-literal answer—restoration trumps destruction—without moralizing. Recurrence of “prudently daring” and “unused courage” accrues meaning through action, not assertion. Ambiguity lingers (Will the network truly heal? Can trust be rebuilt?), avoiding tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges solely through particulars: yarn needles, gutter ticks, and fog distill love’s persistence into essence without moralizing. The palimpsest metaphor operates diegetically—rewritten vows, overwriting circumstances—not as abstract commentary. Final image (needles touching as gutters fall silent) reweights thirty-seven years into a non-literal answer: love percolates through time via attention, not grand gestures. Subtext thrives in silence; their wordless reunion rejects therapy-speak for tactile truth, avoiding sentimentality while evoking profound emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from object and action: care as architecture, time as glaze, kindness as sustenance. The final image—Kai walking away, shadow “sharp and gentle”—reweights all prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the absent bees, the single circling bee at end) and avoids binaries; entropy isn’t defeated, but transformed. No prompt-like articulation mars the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: lock teeth become seed furrows, roses become moonflowers, vertical protest becomes horizontal hope. No moralizing; insight arises from action (“turning grief into geometry, memory into moonlight”). Final image reweights the premise: the gardener becomes “lock, key, and hand”—a non-literal answer to loss that embraces complexity without false equivalence. Subtext thrives in silence: the city’s “quivering hush” gives way to “protected vulnerability,” earned through precise, quiet defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: extinction isn’t erasure if memory becomes active communion. The final image—Mara as “weaver of time”—reweights all prior ghosts from passive echoes to living data, answering the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the hum between heartbeats) and concrete action (recording vibrations onto scrolls). Avoids sentimentality; embraces complexity—legacy as both burden and bond.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: connection as collective weaving, not solitary longing. The spiral reweights “secrets” from burdens to shared whispers, answering the central question (“How do we belong?”) through the child’s stone offering and Lira’s signed letter—not moralizing. Final image (“luminous thread in its endless weave”) offers non-literal resolution, embracing ambiguity (threads are “everywhere and nowhere”). Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in concrete acts: dyeing silk, shaping bowls, placing stones.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through particulars: celestial gaslighting as metaphor for real-world polarization, with subsonic manipulation mirroring how media amplifies paranoia. No moralizing—insight arises from Mara’s actions and the dissolving interference patterns. Final image reweights the premise: humanity’s fragility isn’t cured, but awareness becomes armor. Ambiguity lingers (“what else might be hiding in the static?”), resisting tidy binaries while affirming vigilance as ethical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: discovery as dialogue with the past, rebellion against static design. The final image—Elara tracing a new line—offers a non-literal answer: true keys unlock imagination, not just doors. Subtext thrives in silence, geometry, and sound-as-map; no moralizing intrudes. However, “wistful rebellion” edges close to prompt-language, slightly diluting earned resonance in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: blindness as alternative sight, subtraction becoming addition. The ribbon’s gold bead as “suspended tear” reframes loss as residue rather than void. Final image—Elara seeing stone and shadow both—answers the central question non-literally: perception isn’t about features but presence. No moralizing; resonance built through Catherine’s constellation-freckles and the quarry’s furrowed hush.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: truth suppressed for being “too soon” resurfaces through material relics and coded resistance. The final image—Vance’s camp resolving “like a developing photograph”—offers a non-literal answer: erasure is temporary; evidence persists. No moralizing; resonance accrues through the copper nail’s transformation from relic to key. The story refuses tidy redemption, focusing instead on the burden of inherited complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically through recurring images—glass shard, scaffold flutter, fiddle melody—that shift from fragmentation to wholeness. The ending offers a non-literal answer: forgiveness is pixelated, partial, yet fertile. Avoids moralizing; “luminous disbelief” encapsulates ambiguity without resolution. Central question—can the dead sing again?—is answered through action (playing the new bridge-song), not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: some circles teach stillness rather than trap. The foreign bill’s journey—from pouch to floor to pocket—reweights value without moralizing. Final line (“some circles are meant to be understood, not escaped”) offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Avoids tidy binaries; embraces ambiguity in Leo’s departure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of astronomy, botany, and scribal tradition—human resilience as a constellation requiring multiple points of light. Subtext lives in silence: the predecessor’s frantic note, the unspoken lineage of women scribes. The ending offers a non-literal answer: burdens heal only through transmission, not resolution. No moralizing; the final inscription whispers rather than declares, trusting the image of fading daylilies to carry emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: truth lies beneath surfaces, and self-deception is its own curse. The frozen confession reframes mirrors as instruments of concealment, not revelation—a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext thrives in gesture (kneeling, planting the seed) and image (ice melting into berries). Avoids moralizing; the insight arises from concrete struggle, and ambiguity lingers (“some truths remain hidden from mirrors”). Final image reweights prior material without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: stewardship vs. control, wounds as portals, legacy as living garden. The final image—planting a maze that welcomes wanderers—offers a non-literal answer to “how to heal what was eclipsed.” No moralizing; insight arises from concrete action. Subtext thrives in the tension between thorny inheritance and wild possibility, resisting tidy resolution while affirming responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: bartered destinies reveal that healing requires irreversible loss, not restoration. The ending reweights this non-literally—Elara’s “dusky resolve” accepts a reshaped void, rejecting tidy closure. Recurring motifs (“inlaying meaning everywhere”) evolve from observation to action to consequence, avoiding moralizing. Final image (“pulse in her own chest”) resonates with ambiguity: connection persists, but identity is fractured, honoring complexity over binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: forgotten things (including people) hold latent value if witnessed anew. The ending offers a non-literal answer—appraisal as performance, silence as canvas—without moralizing. Echoes reweight from loss to possibility through concrete particulars (cloth, helmets, valley). Avoids sentimentality; embraces ambiguity in whether new rhythms will suffice, yet affirms agency in seeking them.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the braided conflict between presence/absence and translation/permanence. The final flower of “pure information” offers a non-literal answer: understanding lives in the “touching distance” between sign and meaning. No moralizing—insight arises from Elara’s tactile work (carving, planting, witnessing). The braid metaphor reweights the entire premise without stating it outright.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges through the creel’s transmutation: preservation requires loss, routine needs surprise. No moralizing—insight arises from Elara’s tactile defiance (“not in the feed-chute”). Final image reweights prior material: the half-bamboo/half-crystal artifact embodies contradiction as necessity. Subtext thrives in silence—the unsaid cost of tomorrow’s collapse lingers in “drowned memories” and tidal absence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: unsaid hopes crystallize in shells, not abstract “regret.” The ending reweights silence as violence and speech as luminous rebellion without moralizing. Central question—what holds structures together?—is answered non-literally: shared vulnerability, not concrete. Final line (“brightest hopes… crown them”) avoids platitudes by tying reverence to the pearl’s physical act.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from water imagery, broken instruments, and maps—not stated but embodied. The final insight—“healing is a song you learn to play again”—avoids moralizing by anchoring in the bellows’ silent resonance. Subtext thrives in silence, dust, and ivy’s “forgiving hands,” resisting tidy redemption. Yet the phrase “raw solace” appears twice as near-label, slightly flattening ambiguity; true thematic risk would let the imagery alone carry the weight without naming the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as active release, not passive absence. The final line—“the time between them was now a story documented in delay”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how meaning forms. Motifs (spiral, tick, mist) accrue weight without moralizing; the scroll’s clue avoids exposition. Subtext thrives in gesture (touching the spine, tucking artifacts away). No banality; insight arises from concrete particulars like the watch’s spiral hands.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as living archive versus commodified resource. The final image—a tree whose roots hold songs—offers a non-literal answer to whether dreams outweigh empires.

The “perforated destiny” concept is repriced as fertile ground for new growth, avoiding tidy binaries while honoring cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through action: art as theft from death, consciousness distilled to essential metaphor. The emerald archive—ten thousand chips—implies a quiet cosmology where meaning outlasts identity. Final image reweights everything: “winter jasmine bloomed forever” answers the central question (What is worth keeping?) without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—is this preservation or vanity?—but resonance is earned through concrete ritual, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically: contentment is found in process, not product. The scallop motif shifts from Aria’s clumsy carving to pruning method to earth sigil to jam jar’s empty readiness—each reweighting the idea of release. No moralizing; the final image of brown bread with jam, tasting of “soil and rain and honest work,” answers the central question non-literally. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld: the cloud-wanderer’s letters remain unread, Aria’s death un-dramatized—yet their weight permeates every line.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from object (mirror), action (unhooking), and setting (chimes as language)—not moralizing. The final image—the shard reflecting “endless spectrum”—answers the central question non-literally: truth is polyphonic. Nuance isn’t preached; it’s demonstrated through the chime language and prismatic light. Avoids binary resolution while rejecting relativism—the keeper’s “sincere insincere smile” acknowledges cost without cynicism.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically through recurring images—the rings, the grotto’s pulse, the sycamore hush—that accrue meaning without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer: visibility arises from surrender to vanishing, not control. This reweights every prior ripple as both loss and revelation. No thematic echo or abstraction mars the resonance; complexity is held in the paradox itself, resisting tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: stillness as profound movement, history as navigable terrain. The final image—“traveling centuries while standing perfectly still”—reweights every prior detail without moralizing. Subtext lives in the arrowhead’s repurposing (weapon → key) and the birds’ collective consciousness as ancient language. No platitudes; wisdom arises from concrete acts of listening and skimming, resisting tidy binaries about motion versus stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: automation vs. organic magic, efficiency vs. inefficiency. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the sacred persists not through rebellion but quiet endurance—reweighting “underachievement” as virtue. No moralizing; resonance lives in “lingering luminance now his own.” Ambiguity lingers (will sentinels erase it?), but the thematic stance is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: truth hides behind light, and silence holds color. This reframes the quest—not as sensory discovery but as epistemological surrender. The ending offers a non-literal answer (silence = white) that reweights all prior imagery without moralizing. Recurring objects (key tag, lanterns) accrue meaning through use, not declaration, and the final whisper (“thank you”) avoids sentimentality by tying gratitude to concrete agents (stars, ship, lanterns). No thematic echo or prompt-like summarization mars the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of coins, static, and prophecy—not as stated moral but as resonant inquiry into choice amid entropy. The final image reweights everything: coins dissolving into light doesn’t restore lost timelines but affirms their frequency as worthy of witness. Subtext thrives in silence (“feeling the shape of silence between” static bursts) and gesture (soundless smile), avoiding sermonizing. The backwards prophecy reframes time not as linear cause-effect but as recursive resonance, offering a non-literal answer: meaning lies in attunement, not outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically: the dignity of naming versus the impossibility of self-naming for those who serve others’ endings. The final image—the mirror-crystallized void reflecting her gaunt face—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: some fears exist only in relational distance, and naming them requires sacrificing one’s own identity. No moralizing; resonance arises from the atlas’s transformation and the reaper’s silent endurance. Subtext thrives in gestures (pressing the page flat for thirty nights) and the echo’s recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: brittle devotion, earnest naivety, and lukewarm persistence as quiet strengths that bend impossibility. The bell’s song reweights silence into hope without moralizing. Final image—a humming bone, whispering sea—offers a non-literal answer to cosmic imbalance: restoration through patient attention. Avoids sentimentality; embraces ambiguity (balance is “a little” restored, not fixed).

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—history as collective responsibility—emerges organically through objects, silence, and water imagery. The wind chime’s cessation and “mirrored hush” reframe stillness as witness, not absence. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid: authorities’ cover-up, generational silence.

No moralizing; resonance arises from Nora’s quiet resolve and the blue-tinged faces under lantern light.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically: chaos and order as lovers, not enemies. The starlings’ murmuration becomes living proof—not stated but shown through spirals, toruses, and visible music.

No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars—the violet’s ghostly purple, the flame’s shift to “color between heartbeats.”

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of vigilance as silent, costly endurance emerges organically through recurring motifs (buckle, echo, burden). The final image—stars watching the arbor—offers non-literal resonance: duty persists beyond recognition. However, “trust” is over-articulated (“mantra etched,” “promise of trust”), bordering on thematic echo. Subtext thrives in restraint elsewhere (e.g., heartbeat matching arbor hum), but the closing lines lean toward assertion over implication, slightly blunting ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: enlightenment without emotional engagement is death; true mastery requires embracing pain as proof of life. The final image—tears cutting salt trails—offers a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting “ego death” as incomplete without reintegration. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete action (shattering the jar, absorbing the brain). The recurring motif of “complementary opposites” shifts from abstract philosophy to lived synthesis, charging closure without statement.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—innovation blooms where the ordinary fears to tread—emerges organically through the corpse flower (rare, pungent, slow) and Mara’s design ethos. Subtext resides in contrasts: silence vs. bloom, secrecy vs. sharing, orthogonality vs. convention. The final image (seedling stirs at dawn) offers a non-literal answer: creation begins in quiet fidelity. Avoids moralizing, though phrases like “true creativity thrived” flirt with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of sound, silence, and unspoken grief—never stated outright. The recurring motif of “macerating silence” evolves from destructive act to tender cultivation, culminating in the final line where wind “macerates the last of her grief.” This non-literal answer to the central question—how do we heal when words fail?—reweights every prior image without moralizing. Subtext lives in shattered plates, sudsy hands freezing, and cracked laughter—concrete gestures that carry thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the pendant as lens into unlight, waiting as reading—not abstraction. The ending offers a non-literal answer: home is a way of waiting, uncertainty a companion. Subtext operates in image and gesture (licking metal, reflection in ice), avoiding moralizing. The final door shimmers with “impossible geometry,” reweighting the entire premise: knowledge isn’t guarded but given, and certainty is illusion.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: hope is the trap, failure the material. The glass tree reweights all prior despair—not as overcome, but preserved and transmuted. Subtext thrives in silence (Elara doesn’t look back) and image (penny as weight, not currency). Final insight avoids moralizing; peace comes from “certainty of approximation,” a resonant non-literal answer to the central question of alchemical futility.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: endings contain beginnings, silence holds creation. No moralizing—the insight arises through rewiring circuits, not stating it. The final image (teaching Tower Twenty to listen) reweights all prior abandonment as necessary compost. Subtext thrives in gesture: grease-blackened hands, dormant shard, starlight work—all embody patience as voltage. Ambiguity lingers (will others hear?), but the cost of transformation is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—permanence within transience—emerges through concrete particulars: the empty hourglass filling with starlight, the radio’s pulse as lullaby, the vanishing as new beginning. No moralizing; insight arises from Lina’s actions, not reflection. The final image reweights the premise: emptiness is full of possibility. Subtext thrives in recurring motifs (clocks, starlight, radio static) that shift from disorienting to harmonious, resisting tidy binaries while embracing cyclical hope.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the sinew thread’s transformation into water and Mira’s shift from architect to participant. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: connection is “the precise weight of a gaze meeting yours,” reweighting all prior weaving as misguided control. No moralizing—insight arises from concrete particulars (child’s laugh, soldier’s thought). The final image—empty mirrors showing only depth—invites reflection without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: what anchors you can guide you. The anchor link’s transformation—from corroded relic to star map—embodies the idea that memory and limitation fuel discovery. Subtext thrives in gesture (Mara placing the link on her desk at artificial dawn) and silence (Corin’s bioluminescence forming Ursa Major). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: horizons unfold not by reaching sky but by expanding perception. No moralizing; wisdom arises from concrete particulars—rust, pressure layers, whale-song—not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: the porous boundary between living and dead, listening as protection.

Final image—child’s smile widening—offers a non-literal answer: being heard transcends life/death. Subtext thrives in silence (Lila’s breath, the man’s grip), avoiding sentimentality while affirming connection.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through the tension between corporate erasure and electromagnetic grief—human cost encoded in infrastructure. The codex’s gold flecks reweight from navigational tool to memorial compass, culminating in the final image where Marek ascends holding inert illuminants, having fulfilled their purpose through presence alone. No moralizing; resonance arises from the specificity of ghostprints in fiber optics and the quiet refusal to commodify loss.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the shard’s fracture echoing data fragmentation, heartbeat syncing with machine rhythm. The ending reweights “failure” as a map without moralizing—the ghost’s final line (“each crack teaches the path to mend”) feels earned by her tactile labor. Subtext thrives in silence (radio static clearing) and gesture (pocketed shard). Ambiguity lingers: is the ghost real or projection?—but the emotional truth of resilience remains unshaken.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically: some losses are unmournable because they erase the very means of mourning. Subtext operates through image—the diamond’s fracture as memory, birds’ geometry as syntax—and avoids moralizing. The ending reweights prior material: the “curse” becomes “gift of persistence beyond meaning,” answering the central question non-literally. Final lines (“meaning persisted”) resonate without assertion, embracing ambiguity while rejecting sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: grief can be alchemized into cosmic harmony through surrender to the untamed. The “cosmic joke” reframes loss not as defeat but as participation in a larger, playful order. Final image—Lyn as guardian teaching others to listen to earth’s static—offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. However, the phrase “harmony untamed” borders on abstract label; its power derives more from lyrical repetition than dramatized conflict between control and chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty isn’t preserved memory but *risked rhythm*. The final image—statues patting out pulses, Elara breathing “resonantly soft beat”—answers the central question non-literally: liberation requires vulnerability, not preservation. No moralizing; insight arises from the shell’s filigree, the cracked granite tear, the crumbling stone. Subtext operates through silence (violin falls quiet) and gesture (hands lifting in rhythm), resisting binaries—mechanical order isn’t evil, just dehumanizing—and embracing ambiguity (will the signal reach beyond the orchard?).

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars: broken promises don’t heal—they’re carried until they can be delivered. The storm-bottle reweights silence into speech, absence into proof of life, without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture—the trembling hands, the drone’s whisper, the unspoken rules between mailman and arcade owner. The ending offers no tidy redemption, only a momentary breach where loss touches foundness, resonating beyond plot through image and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as fertile ground, not void, crystallizes through concrete particulars—oil on gears, moss on rust, the halo’s pulse—not abstraction. The ending offers a non-literal answer: stillness becomes motion via song, reweighting all prior images (e.g., “mist” softens to “breathing stillness”). Subtext thrives in gesture (pressing metal to wood as prayer) and avoids moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will the circus truly revive?—but resonance is undeniable in the spring’s “rhythmic pulse,” tying past to future without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme—stories as recursive, living structures that hold readers as much as vice versa—emerges through precise images (Möbius scarf, black hole books, mirrored cover reflecting origins). No moralizing; insight arises from action (“each tale folding into the next like her scarf's infinite loops”). The final constellation of found stories reweights all prior browsing as co-creation. Subtext thrives in silence: the young man’s unwritten ending implies every reader is also a text.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the central conflict: longing as subject, not obstacle. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—the empty well “shone brighter than others”—that reweights all prior imagery without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (dipping brush, raising camera) and charged objects (palette, cipher). Wisdom is earned through specific failure and insight: “longing itself was true subject.” No platitudes; complexity lingers in the balance between loss and gain, possession and witness.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: truth requires disorientation of binding patterns, and love/forgiveness need no transaction. This is embodied in the hair-lock ritual, not stated abstractly. The final image—Merrin waiting for a key to her own fear—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether liberation is possible for the liberator. Ambiguity lingers (will the idea take root?), but complexity is preserved without false balance. No moralizing; wisdom arises from concrete particulars like ash-like hair and starlit cobblestones.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges through precise particulars: faeries as archivists, constellations as memory-locks, curiosity as both gift and burden. The ending offers non-literal resolution—“some truths are worth the waiting”—that reweights all prior action without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through particulars: resilience as quiet endurance, taught via tea leaves and shard annotation, not stated. The final image—empty swing still swaying, library “no longer forgotten”—offers non-literal answer to whether resilience requires grandeur.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: brokenness as vessel, silence as material to be worked, not buried. No moralizing—the pearl’s warmth against her palm *shows* transformation. Subtext thrums in objects: masks shift from surfaces to sanctuaries, the net from shroud to star-chart.

    Theme emerges organically from particulars: snowflakes’ logarithmic decay mirrors memory fade; the globe’s closed system embodies grief’s persistence. No moralizing—the final insight (“understanding is its own form of buoyancy”) arises from concrete observation, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—silenced voices demand articulation—emerges organically through action, not assertion. The final image reweights all prior glyphs: graffiti isn’t vandalism but scripture, silence isn’t absence but latency.

No moralizing; resonance arises from the coin’s journey from external tool to internal compass.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: discovery as inheritance (“breadcrumb left by a predecessor”) and solitude as strength. The final image—luminance illuminating carvings—reweights mapping from conquest to continuity, avoiding moralizing. However, the phrasebook’s “lights that linger” note borders on thematic echo, slightly reducing subtextual depth in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: brokenness contains wholeness (“every broken thing holds a ghost of its wholeness”), and repair is cyclical stewardship, not restoration. The final image—mirrors reflecting “what could be”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in objects: gears as heartbeats, frost as forgetting. No pseudo-profundity; insights arise from concrete acts (placing gear in keyhole).

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: resilience as tangled, communal hope. The spiral chalk mark reweights prior labor as cyclical, not linear—a Conceptual Repricing that avoids moralizing. Subtext thrives in the bell’s chime (gentle coordination over control) and the nebula (guidance beyond death). However, “brambled hope” edges toward label-speak in the final lines, slightly undercutting earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges through object and action: brokenness enables salvation. The puppet’s cracks become pathways; silence becomes love. No moralizing—the ending reweights all prior loss via the image of “a thousand versions of the boy” receiving the lullaby as shaped silence.

The recurring nut shifts from “forgotten blueprint” to lifeline to worn token of hope, reweighting its meaning silently. Final image offers non-literal answer: graceless beauty resides in unseen labor. No moralizing; resonance stems from Elara’s quiet renunciation. Ambiguity lingers (Will she always do this? Can the curse break?), but the cost of continuity is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of polymer science and river ecology: connection isn’t forced unity but harmonious braiding. The chrysalis—a natural polymer—becomes a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting loss as generative material. Subtext thrives in silence (the unsaid apology) and gesture (releasing the shell). Avoids moralizing; the final hum implies ongoing work, not tidy resolution. Only minor deduction: “symphonically tuned mind” edges toward label-speak but is redeemed by embodied musical metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically: beginnings reside in erased space, not written word. Subtext thrives in silence, negative space, and the vendor’s refusal to solve her own puzzle. The final image—stars as puncture wounds where stories begin—reweights all prior moonlight imagery without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: some pains cannot be smoothed, only shared—and sharing exacts a toll. The final image—bread carrying a ghosted memory “not into absence but into something that could be held”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to live with irreparable loss. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete action (subsuming, baking). The coral pavilion’s sigh and draining pools echo the cost of empathy, while the chef’s brittleness reframes healing as burden-bearing, not cure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: time and music flow best when carrying every voice. This isn’t stated but demonstrated through the cuckoo’s trilingual song and elevators humming “in harmony, their languages interspersed like rows of corn.” The final image—a clock measuring “the distance between hearts, now shortened”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to fragmentation without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (silo silences heard, railroad tracks unspokenly crossed) and gesture (children mispronouncing syllables as empathy).

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of tool, setting, and action: memory is malleable, abandonment is reversible, and identity is porous. The final image—canyon walls holding new memories like mineral deposits—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: can we reclaim lost possibilities? It reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates through the mirror’s fractures and the moon’s “quaking reverie,” avoiding explicit thesis statements. However, slight abstraction in phrases like “original architecture” nudges toward pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—vigilance as active, costly guardianship of fragile knowledge—emerges through concrete particulars: luminous ink, hidden glyphs, inverted thresholds. Subtext resides in the doodle’s sacrifice and the prism’s silent sentinel role; no moralizing intrudes. The final image reweights the premise: history’s protection isn’t archival but liminal, requiring readiness for inversion. Ambiguity lingers (Will she be ready next time?), but the cost of forgetting is made undeniable through the archivist’s quiet fire.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: music doesn’t shatter silence but lives within it.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges implicitly: sacrifice’s reversibility through strategic absence, not stated moral. The final image—a dent as “perfect dark moon”—non-literally answers whether broken covenants can transform into beauty. Subtext thrives in silence, magnetic pulses, and chess metaphors; no thematic echo or sermonizing. Complexity persists—Mira’s agency remains ambiguous, Kael’s redemption partial—resisting tidy binaries while embracing the cost of “dangerous freedom.”

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Mira’s struggle: empathy isn’t passive reception but active, imperfect tuning. The final image—fireworks as “symphony of silence”—reweights all prior stillness into shared resonance without moralizing. Subtext thrives in objects (clasp, radio) and gestures (tracing ink, inviting the neighbor). Avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in concrete action: writing her own entries becomes the path forward. Only minor deduction: the father’s line borders on prompt-like wisdom but is redeemed by its integration into the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the corpse flower’s paradox—beauty and dread coexisting—and culminates in the non-literal insight that “wisdom hides in the most pungent of places.” No moralizing; the final image of shared serenity reweights all prior actions. Ambiguity lingers (Is decay necessary for peace?), yet the emotional aftereffect—a wildflower hush—feels earned through specific rituals and sensory work, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from action: the broken arrow fusing with the scarred seed embodies the insight that wholeness arises from integrating fracture. No moralizing; the final line (“courage to grow backward into one’s roots while reaching forward”) reweights the premise without stating it outright. Subtext thrives in silence—the “whirling silence” isn’t absence but centrifuged memory—and the echoes transform from warnings to ancestral guidance. The story resists binaries, honoring both loss and growth as inseparable.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: foresight as responsibility in systems where sea and sky collide.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through image and action: wonder as a force that must be ritually released, not passively observed.

Subtext thrives in the synesthetic fusion of sound and light, avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the flute as both key and lock, driftwood as choice-symbols, silence as canvas. The ending offers non-literal resolution—failure is a door—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in absence: the unplayed second melody implies wisdom in restraint. However, the phrase “guardianship never truly ends” edges toward thematic declaration, slightly undercutting the earned ambiguity of the flute-as-bridge metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: empathy resists reduction to formula, thriving in reciprocal, unstable exchange. Subtext lives in shifting glyphs, vanishing stars, and the notebook’s equations—never stated outright. The final line (“Empathy = DeltaSelf / DeltaOther”) reweights all prior action without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers (stars gone, workshop dark), yet the cost—lost light, hollowed self—makes the insight feel earned, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: wonder persists not through relics but through acts of faith remembered. The ending offers non-literal answer—the tree grown from sprout and pendant reweights “routine” as fertile ground for myth. No moralizing; resonance builds via concrete particulars (frost-bloom, silver leaves). Ambiguity lingers (Is the mentor truly in the pendant? Does memory equal magic?), but the cost—forgetting the courier’s name while the legend endures—feels earned and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: quartz pages, frost constellations, electromagnetic spikes—not abstract claims. The “truthful lie” reframes the entire premise: truth requires fiction’s honesty. Final image (frost melting into words) offers non-literal answer—memory persists beyond physics, but only through attentive witnessing. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Is it real? Does it matter?), yet emotional aftereffect is concrete: certainty born of surrender, not proof.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges through action: silence as both wound and medium, grief as reciprocal offering. The final image—Lin waking with unnamed warmth—answers the central question non-literally: connection transcends physical distance through shared sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges implicitly: resilience is coaxed through loss, not found. The final line—“hammer's clang a song of azure defiance”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Recurring images (blue dust, copper, silk) shift meaning organically: decay becomes life, meekness becomes deliberate strength. Avoids tidy binaries; the council “nods, not understanding,” preserving ambiguity while affirming Ren’s earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: guardianship as inheritance of unresolved failure, truth as compass not burden. The green shard’s cyclic return mirrors the inescapable duty, and the final line (“when the next dream began”) reframes recurrence not as trap but purpose.

Subtext thrives in silence: the murmur softens, but the work continues.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of objects and silence: safety isn’t guaranteed by light alone but by shared, fragile acts of trust. The bottle reweights prior material—not as container but as vessel of mutual longing. Final line (“safety he had bottled”) avoids moralizing by grounding insight in concrete action. Ambiguity lingers (Who writes? Is the ghost real?), but emotional truth remains coherent and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: forgotten forms (print, sailors’ echoes) contain seeds of renewal. The final line—“dawn broke, fierce and bright gold”—offers a non-literal answer to whether the past can guide the future, reweighting “shadows” from loss to blueprint. Avoids moralizing, though “new dawn is carved from shadows of the past” flirts with thematic echo; saved by its diegetic function as accidental prophecy rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: stories are held, not captured. The blue morpho’s “iridescent caution” evolves from observational tool to metaphor for ethical witnessing. Final line—“hearts and stories were exchanged with equal reverence”—resonates non-literally, reweighting all prior imagery without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (Who was the stranger? Can stories be worn?), yet emotional honesty grounds the metaphysics.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the sextant, trees’ rings, and scattered dreams coalesce into a non-literal answer—that sorrow and hope coexist in quiet resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: memory as collective fabric, sacrifice as generative force. The ending offers a non-literal answer—true dawn arrives not through power but surrender—repricing the premise that preservation requires possession. Recurring motifs (songs, threads, mica) accrue meaning without moralizing; the final whisper avoids sentimentality. Ambiguity lingers (Is Elias gone? Is the dawn stable?), yet resonance is earned through concrete particulars, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the nested structure: truth within contradiction, wisdom in error, compassion within isolation. The final image—Mira among others holding once-crumpled invitations—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: belonging requires not abandoning solitude but sharing its depth. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (the mirror, the seed metaphor, the corridor). The story resists binaries, embracing paradox as lived reality rather than intellectual exercise.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: the sacred resides in ordinary attention, and forgetting is a slow surrender rationalized as progress. No moralizing—insights arise from concrete acts (planting sage in cracks, crumbling bread into soil). The final image—bread left each autumn in a restored garden—reweights the entire narrative: memory becomes practice, not nostalgia. Subtext thrives in gesture (veteran pressing fingers into earth) and silence, resisting binaries while affirming that noticing is resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning persists only through active, meticulous attention to fragile echoes of the past. The luminous vows symbolize promises that outlive their speakers but require interpreters. Subtext thrives in silence, measurement, and recurrence. However, the final lines verge on declarative (“testament to hope”), slightly undercutting earned ambiguity with near-moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—trust as fragile, measurable sound—emerges organically through concrete particulars: the fob’s tick, the splintering mast simile, the captured syllables.

Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the “comforting unease,” resisting tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: taste as epistemology, voting as ecological negotiation. No moralizing; the ending reweights “carrying weather” from burden to ballot via the seed-and-lightning fungalese translation.

Central question—can weather be chosen?—is answered non-literally through the forests’ election, resisting binaries while embracing terrestrially cosmic ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from Elena’s struggle: creativity cannot be buried, only delayed, and loss becomes the pigment of new creation. The recurring lock and painting reweight meaning at closure—not as symbols but as functional objects that channel memory into action. Avoids moralizing; the final line (“first whisper of a new story”) offers resonant, non-literal resolution. Minor deduction for “auroral sorrow” verging on abstract lyricism without full grounding in physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: candor as ecological sustenance, not moral duty. The final image—gold-leafed truth reviving memory’s oasis—reweights every prior detail without stating a moral.

No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers in whether the city can heal, but the studio’s quiet bloom asserts possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: wonder persists not through human speech but resonant matter. The final image—child touching ice, seeing “whales sang in oceans that would become this ice”—offers a non-literal answer: truth is ancestral vibration, not vocabulary. Avoids moralizing; subtext lives in action (fading hands regaining color, blue shadows on clouds). Recurring “glisten” motif shifts from fragility to promise, reweighting all prior silence as necessary sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme—miniaturizing inherited trauma to achieve fragmented wholeness—emerges organically from concrete particulars: the tin box, coiled spring, moth wing. No moralizing; insight arises through the burn’s alchemy, where terror-dimensions collapse inward. The final image reweights the premise: silence “finally made sense,” roses bloom from ash, and the machine kneels “nostalgic for becoming.” Ambiguity lingers (Is Emma’s ghost real? Is wholeness sustainable?), but the emotional aftereffect—quiet resolution through contained chaos—is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from object (locket), action (listening), and setting (courtyard as archive). The final display of letters offers a non-literal answer: healing isn’t abstract—it’s archived testimony made public. Avoids moralizing; instead, resonance builds through specific voices (Mrs. Chen’s baby cry, Mr. Dominquez’s late love letter). The locket’s warmth as it “absorbs every word” subtly reframes curation as emotional stewardship—a repricing earned through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: vulnerability, when structured with discipline (dance, code, web), becomes liberatory force. The spider’s completed web and Lyra’s final bow reprice “weakness” as strategic patience. No moralizing—resonance lives in images: dice grins shifting from terror to triumph, water as both tomb and baptism. The journal’s discovery by rescuers implies cyclical hope without tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of memory, grief, and gravity—not as stated moral but through concrete particulars: pressed violets, brine-hardened crystals, the whale’s salvage. The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question (“Can lost memories be reclaimed?”): yes, but only by understanding their burial site, and never without cost. Subtext thrives in silence—the unspoken exchange between Kael and Mara carries more weight than dialogue. No sentimentality; the emotional aftereffect lingers in the whale’s distant song, carrying “memories the world tried to delete.”

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as both protector and thief, peace as potentially ignorant. No moralizing—instead, resonance accrues through the cranes’ transformation from instruments to vessels bearing “the weight of what had been unmade.” The final question (“was peace worth the price of ignorance?”) reframes all prior action without answer, inviting reflection. Motif of folding—sharp enough to “cut through the veil of what-might-be”—reweights creation as erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically: history is not what’s recorded but what’s preserved in silence, mortar, and gesture. Subtext thrives in absence—the unspoken basement, the nurses’ prayers etched in concrete, the “dead languages” that live in architecture. The ending offers no moral but a resonant reconfiguration: truth isn’t spoken but stamped, and memory endures through willing scribes. The final image—new tenants borrowing sugar—implies cyclical guardianship without sentimentality or explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between quarantine and cocoon, isolation and independence, with the final line offering a non-literal answer: true freedom holds connection without consumption. Subtext operates through the shell’s silence, the garden’s responsiveness, and the star’s vanishing—never stated outright. The story resists moralizing; wisdom is earned through Elara’s surrender, not declared. Recurring images (resonance structures as chords, velvet petals) accrue meaning without symbolic shouting.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the fusion of calligraphy, memory, and resistance: forging as forgiveness, absence turned to presence. The final image—Elara walking into dawn, chains sundered silently—offers a non-literal answer to “how do we heal unfinished wounds?” No moralizing; resonance arises from the thorn’s warmth and ink’s shimmer. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld: the father’s silence, the people’s whispers.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of voice, memory, and stone—echo as scar, as legacy, as cosmic resonance. The final insight (“some echoes are meant to be heard, not solved”) reframes the entire quest without moralizing. Subtext thrives in the seashell’s transformation and the canyon’s response, avoiding abstraction. However, the “conspiracy” subplot introduces a counter-theme (suppression of truth) that isn’t integrated into the ending’s resolution, slightly diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: fragile connections between worlds are sustained not by truth alone, but by curated kindness. The snow globes shift from broken artifact to gift, reweighting “salvage” as emotional stewardship rather than recovery. Subtext thrives in silence—what Maya omits speaks louder than what she reveals. Avoids moralizing; the final dream exchange offers resonance without explanation, though the “borrowed starlight” motif occasionally verges on overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from recurring images: nets, moon paths, fireflies, and whisk all refract “hidden effort” without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the whistle as thread weaving moonlight—reweighting prior material into a resonant tapestry. Avoids sentimentality by grounding wisdom in craft; the villagers’ continued ignorance preserves moral complexity without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme—truth as both weapon and burden in post-collapse societies—emerges organically from action, not assertion. The flawed diamond refracts not just gamma rays but moral clarity: protection for the elite, myth for the expendable. Final image reweights the orchard from miracle to engineered deception, offering a non-literal answer: salvation requires seeing through sanctioned lies. No moralizing; resonance arises from the coordinates etched in code and the daughter’s hidden refuge.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between measurable data and unmeasurable prophecy, technology and myth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: “the prophet be the storm that remembers” reweights all prior “ancient shadows” as necessary teachers for new light. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete acts (broadcasting shadow-patterns). Ambiguity lingers (Is Atlas dead? Is the child real?), but the cost—his erasure for collective awakening—is undeniable, avoiding sentimentality while embracing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through precise particulars: redemption isn’t earned through coins but through becoming a “bee collecting pollen from dead flowers.” The ending offers a non-literal answer—memory as communal currency—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the jar holding “only the silence between heartbeats”) and gesture (child feeling ancestral hands via paper). Ambiguity lingers: is preservation healing or haunting? Yet the final act—giving verses to wind—resolves the central question: forgetting is sweetened only when shared.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: grief as frequency, absolution as resonance. The final image—stars as “distant keyholes”—reweights the premise without moralizing: liberation requires both technical skill and empathetic surrender. Subtext thrives in silence (the keeper’s wordless gratitude) and object (key’s warm teeth humming “duet of deliverance”). Complexity endures—grief isn’t erased but transformed, and the engineer’s duality remains unresolved yet integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically: patience as wildness refined, not diminished. Subtext thrums in objects—the viaduct’s post-rain polarity shift mirrors the community’s internal recalibration. The final image offers non-literal resolution: people look up at a moon now “free to track their own paths,” reweighting Elara’s earlier mapping from observation to liberation. No moralizing; wisdom arises from concrete particulars—salvaged rail transmitters, basalt shards, lunar azimuths.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of past and present: freedom’s legacy demands truth-telling in the face of power. The lantern’s reappearance reweights its meaning—from escape guide to truth beacon—without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the clockwork heart: forgiveness isn’t rewound but rebuilt. No moralizing—the insight arises through Marlowe’s action (“making something that deserves to exist in its place”) and the chaplain’s silent shift. The final melody carries ambiguity: it offers neither absolution nor redemption, only earned resonance. Recurring images (light, dust, fracture lines) accrue meaning without forced symbolism, resisting tidy binaries while honoring complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through particulars: machinery’s “desire” mirrors human yearning, where creation transcends utility. The bell’s backward/forward broadcast reframes all action as communion across time—no moral stated, only embodied in Zephyr’s grin at “unnecessary” beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: truth persists in digital shadows, and memory resists corporate erasure. The recurring numbers function as both motif and evidence, culminating in the realization they’re a “hidden fingerprint.” The ending offers a non-literal answer—the lost are “present in every byte, every note, every number”—without moralizing. However, the theme leans slightly toward assertion in the final paragraph (“truth, like data, never truly disappears”), bordering on thematic echo that nudges it below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: empathy as active, costly practice—not passive feeling—is woven through action (blood donation), object (crystal reconstitution), and setting (orchard responding to communal courage). The final lines reprice “peacekeeping” as equipping communities to change together, avoiding moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (“weighted breath”), gesture (boy’s trembling palm), and image (shadows as vigilant friends). No false equivalence: magic without empathy is explicitly condemned as “control in a finer dress,” giving the theme ethical teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: endings are not absences but transitions audible in ice and wind. The parasol tip and photograph accrue meaning without moralizing.

The final image—a thread in the world’s fabric awaiting the next prophet—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of preservation. Recurring motifs (murmur → hymn → lullaby) reweight the premise without moralizing. However, the “strangely honest” refrain edges toward label-speak, slightly diluting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: healing is incorporation, not erasure. This is dramatized through the archivist’s method—arranging wounds into “patterns of beauty”—not stated until the child’s question, and even then, it’s framed as a map, not a moral. The final line (“turning rust into perfume and grief into grace”) risks sentimentality but earns it through accumulated imagery. Subtext thrives in silence: visitors’ “silent prayers,” ghost-laughter, silver shadows made tangible—all imply what words cannot.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through the crystal’s fractured sequences: knowledge grows not by addition but by emotional sedimentation and eventual erosion. The ending reweights “growth” as loss, not progress, without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: clinging to echoes is not about possession but surrender. The spiral—a futile trap—becomes a gift for future pilgrims, reweighting “capture” as transmission.

Final image resonates beyond plot: the hum persists in rusted machines, inviting others to listen, echoing the story’s own lyrical form.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: the tension between constancy (light speed) and ephemerality (falling leaf, dying star) resolves not in victory but in attuned listening.

No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the recurring whisper, avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: understanding shadows requires stewardship, not domination.

The recurring serpent loop motif reweights from symbol to functional circuit, embodying cyclical responsibility without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.5)

Subtext operates in silence (Moira’s waiting gaze), gesture (tooth as worry stone), and reweighted motifs (constellations become corrections). Complexity is embraced—Elena is wrong but forgivable; Moira is victim yet agent—without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges purely through image and action: stillness as vessel, reflection as generosity, earthbound hands channeling celestial light. No moralizing—only the quiet transformation of sea glass into shared constellations. The final image reweights everything: stars aren’t just watched; they’re mirrored, multiplied, made accessible. This non-literal answer to “How can one give what one cannot hold?” resonates without explanation, embodying wisdom earned through tactile labor and communal trust.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as fertile ground, not void; truth as something tended, not just spoken. The moss-over-keyboards image reframes betrayal as possibility without moralizing. Final resonance lies in the spiral pattern—each drip-mark a day of resilience—reweighting viral exposure into slow, communal healing. No platitudes; wisdom arises from icicle physics and bee navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the fusion of grief, patience, and cartography: loss can be navigated, not erased, through ritualized attention. The final image—a sleeping child bathed in warmth while the plate glows—offers a non-literal answer: love is a path safekept in starlight, not a destination. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (silver dots as heartbeats, rusted wire as memory). Ambiguity lingers (is the child real or spectral?), but emotional honesty avoids sentimentality through embodied restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of preservation: wonder cannot be locked away but must be released to endure. The final image—echoes shared, not harvested—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how to hold time without breaking it. No moralizing; insight arises from quartz refraction and marble acoustics. Ambiguity lingers (scars remain), yet meaning accrues through concrete particulars: frozen mercury, tuning forks, off-center angles.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: creation as self-imprisonment and liberation, burdens as measurable yet paradoxical weights. The final image—the sphere in the burner, grotto exhaling “true silence”—offers non-literal answer: forgiveness isn’t external but woven from acknowledged pain.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the carved lion, rain droplets, steam, and quartz refract the central question—how to hold what is gone. Subtext operates through silence (the hollow eyes), gesture (pressing the prism), and image (rain as lens of the past).

The story resists tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers in the lion’s “expectant” gaze, inviting reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)

The final line (“negotiating peace in the quiet above the clouds”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (Can fragments ever cohere?), yet the cost of erosion is undeniable, avoiding sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: renewal isn’t about restoring function but repurposing decay into shared meaning. The equation “Hope equals Flow times Purpose divided by Time” risks sentimentality but earns its place through concrete antecedents—water lines, solar current, children’s laughter. Final image reweights the premise: the terminal never launches ships again, yet becomes a “different kind of launchpad,” offering a non-literal answer to abandonment. No moralizing; subtext lives in creased paper rockets and humming metal.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically: time as vessel for grief, not measurement. The final image—a blank crystal inscribed for the present—offers a non-literal answer to “why time must be silent”: because healing requires surrender, not control.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: truth resides in silence, lies in structure. The final image—Elara tracing pulsing tunnels under lantern light—reweights the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme—preservation as living practice, not static archive—emerges through rope, seeds, and silence, never stated outright. The final image reweights the entire premise: knowledge survives not in vaults but in tools handled daily. Subtext thrives in Kessler’s tea, Elara’s smile, the unspoken pact.

    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the thread, golden leaves, and silent harbor accrue meaning without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—“healing is… a weaving of loss and hope”—that reweights prior images (e.g., the carpet as collective memory).

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of light-as-information versus light-as-combustion, interrogating whether preservation requires sacrifice. Subtext thrives in silence: petals “sigh,” gears “whisper in binary,” and serenity is “troubling.” The ending offers a non-literal answer: light without fire is still a kind of burning, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost—understanding demands eternal repetition. No moralizing; resonance arises from Elara’s dissolution into mist while her daughter begins to glow.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: ribbons, chisels, migration. No moralizing—insight arises when Kael realizes grief’s shape lives “in the spaces between the words.” The spiral memorial reweights every prior mention of poetry, loss, and craft.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of timekeeping, guilt, and geological instability—absolution as incremental labor, not grand gesture. The final image (“tide marks—incremental, undeniable, restoring balance one careful swing at a time”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: how do communities heal foundational fractures? Subtext operates through silence (between pendulum swings), erasure (sea washing the ridge), and redistribution of weight—never stated as moral. Complexity endures: Marten’s sacrifice is noble but insufficient; truth alone doesn’t heal—it must be wound into daily practice.

    Theme emerges organically: silence holds intention, grief demands decoding, and stewardship is an act of love. The tapestry’s border—frayed then smoothed—mirrors the transformation from hidden pain to honored memory. Final insight (“intentions woven into the fabric of silence”) avoids moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext thrives in gesture (tracing threads, returning nightly), and ambiguity lingers without confusion—yet the near-repetition of “calloused yet gentle” edges toward redundancy.

    Theme emerges organically: transformation as sustained practice, not revolution. The kingfisher’s dive—patient, precise—mirrors Kaelen’s method, reweighted in the closing line as “a pen poised forever.” No moralizing; subtext lives in objects (quill, vellum, ore thread) and actions (sanding ink, tracing boreholes).

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from ash, porcelain, and vanishing perspective—not stated but embodied.

The recurring lullaby motif shifts from comfort to unresolved rhythm, offering a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: competing narratives aren’t debated abstractly but tested against sediment compression rates and thermal fractures. The ending offers a non-literal answer—truth as craft, not comfort—via the cog’s geometry, reweighting all prior talk of sailors, masons, and mathematicians into a single artifact of method. Subtext thrives in absence: the patrol’s confusion at “math” reveals society’s loss of epistemic literacy. No moralizing; resonance inheres in brass notches waiting centuries for a reader who understands their language.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through the rosette’s negative space: what we remove (noise, armor, inherited distrust) allows humanity to breathe. No moralizing—insights arise from Marco’s middle C, Amina’s fifth, the leaf pressed between erased scores.

However, the closing whisper to stars edges toward sentimentality, slightly softening the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically: routine becomes revelation only when infused with wonder. The riddle (“What stores honey but is not a hive…”) crystallizes the central question, answered not didactically but through Mara’s action—memory as vessel for awe.

    Theme emerges organically: attention sanctifies the mundane, and silence is animate. The final image—houses humming with “shard of hush”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in displaced objects as prayers, avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from Petra’s arc: absolute truth kills; nuance sustains. The foxglove—deadly yet healing—embodies this without didacticism, its recurrence shifting from rebellion symbol to active agent of reclamation. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: animate lifeless breathing together proves truth’s multiplicity. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars—stone lips cracking, silver chains swaying—and the cost (a drowned city) makes ambiguity necessary, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through action: regret isn’t dissolved but carried, imperfect and weighted like the dice. The final image reweights the entire climb—not as prison but as penance.

The central question—can beauty reawaken dormant kindness?—is answered non-literally through Mira’s herb bundle and the subsequent tokens, not moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence: Kael watches unseen, affirming that kindness need not be reciprocated to be real.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: cultural survival requires not just preserving objects but reigniting displaced people’s spirit. The final image—children dancing to the harp’s note while Liora whispers a name—offers a non-literal answer: memory is alive when enacted, not archived. Recurring elements (bread, lens, harp) accrue meaning without moralizing; the “rosewater dread” never vanishes, resisting tidy optimism. Subtext thrives in silence—the unspoken grief in initials shaped in dough, the unsung beekeeper—and the ending resonates because it earns complexity, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from action: reversing clocks and yoyos becomes metaphor for defying deterministic fate, crystallized when latent radiance spills “like liquid silver.” The ending offers a non-literal answer—hope isn’t permanence but repeatable defiance—reweighting “bleakness” into “brilliance” without moralizing. Recurring images (counter-clockwise motion, low tide’s exhale) shift meaning: initially ominous, they become tools of agency. Subtext thrives in silence (keeper’s trembling beard) and implication (velvet pouch as future key), avoiding abstraction or sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of trauma, memory, and fear’s parasitic nature—never stated but dramatized via the photograph’s transformation and the clasp’s spent light. The final paradox (“the dead teach… only the revived can speak”) resonates as earned wisdom, not moralizing. Subtext thrives in the repulsive allure of the faces and the advisor’s riddling voice, avoiding binaries while affirming survivorship as ontological rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through action: turning threat into voice reframes conflict as co-creation, not conquest. Final image reweights prior material—the orchard isn’t saved but integrated into the storm’s score—offering a non-literal answer to “how to survive wandering.” No moralizing; subtext lives in apples clicking like castanets and rain playing an invited coda. Complexity endures: survival demands perpetual labor, yet wonder persists in “restless euphony.”

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from calcium geometries and fractured whistles: curiosity’s death is recorded, not punished. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the question mark carved into Old Merra’s shell reweights the premise from seeking answers to sustaining inquiry. Subtext thrives in silence, spiral patterns, and the watchers’ subtle turn; no moralizing intrudes. Complexity abides—Kael accepts her mother’s fate without rejecting her mission, embracing ambiguity as method.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through parallels between station decay and historical erosion, avoiding moralizing. The final image—roses blooming from honest history—offers a non-literal answer to whether truth must destroy compassion. However, the “noble lie” concept isn’t tested through character dilemma; Emlyn’s resolution feels harmonious rather than costly, softening thematic tension between mercy and accountability.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges entirely through particulars: botanist’s conservatory, widow’s teahouse, blank locket—not abstract “loss.” Subtext thrives in silence (Elias never admits weeping) and action (sealing brass notes underwater). The final image offers a non-literal answer: ruins are not rubble but archives, and archaeology is an act of love. No moralizing; resonance accrues via concrete rituals that reweight absence as presence, making “interlaced absence” a lived, not stated, truth.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of truth enduring through archival care emerges organically from Mira’s actions and objects (stamp, watermark). Subtext resides in silence, ritual, and light—no moralizing. Final image reweights “stillness” as active resistance, not passivity. However, “reclaimed stillness” borders on abstract mantra; deeper moral ambiguity (e.g., Was hiding the book right?) is hinted but not wrestled with, limiting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of craft and grief: transformation requires making pain thin enough to fly yet sharp enough to wound. The final image—“a grief so bright it cast no shadows”—reweights the entire narrative without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer to whether loss can be redeemed. Subtext thrives in silence (the unspoken bargain with the shadow) and object (glass cranes that sing instead of fly). The story resists sentimentality by binding hope to torment—each crane releases “luminous torment,” not solace.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the hunt for “unspent futures,” never stated outright. The geode’s refraction of starlight in the final beat offers a non-literal answer: potential persists not as fuel but as memory. Subtext thrives in silence—the children’s unfinished cake, the aunt from Kiev—inviting reflection without moralizing. The story resists redemption or vengeance, embracing the unbearable weight of unlived lives with quiet, devastating honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from object (chip), action (pulling pinions), and setting (observatory as liminal archive). The final waveform of “belonging” reweights the premise without moralizing—it’s a non-literal answer to “where do we stand?” Subtext thrives in contrasts: silicon vs. stone, sharp eyes vs. feeling without sight. Ambiguity lingers (the walking pilgrim), resisting tidy closure while affirming resonance as cosmic typeface.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of forged vs. real memory, with the driftwood carvings and broken watch hand accruing meaning without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth surfaces like tide-polished wood, and time can be mended even if memory cannot be forged. Avoids moralizing, embracing complexity—his regret remains, but is no longer a chain. However, the phrase “memory cannot be forged forever” borders on thematic echo, slightly undercutting subtextual restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the hinge metaphor: small actions (“smallest hinge could swing wide a heavy door”) reconfigure massive consequences. The drawer pull’s journey—from memory to gift—answers the central question: Can past wounds seed future wisdom? Yes, but slowly, imperfectly. No moralizing; resonance lives in the brass warming in Lin’s palm and the fog-shrouded shore of forgiveness. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: navigation as presence, not precision. The recurring image of utility poles transforms from failure (“rusted sentinels”) to constellations of human persistence, culminating in the cemetery visit where grace replaces guilt. No moralizing—insight arises from concrete particulars (sister’s laugh, warm compass). The final stars “finally aligned” reprice the premise: alignment is internal, not cartographic.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of a “clean slate seeker with a dirty past” and the baseball’s dual role as artifact and key. The final image—dawn touching indifferent towers while Kael clutches a time-traveler’s relic—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: empathy persists through small, charged objects. Avoids moralizing, though “delicately robust hope” edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: love transcends form, constancy exists within change. The final image—a feral grin holding “warmth of a thousand shared sunrises”—offers a non-literal answer to loss, reweighting the opening’s “ghost in moonlight” into embodied presence. Motifs (spices, moonlight, fortune) accrue meaning without moralizing. The CR lies in redefining “bond” as cosmic intimacy beyond physicality, with cost legible in her bestial eyes and dual heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the cracked saucer, unbound hair, onyx ink—all accrue meaning without moralizing. The final image offers a non-literal answer: time accumulates in the body’s metamorphosis, and cracks are sites of beauty, not damage. Subtext operates through silence (no dialogue), gesture (tracing, unfastening), and implication (“she had been both vessel and thief”). The story resists tidy resolution, embracing ambiguity—repentance isn’t absolution but understanding—and avoids pseudo-profundity by grounding insight in porcelain, skin, and mist.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: true pacifism requires absorbing and transforming violence, not avoiding it. The stitched tapestry reweights Li’s suffering from burden to purpose without moralizing. Final image—Maya mending the hull with thread imbued with hard-won wisdom—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Complexity endures: salvation is rejected for stewardship, mercy for endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from Kael’s actions: transformation as vibration, not texture; giving as mutual salvation. The final image—bugs spiraling like planets, cleansing water unseen—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Recurring motifs (bottles, light, hush) shift meaning: containment becomes release, isolation becomes connection. Subtext thrives in silence—the village calls it miracle; Kael knows himself vessel—inviting reflection without false equivalence or sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: locks, gears, powder, and light reconfigure from instruments of control into vectors of freedom. The ending offers a non-literal answer—revolution as silent reconfiguration, not explosion—repricing “security” as vulnerability. No moralizing; resonance accrues via the bronze quill’s complicit smile and the reset sundial. Complexity endures: liberation arrives via subterfuge, not virtue.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: order isn’t imposed but witnessed in transient moments. The final image—grooves in sand, repainted rocks, sliding with the world—reprices the premise without moralizing. Sacred patterns as “painted rocks in an endless sequence” resonates non-literally, rejecting solution for participation. No thematic echo or abstraction; ambiguity lingers (will friction fully return?) while emotional honesty avoids sentimentality. The aurora’s “silent nod” deepens subtext: cosmic acknowledgment of human-scale endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: censorship leaves scars that become cartography of survival. The final line—"scars were the true cartography of survival"—is earned through concrete particulars (blackout, tongue scars, hidden poem), not moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, sealed envelopes, and ghost timetables. The ending offers a non-literal answer: truth isn’t delivered but carried, mapped in the body and hidden in obsolete systems.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the needle card’s “hidden overture,” the sundial’s coded angles, and fencing as intellectual combat coalesce into a resonant answer—chaos made grace through disciplined inquiry. No moralizing; the final image of Rhen walking toward “the next horizon” reweights all prior waiting as active preparation. Ambiguity lingers (What questions await?), but the cost of clarity—loneliness, perpetual readiness—is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from action: anarchy isn’t theorized but practiced through book-sharing, shelf-building, and whispered verses. The final image—“beauty carved from chaos”—answers the central question non-literally, reweighting earlier despair into generative defiance. No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete particulars (coffee grounds hiding seeds, wildflowers cracking pavement). Ambiguity lingers: is resistance sustainable? But the cost—his ever-changing self tethered to one cause—is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: time and love may shatter but persist as resonance, not restoration. The final image—a silent clock, playing toward parallel time—offers a non-literal answer to whether longing can reshape fate, reweighting all prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (gripping sheet music like a lifeline) and silence (the clock’s stopped hands). Ambiguity lingers—will she hear?—but complexity is anchored in concrete particulars, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: binary equations vs. salt-harvest chants, spectrograph readings vs. bone-deep hums. The ending reweights “reality” as existing between proof and belief—no moral stated, only shown via golden petals and elders’ humming bones. Subtext thrives in objects: the seed dissolves, but its map remains, embodying memory as process. Ambiguity lingers (“luminous doubt”) without confusion, resisting tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from bonsai practice: healing as cultivation, not repair. The final image—blue-green moving through leaves like tide water—offers a non-literal answer to severance: presence without possession. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from lapis pigment, copper wire, and moss-bound roots. Subtext thrives in silence, lace patterns, and the compass’s recalibration—never stated, always shown.
