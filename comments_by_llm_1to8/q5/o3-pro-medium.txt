  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around creation/survival sharing a rhythm; the pause as purpose is dramatized by the overnight vigil and measured escape. Recurring images (heat vs. cold, glass vs. blade, resonance) deepen meaning without sermonizing; the final line reframes identity as chosen shape. One or two lines verge on thesis‑statement, but the closing cadence reweights prior material rather than telling us what to think. The irony of her sculptures recast into weapons adds moral texture.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)

Ambiguity remains purposeful (balance required) rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of mutual aid, intergenerational continuity, and porous exile emerge organically from action and image (bells circulating, lullabies, returned donations).

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silence as language and weapon threads motif to meaning; the afterimage/dawn conceit offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the opening prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)

Slight neatness keeps it from higher ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)

Subtext in the oracle’s clinical mercy and Mara’s crafted uncertainty ratio avoids didacticism. The final image reweights all prior particulars without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: faith vs. measurement, labor (ghost shift) vs. guilt, and machinery as secular sacrament. The recurring images (rosary wheel, timecards, schedules) reconfigure at the end when value becomes a private metric instead of currency. No moralizing; the final choice (“off the clock”) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about when accounting must stop. The swallowed logbook elegantly literalizes memory and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of memory, neutrality, and renewal emerges through specific events (regenerative silence, origins in catacombs, the boat of blanked paper) rather than thesis. The final image conceptually reprices neutrality—witnessing as costly endurance, not abdication.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of keepsakes as time-bound proofs that re-enter the present is woven through the curl, lullaby, and eclipse, culminating in communal transfer (warm box into the teens’ palms). “Ordinary magic” is earned through concrete action and ambiguity rather than moralizing.

One line edges toward statement (“to nurture lifelong wonder”), but it’s substantiated by events.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: memory as moral axis, listening as lever, archives as living cogs. The dragon‑rod embroidery and “displaced axis” phrase accrue meaning and reweight the final wind‑tilt without sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on ethics of preservation and repair through image rather than thesis. Ambiguity around “lever” remains purposeful and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of secrecy, revelation, and cost integrate through recurring “open secret,” music/key metaphors, and the broadcast-as-aurora image. The final “key change” reweights prior material without didactic closure. One explicit thesis line (“secrets are only cages we pretend are keys”) edges toward on-the-nose, but surrounding images earn it. The aftereffect is reflective and specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—assumptions as demonic footholds; silence as architectural tool; absolution as daring to mark emptiness—emerges through concrete acts, not thesis. The palette’s reweighting and the “cathedral of hush” convert rhetoric into moral action.

The final cadence offers a non-literal answer: carry light that doesn’t burn, with remembered guilt as ballast.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars: silence as instrument, communal feeling over virtuosity, and the ethics of sharing art.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of reframing grief through sensory vessels emerges organically from particulars (lanterns as memory, fern inscription, UV “remember kindly what hurts you”). The ending reweights prior images, but one explicit statement—“teaching citizens that the impact of memories was choice as much as chemistry”—edges toward didactic. Subtext otherwise lives in image (color shift of moss, “duplicate moon” smile). Resonance lingers without false symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of compassion, memory, and time’s fabric emerge organically through object, setting, and action; the villanelle motif recasts choice as rhythmed ethics.

Nevertheless, the closing reprices the premise without moralizing the end.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of finding beauty in incompletion and listening as making are enacted, not declared, through the bonfire tradition, echo-reading, and the refusal to polish.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematic coherence—honoring invisible labor, mistake → map—is woven through actions and motifs (compass/locket, orchestra/harbor). The slogan “After the symphony ends, gratitude begins” risks explicit moralizing yet is earned by the concrete gathering.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of kinship-as-fabric emerges organically through craft actions and charged objects; the final resolve to tend the place reweights prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)

The resonance is durable and non‑didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)

The final charged poise reweights the premise without tidy moralizing. The motifs (magnetism, hum, light) return with altered meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme grows organically from particulars: reconstruction through surrender, belonging to a slow conversation, and the cost of crossing thresholds. The mantra reframes agency and returns to charge the ending without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: memory, reciprocity, and listening to water recur and culminate in a covenant reframing insomnia. Subtext works in images (plankton in font, barnacled statues, rotating droplets) and the exchange ethic. The explicit sentence “Water remembers who listens” risks a thematic echo that slightly reduces ambiguity even as it resonates. Final choices still reweight prior material with earned emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: wonder thrives when shared; prophecy’s limits versus presence; witness as amplification.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: maps vs destinations, routes not taken, and the ethics of truth. The final ticket’s line (“Destinations pretend too”) reweights earlier material without lecturing, and the outward‑pointing arrows deepen resonance. A couple of aphoristic lines (“Maps show paths...”) flirt with telling, but they’re grounded in action and choice. The aftertaste is contemplative rather than pat.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of consolation, epistemic humility, and courageous kindness arise from particulars (tile → music → shared archive). The final configuration (matched lenses) resonates, though a couple lines veer toward overt thesis. Subtext persists in the whales’ unheard/now‑heard motif and the mentor’s unspoken past. The piece avoids sentimentality by tethering insight to action.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme crystallizes through particulars: goodbyes as coordinates, mutiny vs. lullaby, and the refusal that reweights longing. The final repricing feels organic and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of archival ethics, the cost of knowledge, and time as loom emerge through action and image, not lecture. The town’s pact and Calix’s endurance refract into a charged, morally complex ending: preservation over intervention, grace purchased in secret.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of erasure, bureaucracy, memory texture, and identity are dramatized through concrete acts (notebook embossing, taped confessions, tides). The poison label reweights the personal with the archival. Occasional aphoristic lines are earned by scene work and do not lapse into moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal stance rather than a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: truth as evanescent alignment and reality as iterative retelling is earned through the specific sound/memory experiment and confession. Subtext operates in the witty “conversing with ruins” and the forgiving sailor, avoiding sermon. One explicit thesis line (“reality is a story the cosmos retells…”) edges toward declaration but is context‑earned. The ending’s charged poise resists tidy moralizing by preserving cost and ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of communal ownership, art-as-infrastructure, and immigration/gentrification ethics arise from events, not lecture. The “paint, then law” refrain reframes power and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—memory vs. manufactured progress; witnessing as resistance—emerges through particulars (stolen grain, phased flares, “last unmanufactured morning”). Subtext is carried in the hush, the cracked vial, and the drones’ practical voices cutting the vigil. Insights are earned, not moralized, with the final cadence repricing what “space age” means. A hair of explicitness in the archival frame is present but does not flatten the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motifs (ripples, light, feedback) accrue into a theme of faith in pattern recognition; the final synchronization image resonates. The line “Direction is only hidden until we decode the feedback we already carry” reads as a thesis statement and slightly over‑articulates what the images already earn. Subtext in Mara’s method and Rowan’s dawning respect largely carries the weight. Emotional aftereffect is contemplative and earned, if a touch didactic at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres around memory vs inscription, map vs margin, and convergence as both hydrology and polyphony. “Water remembers” transforms from phrase to enacted rule; the final choice to speak the atlas reweights all prior images without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ephemerality, memory, and stewardship accrue through concrete actions (the vial’s “last sunset” used to buy minutes, then withheld). The “lonesome splendor” tone deepens rather than lectures; even the scholar’s thesis statements are grounded in mosaic scenes. The last lines reweight the journey without moralizing, turning survival into a charged custodianship. Ambiguity lingers productively around what it means to carry a stolen sunset within.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of story as communal bond versus escapist self‑erasure emerges through action (confessional lattice, hush’s lure, patrol’s pause). The ending’s repricing—“stories were meant to be shared”—is resonant though one line verges on explicit thesis. Inheritance and confession subtext thread cleanly; the copper→gold tonal shift seals the moral cost without tidy sentimentalism. Ambiguity remains around the prison’s secrets, which enriches without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Debt, return, and recompense deepen through concrete images (constellations of forgotten moments, seeds sowing new chances). The final image reweights the premise without moralizing, marrying mournful elation to cost. The bead’s reprise and the greenhouse’s “dawn‑colored steam” deliver an earned repricing of meaning. Ambiguity (invitation/farewell) lingers productively.

    Themes of refashioning prohibition into reverence are embodied through tactile acts (sewing metal to paper; feeding the loom with blood).

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through particulars—interrupted journeys literalized in etchings, diaspora return framed by the sundial’s reactivation—rather than through moralizing. The ending reweights earlier images (orchard, shadow, missing groove) into a resonant answer about faith as rebuilt practice. One or two lines approach aphorism, but they’re earned by scene pressure. Subtext hums in silence and gesture (not speaking as villagers watch).

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—margins eclipsing text, anonymity as shelter, preservation versus speed—emerges through objects and ritual rather than thesis. The final shift to “drafting sentiments” reweights prior motifs and avoids tidy moralizing. One line (“Because margins have grown louder than texts”) veers toward explicit statement but is supported by scene. Subtext in the chalk/emoticon keys lands with resonant aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes—truth versus misinformation, art as resistance, and wisdom masked as folly—arise through image and tactic, not thesis. The eternal candle and “adjacent possibilities” refract into a meditation on how knowledge survives authoritarian pressure. The final laugh-and-move beat reweights earlier “echoed silence” into charged resolve. Complexity remains without false balance or tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of communication, paralysis, and compassion emerge through image and act, not moralizing. The unsent/sent letters motif reweights at the end, transforming absence from abandonment to mirrored paralysis. The final charged poise—healed seam that proves truth spoken—offers a resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity remains humane without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically through coral/cast motifs and the translator’s reframed duty; the ending reweights prior images without sermonizing. “Let what was broken remember its pattern...” functions as a resonant answer rather than a moral, grounded by concrete acts (placing and returning the coral). The “shared anxieties” thread integrates with the mission and closure. Occasional aphoristic lines (“Words sometimes suture...”) flirt with statement but remain earned.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of memory as communal, reparable infrastructure emerges through acts (coaxing echoes into song, reciprocity with place) rather than moralizing. The blend of art and network reframes joy as a shared system, not just nostalgia. The last image reweights the premise—restored joy sustains a public space. Subtext about technology as caretaker, not thief, is gracefully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: curiosity as living force versus the cage of certainty, enacted by questions, pauses, and echoes that answer with “Deep in your waiting.” Subtext blooms in the intervals—waiting without breath, citizens “tasting the interval”—and the final charged poise reweights the premise. A few direct statements (“Certainty…was a cage”) edge toward telling but are mostly earned by scene. The resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of language as resistance against monetized cognition emerges organically from action (living syntax, ant codes, “Not every silence has agreed”). Final image reweights prior material: “one word isn’t enough… tomorrow we plant a sentence” reframes defiance as cumulative text. The piece resists moralizing while making a pointed social argument through concrete particulars. Subtext in “curiosity accrues interest” and the auditor taxed by paradox deepens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through image and action: bartering despair for color via a “blossom armistice.” The elder’s explanation flirts with on-the-nose but is redeemed by the concrete ritual of planting and the reweighted final images (vines lighting corridors, seeds abroad). The ending offers a resonant answer: beauty requires reconciliation, not erasure, of hurt. Ambiguity lingers productively (cost of identity shift, future wanderers).

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of language death, custodianship, and transforming regret into purpose emerge organically through concrete acts (mending by song; giving mouths back). The final image reweights the premise: the library as archive‑garden with a charged duty ahead, not a neat fix. No moralizing; resonance lingers via the “trace of foxglove regret.” The motifs (song, chime, orchids, mirrors) evolve rather than repeat.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: truth as music, promises as binding—and silence reinterpreted as rest rather than rupture. Motifs (ink well, ribbons, humming) return charged at the end without didactic summary. The line “restore trust after silence” risks on‑the‑nose but is dramatized by the archive’s response and the final cadence. The piece invites reflection on consent and enforced honesty without collapsing into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: mechanisms coupled with compassion, matter and spirit “twin heartbeats.” The closing cadence reweights the premise toward ongoing negotiated equilibrium rather than triumphal control. A few lines verge on stating thesis (“encrypted compassion was not cowardice”) but are supported by on‑page action that earns them. The final image carries ambiguity with responsibility rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: paper trails reframed from condemnation to becoming; trust as release rather than ledger balance. The “blooming withering” motif returns in the final line without moralizing, reweighting earlier images (pressed flowers, ash snow). The graduate’s plea and the meteorite’s “older than oceans” song enlarge the inquiry into stewardship and risk. Resonance lingers beyond plot without tidy certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of “necessary distances” integrates with image and action; the final choreography metaphor (“Stand apart so the wind can finish singing”) reweights prior details without moralizing. The maze as prayer/agriculture and the cathedral of absence are potent reconfigurations. Ambiguity is purposeful, not vague; resonance lingers in the decision to keep the threshold sacred until it can be relinquished.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Belonging emerges through image and act—breath-synced shrimp, star/avenue overlays, the keystone feather—and culminates in a resonant renunciation. The line “Belong, the city sang” edges toward on-the-nose but is offset by the final reframing (“belonging is rhythm… between notes”) and the sunrise ascent. Subtext operates in ritual and exchange, not moralizing. The final image reweights prior motifs with durable ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece offers an earned, non‑literal answer: silenced emotion consumes routes; restoring feeling restores wayfinding. Thematic images recur and reweight (foam → seeds → glyphs → map), and the ending respects loss while allowing elation. No sermonizing; the counter‑taste of sorrow remains. Complexity is present though not morally thorny.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: curated chance transforms grief, ambition, ridicule, and disillusion into reweighted possibilities. Recurring images (bishop, tide, coins, fireworks) accrue meaning and the final drift reprises the argument about surrender versus control. A few thesis statements (“nothing here was coincidence and nothing was forced”) slightly overdeclare, but they don’t flatten the closing image. The ending offers a resonant answer: wonder as disciplined attention and relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of art under prohibition, memory’s materiality, and self-chosen anchoring emerge through concrete acts rather than thesis. The moonstone as crystallized nostalgia reframes remembrance as contraband and fuel, reweighted by the ending’s “origin, not oubliette.” Subtext runs through absence-as-method and the land becoming “mortal skin.” A faintly declarative note (“origin, not oubliette”) skirts didacticism but remains earned by the preceding images.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of repair-through-fracture and mundanity transfigured arise organically from action (reweaving scraps; deckhands’ sudden pause). Subtext is carried by images (light bending toward crates, nets) and the pond’s reprise. A near-thesis line (“beauty adjusts the axis of perception”) states what the images already prove, slightly flattening resonance. Overall, the ending reweights earlier motifs effectively despite that explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through image and act: ash as first draft, shard as memory/possibility, stewardship of innocence, and translation as communal practice. Subtext hums in the shard exchange and the “space for future sketches,” avoiding moralizing. A couple of explicit thesis lines (“Pain, he believed, could be translated...”) slightly blunt subtlety. The final duet of footfalls delivers a resonant non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: disciplined, playful rigor as the engine of communal hope and compounding smallness. The spiral, gauge midpoint, and boat create a non-didactic answer to “how does hope move?” without moralizing. The final images reprice the premise with social cost (indirectness, time, and shared labor). No sermonizing; resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Legacy’s burden” is dramatized via the children’s anthem and Ori’s acoustic vaulting, culminating in Liora’s renunciation. Recurring images (walls’ dreams, ivy, echoes) accrue meaning rather than being declared. One or two aphoristic lines flirt with telling (“Legacy’s burden pulsed…”), but the ending reweights the premise without a moral. The final commitment reframes listening as stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of art as possibility, responsibility toward the vulnerable, and the ethics of mirroring emerge from action and image, not moralizing. Recurring motifs (mirrors, breath, bells, lullabies) reweight at the end, offering a non-literal answer: reality can be tuned to potential without erasing cost. One line states the thesis (“to persuade mirrors...”), but the final image earns it. The aftereffect is contemplative rather than sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    “Price of redemption” accrues through particulars (mentor’s death, ritual costs, grain over gold; children as noncombatant claimants). Subtext runs in objects and gestures (spit vs. benediction) rather than sermon. The line “redemption always demands interest” edges toward explicit thematics but is grounded by action. The final belief is a resonant repricing, not a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Redemption and the ethics of preservation vs. harm resolve through image and action, not sermon (“The release felt like reversing the direction of debt”). The echo motif reweights from aesthetic fetish to an ethic of repair as rain erases the crack-map. Subtext plays in silences (thunder “waiting” for the bird, Fyodor’s wet eyes), avoiding platitudes. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of listening as defiance accrues through image and act, culminating in an invitation rather than command. A few lines tilt toward thesis (“proof that silence was never duty,” “Conformity’s lullaby faltered”), trimming subtlety. Still, the final image reweights prior motifs (echoes, threads, prisms) without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on power and gentleness with credible ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme (“half‑lit epiphanies,” ethical revelation without coercion) rises organically from the candle practice, reversals, and the dome’s acoustics. The line “Ethical stories do not blind or flatter…” edges toward explicit moralizing, though it’s cushioned by action (silence, echo, offering tools) that carries the real statement. Recurring images (meteors, hush, stick, candle) meaningfully evolve toward the final charged quiet. The piece resists false equivalence and leaves room for reader complicity without blur.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.7)
    Resonance is strong around memory, caretaking, and deliberate impermanence; the midwife’s recovery reframes heritage and migration. Recurring motifs (knot, cadence, transience) deepen meaning without over‑explaining. However, the line “proof that overlooked histories can glow brighter than remembered ones” edges into thematic declaration in the final movement, dulling subtext. The image of the aureole already carried that meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of preservation, mercy over force, and forgiveness are enacted through specifics (rope responds to mercy; grooves hold breath of passersby). The final image—spring humming within bronze—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without didacticism. One line flirts with statement (“forged after forgiving yourself, never before”) but the surrounding scene earns it. Subtext runs through the gentleness ethic and communal stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: purpose survives through enacted motion; directives die unless “danced.” The wafer seal, the engineer’s laugh, and the storm braid into a non‑literal answer about agency and lineage across time. Subtext arrives through image (elk procession, seal warming) rather than moralizing. The closing reprices earlier motifs with lingering, confident ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme—devotion to discovery over deity—emerges organically through image and act, and the ending reweights earlier material (mystery can expand without losing equilibrium). The “He understood then…” line borders on explicit statement, slightly reducing subtextual charge. Still, the final cadence is resonant and avoids a moral. The costed sacrifice anchors the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Forgiveness as an embodied retraining (“Convince the cells…”) develops through object, environment, and memory rather than abstract commentary. The music box’s failure becoming music by touch, and the world’s brief steadiness, recast the premise without sermonizing. A single explicit prompt (“Release him…for yourself”) skirts moral statement but is earned by the preceding nonverbal persuasion. The final resonance—quiet drafted into reality’s rough drafts—lingers with conceptual heft.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of porous boundaries, naming/reflecting as capture, and wholeness through fracture accumulate via concrete images (breath as gear; frost as panes; footprints as windows). The final stance—grounded body aiming infinity—reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively about the ethics of capture versus companionship. It’s resonant and integrated, if gentler morally than it might be.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of repair vs. erasure, vows that shed and renew, and stories as non-violating currency accrue through concrete acts (grafting, resonance-tuning, ribbon bequeathal). Subtext works in image—petals as reaffirmed vows; the chalice-eye as sacrilege that heals. The final exchange of stories offers a resonant non-literal answer about what binds communities. One line (“stories never violated any contract worth keeping”) edges toward stating the thesis but remains earned in character.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece elegantly interrogates “What lineage does silence inherit?” and reframes knowledge as participatory and self-altering. Recurring images (mirror, cameo, orchard, punctuation breath) evolve meaningfully to deliver a resonant answer. One slightly didactic line (“Knowledge was forbidden not because it was hidden…”) leans explanatory, but the surrounding images carry the weight. The final turn to stewardship lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of debt, memory, and rescue refract through concrete acts (shelves conducting rescues; payment in memories; “renegotiation” of an impossible debt). The “unheard symphony” motif matures into a single forgiving tonic, reweighting prior unease. No moralizing; resonance lingers via Marrow’s admitted intention to “mend the damage he still intends to cause.” The ending’s conceptual repricing (who pays for avoided error) is earned by particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme coheres through recurring particulars (names, threads, gardens, “trapped freedom”) and reprices at the end (“gardens prefer wanderers to wardens”). Subtext hums in the cost of remembering as labor rather than epiphany. No moralizing; the final widening‑the‑cage image lingers with complexity. The “unkindled solace” idea runs through the garden’s rule and the siblings’ tempered exit.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme—clarity vs. absence—emerges organically from objects and acts, not sermonizing. The final image (“silence given citations,” dual‑crested seal) reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: history isn’t rewritten but clarified, a nuanced stance for an archivist. Subtext (anonymity as ethical stance) glows without being named.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of control vs. attunement (guiding the gale, “two silences pollinate”) accrues through particulars and resolves in a non‑didactic final image. Recurring objects reweight meaning: the echo stone shifts from extractor to communal mnemonic. The ending reframes calm as rhythm rather than place, an earned insight rooted in on‑page struggle. Ambiguity lingers productively without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story’s inquiry—do coincidences have meaning?—emerges through concrete events (retrovisions, the coin that saves a ship, slivers as recorded chance) and reconfigures at the end into communal hope. Subtext rides images (dark snow of hush, mauve‑silver foam) rather than moralizing; the final “lean” reframes the world’s stance. A minor deduction: the last sentence explicitly states the thesis, softening the otherwise impeccably shown resonance. Even so, the afterimage is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of preservation vs. petrification and humility in stewardship arise from concrete acts (what to keep, what to cut) rather than sermonizing. The mentor’s warning edges close to statement but is earned and immediately alters tactics. The final hush reweights earlier imagery into a promise rather than a tomb. Ambiguity remains purposeful, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: serious playfulness as insurgent method; “gravity” as opinion; absence made visible (starless night → perforated charts). Recurring images develop and reweight at the end without moralizing, and the final act offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about transforming despair into communal festival. Subtext hums in the protocol‑prisoned princess and silent mosaics “wanting” to be read.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: hinge moments, oblique coaxing, speech tuned to time’s corrugations. The ending’s image (stars leaning; the night’s discourse) reweights prior motifs without overexplaining. One near‑didactic line (“perhaps our task is simply to listen…”) brushes close to stating a moral, trimming peak resonance. Overall, subtext and image carry the load.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: hospitality vs. fortification, upward shelters, and silence as a shared, revalued resource. The doll and the emptied vial reweight prior material without moralizing; the final tune “tasted faintly of apology” lands a resonant answer. Subtext runs through image and action (costly generosity) rather than thesis. Ambiguity remains human, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through image and action: silence as craft, attention as care, transit internalized. The storm glass’s reweighting and “planting lanterns under water” provide resonant, earned metaphors. However, the explicit thematic line “Silence is the last conductor” risks didactic closure (thematic echo), slightly dulling the subtext’s strength. Even so, the final descent and cushioned whistle sustain a reflective after‑effect.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of decentralization and stewardship over sovereignty emerge organically through murals, the sigil, and the final staircase shared with future climbers. “Crowns were questions, not answers” skews a shade explicit but coheres with the imagery. The last image (waterfall resets; stair remains) reweights the premise elegantly. Ambiguity lingers productively around future climbers and costs to Kestrel.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of grief‑as‑care and thresholds is earned through particulars, not stated morals: bridges burned “carefully,” silence as co‑teacher, breath shaped into a sphere, river mouth opening. The final repricing—darkness that now “inhaled easily”—reweights earlier images with emotional truth. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme integrates through action: pressure as necessary weight vs fraudulent sparkle, reframed in the farm’s new economy. Recurring objects (bolt, mushrooms) shift meaning at the finale, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer: honest weight becomes communal light. One near‑aphoristic line (“They hunger to escape weight…”) brushes didacticism but remains earned by her history. The closing text risks moralizing but is brief and character‑consonant.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of knowledge as music, power, and responsibility accrue through objects and action rather than moralizing. The final image (revolution spinning in silence; truth carried “in bone”) reweights the premise with lingering complexity. Subtext (lawyer’s revolution vs. archivist’s restraint) is embedded, not told. Resonance persists without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: imagination over institution, authorship of reality through risk, transformation from knight to poet. The final naming reweights prior motifs without moralizing and produces a resonant aftereffect. A couple of lines verge on thesis (“imagine truer horizons”), slightly telegraphing intent. Overall, subtext and image do the heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particulars: unknown histories, bureaucratic sediment, kindness as counterforce. Recurring dust patterns move from quirk to methodology to pedagogy, culminating in an image that reprices endings. The “dust awaiting interpretation” line borders on thesis‑statement but is earned by scene. The last rain‑washed image sustains ambiguity without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of memory versus institutional erasure emerges through concrete actions: a relic key reopens testimony; breath repaints censored names. The ending’s conceptual repricing—an individual becoming a vessel for plural voices—reweights earlier images without moralizing. “Coded freedom” evolves from texture (“each blade a coded freedom”) to praxis (murals flaring where she breathes). Ambiguity about the longer‑term fallout keeps resonance alive.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of inheritance, the ethics of secrecy, and absence as a crafted presence arise organically from action. “Vested hush” and the mother’s lullaby refract into a final answer: purpose can sound like music even when unheard. No sermonizing; resonance is achieved through image and choice. The ending reweights prior motifs without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through enacted particulars: folklore and systematizing science reconcile in stewardship, memory, and care for “forgotten things.” The “emerges transformed always” line is reweighted by the ending, which reframes prophecy as ongoing labor rather than spectacle. The tiny monuments motif matures into green, humming candleflowers, giving a resonant, non‑literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity remains fertile.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—patterns vs chance, the ethics of recording—emerges through images (broken clocks, “tick that never tocks,” upward sand) rather than lecture. The ending reframes the premise: wonder > prediction, enacted by destruction of the instrument. A few lines state the thesis a shade too plainly (“to befriend uncertainty in planning”), but the images carry the weight. Resonance lingers in the rain’s “rhythmic yet unpredictable” kiss.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kintsugi and “weight of names” integrate action and theme; the mirror choice reframes identity and mentorship without moralizing. The final image reweights prior motifs (coin, seams, rain) into a resonant answer: redemption through luminous admission, not erasure. One line edges toward thesis articulation (“true alloy of their names”) but remains earned and diegetic.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of authentic laughter vs. rehearsed joy arise organically through confessions and Eluan’s tactics. The ending reweights the world—Echo Gorge becomes a site of beginnings—without sermonizing. Recurring objects (tooth/harp) and the “luminous ache” thread deepen the moral texture. Ambiguity remains humane (who pays the cost of healing), inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres through image and event: mercy as transformation via inversion of power, rendered through ultraviolet sanctuary and mathematical metaphors. The recurring object returns charged, and the drones’ “relax” externalizes the moral recalibration. One explicit thematic line (“mercy is not a constant…”) flirts with stating the thesis, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall resonance lingers and reweights prior material without collapsing into platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: memory vs. translation into action, the lighthouse “changing address,” and art as vessel for overlooked histories. The final dissolution into “direction” reprices possession vs. service without moralizing. Recurring images (light dialects, anchors of intuition, rooftops/sea/sky) gain weight at closure. A single explicit line of statement (“promise…never failed”) is earned by the scene and does not flatten subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Time, concealment, and façades accrue into a resonant thematic weave; the mainspring reframes the circus’s decay into a private metronome of denial and greed. The “weightless burden” motif evolves to meaningful release in the end. No sermonizing; the insight arises from concrete particulars (watch cannibalized, velvet clown hat). Complexity is maintained with quiet ambiguity around reverence and theft.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres around time’s negotiability and the creative act as deliberate destabilization to avoid sterile perfection. The sentence “Now is always” credibly reweights all prior images, producing a resonant conceptual and emotional afterimage. Recurrences (frost patterns, cataloging, whisper) evolve rather than repeat. No sermonizing; meaning emerges through action and charged imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of failure repurposed into futurity, memory as instruction, and the ethics of interpretation arise from concrete images (shattered vase; covered mirrors; visible time). The final vow reframes victory as obligation without moralizing, though one line edges close to statement. The shard’s message reweights the world’s premise with bittersweet clarity. Subtext hums in the practice becoming ritual companionship with time.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of truth versus corrosion is dramatized rather than preached: rust as covenant, purity of named joys, breath of honesty as anchor. The final cost reweights the world’s rules without moralizing. A touch of explicit lore (“Philosophers once claimed…”) edges toward telling, but it supports the conceptual reframe. The ending’s earned stasis resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of curation versus surrender and questions over answers arise organically from particular images (bottled rain becoming constellations; the question‑mark doorway). The final conceptual shift resonates, revaluing the collector’s identity with honest cost. One line borders on thesis articulation (“answers are impossible souvenirs”), slightly reducing subtlety but not undermining power. The hinged motif reframes awakening as both mechanism and philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of art as diplomacy and simplicity scaffolding complexity emerge from concrete acts (layering brig and freighter; inlaying panes as semaphores). The ending offers a non-literal answer—community passes through an artifact that reweights time—without moralizing. A few direct statements (“understood the phrase timewoven alliances”) brush against on-the-nose. Overall resonance lingers through image rather than thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: night as communion, legacy as continuity, and art as translation between mediums. The answer to the posed question is enacted, not preached, and reweights dawn/night expectations. Recurring images (hush, glass layers, nocturnal blossoms) evolve meaningfully by the end. The piece resists tidy moralizing while offering a lucid, resonant stance.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of testimony, erasure, and archival labor as revolt emerge organically through action and image (“Speak, I record”; “Because stories travel…”). The final moral sentence (“documenting the truth was another form of revolt”) edges toward explicitness, slightly dulling the otherwise resonant reconfiguration. Subtext thrives in the negotiated silences and cost of secrecy protecting villages. The closing image reframes the lagoon and archive without didactic over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Responsibility, memory as metabolism, and joining one’s creation are embodied through recurring images rather than moralizing. The final act reframes civilization‑making as literal incorporation, a resonant non‑literal answer to the premise. A few aphoristic lines tip toward stated thesis, but the imagery carries the weight. Ambiguity (salvation vs. self‑erasure) lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from particulars: custodianship vs. release, memory as living ecology, joy-before-fear as a civic rewrite. Recurring objects (shaving, apple, foghorn) shift meaning at the end without moralizing. The accidental prophecy concept is repriced into agency and care, yielding a resonant, quiet answer. Ambiguity remains (costs of released sorrow) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Inheritance, stewardship, and entropy/time are interwoven through seeds, seasons, and lineage without moralizing. The final sowing and thaw reprice “borrowed time” from greed to care, resonating beyond plot. Recurring images (acorn cap, seasons, vortex) shift meaning at the end. The emotional aftereffect is earned and complex: victory with a felt personal toll.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of mindful sound vs. alarmism accumulates through object choices and the tuned warning tone. The final bell as thanksgiving reframes “listening” as an ethic rather than a binary. One line edges toward explicit moralizing (“curiosity, properly tuned, could save lives”), slightly reducing subtextual elegance. Overall, resonance is earned via concrete actions and images.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of strength-through-vulnerability arises organically from empathic repair and the re-seeing of cleaning as sacred labor. The final images reweight prior motifs (broom rhythms, lantern glass, monastery orbiting mystery). A near-moralizing line (“strength is sometimes a patch of vulnerability polished to brilliance”) states the thesis too explicitly, trimming subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of mute stewardship and the ethics of keeping others’ vows emerges organically from image and action, not statement. The final hum recasts bees as “frequency rather than flesh,” a conceptual repricing of voice, duty, and presence. The stained glass reprise (his aged likeness) deepens responsibility over time without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively around cost and duration of service.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of communal meaning‑making versus failed numeracy emerge organically through objects and acts (urn projecting dates as sensations; classifieds as future stories). The final gesture revalues chronology as flavor, not integer, without didactic overreach. One explicit line (“Numbers might never behave again, but stories would”) flirts with moralizing but feels earned by the scene. Subtext hums in the shift from measurement to communion.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of “beauty in the incomplete” arises from specific actions (mending, harmonizing) and the feather’s relinquishment, not just assertion. The closing images reprice earlier motifs (ripples, glass, stained glass kite) with emotional lift. Minor explicit statements (“By harmonizing discord…”, “the most perfect thing of all”) edge toward moralizing, slightly blunting subtext. Overall resonance remains strong and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    Interconnection and reverent reciprocity emerge organically via actions (kids’ inclusive song, priest’s tactile blessing) and culminate in the runes reframing root, reef, and rib cage. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing: recognition as respect. Recurring images (copper lattice, breath, tide) deepen the theme. Ambiguity remains purposeful and generative.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: homecoming as inquiry, not retreat, is earned through particulars (UV sigils, reactive amber, evaporating footprints) rather than stated moral. “Convergence” reweights both scientific method and pilgrimage, culminating in a doorway that literalizes internal reconfiguration. The final charged quiet resists tidy moralizing while delivering a resonant answer. Recurrent images (tower, bronze quiet, footprints) accrue meaning without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of reciprocity, stewardship, and language as ecology emerge organically from acts (translation, liturgy, planting). The submerged concord concept reweights the ending without didactic moralizing; “battle lines…redrawn by chlorophyll” is a strong non‑literal answer. One line edges toward authorial statement (“memory is best fertilized with story”), but it’s enacted immediately by his coastal tour. The final petals “reciting the dead languages of peace” offers resonant, earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of silence, memory, translation, and proximity emerge from particulars—the leaf as address, grooves as speech—culminating in a resonant answer: walking itself creates nearness. The final image reweights the premise (“wild hush” becomes voice), avoiding tidy moralizing. One explicit articulation (“I realized that tinted revelations…”) edges toward statement but remains anchored by enacted choice. Subtext threads through objects and the dog’s behavior rather than declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of guidance versus drift, exile recoded as purposeful wandering, and time’s indifference emerge organically through image systems (compass, stars, comets). The final acts reweight earlier motifs without moralizing. A couple of thematic statements approach overt articulation but are earned by scene pressure. Resonance lingers in the charged poise of the closing walk.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—uncertainty/play versus ossified prophecy—arises through concrete action (replacing certainties with “storm‑inked whispers”) and culminates in time “dancing.” The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, though one line (“Some call that theft; I call it service…”) edges toward thesis. Subtext in the Curator’s softened posture and the whispering chessmen adds resonance. The conceptual repricing feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory’s custodianship, power’s myth‑making, and the dignity of small gestures braid through object/action motifs (pawnless board; pauses as “luminous absences”). Subtext runs through hesitations and kinetic scripts rather than exposition. The final line risks thesis‑statement clarity (“History... the echo of someone choosing to notice”), slightly flattening the otherwise earned resonance. Still, the conceptual repricing of “pawns” into language and microphones is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme coheres: home as a carried direction, memory as pain transformed into seed, the heart/maze refigured. Recurrences (hidden thunder, feather, stone) evolve in meaning and culminate without moralizing. The final image reweights prior material with genuine resonance. Ambiguity remains purposeful and invites reflection without fuzziness.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: mercy over brilliance, the ethics of tutelage, and the work of self‑forgiveness enacted through puzzles. Recurring images (beads, hedges, hush) reweight meaning at the end without sermonizing. The single explicit line about “never teach brilliance without mercy” edges toward stated moral but is supported by earned scene work. The prince’s approving rook as final move offers a resonant, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece reframes forgiveness as multiplicity and honesty rather than erasure; the canyon’s preference for angles of truth culminates in the mirror-laden spire. Subtext in the Marshal’s “hidden kindnesses” and the law softened by a poem avoids sermonizing. The last echoes and the vulture carrying “forged hush” offer a resonant answer without moralizing. Insights arise from enacted ritual and exchange, not thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of mending-without-erasure is enacted, not declared: gold seams accrue through narrated wounds, culminating in self-kintsugi. The key line “kintsugi intentions” seeds an ethic that reweights the final image (“storms forgiven”). Subtext hums in the charm’s circle and the statue’s pockmarks-as-language, integrating craft and healing. The resonance lingers without moralizing, embracing pain’s transformation into honest seams.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of impermanence vs. art’s reach emerges organically through recurring particulars: shell sunrise, cracked mirrors, waves arriving/leaving at once. The ending offers a resonant non‑literal answer—acceptance of “temporary eternity” without explaining—reweighting earlier material. No sermonizing; the images do the work. The later public reaction contrasts his aloof knowledge, enriching subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonance arises organically from concrete motifs (intent, cork, garden scent, bell) and culminates in a reweighting of proof as kindness in motion. However, the final two sentences edge into explicit thesis (“Proof… kindness measured against distance… never stops”), slightly flattening subtext. The piece largely earns its insight through particulars; minor moralizing trims its afterglow. The “screaming tenderness” ethic is otherwise well embedded.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    Reverse migration becomes a lived ethic: grief is navigated backward through embodied tools and names-as-coordinates. The final stance reframes navigation as stewardship, not escape, reweighting all prior images. Subtext breathes through objects and action (censer foot as liturgy; blood as power) without thesis-speak. The ending’s image offers resonant, unsentimental solace with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of honesty vs. kindness and community as psychological safety emerge from concrete acts (the under‑tongue eye, confession, smuggling knowledge). A few direct statements (“Psychological safety…”) edge toward thesis, but the final image (“grace fused with the fracture”) resonates without moralizing. The eye’s function reweights empathy from burden to scaffold. The sister thread anchors ethical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of witnessed isolation, custodianship of memory, and simultaneity (“fingers closed… palm opened”) surface organically through action and image. The Edelweiss/altitude vs. sea/war counterpoint earns the emotional repricing at the end. No sermonizing; the final beam’s promise reframes solitude as service. The war note adds gravity without commandeering the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Motifs (maps, type, ants, rivers) braid into a coherent meditation on choice, promise, and how evidence and intuition compose meaning. The compositor/doorway conceit reweights the premise at the end without moralizing. The final click of type functions as a resonant answer: futures are composed line by line, with costs borne in foreclosed lines. Ambiguity remains purposeful (what other lives were lost) and deepens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of culpability, restitution, and power’s moral debt arise from scenes and images rather than thesis‑telling. The bleeding starlight motif reweights at the end (droplets reversing, but not all healed), offering earned complexity over tidy absolution. “Truth is a path steeper than any ridge” edges toward overt statement but stays anchored to action and cost. The final charged poise invites reflection without closing ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of revaluation and ethical restraint arises from particulars: the shell’s song, the burn, gravity-bending colors, and the forked futures. Subtext runs through tactile choices (pressing shell to wound; scattering color), and the final image reweights the premise without sermonizing. A few aphoristic lines (“We revalue success…”) flirt with explicit statement, but are grounded by action and cost. The ending’s charged poise invites reflection without closing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of authorship versus chronology, with jealousy recast as solvent, arises from actions rather than pronouncements. Recurring objects (scroll, stove, platform, storm) reprice meaning at the end where revision outweighs prophecy. The final self-definition as “adequately footnoted” offers resonant, unsentimental acceptance. Purposeful ambiguity invites reflection without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: loss as rerouting of perception, “reading between lines,” and ordinary miracles. Images reconfigure at the end (droplets as footsteps; “smelling with her ears”), avoiding moralizing. A few lines edge toward statement (“absence could funnel perception”), but they’re earned by scene pressure. Resonance lingers in the charged poise of the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of remembrance as restoration and transforming trauma via craft emerge organically from ritual action and image. Recurring motifs (thunderbird feather, lullaby runes, crystals) shift meaning at the end without moralizing. “Bear them as lanterns” reweights scars as fuel, not erasure. The final shared breath and rain claiming the story achieves resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around absolution’s limits and gossip as a paradoxical conduit; “imperfect miracles” reframes both outcome and method. The bottle’s reprise and the delayed axes embody redemption’s partial reach without neat closure. One explicit line (“sometimes gossip is just a fragile channel…”) edges toward statement but is earned by scene work. The ending invites reflection without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: secrecy vs. witness, separation vs. unity, definition vs. open meaning. Recurring images (dictionary/definitions, hush, spiral geometry) evolve and reweight by the end (blank cover; hush as dawn). The piece resists moralizing; insight arises from the courtroom’s process and the earned renunciation. Slight loftiness remains, but subtext carries the argument.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mesh of hydraulics, memory, and communal time coheres into a resonant answer. The black sand mirror reweights the premise elegantly, and the final commitment reframes his role. However, the explicit articulation (“Time was not length but linkage”) edges toward thesis‑statement clarity. The piece still earns its insight through image and action, so the effect holds.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of letting go vs control emerges through concrete images (barrier parting, spore vectors, “walls remember they were once air”) and culminates in a reweighted security ethos. Subtext works in the echo‑self dynamic and the farm collaborating like a thesis defense. The line “nothing secure can grow…” edges toward thesis statement, slightly reducing subtlety. The ending’s “welcome” image resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of “lucid contradictions” and responsible perspective emerge organically through motifs and the final image. However, the line “It was about letting contradictions stay lucid…” edges into thesis articulation, softening subtext at the finish. The broken pane reframing the lamp’s plain light is a strong non‑literal answer that mostly carries the weight. Resonance lingers, but the explicitness trims the bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: wrong numbers as engineered estrangement; the florist/poet vignette; the harmonica’s haunted music. The line “goodbyes are just openings played backward” risks thesising, but it’s dramatized by the cross‑decade call and the quarter left as grace. The final image (“endings everywhere… rehearsing introductions”) reweights prior motifs without sentimentality. Subtext hums in silence and craft rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—community accountability over mythic absolution—emerges through particulars (sea as courier, locket healing with confession) rather than sermonizing. One explicit line (“not mythic mercy from waves, but a contract among neighbors”) toes the edge of telling but is earned by the scene. The final image reprices small moments as consequential, sustaining resonance. Subtext in the widow’s “haunted euphoria” enriches moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: reciprocity as logistics for the heart, rumor as infrastructure, and loneliness reframed via communal cadence. The moon rock’s “lonesome since departure” mirrors human ache without heavy‑handedness. A couple of aphoristic lines (“polite anarchy…only reliable courier”) flirt with statement, but they’re character‑voiced and embedded in action. The final realization reweights prior motifs without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of reconciliation and guidance through listening emerges organically from particulars (languages of glacier, rain; resonance over route). The final repricing (“not a place on land but a coordinate inside every listener”) is potent, though the direct statement edges toward telling. Subtext is active in the exchange between forest and Oriole and the maternal inheritance. The ending lingers with an image-driven moral rather than a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of control vs. accompaniment and commas as humane pauses integrate through recurring images and culminate in the closing comma/anomaly. The final choice offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without a tidy moral. One line edges toward thesis‑speak (“history disliked being corrected”), softening subtext a touch. Overall, resonance is earned by particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through action: authorship vs. communal memory, grief transmuted into shared, unhearable music, and the ethics of translation. The final repricing—town remembers color‑melodies but not Mara—lands as a resonant answer without moralizing. Recurring images (camera, water as ink, pauses as map) reweight meaning at closure. Ambiguity lingers productively around what is kept and what is lost in making art.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of restitution, art as dialogue, and custodial love for books arise organically from particulars (stitched eyes leading to a niche; murals “answering” her past). The ending reweights the premise: forgiveness is activated by return, not erasure, transforming her identity from destroyer to keeper. No moralizing; resonance lingers through the living‑fire mural and “light curled around her like pages.” Ambiguity remains humane: the world still calls her arsonist even as the archive absolves.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of communal memory versus institutional control and grief transmuted by collective will emerge organically from actions and evolving images (tapestry, auroras). The final act reweights the premise with a humane stance, and the sister’s laughter recast feels earned. However, the explicit line “dreams breathed together cannot be owned” edges into stated moral, slightly reducing subtextual power at the finish. The piece still lingers with a resonant afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thematic throughline—silence as transmission/power—emerges organically through objects and action (mute radios, vents, key, aurora) rather than moralizing. The final image reweights earlier motifs (“silence…loudest song”) without flattening into platitude. The relationship’s whisper‑challenge gives the theme human stakes beyond concept. Slight neatness in the closing aphorism trims the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through image and action: teaching darkness to value stars reframes grief as generative, not annihilating. The secret-to-light conversion makes the insight earned. Minor ding for the near-platitudinal line “pain is a map, not a cage,” which risks stating what the scene already shows. The final image reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—quiet resistance against brittle certainty—emerges organically through chess images, synchronized problems, and the town’s hush. Recurring motifs (cradling, clocks halting, filings forming puzzles) reweight the ending without moralizing. The final canopy-of-questions image resonates and reframes civic change as attention rather than decree. A couple on‑the‑nose lines lightly telegraph theme but don’t blunt it.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of surrender-as-agency and “combative tenderness” emerge through particulars (piracy becoming theater; breakers refusing to wound). The scrimshaw’s heart-unlocking runs through to the final reconfiguration of self. The ending image reweights the premise without moralizing, and the Quietening reframes conflict ethically rather than didactically. Resonance lingers as a non-literal answer to freedom’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of coerced happiness versus truthful sorrow is embodied, not lectured; the lamp reweights the world’s rule‑set. Subtext runs strong in silence, narration of mundane ritual, and the “remade hush” that persists internally after turbines roar back. A single line—“Your grief is heavier because the world demands you float”—risks explicitness but is anchored in action and pays off in the final image. The ending offers a resonant non‑literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—language reborn at edges; certainty as a rhythm rather than a static truth—emerges through image and action. The recurrent “tremor of certainty” is reweighted at the end: “tremble not to break us, but to set rhythm for change.” A single explanatory line risks slight overstatement, but the imagery carries the insight without moralizing. Subtext in the hush, the children’s circles, and the market upheaval deepens the social dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme arises organically: imperfection as living light, barter of flaw and fire, craft humility. Recurrent images (wilted violets, crooked thistles, seeded shard, phoenix) shift meaning by the end without thesis‑statement moralizing. Subtext in silence and gesture (bouquet code, shared breath) carries the argument. The ending’s repricing—broken eyes finding perfect dawn—lands as earned insight, not platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: method inseparable from doubt; connection as braided agency; redefining what counts as music. Recurring images (golden shadows, lens, miners’ rhythms) reweight at the end without moralizing. A few explicit formulations (“Texture… is…,” “Connection… is…”) edge toward statement, but they are grounded by immediate phenomena. The final blessing of coordinates and the charged organ pipes deliver lasting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme surfaces organically: grief refigured into navigation and mutual illumination, without sermonizing; images do the work. The final repricing—she is the observatory; dawn returns—reweights everything we’ve seen. The line “Things don't have to run forward to move us forward” risks aphorism but is grounded by the watch’s refunctioning. Subtext (craft as pedagogy; artificial made tender) operates through image and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of belonging over profit, culture as drawn not stored, and communal trust emerge through concrete beats (unlocked doors, communal ovens) and the charged final choice. Subtext flows in image and action more than assertion. Slight on‑the‑nose lines in the final cadence (“not for profit but for belonging”) temper the subtlety. Nonetheless, resonance lingers without simplism.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of knowledge’s cost, purification without erasure, and pattern‑breaking as ethics emerge from particulars (veil, bell‑dust pagoda, syncopation). The final image conceptually reprices the world’s fear of “contamination” without sermonizing. One explicit realization (“the ancients never meant…”) edges toward statement but is earned by the ordeal and doesn’t undercut resonance. The “atoms of nostalgia” motif returns to anchor the burden with emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Memory, forgetting, and hope are integrated through recurrent images (reels, dusk, stones) that shift meaning at the end without moralizing. The final image—gratitude traced in pollen and a charged book lent only to those guided by “luminous regret”—reprices the world’s rules in a resonant, non‑literal way. The theme emerges from choices rather than commentary. Minor sentiment risk is avoided by concrete, idiosyncratic detail.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of adaptation through shedding layers is threaded through recurring images (tail tip, burning lining, stitched pauses) and reweighted at the end. The piece earns its insight by concrete action rather than sermon; the owl and mist supply subtextual acceptance. One explicit thematic line risks overstatement but remains grounded in scene. Resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme—redefining closure as truth restored, not silence—is dramatized through scars as text, coffee rings as time‑maps, and the displaced miracle. The closing “pale crescent” punctuates the thesis without sermonizing. One line (“They thought closure was the absence of blood, not the presence of truth.”) edges toward thesis articulation, but the surrounding images carry the weight. Resonance lingers through the plants’ counsel and the reweighted body‑text metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: love paused between sender and receiver becomes circulation through enactment, not lecture, culminating in her gift of letters to future dreamers. Recurring images (letters, ink, hum/thunder, incubation) shift meaning at the end. A slight ding for an explicit thesis line (“Unused love had found storage unnecessary; it preferred circulation”) that states what the images already earn. Subtext otherwise runs through silence and tactile ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of inspiration as communal good requiring personal relinquishment emerges organically from events and images. The “emptiness as space for new constellations” line edges toward explicitness, but it’s dramatized and then paid off in the final charged stasis. Recurring motifs (stardust, breath, aurora, rest as punctuation) reweight meaning at the end. The closing image invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme integrates through motifs (dreamlessness, lullaby, vigilance, seeds) without moralizing. The final realization reweights time and care: tending possibilities requires a chosen pause, not sleep. Lira’s line about “waking vessels” deepens subtext around guardianship and renunciation of comfort. The last image answers the central question with grace and lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around questions as frontier and self-revision (“you must redraw it”), culminating in a non-literal answer: he elects to go where questions are born. Recurring images (gear, wind-timbres, mapping) shift meaning at the end (“probable miracles” becoming “probable habits”). One aphoristic line risks thesis-stating but is sufficiently in-character to avoid sermonizing. The resonance lingers through the reweighted absence/pulse motif.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of oblique travel, relinquished leashes, and courage-as-waiting emerge organically through objects and action. The vigil reframes bravery as attention and listening; the final image (constellations in punched stars) reweights prior motifs. A near-explicit aphorism from Calla brushes moralizing, slightly reducing the afterglow. Overall resonance lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of safety, consent, and listening accrue through concrete acts (writing instead of speaking, the sealed lid, the bolt as talisman) and culminate in “safety need not imprison sound, only teach it to listen.” The ending reinterprets the law without sermonizing, transforming silence from coercive to chosen. The father’s “last note” rumor seeds a metaphoric repricing that lands in the earned hush. Ambiguity (storms may come) preserves moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme—truth as gravitational lens vs. lie-induced distortion—emerges through mirrors, ink, and the “crown as lens” metaphor. Lysar’s speech flirts with didacticism yet serves the moment by operationalizing the thematic logic that powers the sunder. The final empty throne and summoned shepherd reweight earlier images without a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Absence, endurance, and the re‑mapping of certainty accrue through images (atlas/labyrinth, cairn, negative elevation) rather than thesis. “A door assembled from absence” epitomizes the conceptual repricing of knowledge and path. The ending reframes maps and tides as vows with cost, avoiding moralizing. One or two metaphoric lines risk prettiness, but they mostly stay earned and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Images earn a theme of reweighing debris into possibility (wreckage → constellations; drones → condemned angels → potential sowers). Subtext mainly rides objects and atmosphere rather than talk, which is effective. However, the closing sentence states the thesis (“Meaning... isn’t found by cleaning the mess...”), tipping from resonance into mild moralizing. The piece still invites reflection, but that explicitness trims its afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of intentional evolution of tradition is embodied by actions (pledge to soil, non-throne) and images (kite script retooled as key). The final resonance reframes custom as a living organism, not a decree. Minor ding: explicit thesis lines (“To evolve tradition with intent”) and the newborn’s on-the-nose thought trim subtextual subtlety. Even so, implications outlive the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: light refracting through ruins rather than denying them, the pearl of stillness as portable practice, and bodies mapping calm before minds consent. The final image conceptually reprices earlier material without moralizing. A few explicit lines (“anchor optimism in realism,” “drawn from neuroscience”) skim the edge of thesis but are earned by scene work. Subtext in gesture (palm to glass, dirt‑smudged pulse) carries the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of fracture, guilt, and acceptance emerge through action and image, not moralizing. The final repricing—“cracks as contours”—reweights all prior motifs (mirror shards, broken box, missing Moon) with earned complexity. Ambiguity is purposeful, leaving a resonant charge without confusion. The surrender reframes “redesign” as yielding rather than mastering.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of crisis-time, fear as harvested energy, and the ethics of conversion into power resonate through concrete beats (ink code, suspended campers, archival order). The final choice offers a non‑literal answer: justice requires entering the engine that commodifies fear, not simply escaping it. The “serene anger” reframes measurement vs. wildness as a moral stance rather than a temperament. No moralizing undercuts the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through action and recurring ice/thaw/breath motifs rather than thesis statements, culminating in “We hear you… and the world shifts.” The library’s “listening” converts preservation into complicity, then into resistance—an earned conceptual repricing. Ambiguity remains meaningful (“melt the ice or refreeze it harder”) without hedging. The final charged quiet answers the central question obliquely yet decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of continuity versus fear and nonviolence as active craft arise from particulars (engraved quiet, labeled virtues, Cullin’s reorientation). Subtext works through gesture and objects rather than moralizing; “remind us why towers mattered” teeters near thesis but is grounded by the canvas metaphor. The final image—planting beyond the dome and Cullin choosing to learn—reweights prior material. Resonance is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme arises organically: translation’s limits, the ethics of capture, and freedom over possession. Recurrent images (lullaby, silence, net/spike) reweight at the end—“some songs refuse translation” reframes the premise without moralizing. Subtext lands via gesture (gratitude hidden in ache) and the conceptual compass humming toward “unspoken shores.” The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of legacy, accountability, and journalism’s ethics emerge through concrete images (orrery of headlines; “proof by contradiction” as persuasion). Final cadence reweights the universe from regret to responsibility without sermonizing. A couple of lines verge on declarative thesis, but subtext largely carries the weight. The storm/press/telescope braid deepens the moral pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme coheres around guilt, responsibility, and the ethics of containment versus erasure, realized through specific images (amber as “paused sunlight,” “cathedral after bells”). The ending’s laughter without translation reweights prior material toward forgiveness without sentimentality. The act of writing new instructions extends the moral calculus beyond the self, turning private atonement into communal stewardship. No moralizing; resonance arises from reconfigured sound and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central theme—meaning as reorganized dailiness rather than grand riddles—emerges through particulars (mandala → kitchen table → dispersed plans). Strong subtextual resonance in the tile melting and the emptier nets. However, the explicit line “Meaning… is not hidden in grand riddles” tips into moralizing, slightly blunting the ache of discovery. The ending still lingers as an image‑driven repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of mercy versus strength and names as destiny arise organically from action, not sermonizing. The hinge vs. wall line risks neatness, but the piece earns it through consistent paradox imagery (“warm coldness,” “sunrise on iron”). The final revaluation (Solaryn) offers an implicit thesis on healing scars without didacticism. The braiding of shards, promise, and renaming yields lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres around possibility, repair, and earned nostalgia—labor meeting art—emerging through concrete acts (echo-breath, applause as citrus light) rather than moralizing. The coin and encore reweight time and memory without thesis statements. The final decision (to be late) is a quiet, resonant answer about value. Ambiguity lingers productively (the orchard “waiting nightly”) without blurring stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through action: ethics of illumination vs. protection, skepticism as loving discipline, collaboration under surveillance. Recurring images (willowglass hope, geode, light/dark) accrue meaning and subtly shift at the end. One slightly on-the-nose aphorism from Theo skirts didacticism but doesn’t derail subtext. The ending offers a resonant stance rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of translation, awakening, and future-as-unknown emerge organically from events and recurring images (heat‑maps becoming grammar; the fossil as transitional object). The final reweighting—humanity will “walk through fully conscious,” and he becomes the hinge—resonates without moralizing. A single line (“interpreter not intruder”) leans declarative, but it’s dramatized by subsequent cost. The afterimage invites reflection rather than providing a tidy thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of communal meaning emerges organically from concrete acts (cataloging, opening doors, transcription). The imperative “Share or disappear” risks didacticism but works because it’s diegetic, not authorial scolding. The ending reconfigures prophecy from dictation to dialogue, offering a resonant answer to the premise. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    “Fixing what’s broken” is dramatized through the gear/time wound and not just asserted; the click reweights the premise without sentimentality. Recurring images (snow codes, burns, thaw) accrue and then shift meaning in the final descent. One overt thematic line (“Fixing what's broken…”) skews slightly declarative, but the surrounding scene work earns it. The ending invites reflection beyond the plot without closing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres through palimpsest/needle/thread/ripple motifs that reweight meaning at the end (service persisting with doubt; simplification as earned). Subtext operates in image and cadence, especially the silver hair braided with his own questions. A minor ding: the explicit aphoristic line “service continues only while doubt endures” flirts with telling the thesis. Still, the final corridor-and-rain image restores resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of mercy, endurance, and “phototropic to kindness” emerge through motif and object use rather than meta‑commentary. The vibrating line “kindness is the only light that survives scorching” risks statement, but it’s diegetically heard and reweighted by action. Final images (cups, kiln, promise of bees) reframe resistance to change as a shaping force, not a slogan. Resonance lingers without neat moral arithmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stewardship, shared resilience, and the ethics of care arise from concrete acts rather than stated morals. Recurring images (oars’ rhythm, hush, light as sap) accrue meaning and reprice the world at the end. Sentiment is present but anchored in risk and labor, avoiding syrup. The final rosebush in the heart of the floodgate reframes the balcony garden as communal duty.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of stewardship after extinction, migration as non‑negating motion, and translating solitude into communal resilience emerge through actions and images (sundial verbs, raft from regrets). The final reweighting—libraries among people, fear turned to reference—resonates without sermonizing. Subtext in “coexist” (sky/earth, language/silence) threads choices. A couple of declarative lines brush the edge of thesis but remain earned by scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    Recurring images (water, nest, coil) build a coherent meditation on secrecy, connection, and communal music. The final realization reframes “keeper of secrets” convincingly, charging prior details. A minor drawback: the line “to be a true keeper of secrets...” states the theme a touch explicitly. Despite that, resonance persists in the closing image of the world signing the letter.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Unity versus exploitative power plays emerges organically via action (hearts synchronizing, cocoa shared, Calvin’s hunger). The auroras reweight the premise toward care over conquest. However, the line “sometimes interference is protection” states the thesis directly, blunting subtext in the final beat. Strong imagery carries theme; trimming explicit moral would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of negotiation over conquest and the ambivalent nature of opening (“doors invite war as easily as relief”) arise from action, not sermon. The ending reweights the premise into a charged, wistful pledge, avoiding tidy moral closure. Recurring images (organ, compass, dilation) accrue meaning toward that stance. A few abstract lines flirt with overt statement but do not dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Unifying opposites” and dormant empathy are dramatized through concrete images (single heart between silhouettes; mist‑separated suspects, dawn’s ember). The final image reweights the premise toward shared humanity without overt moralizing. A printed instruction sheet edges theme toward didactic, slightly flattening ambiguity. Still, resonance lingers via the ribbon touch and hush.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through specific motifs: librarianship as authority, debt/loan ethics, language vs. weather (“terrified it might be grammar”). The “borrow tomorrow” line reframes bravery as custodial duty with cost. The ending’s charged poise reweights inheritance and duty without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in a purposeful, resonant way.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—art as amnesty for foreclosed futures—is earned through concrete acts (music soldering grief to courage) rather than stated moral. Recurring images (glass flake/lens, scaffold wrap, bridges) shift meaning at the end, inviting reflection without sermonizing. The final charged poise—hope as practiced craft—reprices prior material. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: borders as stories, markers as living ethics, optimization humbled by memorial memory. The discovery (“a living territorial marker”) reweights all prior imagery, and the final choice answers the core question without moralizing. Subtext through coyotes, currency, and chains keeps it resonant. Slightly explicit lines (“Paths circle back because…”) flirt with telling but don’t spoil the earned effect.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from action and image—shared burdens shift stone and sky from threat to remedy. The inscription’s warning, the communal broadcast, and the reweighted “burden as anchor or propulsion” deliver a true conceptual repricing. No sermonizing; resonance lingers in the final resolve to map aspirations. The daylily telegram threads grief into communal meaning without platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete acts: truth versus reflection, guilt’s carapace versus unbending courage. The circles motif and “frozen confession” reweight at the end into a hopeful repricing without moralizing. The seed’s property (devours lies) integrates concept and theme, culminating in the sister’s vision that reframes prior shame. Resonance lingers through the final cadence of widening rings and “warlike serenity.”

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: consent and liberation versus control, negotiated kinship across species, and redesign as ethical repair. The spiral reweights prior material, offering a non‑literal answer to “How may we unweave the maze without uprooting memory?” without moralizing. Recurring images (roots, scars, eclipse) shift meaning at the end. The resonance lingers with conceptual and emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of mercy’s cost and grief’s ballast emerges through concrete acts, not assertion. Recurring images (“bruise,” “ballast,” “ash”) deepen a moral calculus that resists tidy moralizing. The final charged poise—blank pages plus soft-burning ballast—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext in the Keeper’s rule frames the bruise as the necessary price of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of reverberation, failure beyond applause, and purpose-in-carrying-on arise from concrete particulars (cloth, reels, wind). The “after the applause” line returns meaningfully and is reinterpreted by Gideon’s final choice. A few sentences verge on thesis (“proof that failure is not finale”), slightly edging toward statement over image. Overall, resonance lingers and avoids pat moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of translation as ethical passage accrues through objects and acts: cuneiform, lament, lattice as childhood streets, “Gate held open by memory.” The final repricing—conservation of transition—reweights the opening ache. One near‑thesis line (“understanding never captures a spirit; it only offers it safer passage”) edges toward explicit moralizing, slightly dulling subtext. Overall resonance lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—variety safeguarded through accepting contradictions—is enacted, not merely asserted, with the paradox‑song as method and result (individuality as shared music). The ending reweights routine as sacred after tomorrow’s disappearance, a resonant answer to the opening premise. A single explicit thesis line (“Wonder…is best preserved…”) overstates what the images already prove, slightly dulling subtext. Still, the peppermint/brine air and rehung creel carry quiet afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of secrecy, fear, and communal vulnerability emerge through concrete particulars (shell grooves, crystal resonance) rather than thesising. The line “I inspect shelters because I fear living” risks explicitness but feels earned by prior beats and catalyzes the reweighting. The final image—walking toward dawn “bearing hopes”—achieves conceptual repricing without sentimentality. Ambiguity lingers productively around the cave’s intent and the ethics of bearing others’ hopes.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    The river/rail confluence builds a coherent theme of forgiveness-through-redirection, echoed in leaks, graffiti, and music. Subtext generally carries the weight, but the explicit thesis (“Forgiveness is not the erasure…”) edges into moralizing in the final paragraph, dulling resonance. Still, the closing image reweights prior motifs credibly. The Mara parallel adds ethical complexity without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: listening as liberation; time’s distortions and responsibility to release what one anchors. Recurring images (mirrored ink, reversed letters, the watch) evolve at the end into a reweighted ethic. One explicit line (“to carry…to share…”) flirts with stating the moral, but is earned by the scene. The final gesture re-situates prior material without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—memory versus imperial erasure and who curates cultural lineage—emerges through concrete acts (propagation via roots; anthem versus ghost of ice). Recurring images (perforations, glow, propagation, frost/plant dialogue) reweight at the end without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer: art seeded in the living world outlasts sanctioned narratives, at a cost to imperial control. Ambiguity lingers in the potential fallout, enriching the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece refracts mortality and purpose through specific ritual and image, avoiding overt moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: beauty survives as charged stewardship, not resurrection, with a cost accepted. Recurring images (aurora, hush, emerald) accrue meaning and shift subtly at closure. The promise to return the spark carries thematic gravity beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of release, identity, and cyclical rebirth emerge through repeated, particular images (hairpin chime, ash tree, river metaphor). The final cadence reweights prior material without overt moralizing, though the line “Contentment… was not a spring to be found but a river to be joined” edges toward statement. Subtext travels in images (dissolving hairpin; vineyard hush deepening into quiet joy). Emotional aftertaste is tender and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme (welcoming nuance into certainty) emerges organically through the chime code, the “cloak of doubt,” and the ocean “keeping secrets without locking them.” Subtext runs in images and dialogue indirection (“sincerely insincere,” “protected vulnerability”) rather than moralizing. The ending’s conceptual repricing (“decisions can breathe, not ossify”) reweights the whole without telling us what to think. No tidy binary; complexity is embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of delayed revelation ripens organically through restraint, silence, and reversal of ripples/time; no moralizing intrudes. The final repricing—vanishing as “perfect arrival”—reweights the premise with emotional and conceptual cost. Recurring images (hush, rings, backward time) accrue meaning and culminate in a resonant silence. Ambiguity is purposeful: Rowan’s return is an earned unresolved charge, not evasion.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme arises from particulars: reverence versus mastery, listening to history, and the ethics of power. The final vow and teaching object reweight the premise without moralizing, answering the question of how to move the world without moving oneself. Recurring images (birds, pulse, dust) accrue meaning and modulate by the end. The emotional aftereffect is one of charged stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: automation vs breath, sacred simplicity vs categorical genius. Recurring images (“lingering luminance,” “brilliant dimness,” ordinary blessings) reweight at the end without sermonizing. The final poise—carrying a pocket sun that’s “bright enough to guide, dim enough to keep wondering”—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Slight softness of on‑page price keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from particulars: lamps, vows, and synesthetic ripples converge on honesty as the medium that renders sound visible. The insight is earned on the page via the ledger and the ensuing auroras rather than told. One line edges toward thesis (“Resonance… possessed hope”), but it’s grounded by immediate consequence. The final image resounds without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silence, echoes, and answers-before-questions thread the theme; the ending’s vow to keep listening reframes leadership as attunement rather than certainty. The clause “Go where echoes begin” reweights prior motifs without moralizing. One or two abstract statements (“simplicity… rarer than hope”) flirt with telling, but the imagery largely carries the argument. Resonance lingers via conceptual repricing of causality and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Language as containment and the ethics of naming versus sacrifice emerge from concrete acts, not sermon. The line “some horrors survive renaming” complicates the thesis, and the ending reweights it with a quiet, charged acceptance. Recurring images (light, atlas, echo) accrue meaning and pay off. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of repair, devotion, and the ethics of gentler breaking emerge through concrete acts (rebuilding purpose, not metal; “teaching things how to break more gently”). The final repricing is resonant rather than moralistic; aphoristic lines feel earned by action. The silence/hope/bell triad accrues meaning and reweights the ending. Ambiguity remains purposeful: the cosmos accepts tempered, lukewarm accord, not triumphal perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Memory versus engineered erasure emerges through concrete acts and images, not sermonizing, with the final chime ringing to remember. A single line (“She will expunge the engineer’s version…”) flirts with thesis-speak but is anchored by subsequent action. The water-as-archive motif deepens subtext without overstatement. Resonance lingers beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: harmonizing logic and intuition becomes literal in sap/pulse braiding, with restraint framed as a higher alchemy. Subtext breathes in images (figure‑eight stability, muted waterfall) rather than sermon. A minor explicitness (“purest philosopher’s stone”) edges toward telling but is earned and not reductive. The ending reweights “wonder” as disciplined care, not conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: trust vs. force, pattern and patience as moral stance, memory as tool. The buckle and “soundless echo” motifs reweight the final image without moralizing. The diplomats’ hour gained contextualizes an ethic of nonviolent redirection. Ambiguity remains (perhaps her data, perhaps morning light), enriching the meditation on trust.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: personhood as shared, integration over erasure, conflict as conduit for connection; images shift meaning (orchids/rainfall/marble guardians, the “duplicate” relabeled by action). The final offering of the jar to the lake reweights uniqueness. Slightly on‑the‑nose lines (“Personhood… thrived only when shared;” “uniqueness was pointless now”) edge toward moralizing, tempering subtlety. The emotional aftereffect is earned and lingering.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—innovation requiring hush and discomfort—is woven through concrete particulars (stench as design medium, airflow puzzles), not just assertion. The final image reweights prior motifs (seed as lock/map; storm‑born hush) without moralizing, though “Innovation… often blossomed from discomfort” leans on‑the‑nose. Subtext between secrecy, risk, and creation lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of tending to the unspoken emerges through concrete action (lullabies in wind, leaf mist) rather than statement, with grief and joy interleaving. The final repricing of silence—no longer “overdressed”—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. The leafy child‑outline skirts sentimentality by remaining mute, charging absence with presence. Ambiguity remains purposeful and charged, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres around thresholds, waiting, and “potential” cults; subtext arrives via margins, sundial shadow, and dawn held in rumor. The explicit line “I want to make friends with uncertainty” risks on‑the‑nose but is supported by enacted choice and imagery. The ending offers a resonant answer: thresholds travel with listeners; Earned Stasis over decisive conquest. No sermonizing; complexity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of creative destruction is organically enacted through materials and confession, and the ending reweights selfhood without mere plot summary. However, explicit thesis lines (“he was the argument that matter and spirit evolve by breaking their own cages”) verge on moralizing and reduce subtext. Earlier images already earn the insight, so saying it blunts resonance. The final promise of “future pennies” lands, but a little less telling would heighten after‑echo.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Finding the beginning in every ending” shifts from credo to enacted ethic via the sacrificial use of the fragment; the city’s revival and the “brand‑new overture” resonate. The moon’s supervisory retreat reframes the labor’s dignity without a tidy moral. Slight on‑the‑nose repetition of the theme phrase softens subtlety but stays earned by scene work. The aftertaste is imagistic and reflective rather than didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant motifs (tides, knots, maps, hourglass) braid into a theme of impermanence as arrival and interconnection. Subtext generally carries meaning, but explicit thesis lines—“We are not lost… we are being woven together” and “impermanence is another form of arrival”—edge toward moralizing, especially in the final third. The ending reweights prior images without a cloying wrap‑up, yet some stated wisdom dulls the afterglow. Complexity is present but could risk more ambiguity in the last beats.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece meaningfully explores connection as mutable vibration and the ethics of altering memory to heal. Thematic answer arrives via image and action, not sermon, though “emotion is circuitry” edges toward explicitness. The final recognition among strangers (“song remembered from a previous dream”) resonates without tidy moralizing. The conceptual repricing of memory as living weave holds.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Unfolded horizons” integrates with the map/folding idea and the translation of water logic into stellar grammar, returning charged at the end. The teaching motif and alien “tutoring” complicate conquest narratives, delivering earned wonder without sermonizing. A couple of lines verge on thesis (“to explore is to pry the crease”), but they grow from particulars and are paid off by scene work. The final image reweights the premise rather than stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of remembrance over rescue and stewardship of vulnerable voices emerge through concrete acts (archiving the photo, reviving speakers). The final reconfiguration of “hush” resonates. A single overt thesis line (“Incidental heroism…”) states what the images already imply, slightly flattening subtext. Overall, meaning accrues from particulars more than pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: memory versus forgetting, translated into matter via “phase transitions of silence,” culminating in a non‑literal answer—the lullaby only Lira can hear and salt footprints marking future obligations. Subtext runs through images (cables carrying whispers; mist technicians) rather than moralizing. The final repricing of “standing by” widens beyond this night while acknowledging cost. Resonance is earned, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of failure transmuted into growth, grief becoming circuitry, and repair through sacrifice emerge from concrete acts and recurring objects. The final reconfiguration (“felt convincingly alive”) resonates. Slight docking for the explicit thesis line (“failure… is its bloodstream”), which edges toward on-the-nose. Subtext otherwise works via image (porcelain, ink, static clearing).

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of preservation vs. erasure, curse vs. cure, and how texture births sound emerge organically through concrete acts. The line “why curse and cure share almost the same letters” flirts with aphorism but is earned by what precedes it. Final images—night swifts’ calmer glyphs, shadow‑ink phonemes—offer a resonant, non‑literal answer: survival through transformation and cost. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of transmuting despair into communal resilience emerge organically through action (confession → Loamling’s bonding to grief → laughter as ecological safeguard). The final realization reweights prior images (frost, flint, mulch) without collapsing into sermon. One explicit statement (“I realized the creature’s miracle…”) flirts with telling but is supported by image (“punchline tasted like thawed sunlight”). Subtext around grief, ecology, and kinship lingers credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars—music as defiance, craft as complicity and remedy, memory as frequency—not through moralizing. The locust shell reframes “breaking free” from symbol to operative force at climax. The final charged poise (“not triumph, but a beginning”) reweights prior images with earned ambiguity. Subtext of collaboration over solitary heroics is embedded in pulse/code without explication.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: promises, absence, and re‑routing systems of return culminate in “Returned To Sender” as a reparative gesture. The blank letter scene elegantly dramatizes “linking absences” without moralizing. The ending reweights the premise with a non‑literal answer—healing by rechanneling systems rather than defying them outright. Resonance lingers with the unscheduled moon and reformed hush.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres through recurring images—silence, bells, gears, song—as possibility versus vacancy and art as repair. The halo/story wage insight accrues through concrete acts rather than declaration, culminating in the nonverbal offering to the angel. The final reconfiguration reweights earlier quiet as generative, not empty. Ambiguity remains purposeful without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: observed solitude as creation’s climate; maps of desire vs. order; arranging quiet instead of possession. The sentence “We will come when you learn to shelve silence” reweights the entire pattern without moralizing, and the reprise of ordinary duties carries new charge. Counter‑readings (is he deluding himself, or honoring process?) remain possible without confusion. The closing image resonates beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of stewardship over ownership and the ache of “becoming” accrues through particulars (palette’s smell of conclusion; negative as unread code) rather than thesis. The ending’s shift from “luminous absence” to presence re‑prices the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in image and gesture (offering harbor vs. opening lens), inviting reflection. Resonance lingers as the archipelago’s whispers continue beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—courage to voice a feared idea, and compassion as the key—emerges organically from objects and action. The hair’s tenderness reframes fear as protectiveness and turns the box from prison to incubator, avoiding platitude. The ending’s reweighting (city as observatory; key that learns to sing) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Slight neatness in the universal uplift keeps it just shy of greater complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of memory as communal archive, reciprocity, and habit‑breaking emerge through acts, not dicta; the final image reprices the premise (“new stars” from spores). The orchard as everyone’s archive complicates ownership and anchors an ethical cost. Resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mentorship as “combative tenderness,” memory’s capacity to wound and pardon, and law as shadow‑hosting glass weave through concrete acts. The leaf‑geometry lesson reweights the climax and reframes resilience as interpretive practice. The ending achieves a resonant answer without moralizing: choose care over formal absolution. Images, not assertions, carry the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme arises through action (weaving/grafting as tending wonder) and the reweighting that follows (villagers subtly transformed). The “prune away fear” line edges toward thesis-stating, but prior particulars earn it. The final vow and luminous path offer a resonant, non‑literal answer about stewardship over spectacle. Ambiguity lingers in the ongoing cost rather than a moral wrap‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of recognition, honor, and redistribution of applause emerge organically through naming and the net’s drowned‑sky memory. The “interlaced hush” transforms from threat to lullaby, reweighting silence as earned equilibrium. The final image (mask facing dawn; island‑sand silence) resonates without moralizing and reframes the opening unrest. No sermonizing; complexity persists in the gentled hush that remains.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of listening over naming is enacted through particulars (silent reels, the “ear” inscription, wind‑chant, replacing the grate). The conceptual shift—“the whispered chapel” as practice—reweights prior material and sustains resonance. A near‑explicit thesis line (“attentive mapping that asks before it names”) edges toward telling, slightly softening the subtext’s elegance. Even so, the final image delivers earned, non‑didactic aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: wire knots as productive failure, the mathematician’s “show its work,” and transmissions that travel yet reach nobody. The ending reweights prior images without moralizing; resignation is rendered as wavelength, not thesis. The sophisticated melancholy is earned and avoids sentimentality. A single explicit thematic line via the found journal skirts didacticism but is mediated by artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme arises organically: art as a mouth for silence; technology as repository of longing; translation across mediums. Recurring images (violet/sorrow, gold/yearning, teal/deferred hope) shift meaning at the end when “something new” is whistled—an earned repricing rather than a thesis. Subtext (unheard apologies, orphaned drafts) informs the ethical duty without sermonizing. The final charged poise answers the question of how we honor the unsaid.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of pain transmuted by attention, consent versus trespass, and finding joy “beneath anguish” emerge through concrete events (light unlocking tenderness; returned line easing Auden’s guard). The final shared sunrise functions as a non‑literal answer without overt moralizing. The quoted maxim risks slight neatness, but its diegetic origin keeps it earned.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme coheres: archiving borrowed emotion, the ethics of witnessing, and the cost of proof versus possession. Recurring images (telescope, hush, loans, dusty starlight) reweight at the end without sermonizing. The final act reframes “empty spaces remember” from hypothesis to lived wager, with moral and conceptual cost. Ambiguity is purposeful, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of discovering limits by crafting beyond sight integrates through the coin’s instruction and Liora’s sensory reorientation; the end reweights “recognition” from faces to interior weather. Subtext accrues in images (coin’s “collapsed constellations,” plaster as “unmapped stars,” safe’s “high altitude”) rather than thesis. No moralizing; the final image offers a resonant non‑literal answer about art remaking space and perception. Complexity remains without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of translation (speech/maps) and “sociable isolation” accrue through objects and acts and culminate in the final realization and image. The phrasebook marginalia and hopscotch grid reweight “language” as a way to read the sky. One line veers near didactic (“not a contradiction but a compass”), slightly flattening ambiguity. Nonetheless, the ending image resonates without overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of repair as invitation vs obstacle is earned through mirrors, scraps, and the tear-heart; subtext hums in images (icicles as punctuation, bottled flames as imprisoned heartbeat). The line “repair was less about fixing…” leans toward explicit thesis, slightly reducing subtlety, though it’s grounded in action and arrives after struggle. The final descent reframes the world with a charged cadence rather than a moral. Resonance lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of communal interdependence, trust in the intangible, and transforming fear into harvest arise organically from action. Recurring images (bell, chalk, arches, nebula) reweight at the end without moralizing. One explicit line (“The motivation was simple and enormous…”) spells what the scene already shows, slightly flattening resonance. The final “bruised yet blooming” cadence lands as earned hope with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—imperfection as salvific modulation rather than cure—emerges organically through action and recurring images (cracked bell, fractured porcelain gilded by gold). The lullaby motif becomes an ethical stance enacted, not declared, and the ending reweights the premise without sermonizing. Subtext around art, duty, and mercy coheres in the repaired puppet and softened time. The resonance lingers through implication rather than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of caretaking vs. power, assembling guidance from fragments, and reorienting guardianship are earned through images (amber, birds, blueprint). Final images reweight the premise (safety as harvest, not glory). Slight thematic overstatement in “Caretakers should leave only a harvest of safety, never the taste of power” edges toward moralizing, tempering the score. Subtext otherwise holds in gesture and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: division as necessary prelude to resonance; chemistry and music braid with grief and environmental repair. Subtext operates through image (chrysalis as hollow polymer promise turned vessel of release; foam patterns as social/chemical analogy). The line “Separation...was not failure but prerequisite” edges toward stating the thesis, but the final images do the work without moralizing. The ending reweights earlier motifs into a resonant, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of beginnings via absence materializes through repeated, functional acts (quantifying lack, bottled moonlight, the blank slate). The ending image answers the question non‑literally by enshrining emptiness as seed. A few explicit thematic statements (“universally adjacent,” “integrated fragmentation”) step on subtext. Still, resonance lingers through the vendor’s charged refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: remorse cannot be erased, only redirected, and responsibility requires bearing cost. The final uncertainty—whether the vigil praises or judges—preserves moral complexity while landing a resonant answer. Recurring images (salt, water, coral) accrue meaning without being over‑explained. No moralizing; the insight is earned through action and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of communion over precision accrues through multilingual counterpoint and architectural empathy, not sermon. The payoff (“Unity outweighed precision” enacted by the clock’s syncopation) reweights prior images. The bridge of sound offers a resonant answer to isolation without neat moralizing. Subtext hums in cost and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory ethics, stewardship vs. possession, and collective rewriting emerge through images and the final acceptance scene. The closing reprise (birds singing “algorithms”) resonates. One near‑explicit thematic articulation (“meant accepting custodianship, not possession”) slightly reduces the felt subtext. Still, the images carry honest, durable resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of vigilance, memory as mercy, and custodianship emerge through image and action rather than moralizing. Recurring objects reweight meaning at the end (doodle → crystalline seed spelling the combination; “quiet blaze” vow). The resonance is strong, though ambiguity about the ethics or potential danger of unleashing memories is only lightly implied. The piece invites reflection without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of reciprocity and listening materialize through particulars: breath, bark, fracture, and apology chords. The line “for empathy had been rendered audible by motion” edges toward thesis, but most resonance arises from image and act, not moralizing. The final repricing of silence is felt rather than stated. Ambiguity lingers in a fruitful way without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: grace over ambition, a covenant un‑eclipsed, beauty discovered through difficulty and listening. The worry stone’s transformation and the quiet mate reweight prior material without sermonizing. The single explicit line “Beauty, he decided…” edges close to stating the moral but is earned by the scene. Subtext hums in magnets “whispering” and the stakes easing with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres—empathy as the meeting of silences—earned through concrete acoustic practice and the reweighted final image. The motif of naming silences evolves convincingly to Silence Type IX. A minor deduction for explicit thesis statements (“Empathy is heard…,” “peace can echo louder than war”) that edge toward moralizing. Subtext nevertheless works through the muffled fireworks and the tender release of the clasp.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme crystallizes through particulars: stillness within motion, foulness becoming cure through attention, portable peace for a migrating people. The final repricing—serenity as a seed to be “walked with”—is largely earned by the scene’s images (breath, wind diagrams, fireflies, altered bat flight). A few lines edge toward aphorism, but the imagery bears the weight. The communal exhale and rope gate opening give the idea consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thematic throughline—resilience as circulated memory—is enacted via images (hovering shards, letters sprinkling hymns) and payoff in living buds. However, the spear’s line (“Resilience is not hidden… it is circulated”) tips toward explicit thesis, slightly dulling subtext. The final reweighting still resonates through action and image. Complexity is present without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of foresight vs hindsight, listening to environments, and geometry as ethics emerge through particulars (spiral patches, organ‑pipe corridors, “air remembered accidents”). The final image (“silence she had saved”) reweights prior silence from ominous to earned stasis. No moralizing; resonance arises from the reconfigured wind. Slightly limited by the protagonist’s emotional flatness.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of wonder versus disbelief and silence as threshold rather than absence are embodied through action, not lecture. The final reweighting—hush housed in an “open door”—answers the premise with a resonant, nonliteral solution. Motifs (aurora, bells, marble) return charged, avoiding tidy moralizing despite one early line naming the aim. The ambiguity around cost (what wonder demands) lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of failure-as-instruction matures through particulars: driftwood “bread crumb bones,” the funeral-like uncasing, and the music shifting from lament to tentative major. Subtextually, the canyon hush becomes moral pressure toward mercy rather than blame. The ending’s repricing—guardianship regained only by owning complicity—lingers without stating a moral. The final thunder-as-applause reframes earlier accusation, offering resonance rather than neat didactic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme coheres: only ambiguity sustains empathy’s motion; some truths are true because they never resolve. Motifs (primes as sorrows, feathers as variables) accrue and shift meaning at the end. The final charged poise—silence “like being understood”—offers a non‑literal answer without moralizing. Occasional declaratives (“Only in the gash…”) serve the lyric argument rather than flatten it.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—wonder emerging from routine, the ethics of delivery vs. sowing—is integrated through recurring motifs (drumming, aurora, “germinate”). The final act reweights prior beats into a myth-making ethos. A couple aphoristic lines (“wonders hide in plain errands…”) skim toward stated moral, but they’re anchored by concrete action. Resonance lingers without neat closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particulars: mirror vs. absorption becomes “soil” transformation, with ethical freight. Recurring images (prism, frost, hush, truthful lies) reweight meaning at the close without sermonizing. The final ambivalence (“neither lie nor truth”) offers a resonant non‑literal answer. A few explicit statements (“Objects…absorb emotions…”) are direct but earned by scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres around memory’s transmission, the alchemy of craft, and the cost of making a message cross hostile space. Recurring images (bead, puzzle edges, silence) shift meaning at the end—silence repurposed as song. No moralizing; resonance arises from the final image of persistent glow and reconfigurable quiet. The emotional aftereffect is earned, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Resilience via remembered/forgotten cost, communal artistry, and “meekness as muscle” emerges organically from acts, not sermon. “Azure defiance” coheres as tonal‑thematic glue and charges the ending. One line edges toward thesis (“his meekness had been muscle all along”) but is earned and not reductive. The final vow reframes responsibility and loss without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of mapping as power/ethics and the ambivalence of discovery vs. protection emerge organically through action and image (maps that “protect or betray,” redirect as moral calculus). The final resolve to map lacunae reweights prior motifs without sermonizing, though one line edges toward thesis statement. Subtext around exploitation of gifted labor adds depth. Resonance lingers in the charged refusal rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Guardianship, communal secrecy, and “bottled safety” arise organically from sea glass, cairns, and Ellis’s routes. The chain reframes superstition into a network, a conceptual repricing that dignifies reticence as service. The naming of “Anchor” and the final hush-braiding beacon carry earned resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity remains meaningful, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: story outlives print; warning braided with creation; stewardship as the true form of prophecy. The final image—guidance emitted as shaped darkness, rain multiplying it—reprices narrative as navigation with a visible cost. No moralizing; the auroral headlines and “yesterday to mint tomorrow” embed the argument in action. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance is strong through recurrent images (magnetism, gravity, light, dye), and the ending reweights “listening” versus “imprisoning.” However, the line “some people magnetize stories because their silence aches for listeners” states the thesis outright near the end, dulling subtext. Without that explicitness, the piece’s imagery already carries the insight. The final title “Heart of Drift” elegantly echoes both canvas and self.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Maintenance as devotion, listening as technology, and “sorrow released kindly” emerge organically from action, culminating in a final image that reweights the premise (witnessing a sky only trees can see). The “mundane miracles” line risks explicitness but lands as a character insight earned by the scene. The story resists platitude by tying healing to quantified sorrow and custodial craft. A hint more ambiguity about what is lost with a straightened maze could deepen the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars: memory as communal weave versus isolating archive; dawns must be sung together. The line “The window would never open while memories remained separated” reweights the premise without moralizing. Final understanding (“swaddle them until they could fly”) reframes care as temporary holding, not imprisonment. Resonance lingers with complexity, not tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of compassion for imperfection and paradox accrue through concrete particulars (the ledger of mistakes, clocks chiming out of phase into harmony). One line states theme explicitly, but most resonance arises from image and action. The ending reweights the premise: failure as doorway and “staying while leaving” as a lived ethic. The afterimage is emotionally honest and avoids sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme braids elegantly through seeds, rain, the bread/tea reunion, and quiet acts as sacrament; subtext holds in silences and Ko’s aphorisms. However, the near‑final explicit thesis (“sacredness is merely the ordinary relieved of its disguise”) drifts into moralizing, reducing resonance. Even so, the final vow and image reweight prior motifs without didactic wrap‑up. The piece invites reflection on attention as agency with credible ambiguity around absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme integrates through action: measurement as liturgy versus the unmeasured vow; preservation as love’s difficult form. “Luminous vows” reprice memory’s ethics without moralizing, landing in the charged final image of a promise archived with cost. Ambiguity remains (memory vs. illusion; truth vs. necessary record) but coherence holds. The resonance lingers beyond plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    Trust, silence, and barter entwine through action rather than thesis, culminating in her internal “recording” and the fob’s closing click. The ending’s vow reweights earlier motifs (hush, inheritance, moral debts) without moralizing. Subtext in Cinder’s grudging loyalty and the market’s quasi‑sentience deepens complexity. The final image lingers with thoughtful ambiguity about what trust costs to hold.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres around reason and feeling reconciling into civic coexistence; the election conditions and the ring‑rain pact let the ending answer the inquiry without moralizing. Recurring images (taste‑compass, aurora, rain) reweight meaning at the close, locating hope with costs (dialogue, obligations). Subtext of governance, empathy, and tech‑haunted nature runs through events rather than statements. It’s resonant, if gently resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of inescapable calling, grief’s transmutation, and memory vs. creation emerge organically through particulars (journal, birthday lock, crystals absorbing faces). The final image reweights earlier motifs into dawn/acceptance. However, the near-moralizing line “some callings cannot be escaped, only answered” states what the images already achieve, slightly dulling subtext. Despite that, resonance lingers via the kept-laughter and self-chosen confinement.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—small candors as restorative ecology—emerges through concrete images (seeds of unuttered truths germinating) rather than meta commentary. The final image reweights prior motifs without needing exposition. A slight whiff of moral statement in the penultimate lines keeps it shy of the very top band. Subtext in the Archive conceit enriches without blunt allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silence, stewardship, and translation of wonder into action interweave without moralizing; “Even when humanity forgot every noun…” reframes language loss as an aesthetic and ethical challenge. The final choreography-map is an earned answer: truth kept alive through embodied practice rather than speech. Recurring images (ice light, bells, wind) deepen rather than decorate the theme. Thematic complexity lingers with credible humility rather than a tidy maxim.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme integrates through action: containment vs. chaos, preservation vs. transformation, memory’s burden distilled into manageable beads. The closing acceptance reframes survival as “fragmented wholeness,” resonating with the controlled burn logic. A slight explicitness in the final articulation edges toward statement rather than pure image, but the resonance remains earned. The box and burn jointly embody the theme without sermonizing elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of listening as communal medicine emerges from specific acts (circle, testimonies, shared reading) and the reweighted objects (locket, padlock). Subtext breathes in gestures and images (key in the sock, hinge sighs), with a resonant non-literal answer in the final hush. A couple of explicit thematic sentences (“listening heals”) edge toward on-the-nose, slightly tempering the subtlety. Overall, resonance endures past the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme integrates through action: vulnerability rendered as code, dance teaching mercy, and the spider/web motif reframing liberation as patient, networked revolt. The final float‑and‑broadcast image reweights prior images without sermonizing. A few explicit statements (“vulnerability is strongest when encrypted”) verge on on‑the‑nose but are mostly earned by scene. Ambiguity around Vane’s fate and the ethics of destruction adds resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of communal memory, grief, and the physics of forgetting integrate through image and act, not proclamation. The whale’s gravity turns loss into a material ecology, reweighted by the final restoration and communal aftereffect (fishermen humming forgotten tunes). The wildflowers’ regained scent and unlit lantern at dawn provide resonant repricing without moralizing. Plan to “return with allies” hints larger ethics without neat closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silence refigured as craft and cartography yields a resonant answer: peace as deliberate structure, not absence. Recurring images (wings, water, maps) reweight at the end, avoiding didactic moralizing. A single explanatory line (“He was driven to hush a prophecy…”) edges toward tell, but the piece largely trusts image. The final inward turning of prophecy offers conceptual repricing with lingering implications.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    “Agreed upon lies” entwines with treaties, guilt, and language as covenant; the murder/penance reveal reframes the tea ritual. The final image (“syllables of sorrowful masonry” and a city listening) reweights everything without moralizing. Subtext works in gesture and object (desk seal as First Lie), avoiding thesis statements. The complexity of truth/translation/penance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of memory stewardship and redefining independence are earned through particulars (archivist ethos tested by the brother’s sacrifice). Subtext surfaces in images (filaments knitting; fountains falling silent) and the shift from coaxing to conversation. However, explicit thesis lines (“Independence…was not the absence of voices…”) verge on final‑paragraph moralizing, slightly blunting the resonance. The underlying revaluation still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of authorship, mercy versus rule, and rewriting history are embedded in object and act rather than stated. The blood toll and the emperor’s retroactive “always pardoned” repricing offer a resonant, morally thorny finish without sermonizing. The thorn’s reappearances carry subtext (forgiveness demands a cut). Ambiguity (aurora’s “approval or condemnation”) lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of consent, stewardship of memory, and the ethics of voice emerge organically from the pact and the reinterpreted echoes. The final “grateful silence” offers a resonant, non-literal answer: chosen mediation over hijack. The loom imagery and countdown repricing avoid moralizing, inviting reflection on collective vs. individual voice. Ambiguity remains purposeful (the depths’ “intelligence” speaks in ache, not rules).

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of truth versus sanctified myth, connection versus isolation (windows vs mirrors), and beauty’s frailty are woven through objects and culminate in an earned reweighting. The lighthouse keeper’s release reconfigures the glacier’s meaning without didactic wrap-up. One line edges toward sermon (“Let the truth breathe, and his light will rise for all of us”), but the ending wisely returns to image and felt repricing. Resonance lingers through the pilgrims’ reflections and Mara’s quiet exit.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of hidden effort/patterns integrates through nets, rain traces, tea foam, and laboring fishermen; the ending reweights attention as agency. The final line edges toward explicit thesis, but it’s anchored in character and image (gathering droplets) rather than summary. Subtext flows in the reciprocity of observing and being changed.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of stewardship vs. sensationalism emerges from her profession colliding with the stillpoint’s fragility. Recurring images (dust vs. untouched leaves; hum vs. silence) reweight in the final choice. A few lines verge on aphorism (“People preferred curses...”), but the closing acts keep it from sermonizing. The last image holds complexity: a lie as shelter, with ethical tension intact.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Leadership as lullaby and “new dawn using ancient shadows” deepen thematically through concrete acts (repurposed machines, lullabies dissolving flags). The ending reweights prior motifs—the cobalt glass, storm, and song—into a non‑literal answer: a chorus, not a coronation. No moralizing intrudes; resonance lingers in the alloy of grit and whimsy. Complexity holds with plausible counter‑readings about power and prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, translation, and partial redemption emerge through action (jar selection, lullaby revival, release), not lecture. “Redemption… gleaned” risks on‑the‑nose, but it’s earned by the scene’s particulars. The final image reweights prior motifs (hum, jars, dawn) into a charged poise: the work continues, with cost acknowledged. Sentiment is controlled, avoiding tidy moral closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the fusion of engineering and contrition, asking whether intention can be audited and protected. “Sonic absolution” is not mere rhetoric; it dictates who passes, extracts a price, and reframes belief as evidence. The final ascent with lantern rhythms delivers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity remains humane (absolution costs; forgiveness isn’t free).

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of patience versus haste, borders versus promises, and time as political technology emerge from craft acts and images, not just claims. Some explicit thesis lines (“A patient revolution…”) flirt with sermonizing but are mostly embodied by process and cadence. The final reweighting (“promises stretch; borders stop”) resonates and reframes the map motif. Subtext in wolves pausing and sapphire light adds quiet gravitas.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Freedom vs. bureaucratic erasure resonates through the Underground Railroad lantern and the ledgers-as-chains image. The final acceptance to “carry them upward” reweights prevention as an ethical lineage, not a slogan. One line edges toward aphorism (“Freedom, prevention, and truth share a corridor”) but is supported by concrete particulars. Subtext—debts paid forward—emerges from image rather than lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres around apology versus action, craft as moral labor, and the insufficiency of words alone; subtext blooms in the etched names and “balance wheel.” The final counsel reweights the premise without didactic overreach, though a line or two toes moralizing (“first beat of the sentence he must compose”). Recurring images (heart, hush, light) earn resonance. Quiet ambiguity remains: the victims’ agency is honored without forced pardon.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of wonder risking ridicule to make machines “sing” arises organically from action and tools (algorithm of desire, silent bell, arrow striker). The ending offers a resonant answer—the bell speaks to “things,” reframing audience and purpose—without needing a spelled‑out moral. The ticker’s aphorism toes the line of explicitness but feels earned by the concrete experiment. Subtext of mischief-as-holiness threads cleanly through the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memory, corporate control, and digital afterlife emerge through particulars (numbers as breadcrumbs; Echo sector; “the system wore their weight”). The ending reweights “deletion” and “home” without tidy moralizing, though one line explicitly indicts the company. Subtext in tones of absence becoming song sustains resonance. The astronauts’ lullaby threads an earned, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through objects and action: mirrors, shards, emotional cartography, and a lighthouse that broadcasts empathy. The final repricing—“the anomaly” as collective courage—reweights earlier signs. One explicit statement (“Mara realized…”) edges toward telling but aligns with the image-driven close. Resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of endings, patience, and listening emerge organically through particulars (trawling, harmonica, calving ice) rather than thesis. The final cadence reweights the premise: endings are chords learned over time, not a single note; this reprices her earlier urgency. No moralizing; the ambiguity is purposeful and resonant. One aphoristic line (“Not every voyage…”) tiptoes toward stated theme but is buoyed by context.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of translation, loss, and “destined mismatches” emerges through particulars (ash carrying flavor; pruning as surrender) and returns with reweighted meaning at the end. Subtext lives in gesture and pairing images (burned “y” that “loops through my throat”). A brief on‑the‑nose line (“harvest measured in empathy rather than bottles”) edges toward statement, trimming perfection. Overall resonance is strong and earned without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—preservation over utterance—emerges through concrete ritual, the hush architecture, and Lira’s renunciatory stance. However, the explicit aphorism “Wisdom, once spoken, scatters; preserved, it walks” states the thesis, undercutting subtext at the finish. Subtext otherwise works in images (weight like a harmless stone; anonymity accepted) that could stand without the moral. The piece invites reflection but trims its own ambiguity with that final line.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete acts—rearranging photos by arcs, shared song, and a plan to paint—without sermonizing, though a couple of lines edge close to thesis (“Collective healing was not a slogan”). The final image reweights prior motifs (lavender glow as guide) with earned hope, not sentimentality. Subtext in the lilac tint “coaxing dormant stories” is deft. Resonance lingers with the quiet, communal “yes.”

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of language as living growth and authorship as witness rather than ownership emerge through image and action rather than sermon. The line “I cannot testify in lines that march… but in rings that spread” sits close to thesis yet is dramatized and earns its place. The final charged poise (listening to futures’ breathing) reweights prior imagery without a moral. Ambiguity—celebrate or fear—lingers in a productive way.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of memory, aging, and the economy of forgetting emerge through particulars (echo-footprints, match-in-water, marrow vs. tape). The ending reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to the central question. Subtext in the prophet’s curse binds cost to knowledge elegantly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—stillness within motion, persuasion over control, vigilance at the brink—emerges through images and choices, not declarations. Recurring motifs (hum/heartbeat, “sound of a leaf falling,” escape velocity) reweight at the end to a poised stasis. The Rhea/Eloi exchange avoids moralizing and lets the final image carry meaning. Slight softness in cost keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres around transforming menace into music and grief into connection; subtext works through gesture and sound rather than thesis. The “scent of hope” and the vinyl shard reweight earlier material at the end, avoiding moral summary. The piece resists sentimentality by keeping costs live (the death is imminent; “final verse” is not euphemized). The resonance lingers as a humane, craft‑driven answer: art can midwife a goodbye, not cancel loss.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of harmony vs. conquest, trust, and circles as ethical closures emerge through events, not thesis statements. The noonless archive reweights the premise with conceptual cost: knowledge demands restraint. The early “relearn”/“closing loops” motif returns as an ethical method, not just a mechanism, and the final pact avoids sermonizing while suggesting a curriculum of humility. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around forgiveness versus skepticism and transforming error into pattern; the bone-constellation motif matures into a moral calculus without sermonizing. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“even illusions deserve the chance to correct themselves”), but they arise from concrete stakes. The ending reweights prior images with a non-literal answer (earned wonder over tidy answers). Subtext hums in the garden “calling them liars” and the villagers’ avoidance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of guidance without harm and the ethics of illumination arises from actions (snuffed lantern memory → pearl → villagers’ safe return). Recurring images (constellations/spirals/threads) reweight at the end without moralizing. The final image conceptually reprices “light” with restraint and communal consequence. Ambiguity is meaningful, not muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motifs (amber, gnat, icicle constellations, “honeyed hush”) evolve to articulate a theme: repair through small, deliberate acts that scale against thunderous harm. Subtext is carried by labor and objects rather than moralizing, with a clean late reweighting (“healing scaled as quietly as harm had thundered”). The ending resists neat closure while offering a resonant answer. No sermonizing undercuts the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of endurance, dispatch, and nurturing cracked vessels accrue through particular images and are reweighted by the final vow. Subtext lives in object actions (oar, envelope, seedlings) more than abstraction. A few explicit labels (“Hope Three,” “enough to keep him rowing”) approach on‑the‑nose but remain supported by scene. The ending offers a resonant answer without a moral lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory as technology, ritual continuity, and community interdependence emerge organically through objects and acts. The elder’s line edges toward explicit thesis‑speaking, slightly dulling subtext in the final movement. The ending still reweights prior images (story as conduit; living wood carrying tales) with earned poetic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of patience, memory-as-compass, and shared human rhythm emerge organically from acts (aligning etched memory to living trees, stitching with breath). The ending reprices the cosmos-human link (“stars unburdened”) and relocates direction from sky to orchard. No moralizing; resonance arrives via image and consequence. The fairytale plate and withered orchard triangulate memory, loss, and guidance with satisfying subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of memory, time, and the rational custody of wonder emerge through action (echoes folded into coils, bells carrying layered pasts). The final lines reweight the opening premise without sermonizing, though the aphoristic “a good lock is never about closing” approaches stated thesis. Recurring objects (timer, diagrams, cellar of reason) evolve in meaning to deliver resonance. Ambiguity remains purposeful and humane.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of reciprocity and burden-ethics emerges through concrete acts: she cannot credibly weave others without weaving herself. Recurring images (hush shingles → wings; calcified tears; weights in drams) reweight meaning at the end without didacticism. The final hope “roof the sky” resonates as conceptual repricing rather than a moral. Complexity survives the resolution: mission unfinished, but stance altered.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme arises from particulars—kettle, skylight, ash blank, the husband’s method—rather than assertion, and “Here and gone” is reweighted from wound to organizing principle. “Absence, too, can roar” is earned by the scene’s action, not tacked on. The final poise holds complexity: peace carries ongoing cost. No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of authorship versus theft, regret as currency, and ethical stewardship of stories arise organically from concrete acts (releasing giggle, sigh, curse). The final image reweights the premise without sermon, though “he understands the bargain” approaches a thesis statement. Subtext in the chosen fragments maps beginnings/endings/motion elegantly. Resonance lingers as a reorientation rather than a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from flows and orientation; systems “remembering themselves” reweights hope without sermonizing. The explicit equation risks didacticism but stays character‑particular and earned by prior beats. Final gestures (locker note; lanterns off) resist tidy triumph, giving a resonant, open‑handed answer. Motifs (rivers, sextant, skylight) accrue rather than repeat.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thematic web—silence as bearer of meaning, time as interval, forgiveness—emerges from particulars (petrichor, quartz droplets, the unmounted hand) and culminates in a resonant non‑literal answer. Subtext lives in the sanctuary’s response and the ledger’s blanks. One explicit sentence names the thesis, slightly flattening mystery, but the final images recover nuance. The work avoids moralizing and lingers with conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of institutional omission and the ethics of misdirection emerges organically through objects (sundial as moral weathervane) and events (radio/weather elisions, reborn “charity”). “Silence corrodes more than confession” risks explicitness, yet it’s earned by the ledger reveal and confrontation. The final image reweights prior material without a didactic moral. Subtext hums in the man’s practiced casualness and the narrator’s strategic deceit.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of patience, relay, and reading the world’s knots accrue through concrete actions and close on a resonant vow. “Some wisdom grows only by relay...” elegantly crystallizes the piece, though the final aphoristic sentences edge toward explicitness. The reinterpretation of “weavers” as instructions reweights prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of disappearance, witnessing, and healing emerge organically through image and action—the thread as pulse, obituary as compass, ghost hours as “explained absences.” Subtext works in the way Selene chooses presence over projection at the meeting and then back again on departure. One line edges toward thesis (“She believed words could stitch...”), but the closing reprices the premise without sermonizing. The emotional aftereffect is quiet, poignant, and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: flawed genesis, fear‑driven escape, and the risk of synthesis over purity. The bird’s ambivalent note and the charged descent resist moral neatness while offering a resonant answer: integration at cost. Occasional explicitness (“We built this height to escape failure…”) skirts sermonizing but stays embedded in action. The final image reweights prior motifs without a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through particulars: graft as mercy, water remembering fire, compassion as active discipline. Subtext carries in objects and gestures; the lagoon amplifies her buried song rather than rescuing her. Two declarative lines risk neatness but are earned by on-page struggle. The ending reweights what “inheritance” means without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme arises organically from action: skepticism as light vs. memory as water; maps you doubt but follow; patience aligned with celestial cycles. Recurring images (argent thread visible only when wet, geese/constellations) reweight the final release without moralizing. The ending reconfigures the premise—memories as civic water—with resonant restraint (“defiant hush”). Complexity holds: certainty arrives as a costed renunciation of doubt, not a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around nonviolent intervention versus complacent pacification; the story reweights “calm” into potential harm and advocates shimmer (variance) over stasis. Recurring images (gear, pings, blossoms) accrue meaning and reappear transformed. One line (“Light must shimmer, not stagnate”) edges toward thesis‑statement explicitness, but the final images do the heavier lifting. The resonance lingers without moralizing the close.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of communal grief, art as conduit, and continuity (poems/butterflies/ribbons) emerge organically from events and objects. Subtext hums in the mentorship and family ritual, culminating in “For everything that leaves, stay” as image, not sermon. The ending reweights the prior braid without moralizing, inviting reflection. Complexity lingers via the porous monument that welcomes future sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of incremental absolution emerges organically from counting “wrong seconds,” ritualized repair, and communal time’s dependence on private ethics. The final image reweights earlier motifs (breath, bells, gear teeth) without preaching. One line edges toward explicitness (“Incremental absolution works like sand filling a vial”), slightly softening the otherwise earned resonance. Subtext around stewardship, truth’s cost, and communal synchrony lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Memory, intention, and caretaking braid organically through images (spade, king, salt to clay). The final act reframes the whispers as a call toward communal repair rather than mere haunting. No moralizing; the resonance lingers in the lullaby-like hush and the reweighted whistle. Ambiguity around “voices” serves theme without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of constraint as generative, ethical futurity, and mapping ignorance emerge organically from action and image (“edges of knowledge,” “before the pen meets the blank page”). The final stance reframes “prevail” as ongoing charged poise, not conquest—an earned conceptual repricing. A couple of thesis‑leaning lines skirt moralizing but stay anchored in scene. The kingfisher motif ties invention to responsibility with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—art as resistance and the decentralization of narrative—emerges organically from particulars (copying rumors as staves; dust rehearsing syntax). The ending’s CR is strong: life itself becomes the transmitter, reweighting earlier images of light/noise and the famine. No sermonizing; “The regime would search...” edges declarative but still serves subtext. The final “thistled calm” reframes survival as fertile, not merely quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme coheres around art as wound and refuge, the “mirage of safety,” and how truth must both hide and reveal; it emerges through action, not moralizing. The final image reweights the premise—the mask’s negative space promises solace and threat at once—answering the central question via charged poise. Recurrent particulars (ash, porcelain, chair, moon) accrue meaning rather than symbol‑shout. The piece invites reflection without tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through event and image: gears, sediment, tides, and star maps turn “story vs proof” into a synthesis (“the stars were a narrative too, but one that tolerated verification”). The final agreement reframes truth as method‑backed narrative without sermonizing. A slightly on‑the‑nose line brushes the edge of telling but is justified by the moment’s verification. Resonance lingers through the custodianship choice and dawn image.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: harmony through restraint, “unlearning hatred,” and art as civic repair. Recurring images (rests, rosette, hush) accrue meaning and invert debate into listening. A few explicit lines (“to braid diverse voices… before the vanishing arts are forgotten”) edge close to statement but are earned by scene work. The ending’s conceptual repricing lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of collective nourishment versus solitary omniscience, repurposed sorrow, and gentleness as rebellion emerge from concrete acts (guiding roots into war‑dust, leaving the ladle). The final image offers a resonant answer: change delivered softly can rewire a community without decree. No moral is stated; the imagery carries the argument. Ambiguity remains (future stewardship by others), enriching aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—utility versus wonder, truth as ritual—emerges organically via riddle, duty, and the swarm’s reawakening. Subtext in Bram’s compulsion and the architect’s design resonates without heavy exposition. The final line edges toward explicit moral (“mystery could light hearts”), slightly flattening ambiguity. Nonetheless, the ending reweights prior images with a felt conceptual charge.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres through action and image: placement versus displacement, attention as sanctification, translation of mute spaces. The recurring objects reweight meaning at the end (swan, wishbone, orris) without needing a moral. The sentence “Displacement was the illness, placement the cure” edges toward thesis‑statement explicitness, slightly dulling the subtext’s mystery. Overall resonance lingers via the door’s “lungs returning to repose.”

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme (kindness vs certainty; revelation via structural weakness) emerges from concrete choices rather than sermonizing, with the ampoule’s reweighted purpose as vector. The explicit line “Only if we let uncertainty breathe…” toes thesis territory but is earned by the scene’s pressure and is counterweighted by image‑driven beats. The ending’s gardening of “ideas” and harmless shatter reframes prior destruction into a fragile, ongoing practice. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme integrates seamlessly: probability as memory, motion without travel, regret versus stillness. The final act (listening “for the silence between probabilities”) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Recurring images reprice meaning at the end (the healed chip, the staircase finite when desire ceases). Ambiguity remains purposeful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, kindness, and language-as-cultivation emerge organically through images (seedlings as letters, bioluminescent script), and the ending reweights the premise with quiet resolve. However, the near-moral line—“strangers remember kindness more stubbornly than smog”—edges into explicit statement in the penultimate beat, slightly reducing subtlety. Subtext otherwise carries via the city’s softened reactions and Ravi’s earned stasis. Resonance lingers without didactic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme arises organically: art as lineage and survival; names and crafts as bulwarks against erasure. The initials/bread motif shifts meaning at the end, from memory to active re‑inscription. One line edges toward stated thesis (“generosity multiplies…”) but overall subtext works through image and action. The final promise to hide the lens resists tidy triumphalism, preserving complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: autonomy costs intimacy with one’s possible selves; gifts that demand nothing are the most perilous. The final image—clocks stilled at the moment she first dreamed of escape, ocean paused—reprices fate and time without stating a moral. Recurring objects (yoyo, stone, clocks) deepen subtext from seduction to negotiated agency. Resonance lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through action and image: fear’s vanity before unexpected light, performance vs. exposure, image as trap. The “photographically cursed” motif and lingering luminance reweight the ending when the carnival goes dark and the speck holds the light. The clasp‑void on Eli’s chest and the hint of fear’s heirs provide resonant after‑pressure without moralizing. Insight is earned by the specific exchange for the name.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: art as transformation, listening as agency, ephemerality over capture. Recurring images (chains retuned, storm remixed, mallet’s hum) deepen a concluding repricing of “recordings cage resonance.” The “Legends later said…but the truth was simpler” moment edges toward thesis-stating but is anchored by prior action. Resonance lingers without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Questions vs. gates, language as passage, and grief repurposed into inquiry cohere without sermonizing. The final contrast—“gates are only doors in metal; questions are doors in light”—reweights all prior images and costs. Motifs (spirals, cracking, mirrors) shift meaning at the end. Resonance lingers with conceptual and emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—truth versus “noble lies,” handshake as polite strangulation—emerges through actions, objects, and reprises. Strong subtextual play in the mural/saint‑demon parallel and the final “reopened airways” image. A few lines verge on thesis (“beauty divorced from honesty was only gilded rot”; “best histories are written…”) softening subtlety. Overall resonance remains high without collapsing into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres around memory’s salvage and “interlaced absence,” moving from personal irony to communal continuity (the handbill mirroring his dowels). The final image reframes the mission as a generational relay without stating a moral. Subtext (foundation repairs as vows, ink as confession) accrues naturally from action. No sermonizing; ambiguity lingers in the sea’s complicity and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonance arises from “reclaimed stillness” enacted through method and the charged final image of dawn with the stamped codex. However, the closing thesis line (“the alternative hypothesis of courage, inked upon a broken world”) edges into overt moralization, blunting subtext. Most insights are earned via specific acts (tactile verification, refusal to rush). Ambiguity remains around the library’s losses, adding texture.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story articulates a nuanced thesis through image and act: grief transformed, not erased; “she had given it wings, and they chose to stay.” Motifs (shadows, ladders, steam, cranes) evolve meaningfully and reweight earlier material at the end. No sermonizing; resonance arises from the specific ritual, cost, and communal uptake of sorrow. The final acceptance is complex, neither cure nor collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of weaponization, stewardship of power, and grief transmute into action rather than thesis. The “every invention becomes ordnance” line risks on‑the‑nose but contextualizes the ethical field without flattening it. The final image (“bleak exhilaration in equilibrium,” lantern of remorse) reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity (saved vs. delayed war) invites reflection while honoring the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Belonging evolves from an abstract phrase into a lived acoustic reality, paid off by the names and the observatory-as-ear image. Recurring motifs (“brilliant dimness,” missing pieces, star‑trails) shift meaning at the end without sermonizing. The last lines resist moralizing and offer a resonant, non‑literal answer: belonging as portable cadence rather than place. The ambiguity retains charge while avoiding vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars—erasure, forged lineage, the hollow‑chested children—and culminates in a non‑literal answer (fusing the watch hand/heart, choosing witness over fabrication). The “sieved hush” motif reweights itself at the end (“simple night wind”), signaling repricing of silence. No sermonizing; the vow is direct but earned by the ledger scene and spoken name. Ambiguity (magic or madness) deepens resonance rather than blurring meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of reconciliation, humane exchange, and memory-as-opening arise through specific gestures (drawer pull gift, silver shed, blanket, pendant) rather than sermon. The “between apology and forgiveness” motif is enacted, not declared, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights earlier details. One aphoristic line (“compassion was the only currency…”) toes the edge but fits the moment. The ending invites reflection without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Redemption versus self‑trust emerges organically from concrete images (poles vs. stars, the compass pointing “down,” the lantern heartbeat). One or two lines verge on explicit statement (“Energy flowed unseen…just as intention could”), but most resonance is earned through action and reprise. The final promise divides labor between heart and stars without moralizing. The ghosts turning away sharpen complexity without neat absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through action and image—empathy framed as the “impossible pitch”—and the baseball’s reweighted meaning carries the final resonance. The lake’s visions operate as subtextual ethics, not sermon. One explicit framing line (“It was about empathy…”) toes the edge of statement but remains voice‑true and grounded in scene. The ending avoids tidy moralizing by holding risk (“fearing future relapses”) alongside commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Grief transformed into communal stewardship and coexistence emerges organically through action and image (beasts forming a sigil, shared heartbeat with the orchard). The fortune’s promise reframes “stone” and “heart,” culminating in a non-literal answer about bonds remade through shared cost. A few lines edge toward overt statement (“teaching distant hearts the possibility...”), but overall the resonance is earned. The closing charged poise—half-light guardianship—lingers without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of forgiveness versus guilt and the economies of memory emerge through concrete acts: the saucer ferrying memories, the inkless hand outlines, the re-seeded sky. Subtext works in silence and image rather than moralizing; the glade’s laws embody the thematic assertion. The ending reweights prior motifs with a resonant, non‑literal answer: love paid as memory releases time. The single voiced maxim (“forgiveness is heavier than guilt”) serves world logic rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: nonviolence as active transmutation of collective harm, the cost and grace of survival, and refusal to weaponize liberation. Recurring images (tears, stitching, frost petals) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final garden‑like corridor offers a resonant answer rather than a thesis. Ambiguity is purposeful and generative, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of transformation as process (conversation between states) is dramatized through action: spiral unwinds, ash as “parchment soaked in thunder,” constellation blur between fireflies and stars. The final image reconfigures the premise without moralizing, offering earned resonance. One on‑the‑nose line (“Transformation is not a moment…”) slightly states the thesis but the scene otherwise carries the weight. Subtext threads through hush, detour, and philanthropy-as-prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Light vs. captivity, systems that “feed” control, and the ethic of silence braid through image and action. The “silent revolution” line edges toward thesis‑telling, yet the story mostly earns theme via particulars (doors “saluting,” the fort “lighter of heart”). The closing reprise (smile folded into hush) offers a resonant stance without moralizing. A touch more friction or ambivalence in Serah could deepen the thematic afterburn.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: covenant over abstraction, translation as care, miracles restoring the mundane. The final cadence (“raspy, deliciously ordinary”) reweights the luminous ritual with a grounded ethic. The eel chorus and circular dance recast “understanding sacred patterns” as a lived promise kept. Resonance lingers without didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of censorship, pain-as-cartography, and earned voice accrues through concrete motifs (timer, star chart used as letter opener, map stitched into coat). The line “We breathe so scars can speak” edges toward thesis‑statement but is supported by scene‑work and doesn’t flatten ambiguity. The closing reprices “pause” as listening rather than silence, enriching the question of how truth emerges. Resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres around wonder versus certainty and the ethics of collaboration, expressed through steel, light, and score rather than sermon. The final gesture (returning the card; “no destination forgives a single author”) reweights prior images without moralizing. One direct statement of motive edges toward telling, but the imagery does the heavier lift. Resonance lingers in the charged portal and the relinquishment it implies.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—language as infrastructure and resistance—emerges through specific acts (seed packets, sonnets along cracks) rather than abstract sermonizing. A few aphoristic lines flirt with thesis-stating (“Fear is an obedient architect”) but are earned by action. The final shared note reframes “molting” from solitary to communal, deepening the question of identity and solidarity. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Time, fate, and art’s capacity to reweight the world emerge through recurring particulars (clock, compasses, projector, arbor) without didactic statement. The final image reprices the premise: destiny can be startled by human improvisation, at a cost of persistent longing. The child’s match as a “steady compass” is a deft subtextual turn from mechanical measurement to communal witness. One line (“destiny, properly startled, missed its departing train”) skirts on‑the‑nose but remains earned by scene momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of memory as living commons, verification versus faith, and guidance through remembrance arise organically from acts and images (marbles, driftwood, ear‑fruit). The final realization that “memory, once wakened, also steers” reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext blooms in the tension between curated proofs and doubt. Resonance lingers in the charged decision to be midwife rather than auditor.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of apology, pruning, and remembrance interweave through repeated, reweighted images (shears, tides, lace). The non‑literal answer—apology’s color flickers without understanding until ritual integrates memory—lands through scene rather than moralizing. One near‑explicit line (“as if apology alone could never last without understanding”) slightly overstates what the images already show. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is masterfully integrated, emerging organically from the central metaphor that links astrophysics and botany. The concept of "gradual change" is not just an abstract idea but the very mechanism of the plot. The story avoids didacticism, culminating in the resonant final image of the river and Mara's line, "The universe prefers whispers," which provides a non-literal answer to the story's central question about how to recover from cataclysm.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of creation, destruction, and reclamation is beautifully woven through recurring motifs of glass, fire, and cold. The central image of the "scorched testament" is powerful and resonant. The story's primary flaw lies in the final third, where it succumbs to thematic echo by explicitly stating its core insight ("creation and survival shared the same rhythm"). This brief moment of telling slightly undermines the otherwise powerful, image-driven conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is woven into the story's fabric with subtlety and power, exploring how meaning and art can be transformed, not just lost, after a cataclysm. The concept emerges organically from the central action of translating vibration to color. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, beautifully re-contextualizing "unshaken marvels" to include the protagonist, avoiding any didactic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is handled with exceptional grace, emerging organically from the undertaker’s actions rather than through statement. The concept that "wandering grief turns cities into graveyards, but here grief had built its own architecture" is a profound insight earned by the narrative. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central problem of unrest, achieving a powerful emotional aftereffect without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of reciprocal kindness ("Support grows by echo") emerges organically from the narrative's concrete particulars, never succumbing to didacticism. The final image of the charcoal-sketched bell on the napkin is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question of how hope survives. Rhessa's final declaration is not a moral but an earned observation, cementing a theme that resonates with profound complexity and emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme emerges powerfully from the story's unique imagery and central conceit. However, the final third veers into direct thematic summary with the line, "Unused love, once released, does not vanish; it seeds the dusk..." This over-explanation lessens the impact of the otherwise resonant final images, functioning as a "thematic echo" that doesn't fully trust the reader. This flaw prevents an otherwise exceptional story from reaching the highest tier in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of obsession, memory, and the price of knowledge emerges organically from the plot without a single line of explicit moralizing. The final image of Quillon as the silent curator offers a complex, resonant answer to his initial quest, reconfiguring the desire "to discover the texture of time" into a permanent obligation. The story's central question is answered through a powerful, non-literal image that lingers with profound ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of resilience blooming from ruin emerges organically from the central premise and culminates in a resonant final image. The transformation of a carnival prize into a key for survival is a powerful metaphor. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary, explicitly stating what the story has already shown ("it would root beneath ruins and make strength bloom..."), slightly undermining the earned power of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges with superb subtlety from the story's central conceit and resonant imagery. The idea that absences can "bloom into warning" is a sophisticated insight earned through the plot. The final few sentences verge on overstating the theme ("not as despair, but as cauterized promise"), a minor flaw that slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of release versus hoarding, of found possibility versus bartered futures, emerges organically from the story’s central metaphor. The narrative avoids any moralizing, instead offering a powerful closing image—the door of light—as a resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's quest. The subtextual link between stealing others' pasts and being unable to access her own future is resolved beautifully when she releases the memories and joins her own younger self.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of the "thawing heart" is beautifully integrated, emerging organically from the setting, character, and action. However, the final realization, "the safest zone for inquiry begins within," is slightly too explicit. This line functions as a thematic statement that verges on telling the reader the moral, which slightly diminishes the resonance that was otherwise built with such masterful subtlety. While the idea is earned, its direct articulation prevents the theme from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story explores themes of identity, memory, and exploitation with depth. The final image of the seashell "whispering, now for anyone brave enough to listen" is a powerful, non-didactic thematic resolution. A slight demerit for the line "through the fracture I saw how porous all selves are," which verges on stating its theme too directly, though it's somewhat excused by the confessional context.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is expertly woven into the story's fabric without a single declarative statement. Concepts of silence as strength, adaptation to overwhelming darkness, and communication beyond language emerge organically from the central premise. The final instruction, "lead your men into its afterimage; there the next dawn hides," is a thematically perfect and unforgettable closing note that reweights the entire story with a difficult, earned hope.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thematic development is deeply integrated and resonant, culminating in the sublime insight that thought originates "where a broom meets starlight." However, the final paragraph slightly undermines this earned, imagistic conclusion with a direct thematic statement: "revelation is just well-placed debris awaiting someone patient enough to gather it across timelines." This moment of telling in a story that otherwise masters showing is a minor but distinct flaw that prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story's theme of transparency over rhetoric is woven into its core mechanics and culminates in a powerful final image of communal, non-verbal truth. The resolution beautifully avoids a stated moral. The score is slightly tempered by a few lines that verge on thematic summary, such as "Honesty, stripped of rhetoric, might yet free both speaker and listener," which momentarily tells what the rest of the story shows so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.8)
    The story masterfully explores the theme of quantifiable versus unquantifiable worth without a single line of overt moralizing. The concept of "mended deception" is beautifully transformed into "transparency" through Orlan's actions. The final image of the sundial registering 'Gardener' serves as a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, re-weighting the entire value system presented at the start.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is handled with masterful subtlety, emerging from the friction between ambition and responsibility without a single didactic statement. The story's central question is answered not with a moral but with a resonant, complex final image of Maren carrying her discovery "like twin suns," perfectly embodying both the prize and the burden of her new knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of finding meaning in ruin and communication within silence is developed with exceptional subtlety. It emerges organically from the central conceit of a score written by water damage and a conversation held through resonance. The final credo and the transformed meaning of "the hush of unstruck chords" provide a resonant, non-literal conclusion that beautifully reweights the entire story without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is expertly woven through recurring imagery—swaying lilies, margins, seeds, weather—that accumulates meaning without a single instance of overt statement. The central concept of "fault tolerance" is explored with nuance, moving from a technical attribute of the oracle to a psychological state Mara earns. The final image of the falling seed provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the question of what to do with a painful truth, achieving profound resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.8)

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of witnessing, memory, and detachment is explored with subtlety and depth, emerging organically from the story’s potent imagery. The piece avoids easy moralizing, culminating in a resonant final image that embodies its central questions. The line "Perhaps that is the price of peace..." verges on being overly explicit, but is saved by its speculative phrasing within the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of "ordinary magic" and memory as a form of wonder emerges organically from the story's central images: the curl, the song, the eclipse. The final image of the warm box is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly limited by the final paragraphs, which verge on explaining their own subtext, particularly the line about the chord that "would travel tomorrow to Junie," which risks stating the theme rather than letting it resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of memory, listening, and collective action as a healing force emerges organically from the story’s central metaphor of the "displaced axis." Subtext is carried effectively through the imagery of the broken rod on the tapestry and the final, subtle shift of the wind.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of secrets as "cages we pretend are keys" is developed with exceptional grace. It emerges organically from the plot, culminating in Jun's direct statement, which feels earned rather than preachy. The final image of the broadcast as a "key change" that raises the night "half a tone" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the nature of knowledge and freedom. The subtext is carried perfectly by the interplay of light, tide, and music.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story develops complex themes of faith, truth, and the power of language through evocative imagery and action. The final image of the priest as a "janitor of meaning" is resonant. However, the final third dips into thematic summary, particularly with lines like "truth delivered through rhetorical devices seldom survives unaccompanied." This direct statement slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise beautifully implicit thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is the story's triumphant core, emerging organically from the interplay of memory, sound, and light. The concept of art as a means of conversing with time is beautifully explored without a single line of exposition. The final image of the "new measure" within the shell provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the character's ache, suggesting creation rather than erasure is the path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of identity as a curated, costly choice emerges organically from the story’s potent central metaphor. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. The score is slightly capped because the narrative twice states its own mechanics in abstract terms (e.g., "survival meant choosing which fragment..."), bordering on a thematic echo that momentarily replaces embodied experience with conceptual summary.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of finding profound feeling in structured silence, rather than noise, emerges organically from the story’s unique particulars without a single didactic misstep. Subtext is carried powerfully through the central metaphors of the "filament of hush" and "backward recorded songs." The final paragraph provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, culminating in an image of "distant thunder... applauding in restraint" that is thematically perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of validated truth versus suppressed data emerges organically from the plot. The principle that "two observers ensure validation" serves as a powerful, non-didactic thesis that drives the climax. The final image of the pigeon awaiting new coordinates provides a resonant, lingering sense of a continuing struggle. The line "she tried to intuit how storms teach mercy" verges on being too explicit, slightly weakening an otherwise masterful thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of memory's power to both wound and preserve love emerges organically from the central conflict. The final image is resonant, avoiding a simple moral. However, a few lines drift toward thematic statement, slightly undermining the subtext, particularly "teaching citizens that the impact of memories was choice as much as chemistry," which feels more like an authorial thesis than a character's forged insight.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic exploration of choice, time, and compassion is handled with sophistication, emerging from the central conflict rather than being stated. The climactic insight, "Compassion is a rhythm, not a ledger," is delivered as a catalyzing event, not a narrative summary. The final image of the glowing grotto offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the texture of time, perfectly satisfying the 9+ test for thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is expertly woven into every element, from the setting of wrecks and ruins to the final "unfinished melody." The resolution offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The line "Beauty, she knew, lived in incompletion" borders on overt statement, a minor flaw that slightly reduces the subtextual power but is softened by its placement as an internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is woven expertly through action and imagery, never succumbing to direct statement. The core concepts—the cost of empathy, the allure of manufactured feeling, and the necessity of professional boundaries—emerge organically from the transaction. The final image of the dealer waiting for new "storms" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion about the nature of his work, offering a complex answer to the central thematic questions without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of recognizing "silent contributors" is central but delivered with a heavy hand. Phrases like "For the hands who lift without applause," Liora's maxim about mistakes becoming maps, and the motto "gratitude begins" function as direct thematic statements rather than emergent insights. This over-articulation, particularly in the final paragraphs, replaces resonant subtext with a tidy, sentimental moral, which is penalized as a "thematic echo."

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic integration is seamless. The core concept of grafting "strangers to family" is explored through layered motifs—weaving, mapping, knots, and roots—that culminate in the central image of the arbor. The story's final moments offer a profound, non-literal answer to its central question about belonging, not through summary but through the resonant image of new shoots shaped like the characters' tools. The theme emerges organically from every element of the narrative without a single didactic misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of raw, unmediated truth versus measured, civic order emerges organically from the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.7)

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic exploration of memory, connection, and purposeful existence is seamlessly woven into the narrative through concrete particulars. The central idea that "remembrance is circuitry" is demonstrated through the tape fragment, the cache, and the final act, avoiding any didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of transformation through surrender is developed with exceptional subtlety and power. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from Marisol's actions and internal state. The final image of the seed is a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question about identity, beautifully reweighting the entire narrative from a story of loss to one of germination.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, exploring memory, loss, and shared vulnerability.

The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer that reframes the characters' struggles into purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of wonder being shared rather than owned emerges organically from the conflict and character arcs. The final image of daylight ringing like night is a superb, resonant conclusion. However, the explicit internal thought, "understanding now that wonder thrives by being shared, not owned," verges on stating the moral directly, slightly undermining the power of the subtext that the preceding actions had so beautifully established.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of memory, trauma, and the nature of healing is explored with profound subtlety. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge from the central metaphor of the silent trumpet and the lattice of fragmented stories.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of paths versus destinations, and logic versus intuition, emerges organically from the story’s central conceit. The final image of the ticket reading "Destinations pretend too" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic summary, such as "Maps show paths, she thought, but mysteries unravel when a path shows the mapper," and the final sentence. This explicit moralizing in the closing paragraphs weakens an otherwise subtle and powerful thematic structure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme emerges organically from the synthesis of science, nature, and mysticism for most of the story. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary. Lines like "Tonight skepticism had listened, kindness had acted..." explicitly state the moral, replacing the resonant imagery of the previous beats with a less impactful explanation. This thematic echo significantly undercuts the ending's subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of endings giving meaning to the endless is explored with subtlety and depth, emerging organically from the story’s sci-fi conceit. The final insight that "goodbye is not an ending, only a coordinate" is a powerful, resonant crystallization of the core idea. The only minor weakness is the line "I realized boredom was merely a refusal to intrigue oneself," which verges on stating the theme directly, slightly lessening the impact of the otherwise masterful subtext. Nonetheless, the final image carries the thematic weight beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of "fair trade" is masterfully woven through character, object, and plot, culminating in a complex, non-moralizing resolution. The final image of the ink pot is superb. However, the line "the world, she realized, was a problem set that only liquefied rigid thinking could solve" is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the resonance of the closing images by over-explaining them.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of history, memory, and the archivist's role is sophisticated and emerges organically from the events. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering the powerful metaphor of history as a "loom." The final juxtaposition of the stationer who bottles apocalypses beside wedding vows creates a resonant, lingering subtext about the hidden depths of the mundane.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory versus erasure is beautifully integrated into every facet of the story, from character to setting. The final image of the warming label provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, a few lines like "Texture precedes meaning; that is the first rule..." and "Histories do not vanish..." border on explicit thematic summary, a minor flaw that slightly lessens the subtextual power of an otherwise masterful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme—that reality is a subjective, ever-changing story—emerges with exceptional grace from the narrative's concrete events. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the climactic epiphany to land as an earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of memory, progress, and the limits of archives is sophisticated and deeply integrated. The theme emerges organically from Halina's actions and internal reflections, particularly the question of conveying "sensorial sorrow." The story's final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer: true preservation is carried within, a personal and untransferable weight. It masterfully avoids any stated moral, letting the melancholy image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding patterns and direction beneath sensory noise emerges beautifully from the central repair sequence. However, the story falters slightly at the end by over-stating its thesis. The apprentice's realization followed by Mara’s direct thematic statement ("Direction is only hidden until we decode...") feels like a summary, a "Thematic Echo" that slightly diminishes the power of the preceding subtle demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme—the clash between empirical mapping and living, remembered knowledge—emerges with exceptional grace from the story's particulars. It avoids any hint of moralizing, instead dramatizing the theme through the conflict between Morrow's ink and Yara's phrasebook. The final image of Morrow embracing a "spoken" atlas is a resonant, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire story without a single misplaced word.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is woven into the story's fabric through image and action rather than statement. The concept that memory and existence are sustained by rhythm and balance ("Balance wants music, not words") emerges organically from the central ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story presents a coherent and poignant theme about preserving ephemeral beauty, which emerges organically from the setting and plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The scholar's dialogue ("To harness the ephemeral") verges on stating the theme directly, but it is well-contextualized as a dying man's obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of storytelling's power to trap or connect is explored with nuance and depth. The narrative avoids moralizing, instead allowing the theme to emerge from Silas's evolving actions. The final image of the warden tracing the lattice offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about how a tainted truth can be made credible.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of cyclical debt, grief, and recompense emerges organically from the potent imagery of grafting, soul-fruit, and constellations. The core concept of "mournful elation" is beautifully sustained, resisting a simplistic moral. However, the final paragraph contains a direct thematic statement: "Some debts take lifetimes; some, a single night..." This unnecessary summary slightly weakens an otherwise resonant ending, constituting a "Thematic Echo" that states what the preceding scene had already masterfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of creating reverence from ruin by breaking precedents is powerfully integrated through concrete imagery, particularly Wren sewing shattered instruments into new tools. The story's core concept is resonant and emerges organically from the action. However, the final line, "...knowing the path she carved will lead others from ruin to reverence," is an explicit thematic summary that slightly undermines the earned, imagistic conclusion, creating a Thematic Echo.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is handled with masterful subtlety. The concepts of exile, faith, and interrupted journeys are woven into every image, from the root-choked bones to the sundial itself. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, with the final image of the sundial's new arm tracking "the slow return of trust" providing a complex and earned thematic statement without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of preserving ephemeral human sentiment against technological erasure is beautifully integrated and never stated outright. It emerges organically from the juxtaposition of drones and surface mail, magnetic storage and chalk. The final image of Mirielle picking up the chalk offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial search, fulfilling the story's central question without resorting to a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of wisdom disguised as foolishness emerges organically from character and action, avoiding any didacticism. Subtext is the story's engine, especially in the dialogue with Voren, where every word carries a double meaning. The final image of foolishness as a "cloak" for wisdom offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central conflict, creating a memorable and thought-provoking conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is developed with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the central images of unsent letters, silence, and liminal spaces.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of regrowth and shared humanity emerges organically from a powerful constellation of images (coral, cast, snow, sea). The final line—"Let what was broken remember its pattern, and build again together"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central tension. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with an explicit thematic statement ("I realized my task... was never to mediate between enemy tongues but between frightened hearts"), a flaw that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory's power to heal and be reshaped is powerfully integrated into the plot. The story's central actions are a literal enactment of its theme. However, the final line, "...the certainty that memory can be repainted brighter than before," is a thematic statement that verges on moralizing, slightly undermining the resonance of the final image by explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of curiosity versus certainty is explored with depth and nuance, emerging organically from the story's central conceit. The final image of citizens flocking to "taste the interval before answers" is a brilliant, resonant conclusion that avoids didacticism. The score is held just shy of the 9-band due to one line—"Her own private motive echoed perfectly in the garden's demand"—a minor thematic echo that states the connection a bit too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is the story's strongest element, emerging organically from the fusion of its biopunk world and linguistic rebellion. The central concept of "taxable thoughts" is explored through resonant particulars like "leafcutter ant dialects" and a garden where "hoes edited poetry." The final image of planting a "sentence" provides a non-literal, powerful answer to the story's core question of how to resist intellectual suppression, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme is the story's heart, emerging organically from the central metaphor of transforming pain into beauty, and then into peace. The final image of the postcard becoming a "tree of nebulae" provides a resonant, non-literal expansion of the theme. The elder's explanation borders on being slightly too explicit ("the universe had tired of devouring poems that tasted only of anguish"), a minor flaw preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.6)
    The themes of memory, preservation, and the restorative power of art emerge organically from the story's concrete particulars. The narrative avoids any moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image—the library as a nurtured garden—that provides a non-literal answer to its central questions. The subtextual link between lost languages and lost identities (mouthless faces) is handled with exceptional grace and power, making the climax emotionally impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of language and art possessing a power beyond politics or violence ("declarations no sword could parry") is woven seamlessly into the plot. It emerges through action and image, never through explicit statement. The final image of Ada humming an "unfinished tune" provides a perfect, resonant conclusion—the work of building trust is cyclical and ongoing, resisting a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of harmonizing conflicting values is skillfully woven through action and imagery rather than just being stated. The final image of children following Mara’s footprints provides a resonant, non-didactic conclusion. However, the repeated use of abstract labels like "encrypted compassion" and "conflicting values" occasionally reads like authorial thesis statements, slightly undermining the otherwise organic emergence of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The themes of trust, exile, and reinvention are woven into the story's fabric with exceptional subtlety and power, culminating in a resonant final image. A minor deduction is warranted for the line "Trust, she realized, is not a ledger column...," which verges on an explicit thematic statement, slightly lessening the subtextual elegance in a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic exploration of "necessary distances" is masterful, woven organically through maze corridors, weather codes, wood grain, and human relationships.

This offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central thematic question, re-weighting the entire narrative with profound ambiguity and insight.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of belonging is explored with nuance, moving beyond a simple search for home to a more profound understanding of connection as a "rhythm between notes."

The ending avoids a tidy moral, instead offering a powerful, non-literal answer to the central question that reweights the entire story.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of healing absences with acknowledged emotions emerges with subtlety and power. The final image, where an unknown traveler can now take a missing step, provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The piece avoids moralizing, though the conjecture that paths were "consumed by the burden of emotions never spoken aloud" verges on stating the theme too directly, a minor slip in an otherwise masterfully handled thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of "orchestrated serendipity" is explored with exceptional depth and artistry, moving from direct statement to powerful demonstration. The story avoids simple moralizing, instead using its final images to offer a resonant, non-literal answer to its central questions about chance, design, and meaning. The skeptics' observation that they "could not explain the timing" is a masterful touch that elevates the theme beyond simple fantasy into a nuanced philosophical meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of memory as a subversive, elemental force is explored with remarkable subtlety and power. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the central conflict and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding beauty in brokenness and illuminating the mundane is expertly woven through the story’s central conceit and imagery, emerging organically from the action. The final image of the town transformed is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly capped by the concluding line, "a reminder that beauty adjusts the axis of perception," which functions as a thematic statement that verges on telling the reader the moral, slightly diminishing the power of the preceding dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of transforming grief into possibility is beautifully rendered through the central imagery of the broken porcelain and ash. However, the story's thematic power is undercut by explicit authorial statements, particularly the line about translating pain into a "universal language." This thematic echo replaces resonant subtext with a direct thesis statement, showing a lack of confidence in the story's own powerful symbols.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme—that hope can be a form of rigorous, compassionate science infused with art—emerges organically from the story's unique conceits. There are no heavy-handed statements; instead, the theme breathes through the images of decorated balloons, breathing symbols, and the final, resonant act of setting the parchment boat afloat. The story's final lines offer a non-literal answer to its central question, reweighting the entire narrative with a sense of profound, quiet success.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of legacy and memory is potent and emerges organically from the story’s discoveries. The final image of the "awake" walls is a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial question. However, the line "the past always leans forward, balancing its elbows on the future's table" is an overly explicit thematic statement that momentarily breaks the subtextual spell, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme—art's power to create possibilities rather than just reflect reality—is seamlessly integrated and brilliantly executed. It is introduced through Ariste’s motivation and then dramatized on the page, as the narrator's own eyes become the first mirrors to be persuaded. The final image of the city transformed and the bells remade into "bells of possibility" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic resonance is achieved with subtlety and power. The central theme—that redemption and peace are not final states but costly, ongoing processes of upkeep—emerges organically from the narrative's particulars. The final image of Petra facing the moons perfectly encapsulates this "flawed beauty," providing a non-literal, resonant answer to the story's core question without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is woven seamlessly through image and action. Concepts of manufactured nature, repentance, and what it means to be human emerge organically from the narrative. The final image of the rain washing away the map is a sublime, non-literal answer to Serafina's journey. The line "reversing the direction of debt" verges on being overly explicit, but it's a minor flaw in an otherwise thematically resonant and complex piece.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic handling is superb, exploring conformity, silence, and authenticity through the central, recurring motif of threads and weaving. The story avoids any moralizing, instead delivering its resonant answer through the final, powerful image of a sky made of echoes where "each citizen's smallest utterance sprouted a color." This is a sophisticated, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire narrative and lingers with the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme is developed with remarkable nuance through the central metaphor of "half-lit epiphanies."

The story powerfully dramatizes its thesis, offering a resonant, non-literal answer that avoids a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of honoring overlooked histories is woven into the very fabric of the plot, emerging organically from the conflict and its resolution. The midwife’s story serves as a potent particular that avoids abstraction. The final paragraph contains a line—"proof that overlooked histories can glow brighter than remembered ones"—that borders on a direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise perfect subtext and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.8)
    The themes of memory, forgiveness, and art as preservation are seamlessly integrated and emerge entirely through action and image. The story avoids any overt moralizing, offering instead the final, resonant image of the bronze bell core humming with eternal spring.

    The theme of purpose transcending memory is explored with nuance and powerful imagery, culminating in the beautiful metaphor of the "living vine." The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the line "I can promise the future its ancestry and remind the past of its descendants, stitching continuity from fragments" veers close to a direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise superb subtext and costing it a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of discovery as an eternal, incomplete process is beautifully realized through the final image of the expanded magic square. However, the direct articulation in "devotion to the very act of discovery, eternally incomplete" borders on thematic summary. While filtered through the character's understanding, this moment of telling slightly lessens the resonance that the story's imagery otherwise perfectly achieves.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is woven deeply through image and action, with the broken music box serving as a potent, non-literal metaphor for healing. The story's final insight feels earned and complex, avoiding simple morals.

    The story masterfully explores themes of memory, knowledge, debt, and paradox without ever resorting to direct statement. The central concept of a "library of unlearned lessons" is itself a rich thematic well.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of history as a living, editable text is explored with nuance and depth. The story skillfully avoids simple moralizing, landing on the sophisticated idea of clarification over rewriting. The final image of the cohabiting crests on the wax seal is a perfect, resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. A slight deduction is for the line "an archivist succeeds when confusion forgets it ever existed," which verges on stating the theme, though it's voiced well enough to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme—that tranquility is not an absence of turmoil but a cultivated rhythm within it—emerges organically from the protagonist's journey. The "bloom of hush" and the concept of "pollinating silences" are resonant metaphors that carry the thematic weight without sermonizing. The final line, "calm was not a destination but a rhythm one can redraw," verges on direct statement but feels earned as a concluding epiphany rather than an authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.8)

It emerges organically from Lioh's actions and beliefs, culminating in a final image that offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image—new constellations burned into old star charts—that provides a non-literal answer to its central question. The one explicit thematic statement near the end is a minor flaw but feels largely earned by the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of achieving goals through indirectness is woven beautifully through character, object, and action. The story culminates in a resonant insight about tuning one's speech to the "corrugated" texture of time. However, the penultimate paragraph dips into overt thematic summary ("Transition periods, she thought, are nothing but cosmic hesitations..."), a minor thematic echo that slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise subtle and powerful exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of contrasting approaches to safety (inward contraction vs. outward expansion) emerges organically from the plot and character actions. The final image of father and child reinforcing the beams together provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the line "The hush had taught him that some shelters grow upward, not inward" is a minor thematic echo, a moment of telling that slightly undermines the otherwise perfect subtlety of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is developed with exceptional subtlety, emerging organically from the story's imagery and central action. The recurring motifs of the humming notebooks, the storm glass, and the train whistle are reweighted at the conclusion to create a powerful resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of transforming harmful pressure into honest value is masterfully woven through the narrative, emerging organically from character and action. The final image of diamonds sprouting from spores is a powerful, non-literal resolution that resists a simple moral. The insight "forgetting weight makes stars burn and coal become gem" verges on being an explicit statement, but its placement as a mid-climax realization feels earned rather than authorial. The subtextual contrast between the scheme's empty sparkle and the farm's "honest light" is resonant and well-developed.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of memory as a rebellious act is executed with stunning precision. Subtext operates through potent imagery—the key from a defunct "connection" company, the puddle-map as "permission," the final act of rewriting the city with her breath.

The result is emotionally honest and intellectually satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.8)

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)

It emerges organically from the central image of the mainspring barrel measuring time for no one. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central tension. A minor deduction is for the repeated phrase "weightless burden," which comes close to explicitly stating the theme rather than letting it resonate entirely through image.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of order versus generative chaos is explored with nuance and artistry, culminating in the concise, powerful statement 'Now is always.'

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of preferring profound questions to finite answers emerges organically from the character's actions and culminates in the brilliant closing image. The story largely trusts its imagery, especially the motif of collection and the final punctuation-shaped door. However, the final insight, "answers are impossible souvenirs, but questions can live here forever," verges on an explicit thematic statement, slightly undermining the subtextual power of the final action by over-articulating its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of time, art, and interconnectedness is potent and well-integrated into the imagery. However, the story leans towards over-statement, particularly with the repeated phrase "scaffold complexity with simplicity." This line, while elegant, functions as a thematic label articulated by both the narrator and the magical forces, slightly diminishing the subtext. While the final image is resonant, this directness prevents the theme from feeling fully emergent, holding it back from the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of communion, continuation, and hidden life emerges organically from the story's central imagery—postcards, etched glass, and the final phosphorescent mural.

    The theme of documentation as an act of resistance emerges organically and powerfully from the story's events. The final exchange ("Because stories travel even when bodies cannot") and the final image of the "storied" lagoon provide a resonant, non-literal conclusion. A minor deduction is warranted for the slightly too-explicit thematic statement, "documenting the truth was another form of revolt," which borders on moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully weaves its themes of memory, inheritance, and ecological hope through concrete imagery rather than statement. The concept of planting minutes like seeds culminates in the final, resonant image of a self-grown thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic development is very strong, exploring the nuanced relationship between observation and action, silence and sound. The final image of the single bell chime as thanksgiving is a brilliant, non-literal resolution. However, the preceding line—"confirming that curiosity, properly tuned, could save lives"—is an explicit thematic summary that slightly undermines the resonant power of the final image, preventing an exceptional score.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of finding meaning in forgotten things and strength in vulnerability is expertly woven through the central metaphor. The story earns its resonance through action and imagery, particularly the link between sweeping dust and cosmic erosion. However, the final act is slightly marred by a single line of overt thematic moralizing ("strength is sometimes a patch of vulnerability polished to brilliance"), which feels like an unnecessary summary of what the story has already beautifully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of preserving unspoken vows is beautifully woven through imagery—the silent ghosts, the indented wax, Orin's muteness. The final image of the box provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the line "he was built to hold sounds no mouth could keep" veers close to a direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme—the nature of time as qualitative experience versus quantitative measurement—emerges organically from the story's potent imagery and events. The resolution, where numbers become sensations ('17 as cinnamon'), is a brilliant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final sentence about stories in garage sale classifieds provides a thematically perfect and resonant closing image, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding wholeness through fracture is woven seamlessly into the action and imagery. However, the final two sentences state the theme directly ("beauty in the incomplete revealed itself as the most perfect thing of all"). This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the earned resonance of the preceding scenes by summarizing what the reader has just experienced, a notable flaw for a piece aiming at the highest literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of interconnectedness is developed with remarkable subtlety and power, culminating in a superb final image that avoids didacticism. The villagers' epiphany, realizing they share "identical branching math" with all life, is an earned, resonant answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of inquiry, return, and the limits of empiricism is sophisticated and deeply integrated. The concept of the pilgrimage as an "interior itinerary" is a brilliant turn that elevates the narrative from a simple mystery to a profound meditation on knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    The themes of memory, ecological grief, and restorative storytelling emerge organically from the story’s potent imagery. The final line, "petals kept reciting the dead languages of peace," is a stunning, non-literal resolution. The score is slightly tempered by one moment of overt thematic statement ("gardens thrive on memory... fertilized with story"), which, while well-placed, verges on making the subtext explicit in a way the rest of the piece artfully avoids.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of translating distance into closeness is woven beautifully through the narrative, culminating in a resonant final action rather than a simple discovery. The subtext is strong, particularly in the contrast between silence and the 'secret texts'. A minor deduction is warranted for the final paragraph's slight thematic over-articulation ("I realized that tinted revelations were not colors of sight..."), which verges on explaining the story's metaphor to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thematic depth is exceptional, with concepts of guidance, time, and purpose emerging organically from the narrative's central images and actions. The final image provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's core questions.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.6)

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of history's nature emerges beautifully from subtextual actions and competing desires. However, the final line, "History, he realized, is only ever the echo of someone choosing to notice," is a minor but distinct flaw. It functions as a thematic summary, slightly undermining the resonant power of the preceding scene by stating the moral too explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of home as a dynamic, internal process rather than a static place emerges organically from the narrative. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the final conversation with the seer and the closing image to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's quest. The lost language stone and the act of "seeding" verses serve as powerful, integrated metaphors for how we construct meaning from a fragmented past.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of balancing brilliance with mercy is masterfully integrated through the central chess metaphor. However, the final two paragraphs verge on thematic summary, particularly the line "determined never to teach brilliance without mercy." While earned, this direct statement slightly diminishes the resonance that was already powerfully established through action and image, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of truth as a multifaceted, refracted concept versus a monolithic judgment emerges with grace and power. The final image of the spire covered in myriad small mirrors is a stunning, non-literal embodiment of this theme. The line “Vera realized the canyon did not want their repentance; it wanted their honesty” verges on being slightly too explicit, but it functions as a necessary pivot for the final action, and is a minor slip in an otherwise thematically resonant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of "kintsugi intentions"—mending what is broken to make it stronger and more beautiful—is flawlessly executed. It begins as an external practice and culminates in a profound internal realization. The story's final image of Brielle's own flesh sealed with "radiant veins that hummed like newborn gears" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central thematic question, reweighting the entire narrative without a single word of moralizing. It's a sublime and earned thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story explores its theme of psychological safety with impressive nuance, culminating in a resonant final image rather than a simple moral. The shift from relic to recipe is a powerful thematic evolution. However, the score is capped below 9.0 due to a moment of thematic summary: the lines "He realized the eye did not occlude empathy entirely... That balance was the psychological safety he sought" state the theme directly, slightly undermining the otherwise masterful use of subtext and image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is handled with sublime subtlety. The concepts of memory, connection, and purposeful isolation emerge organically from the story's particulars without a single line of overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story beautifully develops themes of memory, choice, and trust through its central actions and images. However, the final paragraph includes a line of thematic summary ("Elias realized that every map... had pointed here, needing only the empirically intuitive act..."), which slightly over-articulates the insight the reader has just experienced. This minor "thematic echo" slightly weakens an otherwise resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is handled with exceptional subtlety and power. The central concept of "bleeding starlight" as a manifestation of a leader's moral wound is a potent, original metaphor. The resolution avoids a simple apology, instead focusing on "recompense more than regret," offering a complex and resonant answer to the story's central question about power and responsibility without a single line of overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)

    The theme of finding new modes of perception in the face of loss emerges organically from the plot. The story's central insight—"absence could funnel perception, not drain it"—is earned through action. However, the recurring phrases "reading between lines" and "emotional terrain" function as explicit thematic labels that slightly reduce the subtext's power, preventing a higher score. The final image of the new map is a strong, resonant answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is seamlessly woven into the narrative's fabric through concrete imagery rather than abstract statement.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of time as connection rather than duration emerges organically from the plot, culminating in the stunning image of the mirror-sand. The story powerfully resists a simple moral. However, the final two paragraphs verge on thematic summary, with lines like "Time was not length but linkage" and "His job was not to herd hours but to keep the dialogue whole." While beautifully phrased, this direct articulation slightly lessens the resonance that the preceding imagery had already masterfully established.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic integration is very strong, emerging organically from character, setting, and conflict. However, a few lines verge on being too declarative, such as the duplicate's introduction, "I am the possibility you abandoned..." While fitting the surreal tone, this slightly undermines the subtext by stating what is already powerfully implied. The final proof, "nothing secure can grow," feels more earned.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme is powerfully developed through the central motifs of probability, light, and perspective. The final image of the broken lantern offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is slightly capped by a moment of thematic over-articulation in the resolution ("In that plain light she realized... It was about letting contradictions stay lucid..."), which explains the epiphany rather than letting the image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is handled with exceptional grace, emerging organically from the story's core conceit and imagery. The relationship between endings and beginnings, connection and estrangement, is explored through action rather than pronouncement. The final paragraph serves as a perfect resonant reconfiguration of the story's ideas, offering a non-literal answer to the central problem without a hint of moralizing. The final image of endings "rehearsing introductions" is sublime.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of communal healing as an active, shared responsibility emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The central metaphor of memory steeping like tea is beautifully realized in the locket's function. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The realization that the covenant is "a contract among neighbors" verges on being explicit, but it is so thoroughly earned by the preceding scene that it functions as a powerful, crystallizing insight rather than a thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is handled with exceptional grace and subtlety. The central idea of connection as a problem of logistics, reciprocity, and "polite anarchy" is explored through concrete images (moon rock, manifest, origami swallow) rather than exposition. The final realization offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any hint of a tidy moral and leaving a powerful emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic resonance is achieved with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the story's central magical conceit. The theme—that true cartography is internal and empathetic—is not stated but demonstrated through Oriole’s journey from seeking a place to creating a resonance. The final image of emotional waypoints as "braille constellations" is a brilliant, non-literal resolution that lingers beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme is sophisticated and brilliantly explored through the sustained metaphor of cosmic copyediting. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with direct thematic statements. The revelation that "history disliked being corrected; it preferred being accompanied" is a powerful idea delivered as an overt summary, functioning as a thematic echo that slightly lessens the piece's resonance by stating what was already being shown.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story masterfully explores themes of memory, grief, and the transcendent nature of art without a single line of exposition. The central idea that silence itself is a language with a map is beautifully dramatized. The final image of synesthetic, silent music ("Purple chords floated above rooftops") provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of grief, lingering long after the story ends. The theme emerges organically from the story's unique magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of forgiveness and the resilience of knowledge is powerfully integrated through recurring motifs of fire, art, and books. The central concept is explored through concrete actions, culminating in the final mural, which provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. While the theme is handled with grace, the explicit nature of the messages ("Return the ember, and the library will forgive") comes close to stating the theme directly, slightly reducing the subtext's power.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, exploring the tension between imposed order and organic, collective will. The final image of the transmuted auroral sorrow offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. The final line, "dreams breathed together cannot be owned, only nurtured," while powerful, verges on a direct thematic statement, slightly reducing the subtextual power of the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme—that quiet, subtle forces are more powerful than loud, obvious ones—is woven into every aspect of the narrative, from the whisper challenge to the "smuggled silence." The final line, "silence, practiced well, is the loudest song in any storm," risks being an overt statement, but the lyrical quality and the story's preceding actions earn it completely. The final image of the footsteps as a "duet" provides a resonant, non-literal resolution that is both beautiful and thematically potent.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of transforming pain into shared light emerges organically from the story's central conceit and imagery, culminating in a resonant final action. The subtextual communication is powerful, particularly the guardian's "voice" in the shutter beats. However, a few lines verge on thematic summary, slightly reducing the subtext's power, as in, "He sought, I realized, to teach darkness the value of stars." While framed as an epiphany, it's a moment of telling in a story that otherwise shows with exceptional grace.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of contemplation versus certainty is woven into every element, from the chess metaphor to the grotto's wisdom ("You cannot force reflection"). The final image of the townspeople pausing offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem without a hint of moralizing. The rebellion's quietness is its power, and this idea emerges organically from the story's particulars, achieving a complex and satisfying thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is woven into every image and action with extraordinary grace. The concept of "combative tenderness"—a strength that refuses to wound in a world where violence is impossible—emerges organically from the whale's call, the island's breakers, and Eren's final smile. The story offers a profound, non-literal answer to its central question about freedom, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story masterfully explores themes of grief, oppression, and authentic versus performed emotion through potent imagery like the blank face, dried flowers, and the flameless lamp. The final image of the "remade hush" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The score is held just below the 9+ band by Marrow's line about cultivating "lightness inside the weight," which, while elegant, functions as a thematic statement that slightly reduces the ambiguity and power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the story’s central images—the ephemeral breath-poems, the pulsing stone, the resonant columns. The final image of the narrator accepting the empty notebook provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's questions about art after silence. A minor deduction is for the line "I understood then that certainty itself might tremble," which veers close to a direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise impeccable subtextual work.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.9)
    Theme is impeccably woven into the story's fabric, emerging from character, action, and image without a whisper of didacticism. The central concept, "beauty hides where symmetry fails," is not just stated but proven in the climactic scene. The final image of the flawed glass scattering "wild spectra" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, achieving a profound emotional aftereffect that avoids sentimentality entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of connection forged through shared imperfection emerges organically from the plot and imagery, culminating in the beautiful, non-literal answer of "braided light." The story navigates the risk of being overly didactic with grace, and the final image provides a resonant after-effect that avoids a simple moral. While a couple of Lio's lines border on direct thematic statement, they function as propositions tested by the experiment rather than as authorial pronouncements.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is woven into the story's DNA, emerging from the potent imagery of withering/blooming, celestial cartography, and mending. The final image of the gardens blooming below is a resonant, non-literal answer to the custodian's initial charge, avoiding any didactic moralizing. The line, "'Things don't have to run forward to move us forward,'" verges on a thematic statement but is saved by its context, delivered as a murmured, personal discovery that feels earned rather than authorial.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic resonance is powerful and emerges organically from the story's core conceits. The tension between cold data and warm community, or abstract ledgers and tactile craft, is explored without a single didactic misstep. The final lines, which frame the work as being "for belonging," provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, perfectly crystallizing the theme without resorting to a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme—that true wisdom requires embracing both beauty and ruin, and that this is achieved by breaking cyclical patterns—emerges organically. It is not stated but demonstrated through Kesari's actions and her final transformed state. The final line acts as a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial quest. The realization about the ancients' intent verges on direct statement but is framed as a personal epiphany, narrowly avoiding a thematic echo and preserving the story's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of memory's persistence against erasure is masterfully integrated, emerging organically from the plot rather than being stated. The central metaphor of developing film and restoring a faded image is powerful and consistent. The final image of the grandmother tracing "keep noticing dusk" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a profound emotional aftereffect without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is handled with masterful subtlety, emerging organically from the central metaphor of shedding layers. The story explores integrity, reputation, and the nature of truth without a single didactic sentence. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, and the reprise of "fragile convictions" in the last line is a brilliant thematic bookend that demonstrates profound character growth. The subtext in the ritual is rich and rewards rereading.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration is the story's greatest strength. It interrogates the concept of "closure" with nuance and depth, contrasting the surgeons' sterile definition with Odelia's search for truth. The theme emerges organically from her actions and the story's rich imagery. The final line, "closure had finally arrived not as silence, but as the retelling of a life," is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the entire narrative without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of love as a current that requires circulation is explored with originality and grace, culminating in a powerful, resonant final image of the city humming the new melody. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with moments of direct thematic summary, such as "Unused love, therefore, was not stored but paused" and "it preferred circulation." These statements function as authorial explanation, momentarily breaking the otherwise immersive spell cast by the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of sacrifice for creative renewal emerges organically from the narrative without a single line of exposition. The story resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex meditation on the nature of inspiration. The final image of the emptied but resonant hero watching new legends being born is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question, achieving a resonance that lingers long after the story ends.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of vigilance as a form of nurturing emerges organically from the story’s particulars, particularly the contrast between dreams and wakefulness. The recurring motif of the "fractured lullaby" mending in real time provides a perfect, non-literal thematic spine. The final line delivers a resonant Conceptual Repricing of "vigilance" itself, avoiding any hint of moralizing while leaving the reader with a profound sense of purpose found in limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of self-discovery as a process of active mapping emerges organically from the story’s central metaphor. The final image powerfully answers the story’s core question without resorting to a simple moral. However, the line "To rediscover the wild frontier of your mind, the walls seemed to whisper, you must redraw it" is an overly direct thematic statement, a slight authorial intrusion in an otherwise elegantly implicit narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of courage as a quality to be retrieved rather than summoned is developed with beautiful subtlety through imagery and action. The final image of constellations in the ticket is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, Calla's final line ("courage never vanishes; it only waits...") verges on a "thematic echo," stating the moral a little too plainly and slightly diminishing the power of the preceding scene which showed the same thing more artfully.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of safety's cost is explored with nuance and depth, emerging organically from the central conflict. The story avoids any didacticism, offering its conclusion through the powerful final images: the "hush deeper than law, almost kind," and Mara's hand hovering over silent keys. The final line, "frostbitten hope no longer begged; it remained," provides a resonant, non-literal answer that elevates the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic exploration of truth, legitimacy, and the nature of power is woven seamlessly into the narrative. The story avoids simple moralizing, instead using its central magical conceit to pose complex questions. The final image of the shattered mirror—showing not one truth but many possibilities, all of which exclude the lie—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem that lingers powerfully after the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of mapping the unknowable is expertly woven through recurring imagery of atlases, labyrinths, and sonic outlines. The story contrasts human attempts at measurement with the "unsettled arithmetic" of nature. The final line, "one no atlas can keep," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Mara's quest, re-contextualizing her journey from one of discovery to one of surrender without a single didactic sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding restorative purpose in destruction is powerfully woven through contrasting imagery (opera/shrapnel, music/guns). However, the story falters in the final paragraph with an explicit thematic summary: "Meaning, she realized, isn't found by cleaning the mess but by discovering constellations within it..." This moment of telling, rather than showing, undermines thesubtlety built throughout and is a significant flaw for a story aiming for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of gentle, intentional evolution is explored with depth and nuance, culminating in an image that serves as a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The embryo, a living thing that will grow, beautifully embodies the idea of coaxing tradition forward like a seedling. The final thought is a slight thematic echo, but its delivery through the newborn's mind makes it emotionally resonant rather than didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of reconciling hope with the reality of trauma emerges organically from the story's central imagery, especially the pearl and the lighthouse lens. The final image provides a brilliant, non-literal resolution. A minor deduction is applied for the line "to anchor optimism in realism," an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the otherwise superb use of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of guilt, art, and perception is handled with nuance and depth, emerging organically from the dense web of imagery (threads, water, mirrors). The story avoids didacticism, culminating in a final image that offers a resonant, non-literal answer to its central questions. The line "fractured worlds can be art if one accepts the cracks as contours" lands as an earned insight rather than a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story brilliantly explores themes of time, consciousness, and exploitation, with the concept of harvesting terror-stretched seconds being profoundly resonant. The theme emerges organically from the plot, avoiding moralizing. However, the explicitly stated motivation—"to discover why time slows in crisis and whether pain manipulates clocks"—functions as a thematic echo that is slightly too direct, even though it serves a plot purpose as a password.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is expertly woven through the central metaphor of ice, cold, and thawing. The concept of truths that might “thaw history” is never heavy-handed, emerging instead through Ila’s actions and the story’s imagery. The final line—“subtle as thaw, unstoppable as story”—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict without a shred of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic depth is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the core concept of "engraved quiet." The central question—how to build in a broken world—is explored through the potent contrast between roots and chains, fragrance and muzzle flash. The line "they remind us why towers mattered" is a masterful piece of subtext, and the final act of planting outside the dome provides a resonant, non-literal answer that lingers beautifully without ever stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through action and imagery, exploring capture, empathy, and the limits of possession without a single line of overt moralizing. The shift from a desire to "imprison" to the understanding that "cages... still bruise wings" is an organic development. The story's final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict that lingers beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of journalistic responsibility and the weight of inherited guilt is explored with remarkable subtlety and power. It emerges organically from the central metaphor of the orrery and its "orbits of regret." The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image of the stars as "editors satisfied with a rewritten universe," which provides a non-literal, conceptually rich answer to the central question of how one rectifies the past.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.7)
    Themes of technological hauntings, the archiving of error, and the possibility of atonement are woven together with subtlety and power. The story avoids any moralizing, instead offering the final image of the glowing amber and the laughing baby as a complex, resonant answer to its central problem. The act of writing new instructions deepens the theme from personal salvation to shared responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme—that meaning is actively created through small acts of reorganization rather than passively discovered in grand riddles—emerges beautifully from the story's central imagery. The final image of the grotto as an "empty kitchen... awaiting new mess" is a masterful, resonant thematic grace note. However, the score is capped by the on-the-nose thematic statement, "Meaning, Felicity murmured, is not hidden in grand riddles..." This moment of telling slightly undermines the powerful showing that surrounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of healing through redefinition is potent and supported by strong imagery, particularly the final mosaic of "open doors." However, the story falls into direct thematic summary, especially in the final two paragraphs. The line "aberrant mercy can anneal ruins into rebellions of kindness" is a critical instance of a "thematic echo" that replaces earned resonance with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story explores its themes of time, memory, and possibility with nuance and depth, avoiding any explicit moralizing. The core concept of a "fractured" timeline is resolved with the beautiful, complex image of time becoming "facet-cut." This final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story brilliantly explores the tension between scientific rigor and wonder, but it falters with one line of overt thematic summary. Theo's thought that "discovery often begins where disbelief and love share a chair" is a direct statement of the theme, a "thematic echo" that momentarily replaces subtext with a thesis. While the final image recovers to provide a resonant, non-literal conclusion, this on-the-nose moment is a notable flaw in an otherwise subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story masterfully explores its themes of consciousness, memory, and language through concrete imagery and action, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image of humanity waking to discover their own "dream footprints" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core inquiry. The thematic turn that recasts the "unknown" from an alien presence to humanity's own future is a moment of genuine insight.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of shared versus solitary knowledge emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a resonant final image. The story dramatizes its central idea rather than just stating it. The score is slightly tempered by a moment of direct thematic summary—"The phrase reminded her that no prophecy belonged to a single soul"—which is a minor authorial intrusion in an otherwise elegantly executed piece.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of repair versus erasure is masterfully integrated into the story's central action. Mara's line, "Fixing what's broken... is not the same as pretending it never shattered," lands with immense power. However, her final murmur, "Unused courage waits where we decide to carry it," borders on a thematic echo, slightly overstating a truth the story had already perfectly dramatized, which prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme is powerfully woven through recurring images like the palimpsest and the needle, culminating in the resonant final image of the braided hairs. However, the score is capped by the explicit thematic statement in the coachman's final thoughts, which explains the story's moral calculus instead of letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story builds a powerful thematic landscape around resilience, time, and kindness. However, it undermines its own subtext with the line, "kindness is the only light that survives scorching." This direct thematic statement is a significant flaw, a moment of telling in a piece that otherwise shows with great skill. While the final lines recover some nuance, this explicit declaration prevents the theme from achieving the highest level of resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of active caretaking versus passive hope emerges organically from the story’s central images: the reflected light of the rose, the gathered light of the prism, and finally the generative light of Nara herself. The final image of the gardeners at the heart of the floodgate offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's initial problem without a single word of moralizing. The shift from reflecting borrowed light to nurturing the source is thematically profound.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of independence evolving into responsible connection is developed with nuance and power. However, the final two paragraphs shift from resonant dramatization to explicit summary. The line "Thus began the era when libraries floated no longer above but among people" functions as a thematic statement, slightly undermining the superb imagistic work that preceded it by stating the moral directly.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of connection versus containment is woven beautifully through the story’s central images and actions. The final resonant image of a "newly braided" city is superb. The only minor weakness is the direct statement of the theme in the climax ("She understood then that..."), which feels slightly explicit for a piece that otherwise relies so effectively on subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of unity achieved through cleverness over force emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the auroras is a powerful, non-literal thematic payoff. However, the story's last sentence ("sometimes the smallest sound can reorder galaxies") is an explicit thematic summary that undermines the preceding resonance, stating the moral directly instead of letting the events speak for themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story's themes of order versus chaos, and negotiation over force, emerge organically from the plot. The concept of "invoking geometry as diplomacy" is a superb, non-literal exploration of the theme. The final image of the key, representing both "war" and "relief," provides a resonant and complex answer to the story's central questions without resorting to moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of "unifying opposites" is masterfully integrated, emerging from the explicit instruction, the central image of the back-to-back silhouettes sharing a heart, and the final resolution where two opposed suspects are revealed as partners. The story avoids moralizing, instead landing on a resonant final image of Samara appreciating "the shape of what people share." This offers a non-literal, emotionally complex answer to the central question of empathy and connection, reweighting the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is woven into the story's fabric without a single didactic sentence. The piece explores legacy, sacrifice, and the nature of knowledge versus elemental power, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in its final lines. The idea that a question can be a key, and that rescue requires exchange, is a profound concept executed with grace. The final image of Havel and the nail recharges the entire narrative with lingering thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges with grace and power from the story’s central images and actions, exploring art’s capacity to manifest hope from loss. The final image of Avery preparing to "play bridges into being" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The piece avoids moralizing, though the final two paragraphs come close to summarizing the theme, slightly reducing the subtextual power of the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of hidden human values versus abstract systems emerges organically from the story's unique synthesis of images. The concept of "territorial markers" evolves from a robber's tool to a tech-bro's ritual to the story's central metaphor for respect and memory. The final image of "walking listening" provides a resonant, non-didactic answer to the story's core question.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of shared burdens emerges organically from the plot, character, and central metaphor. The story resists a simple moral, instead using the final beat to deepen the theme by shifting the burden’s potential from an anchor to a propellant. While a few lines trend slightly toward summary ("comprehension had become communal"), the final image of feather-soft burdens is a resonant and earned thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story's theme—that true clarity requires confronting buried truths—emerges organically from the narrative. The central conceits of the "frozen confession" and the seed that "devour[s] lies" are tightly integrated and never feel like abstract labels. The final image of the sister, alive, offers a resonant and non-literal answer to Inyara's guilt, reweighting the entire journey without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic concerns of healing, communication, and symbiosis emerge organically from the plot. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image—the maze becoming a spiral—as a non-literal answer to its central question about paths that trap versus paths that guide. The link between Lysander's personal scars and the landscape's healing gives the theme profound depth.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic exploration of sacrifice, destiny, and the nature of grief is sophisticated and emerges entirely through the story's particulars. The central premise—"every trade leaves a bruise"—is powerfully dramatized rather than just stated. The ending avoids a simplistic moral, offering instead a complex and resonant image of a life simultaneously emptied and anchored, a profound answer to the story's central question about what it means to heal a shredded soul.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding meaning after failure ("after the applause") emerges organically from the plot and imagery, culminating in the beautiful concept of purpose as "reverberation." The final image is resonant and avoids a tidy moral. However, the line "proof that failure is not finale" is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the otherwise masterful subtlety, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration of transition, memory, and the nature of understanding is exceptionally nuanced. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing theme to emerge organically from image and action, such as the arbor as a "hinge between states" and the final ideogram "journey-complete." The final realization that "understanding never captures a spirit; it only offers it safer passage" is a profound, earned insight that recontextualizes the entire story without resorting to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is the story's powerful core, emerging organically from every element rather than being imposed. The central idea—that wonder is preserved by accepting, not resolving, contradictions—is dramatized with stunning precision in the "smelting song." The final image of Silence wondering what she will become is the perfect, non-literal embodiment of this theme, offering a resonant and complex answer to the story's central question without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of vulnerability versus self-protection is powerfully integrated through the central metaphor of bunkers. The final image of Roan carrying the shells to others provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The score is held back slightly by the final confession, which states the theme too directly, bordering on a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of forgiveness as redirection is powerfully integrated into the central metaphor of water and iron. However, the story repeatedly states its theme directly rather than letting it emerge solely from action. The final notebook entry ("Forgiveness is not the erasure of error...") is a classic Thematic Echo, a summary that undermines the resonant power of the final image by explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of unspoken words as both a burden and a treasure emerges organically from the story’s mechanics. The final image of the dreamer trusting propagation delays provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the epiphany is slightly over-articulated ("Understanding flooded her: to carry unspoken words was to anchor them; to share was to free"), which comes perilously close to a thematic statement, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully develops its themes of memory, power, and art through potent, recurring imagery rather than exposition. The final image of the city's gardens singing the lost concerto provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. It successfully avoids a simple moral, leaving the reader with the complex and lingering feeling of "tentative plum hope."

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of preserving memory against the void emerges organically from every element. The story poses its central question—"Could beauty outlive breath long enough to matter?"—and answers it not with a statement but with a resonant final image: the emerald's light bleeding through the coffin. This powerful, non-literal answer reframes the admiral's death as a form of victory, fulfilling the 9+ test. The piece avoids sentimentality, offering a complex and poignant meditation on art, memory, and death.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of contentment as an act of joining rather than finding is elegantly developed through potent imagery, particularly the vision of faces in the water. The hairpin serves as a perfect objective correlative for memory and attachment. However, the final two paragraphs verge on thematic summary, explicitly stating the moral ("Contentment, he realized...", "Contentment, at last, traveled with him..."). This slight over-articulation in the final moments prevents the theme from landing with the full force of pure subtext and image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic development is masterful, emerging organically from the story’s central images: the mirror, the cloak, the chimes. The core theme—welcoming nuance into certainty—is explored through action and metaphor rather than exposition. The final image of the shard filling with "moving sky" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening problem, achieving a profound and earned sense of completion without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is impeccably woven into the story's fabric, emerging from action and image rather than exposition. Concepts of patience, presence through absence, and the nature of wisdom are dramatized through the central lesson. The final image of "lesson becoming seed" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about how truth is learned, avoiding any hint of moralizing. The subtext in Mira's gentle smile and Rowan's unseen one is powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of knowledge as a shared legacy versus a tool for personal power emerges beautifully from the story’s actions. However, the piece undermines its own potent subtext in two key moments. The lines "He understood now..." and "But his vow was to share the art..." are too explicit, stating the epiphany and moral calculus directly instead of allowing them to resonate solely through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme is developed with masterful subtlety, emerging organically from images and actions rather than statements. The contrast between the quills' glittering sonnets and the handwritten blessings ("cracked cups, uneven lullabies") is incredibly powerful. The story's final image offers a profound, non-literal answer to its central question about the nature of creativity and value, achieving a resonance that lingers beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme—that authentic expression and hope create beauty—emerges organically from the story’s central conceit. The final image of colored oar-splashes offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's initial question. A minor deduction is warranted for the epiphany line, "Resonance, he suddenly realized...", which comes close to stating the theme directly, slightly reducing its subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is woven into the story’s fabric through image and concept, avoiding any didacticism. The central question of finding purpose in an entropic universe is explored through the specific mechanics of the prophecy and coin-casting. The final image of Ikram whispering to the sky provides a resonant, non-literal answer that beautifully recharges the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme—that language can structure and contain fear, transforming terror into manageable grief—emerges organically from the story’s central metaphor. The final image of the narrator accepting their commission is a powerful, non-literal answer to the question of what to do with sacrifice and fear. It avoids moralizing entirely, leaving a lasting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of gentle breaking versus forceful mending emerges beautifully from the story's particulars, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the entire narrative. The story avoids easy morals, offering a complex view of devotion. However, the final two paragraphs verge on thematic summary, with lines like "That gentle breaking, he sensed, was the safest form of devotion..." slightly over-articulating the earned insight, a minor but noticeable flaw at this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of memory versus erasure is developed with nuance and power, emerging organically from the narrative's particulars. The story avoids any moralizing, instead offering the final image of the community co-creating meaning as a resonant answer to its central question. The recurring motifs of water, mirrors, and light are woven together beautifully, culminating in an ending that is emotionally honest and complex.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic depth is achieved with subtlety and precision. The central theme of balancing logic and intuition is woven into every image, from "equations" in starling flight to the final self-assessment as a "union of fervor and caution." The story offers a resonant, non-literal answer to its core question, culminating in the final line about walking the "bridge between equation and poem" without ever resorting to moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is expertly woven through action and image, never stated. The central idea of trust forged through embodied experience versus protocol is powerfully dramatized in the contrast between Mara's methods and Command's doubt. The final image of clipping the buckle offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, re-consecrating her commitment without a shred of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme—that personhood is a shared, integrated narrative, not a contested property—emerges powerfully from the story's core conceit and resolution. The final images are resonant and avoid a simple moral. However, the line "Personhood, it seemed, thrived only when shared" is a moment of thematic summary that slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext, stating what the surrounding action already demonstrates so beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic development is sophisticated and seamless. The core idea that true innovation "blossomed from discomfort" emerges organically from the central symbol of the corpse flower. The story avoids moralizing, instead allowing the theme to resonate through Maren's actions and epiphanies. The final image of turning tomorrows provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's inquiry into the nature of creativity, leaving a lingering sense of profound possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic handling is masterful, exploring the transformation of grief not through erasure but through re-engagement. The central concept of "tending to the unspoken" is dramatized without a single line of exposition. The story's final image—silence wearing a "grin stitched from freshly restored laughter"—is a resonant, non-literal, and unforgettable answer to the narrative's core question.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of embracing potential and the value of "the pause" is developed with exceptional subtlety and control. It emerges organically from a tight cluster of recurring images—spirals, margins, thresholds—without a single instance of overt moralizing. The final image of the guardian fostering new "margins" for patrons offers a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the nature of waiting and knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of "creative destruction" is beautifully woven into the plot's mechanics, emerging organically from the action. However, the final paragraphs slightly undermine this subtlety. The line "he was the argument that matter and spirit evolve by breaking their own cages" is a direct thematic statement that replaces resonance with explanation, a minor but distinct flaw at this level of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding beginnings in endings is powerfully dramatized through the story's climax. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme twice ("For that was her plain craft, fantasy practicality fused: to find the beginning in every ending"). This thematic echo slightly undermines the earned resonance of the final image by resorting to telling, preventing an otherwise outstanding execution from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of interconnectedness and memory is beautifully rendered through the central imagery of weaving and knots. The story mostly trusts its subtext, allowing the theme to emerge from events. However, a few lines, particularly in the final paragraphs ("impermanence is another form of arrival," "we are being woven together"), come very close to stating the theme directly, slightly reducing the resonant ambiguity built so carefully throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme—that connection is a dynamic, costly, and continually woven process—emerges organically from the story’s central conceit and actions. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Mara's quest. However, the closing paragraph veers slightly into thematic summary ("understood that connection never resolves—only continues to be woven"), which is a minor but noticeable instance of telling over showing at the story's most crucial moment. This explicit statement slightly lessens the resonance that the preceding images had already so powerfully built.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding knowledge in unexpected places, of horizons unfolding from within, is masterfully integrated. It emerges organically from the plot and setting rather than through direct statement. The final image of navigating by alien starlight from the seabed provides a powerful, resonant, and non-literal answer to the story's central question, beautifully reweighting the meaning of both "navigation" and "starlight."

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of remembrance and the importance of being heard emerges powerfully from the story's imagery and actions. However, the explicit reflection, "Incidental heroism, she reflected, was simply acting when coincidence named you the only one who heard," borders on a thematic statement. While framed as interiority, it slightly over-articulates the core idea, preventing the theme from remaining purely subtextual and thus holding it back from the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.9)
    Theme is the story's strongest element, emerging organically from image and action without a single misstep into direct statement. The core ideas of memory, silence, and the duty of witness are explored with incredible depth. The final, resonant image of "invisible footprints dry into salt" is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central questions, re-contextualizing Lira's gift and her lonely purpose in a way that will linger with the reader long after finishing.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story beautifully integrates its themes of memory, failure, and connection. While the ghost's final statement ("failure is not the opposite of growth, it is its bloodstream") borders on being an explicit moral, it is contextualized as a direct transactional payoff from a non-human intelligence. The true thematic resonance comes from the final image—the mother's laughter woven into a "lullaby" across orphaned stations—a powerful, non-literal answer that reframes regret into solace.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's unique premise, exploring memory, translation, and preservation with nuance. The final image of "newborn phonemes" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. The score is slightly tempered by the line "curse and cure share almost the same letters: both are leashes on possibility," which verges on an explicit thematic statement, momentarily thinning the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is handled with masterful subtlety. The concept of transforming grief into a "cosmic joke" emerges organically from the plot without a single instance of moralizing. The story's final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to its central emotional question, reweighting all prior events and leaving a lasting, complex impression. This is thematic work of the highest caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic depth is exceptional, emerging organically from the story's central conflict between art and mechanism, freedom and confinement. The locust shell is a brilliant, evolving motif that crystallizes the theme without a single word of exposition. The final paragraph provides a powerful, non-literal resolution that resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex and resonant idea: "beginnings are always born in tarnished wonder."

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic depth is achieved with remarkable subtlety and force. The story explores broken promises and the nature of communication not through statements, but through resonant images like the blank letter and the final act of repurposing a weapon into a message. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to Lorin’s quest, reframing reconciliation as an act of defiant connection, and the final image of the glowing letter is a perfect, lasting echo of this idea.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of finding potential in silence and healing through art is potent and well-integrated. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with direct thematic statements. Lines like "a vow to interpret silence as possibility, never as vacancy" and the concluding sentence "tonight the beginning sings back" function as authorial summary, a "thematic echo" that slightly diminishes the power of the otherwise resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of creation emerging from quiet potential is masterfully woven through the narrative, not stated. The story's final line from the prose—"We will come when you learn to shelve silence"—serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to Hollis's quest. This moment reweights the entire preceding narrative, elevating the theme from a librarian's private search to a universal principle of creativity without a single misplaced moralizing word.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, exploring the tension between conclusion and continuation, ownership and stewardship. The story avoids any overt moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image of "sentence possibilities upon the sand." This provides a complex, non-literal answer to the central question, leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of embracing creative courage over self-imposed fear emerges organically from the central metaphor of the locksmith. Subtext is handled masterfully through objects like the box and the hair. The final image of the city as a "newborn observatory of hopes" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by the final two sentences, which veer close to stating the theme directly, a minor but noticeable lapse into telling after an otherwise brilliant demonstration of showing.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is masterfully integrated, emerging organically from image and action without a single word of summary. The concept of memory as a reciprocal archive, rather than a personal possession, provides a profound and non-obvious resolution. The final image of spores as "new stars" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, achieving a powerful emotional aftereffect without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is woven into the story's fabric with remarkable subtlety, emerging from the central conceits rather than being stated. The final image of brewing a new cup of tea is a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of resilience. A minor deduction is for the line "Exile was declared reversible; mentorship was declared necessary," which verges on thematic summary, slightly flattening the earned resonance of the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of wonder's fragility is potent, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The story resorts to direct thematic statements, most notably in Orien's dialogue: "Only if we return each spring to prune away fear... The task is lifelong, but so is wonder." This line functions as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the moral rather than letting the final resonant image of the glowing tree carry the meaning alone, which significantly weakens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is woven into the story’s very fiber without a single didactic sentence. The central concepts of silence, memory, and recognition are explored through concrete action and imagery. The narrative beautifully transforms the initial threatening “hush” into a restorative silence “like sand building an island.” The final image of the fishermen’s laughter as “foam against distant rocks” provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central problem of misappropriated honor, achieving a profound emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of listening versus merely looking is woven deeply into the narrative fabric through motifs like the torn map, the silent footage, and the ear pictogram. The final realization is earned, but the line "Levin finally understood the whispered chapel was not a building but a practice" verges on a Thematic Echo, slightly over-stating the conclusion rather than letting the final image carry the full weight. This minor explication is the only element holding the story back from perfection in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of letting go is explored with remarkable subtlety and depth, avoiding all cliché. It brilliantly reframes surrender not as simple defeat but as a "productively failing" circuit, a complex physical process. The final planned action—releasing the snow globe—serves as a perfect, non-literal resonant image that answers the story’s central question without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of giving resonance to the digital age's unspoken sorrows is profound and emerges organically from the story's central conceit. The piece avoids any moralizing, instead offering a potent final image as its non-literal answer: "their hidden prayers already glowed above the morning traffic." This image reweights the entire narrative, achieving a lasting resonance that is both beautiful and melancholic.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of finding joy within pain is woven through the story with remarkable grace, culminating in the line ‘Pain is a lantern; joy is the oil’. By framing its delivery as a whispered “idle proverb,” the story avoids didacticism entirely. The final image of the two men sharing the sunrise reflected on a teapot is a perfect, resonant, non-literal answer to the central thematic question, achieving a profound emotional impact through sheer craft.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of memory, faith, and the nature of proof emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery. However, the resolution slightly falters with the clouds forming "THANK YOU." This moment verges on sentimentality, offering a too-literal confirmation that risks simplifying the profound ambiguity built up to that point, a minor misstep in an otherwise resonant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of perception—of seeing beyond the literal to the emotional—is developed with remarkable consistency and subtlety. It emerges organically from Liora's condition, the coin's nature, and her artistic method. The final image of "sky folding forever into itself" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central inquiry, avoiding any hint of a tidy moral and leaving a lasting impression of wonder and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic integration is exceptional. The core idea of translation—of maps, languages, and light—is woven into every element without a single overt statement. The final realization that "sociable isolation was not a contradiction but a compass" is a profound, earned epiphany that recontextualizes the entire story. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions, achieving a rare level of thematic grace.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of repair as an act of empathetic restoration rather than mechanical fixing emerges organically from the story's central metaphors. The final image of the "living clock" offers a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question. While the line "repair was less about fixing and more about inviting what was stilled to breathe again" verges on being an explicit statement, it is framed as an earned revelation from the clock itself, which narrowly saves it from feeling like authorial moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of collective action triumphing over solitary ambition emerges organically from the plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central crisis. However, the story occasionally slips into direct thematic statements, such as, "Indeed, everything that followed happened after strangers become family, and that fragile kinship proved our strongest shield," which slightly undermines the subtext by stating the moral too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of finding grace in imperfection ("beautifully flawed") is woven through every key element: the cracked bell, the puppet head, and finally Mara's own returned heartbeat. The final image of a gentler world provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about mercy. The theme's power is slightly undercut by the final line's personification of the apocalypse, which feels tonally lighter than the preceding gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of quiet, selfless caretaking emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The central metaphor of assembling a forgotten map is powerful and resonant. However, the theme is slightly over-articulated in the final paragraphs. The line "Caretakers should leave only a harvest of safety, never the taste of power" is a Thematic Echo that borders on stating a moral, which prevents the story from achieving the highest level of thematic subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of separation as a prerequisite for connection emerges organically from the layered metaphors of chemistry, music, and river dynamics. However, the story's final sentence, "connection, like chemistry and music, begins in division and ends in shared resonance," is a textbook case of a "Thematic Echo." This direct moralizing undermines the beautifully earned resonance of the preceding imagery, replacing subtext with summary at the crucial final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme—that true beginnings lie in potential and absence, not in addition—is developed with exceptional grace and subtlety. It emerges organically from the character's actions and the world's mechanics, culminating in a powerful final image of the radiant, empty slate. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question that lingers long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of memory, guilt, and containment is sophisticated and resonant. The story elegantly rejects a simple solution, proposing instead that remorse cannot be erased, only redistributed or witnessed. This complex idea emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a final image that serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the central question without a single word of direct summary.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of connection overcoming isolation is beautifully integrated into the core metaphor of singing architecture. The final image of the "bridge of sound" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The score is held just below the 9-band because of a few lines that state the theme a little too directly, such as "Her motivation was clear: to construct bridges from silos."

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of memory, stewardship, and collective consciousness emerges organically from the story's potent imagery and central conflict. The final image of Rhea as a "witness" is a resonant answer to her initial motivation. The score is slightly capped by the final paragraph's line about birds singing algorithms, which feels like a "Thematic Echo," a moment of authorial summary that slightly overstates the theme instead of letting the preceding images do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of safeguarding memory emerges organically from the archivist's quest. The concept of combinations hidden in sensory experiences is a brilliant thematic execution. However, the final sentence—“The seeds of vigilance...would sprout whenever forgetting threatened to devour the world again”—is a minor misstep into overt thematic summary. This slight thematic echo prevents a higher score by stating what the preceding, powerful images had already implied.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of finding voice in silence and connection through empathy emerges organically from the story's central action. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question without resorting to moralizing. The direct labeling of the "core concept of empathy in motion" is a minor blemish on an otherwise subtle and powerful thematic execution, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of finding beauty and peace through sacrifice rather than victory emerges organically from the plot. The narrative resists easy moralizing, instead using the central chess metaphor and the final image of the smoothed stone to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to Tomas's quest. The final two paragraphs verge on stating the theme, but it feels earned after the dramatized events.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of empathy emerging from shared silence is beautifully integrated into the central action. The final realization is earned through the protagonist's struggle. The mentor's written thesis—"'Empathy is heard when two silences overlap without fear'"—borders on a "Thematic Echo," stating the theme a bit too directly. While the preceding narrative earns this moment, its explicitness slightly undermines the subtextual power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding stillness within motion emerges organically from character and conflict, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the last two sentences ("serenity was a seed meant to be walked with..." and "The corpses of yesterday's fears...") overstate the theme, functioning as an explicit moral summary. This "thematic echo" in the final lines detracts from the otherwise elegant, show-don't-tell execution.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of resilience as a circulated memory is beautifully realized through the central conceit and the resonant final image of buds "laughing fragrance into the bruised night." The direct thematic statement from the spear ("Resilience is not hidden... it is circulated") is slightly too explicit, bordering on a moral summary. This moment of telling, rather than showing, is the one element that slightly tempers an otherwise masterful thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of intelligent order versus intentional chaos emerges organically from the plot. Mara diagnoses a phenomenon that "heeds geometry" and counters it with "randomized gust algorithms." The final line, "the silence she had saved," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central tension without ever stating a moral, leaving a powerful aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of wonder's essential nature emerges beautifully from the story's central conflict and imagery. The final image of the open door is a masterful, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the final line—"...having certified that wonder was, is, and must remain essential"—is a direct thematic statement that feels redundant and slightly diminishes the resonance of the preceding image, constituting a minor thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of confronting the destructive nature of one's own obsession emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids moralizing, instead using the speculative mechanism to explore the idea that true wisdom comes from reconciling with, not just analyzing, one's failures. The final image of the obsidian path provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Kalen's quest, leaving a lasting impression of earned peace.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme—that empathy and understanding transcend quantifiable formulas—emerges organically from the story's central conceit. The final image of new constellations born from printed grief is a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. The final paragraphs articulate the theme with beautiful clarity, though they verge on stating what the preceding action has already so powerfully shown; a minor point in an otherwise masterful thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of coaxing wonder from the routine is developed with extraordinary grace, emerging organically from Tren's actions rather than authorial statement. The final note from Ilya provides a revelation that serves as a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The closing image of the pendant settling on the cairn encapsulates the 'fade from memory to myth,' offering a complex, lingering resonance that far exceeds a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of memory, empathy, and responsibility emerges organically from the story's particulars. The central idea—that objects transform emotion into "richer loam" rather than just storing it—is an earned insight, not a declared moral. The story's final image of the swinging lantern provides a beautiful, non-literal answer to the central question, resonating with "the trustworthy ambivalence of objects who remember us."

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of memory, sacrifice, and love transcending impossible barriers emerges organically from the story's beautiful, strange particulars. However, the final act is marred by a moment of over-explanation: "He would know at once that it traveled through..." This line tells the reader the magic's meaning rather than trusting the resonant image of the raindrop. This brief authorial intrusion undercuts the subtext and prevents the theme from landing with the full force of its potential, constituting a Thematic Echo that touches the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The themes of memory, sacrifice, and quiet strength emerge organically from the story's central conceit. The final image of the planet bartering "its nightmares for dawn" is a masterful, resonant answer to the core conflict. The score is capped just below the 9-band due to a single line of thematic summary ("meekness had been muscle all along") that slightly over-articulates the core idea.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of dangerous knowledge and the protective power of obscurity emerges organically from the plot. The final resolution to map "lacunae" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question about the weight of truth. The line "He understood now that the withheld truth was... a burden" verges on being an overly explicit thematic statement but is successfully integrated into Kael's moment of realization, keeping it from feeling like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is handled with masterful subtlety, emerging organically from the story’s central images: the secret language of stones, the chain letter passed by currents, and the final naming of "Anchor." The narrative explores connection, quiet duty, and the power of ritual without a single line of exposition. The final paragraph, imagining a future skipper finding his message, provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about legacy and protection.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic resonance is exceptional, emerging organically from the story’s core conceit without overt moralizing. The transition from print to a new, living form of story is handled with potent imagery like "auroral ink" and "refugees seeking paper." The final image of Mora steering the unwritten day provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the central questions about narrative, responsibility, and creation.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of empathy and the responsibility of listening is developed with extraordinary subtlety and power. It emerges organically from the central metaphor of magnetism and the recurring image of the blue morpho wing. The story's final insight—"some people magnetize stories because their silence aches for listeners"—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial question, reweighting the entire narrative without a hint of moralizing. The final painting, "Heart of Drift," is a perfect thematic crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic integration of sorrow, memory, nature, and duty is subtle and powerful, emerging organically from the plot. The resolution offers a beautiful, non-literal answer to the central question. The score is capped just below the 9-band due to the final paragraph's line about "mundane miracles," which verges on a Thematic Echo, slightly over-stating a theme that the preceding events had already perfectly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of living memory versus static archive emerges organically from the plot and setting. The final image of weaving a new dawn provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. However, the protagonist's realization ("my meticulous archives had stratified life") and final understanding ("not to imprison memories, but to swaddle them") border on thematic summary, slightly over-articulating the theme rather than letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of finding harmony in imperfection is beautifully woven through the story's imagery, from the creased invitation to the misaligned stars and out-of-phase clocks. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by a few lines, particularly the attendant's explanations, that verge on stating the theme directly rather than letting it emerge solely from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding sacredness in small, defiant acts of care is beautifully woven through the narrative's imagery and actions. The story's strength is in showing this through the guerrilla gardening and the tea ceremony. However, the final paragraphs slightly undermine this by stating the theme too explicitly ("He realizes that sacredness is merely the ordinary relieved of its disguise..."). This moment of telling, rather than trusting the resonant image, prevents a higher score in an otherwise thematically powerful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.7)
    The themes of memory, order, and grief emerge organically from the story's concrete particulars, never stated but deeply felt. The central idea—that some truths cannot be cataloged until they are faced—is beautifully explored. The final image of "the measured promise of a brother walking back to his shelves" offers a resonant, complex answer to the story's central question without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is masterfully handled, emerging from the story's central conceit without a single line of exposition. The narrative explores the nature of trust by making its breaking a physical commodity and its holding a sound. The final vow, which "sounded, softly, like trust holding," provides a resonant, non-literal answer that powerfully recontextualizes the entire story.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme—the necessary synthesis of reason and feeling, logic and empathy—emerges organically from the plot. It avoids didacticism, culminating in the final, resonant image of the storm-marble in the compass ring. This powerfully encapsulates the story’s core idea of convergence without a single summarizing word.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thematic exploration of creativity, memory, and grief is nuanced and avoids easy morals. The story argues powerfully that true creation comes not from perfect recall but from "raw longing," a concept earned through the plot. The final image of a subterranean dawn provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's initial problem, beautifully integrating theme and action.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of honesty's restorative power is ingeniously literalized, emerging organically from the story's premise. The final image of truths scrubbing the sky is powerful. However, the story falters in the last two paragraphs by explicitly stating its moral: "She understood that honesty need not roar; candor in small moments could tilt a world..." This thematic echo undermines the beautifully rendered imagery, telling the reader what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of preserving truth and wonder beyond the limits of language is explored with remarkable subtlety and power. The story avoids any overt statement, instead allowing the theme to emerge from the central conflict and Arlen's actions. The final image of the "kinetic map"—a set of instructions with no words—is a breathtakingly resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. It’s a flawless execution of showing, not telling, resulting in a complex and memorable thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of containing chaos rather than fighting it is masterfully woven through action and imagery, culminating in the final resonant state. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the explicit statement "Fragmented wholeness, I recorded, is enough..." This moment of thematic summary, while concise, is less powerful than the preceding images and actions that demonstrate the same idea.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of healing through listening is powerfully dramatized. However, it's also explicitly stated—"hoping to prove that listening heals," "listening has already begun the journey"—which slightly undermines the subtext. The final image of the discarded padlock as a "thrift-bound artifact" is a resonant, non-literal grace note, but the earlier direct statements prevent this from reaching the highest tier of thematic subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of vulnerability as strength is integrated with remarkable elegance, emerging organically from character, action, and image. The recurring spider motif ("as a spider spins its web") is a masterstroke, reinforcing patience and intricate power without ever feeling heavy-handed. The final image of Lira floating, exposed yet victorious, provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story explores themes of memory, selfhood, and collective grief through a powerful central metaphor, never resorting to direct statement. The concept of a core memory acting as a gravitational anchor is deeply resonant. The final image of Kerrin lighting the lanterns, her past restored, provides a non-literal answer to the story's central problem, re-casting the opening "gleaming silence" from a state of loss to one of promise. The theme emerges organically from the plot's strange and specific particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is the story's soul, emerging organically from the central metaphor of transforming a destructive sound into a silent, folded meaning. It powerfully argues for containment over annihilation without a single didactic line. The final image of the brook as a library that has "lent out its most dangerous book" is a stunning, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire narrative with profound and lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic integration is masterful. The central concept of "agreed upon lies" and "resonant half truths" is explored with remarkable depth, weaving together the narrator's professional deception, the social fiction with the landlady, the magical "First Lie Agreed Upon," and the dark secret of a murder. The theme emerges organically from character and plot, culminating in a final image that offers a complex, non-moralizing answer to the story's central questions about truth, memory, and inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematic exploration of memory, grief, and independence is potent and well-integrated. However, the story falters in its final moments by explicitly stating its thesis. The line, “Independence, she understood, was not the absence of voices but the freedom to choose how their chorus shapes the march ahead,” is a classic thematic echo that replaces resonant image with a moral, significantly reducing the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully explores themes of memory, forgiveness, and the power of art to enact change without resorting to direct statement. The core concept—that adjusting an edict by a brushstroke can be more "divine" than overthrowing armies—is dramatized, not explained. The final image of the emperor vaguely recalling the scent of roses is a perfect, resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central questions, leaving a lingering and powerful impression.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story beautifully explores themes of memory, identity, and the responsibility of the storyteller without a single line of didacticism. The central question of how to carry the stories of others without losing oneself is answered not with a moral but with a complex, negotiated settlement. The final image of the canyon's "grateful silence" is a thematically perfect and resonant conclusion that reweights the entire story.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding truth and value in imperfection ("frailty inside beauty") emerges organically from the story’s central images: the wreck, the melted snow globe, and the glacier as a tomb. The final image of pilgrims seeing their own reflections in the globe’s "delicate storm" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The story completely avoids moralizing, trusting its powerful imagery to convey its complex thematic point.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central theme of "hidden effort" is woven seamlessly through recurring images of nets, water patterns, fireflies, and human labor, creating profound resonance. The final image of the gathered net offers a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's questions. The score is capped just below the highest tier only because the final two sentences, while earned, articulate the theme so directly that they border on a "thematic echo," slightly reducing the power of implication.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of protective lies versus difficult truths is woven through every action and image, culminating in a resonant final choice. The story largely avoids overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge from Mara’s actions. However, the final thoughts ("sometimes a lie is the flimsy shelter...") verge on a thematic echo, slightly overstating the conclusion that the preceding scene had already powerfully dramatized. This minor slip into direct statement is the only blemish on an otherwise sophisticated thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's potent imagery and central conflict without a single line of overt moralizing. The tension between technology and nature, prophecy and action, solitude and community is beautifully orchestrated. The final line, "vision is never solitary once it is sung," offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions, reweighting all of Orrin's prior actions.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thematic development is handled with immense grace. Themes of memory, grief, and the artist's purpose emerge organically from the central conceit. The final image of the music box humming its way into the world offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of sorrow without resorting to a simple moral. While the story names its concepts (e.g., "gleaned redemption"), it does so through the character's interiority, framing them as earned insights rather than authorial pronouncements, which narrowly avoids the trap of thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme—a synthesis of logic and faith, engineering and art—emerges organically from the central conflict and character pairing. The resolution brilliantly literalizes this theme, as the barricade functions as a moral mirror. Mara's final line, "belief was unnecessary when evidence rang so clear," offers a perfect, non-didactic resonant answer to the story's core question.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of patience versus haste is woven throughout, culminating in the elegant final distinction: "Promises stretch; borders stop." This final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about maps and progress. The theme is slightly hampered by moments of over-statement, such as "impatience was the hammer that cracked civilization," which feel more like authorial thesis than emergent discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story effectively connects past and present struggles for freedom through the lantern's entangled memories. The theme of vigilance emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary, explicitly stating the moral: "Freedom, prevention, and truth share a corridor, and I intend to patrol it." This thematic echo replaces the resonance of the final image with a less powerful, on-the-nose declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of repentance—its mechanics, its weight, and its insufficiency without action—emerges with stunning clarity from the story's central metaphor. The clockwork heart is never just an object; it is an argument. Maeve’s final line, "the tune is only the first beat of the sentence he must compose," offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, perfectly avoiding a tidy moral. The subtextual weight of "unsung lullabies" and "stalled confession" charges the entire narrative from the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the theme of creation requiring risk and a touch of the ridiculous is potent, its delivery is flawed by overt statement. The lines "Throughout the evolution of every machine... it must sing" and the final ticker tape verdict state the moral directly. This "thematic echo" undermines the otherwise powerful subtext carried by the imagery, replacing earned resonance with an unnecessary authorial explanation that feels like a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of memory as a living, suppressed entity emerges organically from the plot, avoiding any didacticism. The central question, "where deleted files go," is answered not with a technical explanation but with the deeply resonant metaphor "home." The final act of liberating all suppressed memories elevates the personal mission into a universal statement on truth and corporate control, offering a complex, non-literal answer that lingers powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of collective action triumphing over the idea of a lone hero is powerfully integrated, especially through the concept of "emotional cartography." However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the direct statement, "Mara realized the courageous anomaly was never a lone hero; it was the actionable bond." This Thematic Echo explains the story's core insight rather than allowing the final image to resonate on its own, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding meaning in the plurality of endings emerges with beautiful organicism from the story's central action. However, two sentences—"Perhaps the final lesson was not an isolated tone..." and "Not every voyage ends at the expected harbor..."—verge on thematic summary. While elegantly phrased as internal musings, they slightly overstate the theme, pulling back from the superb subtext that otherwise permeates the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding meaning in imperfection and loss emerges organically from the story’s powerful central metaphors. Subtext is handled deftly, particularly in the connection between the burned letter and the narrator's own "unsaid" languages. The final line—understanding a song without lyrics—is a superb, non-literal resolution that resonates powerfully, though a few of the sentinel's preceding lines flirt with making the theme slightly too explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of preserved versus scattered wisdom emerges organically from the story's central ritual and imagery. However, the final line, "Wisdom, once spoken, scatters; preserved, it walks," is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the resonance built through action and image. While earned by the preceding narrative, this direct moralizing prevents the theme from achieving the highest level of subtlety and fails the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of transmuting collective trauma into a shared masterpiece is developed with nuance and powerful imagery, particularly the mural extending the old graffiti vines. The story avoids a simplistic moral, instead offering a resonant vision of healing as a slow, collaborative act. One line, "grief was not denied but lifted, shared, and turned over like soil ready for seeds," verges on thematic summary, but it's sufficiently embedded in the scene's emotional climax to avoid feeling like an authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of language as a living organism is explored with immense subtlety and beauty through resonant imagery of roots, seeds, and growth. The story would approach perfection but for the final two sentences, which state the theme directly ("growth, like language, desired witnesses more than owners"). This small moment of telling slightly diminishes the power of the preceding showing, constituting a "thematic echo" that prevents an otherwise flawless execution from reaching its highest potential.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic depth is achieved with subtlety and power. The story explores memory, loss, and the nature of experience through its intricate network of images—dissolving statues, unwatched videotapes, driftwood markers—rather than overt statements. The final realization that "the true recording was never meant for magnetic tape but for marrow" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question, beautifully reweighting all prior events without resorting to a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story weaves its themes of stillness, listening, and purpose with subtlety for most of its length. The resolution, where Eloi lets the hand "listen to the quiet it was seeking," is a powerful, non-literal answer to the central problem. The final paragraph, however, slightly undermines this by stating the theme too directly ("a reminder that pursuit matters as much as arrival"), a minor but noticeable instance of telling over showing at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges with grace and power from the story's central conceit. By "hymning the mundane," the narrative offers a resonant, non-literal answer to what makes a goodbye meaningful, finding profundity not in grand gestures but in shared, imperfect moments. The final image of reconciliation is a potent thematic culmination that avoids sentimentality or moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of "closing loops" is brilliantly integrated, operating as a mechanical plot device, a philosophical principle, and a map for relational healing. The final image of the unopened sarcophagus in "respectful equilibrium" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about harmony and conquest. While a few lines verge on direct thematic statement (e.g., "circles cancel sins"), they are well-integrated into character perspective and do not detract from the emergent power of the whole.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven into action and image. The story explores the tension between scientific inquiry and faith, and the idea of finding beauty in imperfection, without resorting to overt moralizing. The final image of "mistakes charted now as permanent starlight" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions, and Liora’s arc beautifully embodies the theme that earned wonder can be more valuable than certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of gentle guidance versus destructive revelation is developed with remarkable subtlety and consistency. It emerges organically from the central metaphor of polishing sea glass. The story avoids any overt moralizing, culminating in a final image of villagers guided by faint glimmers—a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem that beautifully encapsulates the theme's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of grafting new, living meaning onto the ruins of old, damaging systems is executed with extraordinary grace. It emerges organically from the central conceit and is reinforced by every key image: the moss on servers, the pendant's fossil heart, the meltwater constellations. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question about healing, avoiding any hint of a tidy moral. The story's thematic integrity is absolute.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding beauty and persistence "against the current" is beautifully integrated and emerges organically from the story's core images. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. However, the fisherman's line "persistence itself is a vessel" and Declan's own final spoken hope are moments of direct thematic statement that slightly lessen the power of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory, story, and ecological reverence emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery. The final image of stories spun into living wood is a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the elder’s line, "...you need only to remember the way the world once breathed you into being," is an on-the-nose thematic statement that slightly undermines the subtext. It functions as a thematic echo, preventing the theme from being conveyed solely through dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic resonance is achieved with exceptional grace. The core concepts of memory, patience, and universal connection (through heartbeats) emerge organically from the story’s potent imagery and specific actions. The final image of the withered orchard whispering "of directions instead of regret" serves as a profound, non-literal resolution to the story’s central quest, avoiding any hint of moralizing while leaving a lasting emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of listening, memory, and finding wonder in reflection emerges organically from the story's potent central metaphor. However, the final two sentences ("After all, a good lock is never about closing...") are an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the resonant ambiguity built by the preceding action. This "thematic echo" replaces earned resonance with a direct authorial moral, bruising an otherwise subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of balancing empathy for others with self-knowledge emerges organically from the story's central magical conceit. The final image of the "luminous tapestry" is a powerful, non-literal answer to the problem of disparate sorrows. However, the final sentence ("even ice can be woven anew...") functions as a thematic summary, a slight authorial intrusion that spells out the story's moral, incurring a penalty for what is otherwise subtle and resonant work.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic handling is superb. The central concept, "here and gone," evolves from a source of pain into a principle of reverence, a transformation earned entirely through on-page action. The final image of the perpetually unfinished sculpture and the line "Absence, too, can roar" provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question about grief. It’s a profound insight that avoids sentimentality and lands with haunting power.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is impeccably woven through image and action, never stated. The story explores regret, memory, and the power of narrative to heal, but resists a simple moral. The final bargain, wherebeginnings (giggle), endings (sigh), and the turbulence between (curse) are used to create a "heart," is a profound thematic synthesis. The closing image offers a resonant, complex answer: progress is possible, but cyclical, holding only "until the next halt."

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of hope as an engineered resource emerges beautifully from the story's actions and imagery. However, the final paragraph's explicit statement of the "equation for hope" is a significant flaw; this thematic summary undermines the otherwise superb subtext and earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme emerges organically from image and action, achieving a profound resonance in the final lines. However, the epiphany is articulated a bit too explicitly with the line, "...he realized his dream failed because he had measured feelings, never intervals between them." This moment of direct statement, a minor thematic echo, slightly undermines the subtextual power built so carefully elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of calculated silence versus defiant truth is woven expertly through imagery and action, culminating in the resonant final image of the lock gate. Subtext is handled with great skill, particularly in the loaded final conversation. A minor, slightly too-explicit thematic summary—"the unpredictable force that bends stories toward justice"—prevents a higher score by momentarily stating what the rest of the story so elegantly shows.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of wisdom as a patient, relayed process emerges organically from the story’s events and imagery. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the line "Some wisdom grows only by relay..." verges on an explicit thematic statement, a slight abstraction in a piece that otherwise relies on concrete particulars to convey its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of language as a tool for preservation and healing emerges organically from the premise and is developed through resonant imagery. The story avoids easy morals, and the final image of Holt with the thread provides a non-literal answer to the central question. The final line ("I knew my own healing had already found its first coordinate") borders on over-articulating the theme, a minor flaw that slightly tempers the otherwise masterful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of beauty's symbiosis with machinery, rather than its victory over it, is developed with nuance and subtlety. The story avoids simple morals, and the final image of planting gears in soil is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The theme is expertly integrated, just shy of flawless due to a few overly abstract formulations like "hopeful algebras."

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of healing and reconciling contradictory legacies is developed with superb nuance through the central images of fire, water, scars, and grafts. However, the final paragraph veers slightly into thematic summary ("daughters can choose which inheritance to ignite"), stating the moral that the preceding scene had already so beautifully dramatized. This minor instance of telling slightly weakens the powerful resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story skillfully explores its central theme of skepticism versus memory without resorting to direct statement. The thematic question is embodied in Aurin's quest and resolved through action. The final image of freed memories mingling with restored water provides a resonant, non-literal answer that elevates the narrative beyond a simple fantasy plot, avoiding sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration is the story's greatest strength. It masterfully uses its central conceit to examine the nature of memory, healing, and progress without resorting to direct statements. The final image of nebular patterns shifting into "alphabets that no warship could decipher" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question, beautifully illustrating the theme that true healing requires possibility, not just peace.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic handling is subtle and deeply resonant. The theme of memory, grief, and the role of art in community healing emerges organically through layered imagery: the migrating butterflies, the braided poems, the woven ribbon, and the porous stone. The final line on the monument, "For everything that leaves, stay," is a stunning Conceptual Repricing that avoids moralizing by functioning as an object within the story, offering a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of incremental absolution emerges organically from the story's particulars, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the explicit thematic statement, "Incremental absolution works like sand filling a vial, he thought...," verges on a thesis summary. This moment of telling, while elegantly phrased, slightly diminishes the earned power of the preceding scene work, preventing an otherwise flawless score.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of resolving unspoken grief and giving shape to lost intentions emerges with lyrical subtlety. The story avoids moralizing, instead using the central metaphor of the unfinished tapestry to explore how memory and regret persist in a landscape. The final image of the sovereign case placed under Rowan's hand is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about unfinished business.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of innovation flourishing under constraint is powerfully explored and dramatized. While Estra's dialogue with Bryn ("to grow roses against stone") verges on being an overly direct thematic statement, the story earns this directness through the subsequent climax. The final realization ("to prevail... is never to finish a map") provides a more nuanced, resonant thematic answer that avoids a tidy moral and lingers effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the central metaphor of language surviving in dust. The piece explores the resilience of art with profound originality, culminating in a final image—a world where "silence had learned to hum in perfect tune"—that provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of the story famine. It masterfully avoids any overt moralizing, trusting its imagery to carry the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is the story's great strength, emerging organically from the central metaphor of the mask without a single didactic sentence. The concept of the “mirage of safety” is explored with nuance, becoming a tool, a trap, and a lens for understanding grief. The final image of the mask reflecting a fractured viewer is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s questions about art’s purpose, leaving a lasting and complex emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of evidence versus narrative is explored with remarkable sophistication, avoiding a simple binary. The narrative resists easy answers until the final image, where the star chart is revealed as "a narrative too, but one that tolerated verification." This synthesis provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, reweighting all prior conflict without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of achieving harmony through subtraction and listening is developed with exceptional grace and coherence. It emerges organically from the central metaphor of the rosette and the choir's actions, rather than from overt statements. The final image of the invisible chord offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding a simplistic moral and leaving a lingering sense of complex, fragile peace. The story’s conceptual core is its greatest strength.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The themes of communal healing, the transformation of trauma, and hope are woven organically into the plot and imagery. The central concept emerges powerfully from Moira’s actions, and the final image of the ladle offers a perfect, non-literal resonance. The score is held back from the highest tier by a few moments of over-explication, notably the phrase "Through synaptic plasticity delivered on tongues," which explicitly states a mechanism the story had beautifully rendered through metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of preserving wonder in a technological world emerges organically from the plot, but the final sentence ("lightning could light houses, but mystery could light hearts") is an overt thematic statement. This "Thematic Echo" slightly undermines the earned resonance of the preceding scene by summarizing the moral instead of trusting the image to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of healing through listening and correct "placement" emerges organically from the story’s particulars. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the realization "Displacement was the illness, placement the cure..." borders on an overly explicit thematic statement, slightly diminishing the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of reconciling certainty with nuance is woven through every element, from the protagonist's motivation to the dual-function object and the flawed setting. The final image of gardening questions provides a resonant, non-literal answer that resists a simple moral. While the collective question "'Can certainty hold kindness without choking it?'" borders on being too direct, Aios's poetic response and the subsequent action re-center the theme in ambiguity and process, avoiding a didactic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic depth is achieved with extraordinary grace. The story explores memory, obsession, and acceptance without a single didactic line. The central concept of perpetual motion is powerfully re-contextualized as a metaphor for being trapped by regret, and the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer. Freedom is not escape, but "a landing wide enough to stand beside regret without falling"—a profound and earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of kindness as a dormant seed awaiting the right conditions to germinate is beautifully woven through imagery and action. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is slightly tempered by the penultimate paragraph's direct statement of the theme ("strangers remember kindness more stubbornly than smog"), which feels like a minor lapse into telling within an otherwise masterfully shown narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of art and memory as tools of survival is woven beautifully through specific, recurring images like the initials on stone and in bread. The final image of mingled scents and sounds provides a powerful, non-literal resolution. However, the line "...realized the displaced persons were no longer merely surviving; they were drafting themselves back into history" is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the otherwise masterful use of subtext, incurring a minor penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully integrates its theme of fate versus free will. Sable's profession as a counter-clockwise clock maker is a perfect, non-didactic embodiment of this theme. The ending resists a simple moral, offering a complex vision of liberty that is intertwined with loneliness. The final image of the clocks stopped at the moment of her decision provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about escaping design.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully explores its theme—the nature of fear and the paradoxical logic required to confront it—through its central conceit. The theme emerges organically from the surreal events rather than being stated. The final image of the "clasp-shaped void" and the shifting dictionary provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, resisting a tidy moral and leaving a lingering sense of unease.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of turning obstacles into instruments is seamlessly integrated and developed through action. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The story slightly undermines its subtext in the second-to-last paragraph ("the truth was simpler"), which comes dangerously close to a thematic statement, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is woven into the story's fabric with extraordinary skill. The central thematic tension between rigid, rusting certainty (the gate, the sextant) and fluid, living knowledge (pattern languages, dreams, light) is developed through concrete images and actions. The final line—"questions are doors in light, and they never rust"—is a stunning Conceptual Repricing that offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core dilemma without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of truth versus "noble lies" is powerfully integrated into the plot and imagery, particularly the mural parallel. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like "a closed narrative was precisely why mold flourished on the walls of history" and the final paragraph's summary ("the best histories are written not in ink but in reopened airways") function as authorial moralizing, weakening an otherwise resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of preserving memory against inevitable loss is rendered with sublime specificity. It emerges organically from the central actions and the recurring motif of "interlaced absence," which gains new weight upon the discovery of the lockbox. The story resists any hint of moralizing, instead offering a final, resonant image of "dreams newly un-abandoned" as its complex answer to the central question of purpose. The theme is not just present; it is the story's structural and emotional architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of truth providing stillness in a sea of chaos is beautifully woven through the narrative, culminating in the physical act of stamping the book. However, the final two sentences veer into thematic summary, explicitly labeling the "alternative hypothesis of courage" and the "honest dawn." This slightly overwrought moralizing replaces a more resonant, image-driven conclusion, reducing the subtext's power at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is woven into the story's fabric with subtlety and power. The central concept—that grief should not be vanquished but given wings—emerges organically from the narrative's imagery, particularly the origami cranes. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, achieving a complex emotional aftereffect without a single word of moralizing. The final image of shadows rejoining bodies is a stunning thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully explores themes of grief, memory, and the cycle of destruction and invention without resorting to overt statements. The central theme emerges organically from Ashraf's choice, contrasting the weight of personal history with collective survival. The final image of the "lantern of remorse" and Ashraf's uncertain new purpose provides a complex, resonant answer that avoids any simplistic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of belonging as a resonant frequency rather than a location is explored with nuance and powerful imagery. The final realization resists a simple moral, offering a complex emotional answer. However, key phrases like "To decode the frequency of belonging" and "Belonging was not a place but a constant song" verge on being thematic statements, slightly reducing the power of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is handled with remarkable subtlety and power. The story explores the weight of memory, truth, and guilt without a single line of overt moralizing. The core thematic insight—"he had never invented new lies, only rehearsed the original one"—emerges organically from the plot, and the final image of the repaired carving offers a resonant, non-literal resolution that lingers with complex emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of reconciliation as a process requiring patience, compassion, and memory is developed with remarkable subtlety and power. It emerges organically from character actions, the setting, and the recurring motif of the drawer pull. The final image of Mara creating the pendant provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, perfectly embodying the idea that reconciliation "needs steady weight" without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of finding redemption in humble, terrestrial guidance rather than "celestial lies" is powerfully and originally developed. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic summary. Lines like "...and the metaphor glowed" and "Gideon knew the route at last..." explicitly state the theme, a minor flaw that lessens the resonance of an otherwise beautifully rendered conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is expertly woven through the central motif of the baseball's signature, which is masterfully recontextualized from "medical sarcasm" into a profound metaphor for empathy. The story resists a simple moral, ending on a note of fragile hope ("dawn was breaking and so, perhaps, was I"). The final image of the future newspaper offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question of whether change is possible.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme is handled with subtlety and grace. The story explores grief, connection, and transformation without resorting to direct statement until the very end. The final image of releasing spice-scented constellations to other mourners offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of grief, transforming a personal quest into a universal act of empathy. The final paragraph verges on stating its theme, but it has been sufficiently earned by the preceding action to work as a concluding grace note.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The themes of memory, grief, and time are woven together with immense skill, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids simple morals. The concept of mutual release ("your surrender releases us both") adds profound complexity. The only slight weakness is the voice’s line, "'Lost time settles where forgiveness is heavier than guilt,'" which verges on stating the theme directly, slightly lessening the subtextual power of an otherwise masterful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging with poetic force from image and action rather than statement. The concepts of healing collective trauma, the necessity of self-forgiveness, and shared liberation are woven seamlessly into the narrative. The final image of a "garden where violence never learned to germinate" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about escaping cycles of harm.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transformation is explored with nuance through powerful, recurring imagery (spirals, stars, shifting land). However, the story falters with Ione's line, "Transformation is not a moment, it is a conversation between states." This is a direct thematic statement that momentarily replaces dramatic discovery with an aphorism, a significant flaw that reduces the score despite the otherwise strong subtextual work and resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of quiet, ingenious rebellion against a monolithic system emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the swinging doors is a powerful, non-literal resolution. However, Aldren’s line, "A silent revolution... tastes best served by the grid that claims to feed us," verges on being a direct thematic statement, a minor authorial intrusion that slightly diminishes the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story explores its themes—the nature of patterns, the line between curse and guidance, the value of the mundane—through resonant imagery rather than didactic statement.

The final image of eels dancing around the grooves provides a beautiful, non-literal answer to the story’s central inquiry, achieving a profound thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is woven into every image, emerging organically from the synthesis of storm, anatomy, and astronomy without a single didactic statement. The final line, "We breathe so scars can speak," is not a moral but a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about censorship and truth. The piece achieves a complex thematic resolution that reweights the entire preceding narrative, particularly the concept of who an author writes for.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story explores its themes of inquiry, collaboration, and the nature of discovery with depth and elegance. The final image of the two characters stepping through the portal together is a powerful, resonant answer to the story's central questions. The score is slightly tempered by the final lines of dialogue, which state the theme so explicitly ("no destination forgives a single author") that they verge on moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of art as resistance is potent and woven into every image. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like "rebuild morale and girders follow" and the definition of the "blooming resistance" function as authorial explanations, stating the theme directly rather than letting it emerge solely from the evocative action. This slightly diminishes the resonance of an otherwise powerful concept.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of art’s power to reframe memory and challenge determinism emerges organically from the story’s potent central images, primarily the broken clock and the music-sensitive compasses.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is handled with masterful subtlety, emerging organically from the story's central imagery and the protagonist's evolving role.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and metaphor rather than statement. The central concept of apology as a tangible, elemental force is explored with originality and depth. The story's final image—the world having "pruned one burden and kept the living shape"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the narrative question. It avoids a tidy moral, instead achieving a complex emotional aftereffect that lingers with poetic ambiguity.
