  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges from the dust-to-cosmos synthesis: "decay as iterative refinement" enacted through Elira's shift from neutron stars to butterfly scales. The piece resists moralizing—reviewers dismiss her, she smiles, no thesis is declared. The final exchange ("I found them here, in the dust") reweights prior material without stating a lesson. Subtext operates in her choice to stop wearing gloves, inviting children, and renaming damage as evolution. The kindled-humility weeping is earned by prior observation, not asserted. Minor slip: "Poetry, after all, was just physics with fewer equations and more awe" edges toward stated theme but remains character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges from image (frost, ledger, glass) rather than thesis, but the final paragraph moralizes directly: "Purpose, she realized, wasn't a destination—it was the act of retracing." The protagonist's arc is inextricable from the thematic question, yet the answer is stated rather than embodied in a non-literal final image. Frost patterns and ledger tracings constrain her medium and accumulate resonance, but the closing epiphany flattens the prior accumulation into neat summary. The piece invites reflection yet hedges with explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—presence beneath silence—emerges through concrete thermals and vibrations rather than assertion. The unshaken-marvels concept is explored through ice's harmonic response and the protagonist's sensory adaptation. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("not the absence of noise, but the presence of everything...") where image alone would have been stronger. The emotional honesty of her marvel avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through particulars: rest as architecture rather than erasure, belonging versus rescue, the transformation of distress into acknowledgment. The lens becomes a charged motif that shifts meaning—from broken to broadcasting to belonging. The final image (walking deeper toward unsent letters and half-finished symphonies) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to house unrest without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture: kneeling in reverence, souls dissolving rather than erased, his stillness settling within rather than around him.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—anonymous solidarity as resilience—emerges organically from the basket runs and the bell's mute presence. The final image ("passed into other hands") attempts Conceptual Repricing by reweighting the individual savior into collective endurance, but the moral is stated rather than implied ("That's how we outlast them"). Subtext operates in the bell's silence and the unsigned baskets; thematic complexity is present in the tension between secrecy and invitation, though the closing declaration flattens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.9)
    The central question—"where is unused love stored?"—emerges from concrete imagery (coins beneath floorboards, songs to empty rooms) and resolves through the final image: "not stored; it was sung." The answer reweights prior search particulars without overt moralizing. However, the artist's epiphany is received rather than earned through struggle or sacrifice, softening thematic resonance. The mist permeating her body and the viaduct blooming brighter offer lyric closure, but the ease of access undercuts the weight of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—time's texture, memory as thread, the cost of obsession—emerges organically from garden imagery and the halo fragment's function without meta-statement. The silver flowers chiming "like forgotten bells" and the photograph ash that "spiraled, rewriting gravity" offer fresh, specific correlatives. The final image attempts a non-literal answer: time's grain is "more beautiful, more terrible" than any hedge, yet the catalogue of textures (grief coarse, joy porous) borders on thesis articulation. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection, though the closing "quaking reverie complete" phrase edges toward thematic self-narration.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of resilience-as-planting emerges from concrete images (spores in cracks, seeds in sleeves, arrow as marker) without overt thesis statements. The final simile ("like soil after rain: quiet, inevitable, and utterly transformative") charges the closure image and reweights prior captivity into agency. However, the piece edges toward symbolic convenience—key, arrow, spores all recur as thematic tokens rather than constraining choices. The melody-left-waiting motif is evocative but arrives late, reducing its weight. Strong lyric resonance, but the question of cost versus hope remains more stated than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—grief as raw material for guidance, absence as signal—emerges from the forge's mechanics (burning hollows, imprinting voids) and the memory-catcher's function (lets others hear the warning). The final image offers a non-literal answer: she's harvested silence into a compass, not healed but equipped to guide. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the ending. Subtext operates in gesture (tears, smile, climbing out) and the recurring absences (sister's voice, vanished laughter) accumulate pressure without overt statement. The aurora and shipwrecks resonate as witnesses rather than symbols. One small slip: "alchemy of grief turned into guidance" borders on articulating the thesis, though it's embedded in her weary satisfaction rather than announced as moral.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (fate as translation, not theft; revelation as release) emerges through the flower codes and the repeated structure of vision + reunion. The final paragraph's "translating it" and "destiny's door… waited for someone quiet enough" make the concept explicit rather than letting the particulars speak. The two reunions offer specific images (sunflowers, the name "Arthur") that avoid pure abstraction, and the jar's emptying provides a concrete correlate to emotional expenditure. However, the ending asserts thematic resolution ("soul brimming") without a non-literal image that reweights prior material with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.7)
    The thawing motif (ice, heart, systems) recurs purposefully and the bookmark-in-glass image carries quiet resonance. However, theme emerges more through authorial framing ("safe zones for inquiry," "wonder might thaw frozen assumptions") than through specific conflict and choice. The final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("gloriously, quietly, melting") states what the preceding action has already shown, edging toward redundancy. The child's future question offers a non-literal answer but arrives as projection rather than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (vulnerability as power, transformation through betrayal) is stated repeatedly in the narration ("vulnerability isn't weakness—it's the crack through which truth enters," "forged in betrayal, baptized in trembling certainty") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The whispering shell and cast motifs recur but function as symbolic conveniences—the shell "whispers" directions, the cast holds clues—without constraining a choice or earning thematic weight through pressure. The final image (walking away, tasting "salt and second chances") gestures toward resonance but relies on metaphor and assertion rather than a non-literal reconfiguration of prior material with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—charting absence, valuing silence—emerges clearly from images and action rather than statement. The flaking gold leaf and summarized silences recur with intent. However, the ending offers no resonant reweighting or non-literal answer: the oracle's smile and descent are asserted satisfaction, not earned tension. The final lines drift into explicit moralizing ("knowing her obsession had not been in vain") and theme summary ("leaving behind only the echo of summarized silence") that replace scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: thoughts arising "from being witnessed" is earned by the loop discoveries (technician's sigh, trembling hands, relief) rather than stated as thesis. The ice violin's melting—"not from warmth, but from purpose fulfilled"—offers a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the courtyard-as-archive metaphor and the final gesture of sweeping "not to clean, but to listen." The ending reweights prior material: the loops weren't about finding external origins but recognizing internal thresholds. No moralizing; the final image (the janitor's smile, "remarkably composed") invites reflection without declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme (transparency thaws mistrust) emerges from the lens-and-doodles device but is stated rather than discovered: "the willingness to be seen in ambiguity" and "transparency won" are direct commentary. The cryptic doodles ("emotional contours") are described as invitations but not dramatized as trade-offs or risks. The final image (lens cracking, tickets fading) gestures toward resonance but the "message absorbed, their purpose fulfilled" is overt summary. No quiet irony or counter-reading complicates the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—reciprocity versus measurement—emerges organically from marbles, ritual, and the garden's response without stated morals. The final image (fireflies spiraling, marbles glowing, "a vine curling gently around her ankle like a question mark made flesh") offers a resonant, non-literal answer grounded in particulars. Subtext operates in gesture (polishing cracks, golden resin), silence (ignoring petitions), and the garden's shiver. The "mended deception" concept (frost/wisteria) integrates thematically. Minor slip: "commemorating small victories elaborately" occasionally edges toward prompt-echo phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    The core question—whether time can move laterally—emerges through the magnetic nexus, avian resonance logs, and holographic principles, avoiding direct statement. "Subdued Awakenings: Chronal Lateralization in Magnetic Twilight" and "Time doesn't move forward here. It breathes sideways" offer resonant phrasing that reweights the premise without moralizing. The roosting xenomorphs "unaware they were roosting not in space, but in the fold between moments" charges the final image with conceptual irony. However, the thematic answer remains somewhat cerebral and the synth-tea ending, while apt, does not embody a non-literal answer to the central question as viscerally as it might.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (silence, absence, memory as composition) emerges organically from the flooded pit, water-damaged images, and unstruck chords. The concept of "in between spaces" recurs with purpose and the final image ("the in between spaces finally sang") reweights prior material. However, the last two paragraphs veer toward overt thematic statement: "The ghost had his peace. She had her purpose. And the flood, at last, had composed its masterpiece." This tell-not-show moralizing flattens what the imagery had already conveyed, triggering a −0.5 penalty in Q5. Subtext operates well in gesture and silence until the ending announces meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme—enduring brokenness without breaking—emerges from image and action: the smudge that "merely made it honest," the oracle's definition of fault-tolerance, the aurora as "grief that dances." The final image ("Let the smudge become the center") reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the oracle's poetry, Elira's silence, and the charged objects (quartz shard, vellum). The piece avoids label-speak at closure and invites reflection through specificity. No late thematic echo; the ending resonates through prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—guilt as recursive machinery, truth that must be carried rather than exorcised—emerges organically from the valve wheel, the ghost-shift testimonies, and the radio loop. The piece resists overt moralizing until "The wheel turns backward because guilt rewinds time," which edges toward articulation but remains tied to image. The final lines ("didn't believe in ghosts. But she believed in echoes...truths that, once swallowed, must be regurgitated, examined, carried forward") offer a resonant, non-literal answer without reducing complexity. Subtext operates in gesture (twisting the wheel, pocketing the radio) and the shift from spectral to psychological labor. The closure reweights prior material—ghost shift becomes her shift—with quiet, earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—impermanence, observation, regenerative silence—emerges organically from imagery and the keeper's actions. The final line ("to witness without judgment was the rarest form of love") risks overt statement but is partially earned by the prior vision sequence. The refuge's interior vision of civilizations dissolving carries genuine resonance. However, the piece leans toward thesis illustration rather than a question dramatized through conflicting pressures, and the closing smile feels too tidy for the existential weight carried.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through image and motif (curl, lullaby, eclipse, "ordinary magic"), avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraphs where "joy, when nurtured softly, adapts" edges toward prompt-like articulation. The piece resists binary resolution and invites reflection on wonder and presence, but the final image (humming as she walks away) does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer—it restates the mission rather than transforming it. Subtext operates in gesture and silence during the gathering, but the protagonist's arc lacks friction to charge the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—memory as repair, stories as structural thread—emerges through concrete images (dragons mending rifts, tapestry as blueprint, ash as testimony) rather than statement. The displaced axis operates as both metaphor and condition, integrated into world logic. The final image offers resonance: "not to restore the axis—but to realign the stories around it." However, "the walls smiled back" edges toward overt sentiment, and the phrase "When the axis slips, follow the thread that dragons guard" borders on allegorical shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of "open secrets" and orchestration through ambiguity is coherent and unfolds through specific fortunes and their outcomes. However, the final image—"even the darkest sea finds its way home when the light knows how to dance"—lapses into a stated moral rather than a resonant particular. The analyst's tears and hiring gesture toward complexity but the piece doesn't resist tidy resolution; every fortune succeeds, and the arrival of a new typist extends the system without cost or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the priest's rhetorical method: unexamined assumptions shelter dangerous certainties, and questions themselves can be weapons or doorways. The realization that "the possession wasn't invading—it was answering" reweights all prior interrogation without stating a moral. The indigo palette and silence-as-architecture motifs recur with shifting valence, and the final image (possession dispersed into the question itself) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids didacticism; the conceptual cost—that certainty-hunger can be one's own trap—lands through implication.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (memory as recursive, non-linear composition) emerges organically from the nautilus spiral and mirrored architecture rather than authorial statement. The final image—"she had remembered how to try"—is quiet and non-literal, offering thematic resonance without moralizing. However, the theme never wrestles with counter-pressure or ambiguity; the protagonist's vision is affirmed rather than tested, reducing complexity. The shell and mirrored horizon recur purposefully but do not shift meaning under resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme emerges through recurring images (gravity defiance, fracture, recursion) and the conceptual scaffold of integrating rejected selves. The confessions ("I was afraid," "I let others define my gravity") veer toward thematic summary rather than dramatized insight, and "I am the branching" in the final beat states the moral overtly. The tablet-as-admission and frozen raindrops offer some non-literal resonance, but the ending blooms into light and merger without ambiguity or cost, resolving complexity into a tidy integration that answers the premise too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme (facing pain inside-out rather than erasing it, silence as presence not absence) emerges organically from the backward-song experiment and the transformed "filament of hush" that thickens rather than snaps. The broken needle as catalyst and the inverted harmony as method avoid stated morals. The final image—"The world, reversed, ready to be felt"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without thesis statement. Minor slip: "She no longer feared the void. She carried it with her—not as absence, but as potential" slightly over-articulates the shift, edging toward thematic echo, though it's embedded in Elara's embodied realization rather than detached commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—truth under erasure, integrity versus institutional compromise—emerges through Elias's storm-recording vocation, the Bureau's lies, and his choice to restore balance via lateral investigation. The carrier tube and field journal recur with reweighted meaning (data as honesty, pigeon as covenant). The final image ("stepped forward into the quiet dark") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor deduction: "He'd always nurtured integrity in solitude—believing truth was best preserved away from committees and compromises" edges toward direct statement rather than fully emerging from scene pressure. The closing line "Not with rage, but with records" flirts with thematic echo but remains grounded in character action.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme (impossible choices as invitation, not binary) emerges clearly but through narrator thesis rather than contradictory particulars. The poet's final speech ("true wisdom lies not in picking a side, but in holding the tension") is explicit moralizing that replaces scene pressure, triggering the thematic-echo penalty. The rope's symbolic arc—from escape tool to bridge—is purposeful but arrives without irony or counter-reading. The piece states rather than earns the insight that "morality isn't fixed, but fluid."

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—beauty in the unfinished, silence as sacred canvas—emerges through image and action without overt moralizing. The grandmother's creed ("lives in the breath before the word") is articulated but enacted through Lira's music, avoiding pure tell. The petal that floats (does not sink) offers a resonant non-literal answer, though the emotional honesty tilts sentimental ("not from grief, but awe"). Strong thematic coherence across particulars, but the closure image restates rather than reweights the premise with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the petal's half-truths, the static-mapping method, and the final vow to hold broken feelings without polish—no thesis statement intrudes. The closing image ("Bring me your broken feelings. I'll hold them until they remember how to breathe") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of real versus counterfeit emotion, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The grotto's sealing silence functions as earned stasis rather than forced symmetry. Minor deduction: "half-truths are the only truths most people can bear" flirts with thematic echo, though it remains character-filtered rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.7)
    The "cycles of compassion" theme emerges through concrete envelopes and responses, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph's "wave after wave, tide after tide" approaches moralizing. The locket photo's transformation from personal artifact to symbol is purposeful, and the harbor's shift (notes, drawings, embroidered initials) demonstrates thematic change through particulars. However, the ending's "gentler economy" and "rhythm of compassion cycling onward" inch toward sermonizing, and the piece offers little counter-reading or complexity—kindness circulates without friction, cost, or moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (kinship as chosen resonance, loneliness learning to bloom) emerges through images: reed sculptures, the arbor-loom, collaborative works. The final image of Lira handing a reed to travelers reweights her role without stating a moral. Minor weakness: phrases like "myth was the first stitch in community's quilt" and "the grammar of kinship made flesh" edge toward abstraction, and the arbor's revelation ("not for thread, but for memory") risks symbolic convenience introduced late. No overt sermonizing, but thematic echo is close in "loneliness learned to bloom."

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of time as malleable, echoes as memory anchors, and creation-as-preservation emerges through image and action rather than statement. The final image—city waking to rediscovered voices—resonates but leans toward wish-fulfillment; the story promises complexity (temporal erosion, borrowed time thinning) yet resolves into straightforward success without ambiguity or conceptual cost that reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—loss transforms rather than vanishes, emotion curves around absence—emerges through the mosaic cracks, glass-eye projections, and fruit-light compass without direct statement. The final image (orchard exhaling, distant twin sensing the shift) offers a resonant answer: patterns persist, silence is frequency. Buried optimism modulates through the piece and charges the ending without sentimentality. The twin beams and equation revelation avoid overt symbolism, though "emotion curves around mass" teeters toward thesis language. No sermonizing intrudes, and the conceptual repricing of silence-as-resonance feels earned by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (invisibility as soul erosion; visibility as resonance, not spectacle) emerges through the dweller's ritual of caching and her tears at the staff notice. The tape fragment's ghost-voice ("if you're listening, you're not alone") seeds the ending message without overt echo. Subtext operates in the placement ritual and the dweller's choice to remain hidden "not yet," resisting both total erasure and premature emergence. The final image (tears, perch behind biography stacks) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "Visibility wasn't spectacle. It was resonance" borders on authorial thesis statement, though it flows from prior action. The non-literal answer criterion is met, keeping the score in the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—relationship as reciprocity rather than extraction—emerges through concrete images (tearing journal pages, leaf transmutation, nursery rearrangement) without overt moralizing. The ending reconfigures prior material (pinned slides, artificial suns) through the protagonist's embodied shift. Subtext operates in gesture and silence ("she simply touched the new growth"). Minor slip: the line "I stopped trying to fix what was never broken" edges toward a stated moral, though it is brief and filtered through dialogue. The final image (linden's successor glowing beside her, keeping time with her breath) offers resonant, non-literal closure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the ocean as "librarian of loss," objects embedding emotional imprints in amber, the convergence as "the moment when grief becomes legacy." The journal revelation that Elara embedded presence against the rising sea provides a non-literal answer to the painter's quest without moralizing. The exchange ritual and "Trade accepted" whisper crystallize transformation through image and action rather than statement. The final line "the convergence wasn't over / It had simply changed hands" risks slight overstatement but remains grounded in the seawater-and-turpentine mixture, keeping the thematic turn anchored in craft.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the cave pearl as metaphor for amplifying small wonders, and the unseen forces embody "the quiet between notes, the pause before laughter." The final image—"darkness that made the light feel brighter"—reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the clairvoyant's articulation of theme ("They thrive in ambiguity") edges toward direct statement rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme—memory as compass through acknowledged absence—emerges organically from Elira's archive work, the valve's transformation from relic to cipher, and the ritual's rejection of statues for spoken names. The final image (valve under open sky, children asking "why") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material: navigation through silence rather than erasure. Subtext operates in the widow's melody, the child's sailless ship drawing, and the town's gradual trust accretion. The piece avoids moralizing; instead, it earns its insight through the specific mechanics of tide logs, valve corrosion rates, and the recurring motif of staggered intervals that shape both method and ritual cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of unspoken truths emerges through the phantom punch, the cracks, and the final chorus of whispers without overt moralizing. The closing image—"The hour had not divided bad habits from new starts—it had dissolved the illusion that they were ever separate"—attempts a Conceptual Repricing but edges into direct thematic statement rather than letting the scene image speak. The recurring motif of arrows and the punch's dissolution provide resonance, though the final paragraph's summary ("not away, but toward") risks abstraction over earned particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—connection across time, attention as conduit, solitude interwoven with awe—emerges from the tile's function and Elira's reflective stance. The final image (parchment rolled and tied, tile pulsing "faithfully") offers a resonant answer to the question of how memory and presence intertwine, avoiding overt moralizing. Yet the closing paragraph veers toward summary assertion: "transcribing the unheard symphony through forgotten patterns only the heart remembers" reads as a thematic echo of the prompt rather than a dramatized discovery. The whale migration and star positions carry metaphoric weight, but the tile itself functions more as symbol than causal agent, which slightly flattens thematic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the immortal's quest for "finality" and "what happens after goodbye" is embodied in the amulet fragment ("the broken heart of a god who refused to die twice"), the spatial mutiny ("geometry rebelled"), and the final plain of farewells. The closing image—"the pulse of final goodbyes, gentle as a breath, relentless as tides"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: endings are not oblivion but "resonance," "the accumulated weight of all farewells" in "harmonic dissonance." No moralizing; the shift from "spectacle" to "quiet thunder" reweights the premise without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling, pressing palm) and implication (the warlock "believe forgetting was mercy"). The piece invites reflection on mortality's value through an immortal's perspective, avoiding platitudes by grounding insight in specific experience—"a mother's lullaby cut short by silence."

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of fairness versus deception emerges organically from the child-of-a-con-artist premise and the ink's properties. The funeral home setting creates apt death/transformation resonance. However, the piece frequently tells its theme rather than trusting the particulars: "mathematics of fair trade," "deathly vitality," "architect of fairness" become repeated labels rather than discoveries. The final paragraph's direct thematic statements ("not as thief, not as victim, but as architect") and the litany structure ("Of fairness. Of flow. Of ink.") feel more like prompt echo than earned resonance. The strongest moment is the child's "I'm the con's conscience"—a concrete stance rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: invented histories as shared archive, memory as collaborative loom, silence as creative substrate. The fluorescent lamp's hum shifts from personal tool to "chorus," and the final offering of the notepad answers the central question without stating it—collective fiction-making becomes the thematic resolution. The jasmine-and-porcelain discovery ("joy tinged with melancholy") provides emotional specificity. One slip: "the mountain was not just her archive; it was a chorus" edges toward thesis statement in the protagonist's interiority, though it stops short of moralizing. The ending avoids sermonizing and lets the trees' protective gesture carry resonance, but the thematic clarity is slightly over-articulated in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of erasure vs. preservation emerges organically from the port setting, fragments, and Elias's method. The poison label and child's shoe function as recurring motifs that accumulate meaning. The final image ("They were layered. They were filtered. They were waiting") offers a resonant answer to the central question but veers close to thematic statement rather than embodied particulars. Subtext operates in silences (he doesn't move the shoe, speaks to no one) and the counter-narrative quilt image is apt, yet the ending's direct assertion ("Until the tide took him—or until the world admitted he'd never died at all") edges toward overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—grief, revision of memory, the limits of seeking closure—emerges organically from the sister's death and the protagonist's ritual. The painted seashell and cello function as recurring images that reweight meaning at closure. However, the riddle's answer ("What do you bury when you refuse to speak?") arrives as a thesis statement rather than non-literal resonance. The final image (walking away with humming shell halves) gestures toward living beside riddles but the insight is spelled out rather than embedded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges from concrete acts—graffiti as salvage, reorganization versus sabotage, joy resisting zoning—without overt statement. The foundation stone chip and recurring carnival imagery (clown holding lease, phoenix from popcorn cart, compass rose of tickets) accumulate symbolic weight. The final mural ("map of the raft city…as it remembers itself: unowned, ungoverned, unbroken") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how memory survives gentrification. Yet the thematic lens remains slightly abstract: "hopeful desperation" is named rather than fully embodied in contradictory on-page choices, and the climax's collective action dilutes the protagonist's internal arc inextricability from the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: obsolescence, the purpose of witness, messages sung to empty auditoriums. The hourglass's chemical mechanism—engineered to outlast its audience—charges the final image without overt moralizing. The inspector's shift from documentation to communion is earned through the scene's progression, and the ending ("You outlasted them all") reweights prior material with resonant ambiguity. One slip: "Some things aren't meant to be seen. They're meant to be known" edges toward thematic echo, though it's internalized rather than declared aloud. The final image avoids neat resolution and honors complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—mending trajectories, translating failure into flight—emerges through image and action rather than statement. The hummingbird's restoration and Elara's ritual carry subtext. Yet the final paragraph's direct thematic summary ("She mended trajectories. She turned fractures into flight paths.") shifts from resonance to assertion, lowering impact. The music box transition offers thematic continuity but does not reweight prior material with new cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: rivers begin where language, land, and liquid converge; origins are silence and seepage, not fanfare. The final image (spiral drawn in melted snow) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. Subtext operates in condensation responding to syllables, ice remembering, and the phrasebook as compass. However, the closing line—"where language listens, where ice remembers, and where a dry-witted editor, subtly confident, finally stops editing—and starts witnessing"—edges toward explicit thesis articulation. The thematic question is posed and answered through particulars, but the final sentence slightly over-articulates the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: rhythm as language, patience as reconstruction, shared balance between living and lingering. The fork left in the fountain and the final line's "next step, next note, next act" offer a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the children "never born" and elders woven from resonance. Minor slip: "infinitely patient" borders on abstraction and is declared rather than demonstrated through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the temple's history and Elira's final realization: "to harness the ephemeral was not to capture it, but to become its vessel." The priestess flashback provides concrete grounding for the "violence into stillness" motif. However, the ending edges into explicit thesis-stating ("The temple's final gift was not escape, but acceptance"; "time didn't run short—it rippled, eternal") that supplants scene pressure with authorial summary. The vial-as-motif is purposeful but the final paragraph's meta-commentary about "the next soul brave enough" dilutes the emotional charge with setup for a sequel rather than letting the particulars resonate. The non-literal answer is present but somewhat smothered by explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—truth sustained when belief is withheld—emerges from concrete particulars: the lattice from confessional, the fractured beam, the boy's kneeling "I believe you." The final image (truth woven into light, carried by every ship) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, "The lighthouse never lies" in the penultimate line edges toward thematic statement rather than trusting the image alone. The copperlight repose recurs and reweights at closure, charging the final triumph with quiet cost. The piece resists tidy resolution—truth is sealed but the boy is dismissed as mad—yet the conceptual victory is undeniable. One late slip: "chasing hush into a prison" in the final third reads as authorial summary rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—vengeance twisted into devotion, debt as balance—emerges from particulars (arsenic kiss, mercury contract, nectar "sweet, bitter, and alive") and avoids overt moralizing until the near-final line "The debt was repaid—not through vengeance, not through sacrifice, but through transmission" which edges toward summary. The bead and fruit motif charges the closure image effectively, reweighting prior material. However, the epiphany is declared ("the debt was never punishment; it was balance") rather than discovered through dramatic irony or resistance, slightly flattening thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of transformation-through-repair emerges clearly from imagery and the plate's arc. The final image (stars rearranged as grandmother's loom, child stepping out with storm) offers symbolic resonance but edges toward overt allegory. "Broken precedents" and the closing moral ("even shattered things hold the map to their own becoming") veer into direct thesis statement rather than letting particulars speak. The penultimate paragraph's explicit theme summary ("she sewed not to fix the world, but to remind it…") functions as sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—faith as rhythm to tend, not monument to preserve—emerges from the sundial's reassembly and the orchard's pulse, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph. However, the closing lines veer into thesis-speak: "Faith, she understood, was not a monument to preserve, but a rhythm to tend—a shadow cast anew each dawn, if one only dares to rebuild its base." This replaces scene pressure with articulated wisdom (−0.5). The sundial and roots recur with shifting valence, but the conceptual repricing lacks undeniable cost; the orchard simply approves.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme ("slower communication holds deeper meaning") emerges from the imagery of chalk, surface mail, and analog commerce, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph's direct claim ("not faster, but deeper"). The widow's encoded message and the inherited clipboard offer concrete anchors. However, the ending resolves into a thematic manifesto ("the future she believed in") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer arising from scene pressure, and the phrase "carefully inventive hope" is lifted directly from the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—wisdom disguised as foolishness, unheard stories given voice through craft—emerges organically from the embroiderer's actions and the conspirators' dismissal. The final image of her sleeping beside the loom offers a resonant non-literal answer, and the closing line "her needle still moves" reweights prior material with Charged Poise. However, the penultimate paragraph's explicit summary ("They called her a fool still, even as they bowed") borders on moralizing, and the piece occasionally substitutes atmospheric vocabulary for scene pressure when dramatizing the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: apology, hesitation, moonlight healing at the cost of memory, the moment before deciding. The final messages ("Go gently. You are loved.") and the medium's smile offer a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The unsent letters' dissolution and the shard's planting reweight prior material with quiet resonance. Minor slip: "fierce tenderness" is stated twice as a thematic label rather than fully embodied in contradictory action, and the moonlight-memory cost is told rather than dramatized as a choice she makes in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (peace is sutured, not signed; wounds that breathe rather than heal) emerges through coral, cast, and the unknotting gesture. The final image—Mira lighter because she carries pain with grace—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the closing paragraph edges toward over-articulation: "lotus-hearted ache...wasn't grief—it was kinship" and "learned to carry it with grace" veer close to thematic summary. The "symbiosis" talisman and "petals unfurling only when you stop trying to fix the wound" risk spelling out what the coral-cast moment already showed.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—creation as release rather than capture, joy unburdened by significance—emerges organically from Elira's arc and the fresco's transformation. The final image ("no longer a relic, but a key") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the child's warming smile and the scent of apples that "would never rot," anchoring transcendence in sensory particulars. One slip: "Her motivation had never been preservation—it was rediscovery" edges toward thematic echo, stating what the projection already dramatized. The piece resists tidy closure (the projection dissolves, warmth lingers) and invites reflection through ambiguity without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: exchange of certainty for curiosity, the nested structure of self-knowledge, and the value of surrender over control. The final image—warm river stone replacing the nickel, garden rearranging itself—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the protagonist's articulation "to trade the certainty of her craft…for the wild, trembling curiosity" in the motivation paragraph echoes prompt language and flirts with thematic summary. The piece resists tidy closure and invites reflection through the cyclical framing, elevating thematic integration despite the mid-story echo.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (resistance through preservation of language and thought) emerges organically from the greenhouse setting and the gourd-as-transmitter conceit. The image of "planting defiance in rows, broadcasting silence in syntax" works without explicit moralizing. However, "the spark wasn't hers alone anymore—it was a garden" tips into thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph, and the final vision of children singing old lullabies resolves into a tidy, declarative future rather than a resonant present-tense image that leaves ambiguity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—art as transmutation of suffering, beauty persisting in darkness—emerges organically from the poet's nightly ritual, the blossom armistice backstory, and the "reef-shadow joy" concept. The final image (singing stitches peace into ordinary lives, postcard humming, poet smiling "shyly unstoppable") offers a resonant answer to how sorrow can bloom without erasure. Subtext operates in the contrast between her isolation and the wide reach of her voice. The piece avoids overt moralizing, though "to coax grief to bloom wild and unashamed" borders on thematic statement. The recurring postcard and evolving song-type (lullaby → psalm) charge the ending without forcing a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: the ethics of preservation vs. resurrection, the beauty of incompleteness, memory as tended garden. The cracked chime as "covenant" and "aperture" operates through concrete metaphor rather than assertion. However, the ending offers no resonant reconfiguration or non-literal answer—it reprises the premise without deepening or reweighting it. The piece asserts its theme clearly but does not test or complicate it through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—trust rebuilt through meticulous, embodied promises—emerges organically from the Syrathi's oath-like syntax and the linguist's own careful methodology. The glass ink well's transformation from half-empty to empty and prismatic grounds the abstract in a concrete image. "She was repairing. Reknitting the social fabric with syntax and song" edges toward stating the thesis, but the final image of scattered prismatic promises and converging paths offers resonance without overt moralizing. The story resists easy binaries (silence as ignorance vs. betrayal) and the ending's quiet awe carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of tempering control with compassion emerges through concrete images (woman pouring water to fish, gears stripped of soul) and the surveyor's chain as a motif that shifts from measuring distance to "mapping sorrow." The final phrase "mercy moving the gears" is pithy but edges toward statement rather than earned resonance. "Slyly heartfelt" recurs as a label without dramatized cost, and the "encrypted compassion" remains more assertion than embodied particulars. The piece avoids overt moralizing but the closing paragraph's future-tense summary dilutes the thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (the tension between erasure and preservation, between buried stories and those sent skyward) emerges organically from the pigeon flights, ledgers, and dust-mote mapping. The final image offers a resonant answer: "Her history wasn't a forgery anymore—it was a composition, still being written, still being flown." This reweights the opening's three reinventions without moralizing. The meteorite as "tuning fork for memory" and the child's letter describing a dream-song that "smelled like old books and tasted like starlight" layer concrete particulars that charge the ending. No thematic echo in final paragraph; subtext operates through image rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (thresholds, necessary distances, sacred geometry) is stated explicitly rather than emergent: "thresholds weren't merely doors—they were echoes of decisions unmade" and "sacred thresholds aren't marked by stone or scripture, but by the weight of what's willingly left behind" function as thesis sentences. The final logbook reveal ("Daddy, I found you" in her own handwriting) asserts time-loop cleverness without prior particular setup, undermining earned resonance. The bench's "sigh of relief" at the end is an overt symbolic flourish rather than a non-literal reweighting of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of solitude transmuted into belonging emerges through image and action: the facility "no longer empty but threaded with seam-light wonder," the fireflies arranging into an open hand. However, the final paragraph summarizes the thematic payoff ("belonging isn't found, but coaxed") rather than letting the image resonate without explication. The burnt feather's shift from ending to beginning is earned by its recurrence but stated rather than embodied at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically: loss as gift, vanishing as resonance, "cheerful gloom" as shadow of joy. The crater glass and seed imagery recur with purpose, and the final line reprise ("before memory fades") reweights the opening. However, the penultimate paragraphs edge toward thematic statement ("Some paths disappear…so new ones can be sung into being") where scene pressure could carry the insight more obliquely. The emotional honesty and paradox register, but the ending leans instructional.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of "orchestrated serendipity" emerges through concrete particulars: coin variables, backwards poetry, pebbles mirroring lunar phases. The physicist's napkin line "Chaos is just order waiting for its choreographer" borders on explicit statement but is dramatized through the pebble-balancing beat. The bishop as "diagonal movement" and "oblique solution" carries metaphoric weight without shouting. However, the ending settles into restatement rather than a non-literal answer; the final paragraph moralizes ("wonder isn't rare... hidden in plain sight") instead of trusting the image to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—memory as resistance, embodiment as protest—emerges organically from the dance and moonstone motifs without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant answer ("trust they'll catch you") that reweights exile from solitary to communal without stating a thesis. However, the cosmic verse conceit and "fledge" metaphor feel slightly abstract and under-dramatized; the piece gestures toward profundity through poetic language rather than earning it through fully specific, embodied particulars. The final image of the child holding wildflowers is evocative but risks sentimental convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (finding the sacred in the ordinary) emerges organically from image and action—prism refraction, tide-pool rings, the widow's window repair—without overt statement until the final paragraph's "compass points" phrase. The father's shipwright lesson and the cormorant's droplets serve as grounded particulars. However, the ending ("always what you chose to see between the lines") edges toward maxim, and no thematic tension or cost is dramatized; the glazier's worldview is affirmed rather than tested or reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—pain as a dialect, translated to bridge isolation—emerges from particulars (the children's questions, his scars, the cracked box as reliquary). The piece resists overt moralizing until "he found something close to peace—not the absence of pain, but the presence of purpose, polished by reflection," which edges toward thesis statement. The final image of scattered letters as seeds and his breath as "translation no fire could consume" offers a resonant non-literal answer, though the porcelain box's "fractures had let some of the burden breathe" relies on metaphor assertion rather than concrete reweighting. Subtext operates in gesture and the celestial witness motif, but the theme leans explanatory in the closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (hope as solvable structure, patient multiverse repair) emerges from pattern-work and trial balloons without overt moralizing. The final image—"multiverse exhaled, lighter than before"—offers resonant reconfiguration. However, "serene upheaval humming in her marrow" and "lucidly watchful" veer into thematic echo, articulating the thesis in prompt-like language. Subtext operates in the balloons' return and the gauge's calibration, but the penultimate paragraphs state rather than imply: "Her motivation was not to fix everything, but to keep the equations breathing."

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme—legacy as a burden passed lightly, not carried alone—emerges organically from the cartographer's encounter with the half-burned diaries and her decision to leave her own work in the hearth. The final image of the passage exhaling and the walls dreaming answers the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in the film negative's glow and the ivy's rustle. However, the penultimate line "Legacy's burden was not meant to be carried alone" hovers close to explicit theme statement, though it is quickly subsumed by the sensory departure. The piece resists tidy resolution while delivering a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.4)
    A coherent theme of transformation and gentle intervention emerges from the mirage-painting conceit and the mirrors showing "what could unfold." The lullaby motif and the third mirror's reveal ("younger, standing beside a crib") create a recursive pattern that reweights prior material. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "Her work was not to linger, but to leave traces—to seed the world with gentle fractures where light could enter" (−0.6 for thematic echo in closure). The ending offers reflection rather than earned insight from dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—redemption's price measured in courage to return after failure, ritual as binding strategy—emerges from concrete acts (writing with meteorite ink, soldiers pressing thumbs) without overt thesis. The clipboard's evolving inscriptions (scratched names, layered text) and the mirror-treaty metaphor avoid allegory. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling in preparation not prayer, silence before speech). The final image reweights prior material: "mustered—not through conquest, but through ritual significance" answers the story's question with earned resonance. No explain-everything moralizing; the ending trusts implication. Minor slip: "operatively gentle" and "anchor ideals in practice" edge toward prompt-label phrasing in interiority, but the scene work dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: Elias's manufactured droughts versus his preservation of ghost-songs, atonement through symbolic gesture rather than justice or resurrection. The egg and salt flat form a coherent image cluster that charges the ending without overt moralizing. "Echo was enough" risks abstraction but is grounded in the on-page resonance and his departure. The piece resists tidy redemption—he returns to destructive work—and the final image (egg staying, cracks remembering, melody waiting) offers a non-literal answer to whether atonement is possible. Minor slip: "fractured grace" and "hollow between heartbeats" veer toward poetic summary rather than scene-driven resonance in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (voice versus enforced silence, defiance of conformity) emerges from the prism task and echo imagery. The final line "keeper of the defiant hum" offers a non-literal answer without overt moral, and the "harvest of echoes" metaphor recurs with shifted weight. However, the piece leans on prompt-language abstractions ("lullaby of conformity," "bodily poetic grace") that read as thematic announcement rather than discovery through particulars. Subtext operates in gesture (breath, thread-tracing) but interiority often names the theme directly.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme—accountability in storytelling—emerges organically from the calligrapher's reflections and the Navajo elder's warning ("stories burn twice"). The motif of the story stick returns with shifted meaning at the end, and the puppet shows embody the theme through subversive truth-telling. However, the final epiphany ("ethical storytelling wasn't about purity, but accountability") is stated rather than dramatized, and the closing line ("The story wasn't over. It was just finally being told right.") edges into thematic summary. The piece resists easy morals but leans on the protagonist articulating the thesis rather than letting the image carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme (the power of ephemeral witness, reverence without audience) emerges organically from the ritual and the setting. The final image—"the weight of a history briefly, blindingly, remembered"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, the piece drifts toward thematic assertion ("Its power lay in its solitude") rather than earning all claims through concrete action, and the meta-commentary on forgetting and erasure occasionally replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—memory as living resonance rather than archival stasis—emerges organically from the lost-wax process and the rope's preserved chants. The final image (helix embedded in bedrock, roots cradling it, children hearing lullabies) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the preservation question. Subtext operates in gesture and image; no overt moralizing mars the ending. However, the protagonist's internal arc is more enactment of thesis than struggle; forgiveness and grace arrive fully formed rather than earned through friction or renunciation, blunting thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges organically from images: the seven-path vision, the wafer seal's honey-to-obsidian transformation, and the forest reclaiming the bunker. The central question (why paths choose walkers) is explored through symbolic particulars rather than statement. However, the final paragraph edges toward Thematic Echo: "You were always the path" and "walkers, at last, become the road" articulate the thesis too directly, replacing earned resonance with summary. The piece invites reflection, but the closure moralizes rather than letting the image speak, triggering a −0.5 deduction per the Thematic Echo penalty guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—devotion encoded in arithmetic, the collision of rationality and mysticism—emerges through particulars (the magic square, the schematic representations, the resonance) and the final image of "encrypted devotion puls[ing] like a neutron star" reweights prior material. However, the closing paragraphs veer toward thematic statement: "unseen, unpraised, empirically ironic, and utterly essential" and "counts the infinite and calls it home" articulate the thesis rather than letting the image resonate. The conceptual cost (no monument, no coin) is asserted but not dramatized as a present forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme—resentment released through bodily memory rather than argument—emerges clearly, but the final paragraph ("Its purpose had shifted," "those who needed it would always find it") states the thesis rather than showing it through a resonant image. The music box recurs and shifts meaning, but the ending leans on meta-commentary ("she would teach them to listen not with ears, but with sinew") that replaces scene pressure. Epiphanies are asserted ("this was the lesson") rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—boundaries between maker and made, memory and mirror, sleep and waking—emerges through concrete imagery (sextant's harmonic resonance, frost-glow blossoms, the dream flowing into obsidian glass) rather than direct statement. The mirror maker's recognition ("She had once been that child") and the dream's motivation (fleeing "the cage of becoming") ground the theme in specific experience. The final image—fog thickening again after the capture—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: mastery achieved, boundaries restored, isolation re-embraced. One slip: "Glass mountains" tone is asserted in exposition ("that was the tone she carried in her marrow") rather than fully dramatized through scene pressure, edging toward thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—repair across generations requires patience and the right tools—emerges from particulars (vows as fallen foliage, honey for coaxing, silver thread for stitching) without overt moralizing. The final image of the green fabric caught on a thorn offers a non-literal answer: reconciliation begins with return, not resolution. "Accidental wisdom" is dramatized rather than stated. Slight thematic echo in the closing paragraph ("wisdom...grows best when tended across generations") trends toward summary, but the honey-spoon image and footprints anchor the insight in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the cameo's emptiness holding prophecy, the Möbius glyph, petals bearing unlived versions of herself. "Nonlinear inheritance" shifts from archival puzzle to existential resonance—inheritance as choice across timelines, not bloodline. The closing image ("field to be harvested") reweights the opening gap between first and last page without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the pistachio shell's "potential never tasted" and the word "Again" nested inside. The piece resists tidy resolution; she gains understanding but also "brightened disquiet settling into her marrow like a second skeleton."

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme—rescue as reconciliation rather than removal—is stated directly in the lexicon's sentence rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. "I am the lesson you refused to learn: that rescue is not removal, but reconciliation" functions as explicit moralizing in place of resonant image. The botanical diary's "semantic blooms" and "gaps" recur but remain abstractions without grounding in specific event or cost. The final image offers a conceptual answer without non-literal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from image and choice: identity as multiplicity, freedom within constraint, and the cost of reclaiming lost selves. The emerald swatch card, mirror reflections, and vine-hung names accrue meaning without overt statement. The final line—"trapped freedom...was still freedom—if you chose the bars"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing, reweighting the entire descent. "Solace unkindled" (the core concept) appears as a tangible moment in the garden, though it functions more as atmospheric texture than a choice-driving force. Subtext operates in the protagonist's whispered invitations to her reflections ("I remember you," she lied) and the hesitation at the vine. The piece resists tidy resolution; her becoming "lighter yet heavier" preserves complexity. No thematic echo or direct thesis statement mars the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: "Fables of absence are not endings. They are pauses—waiting for hands that know how to weave silence into structure." The rope's reconfiguration and the door's dissolution offer a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. The final image—the clock chiming correctly, the archivist logging "Temporal Reconciliation"—reweights prior material. However, the thematic statement in the archive note borders on overt articulation; it nearly crosses into echo territory but stays grounded in the rope's physical transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as architecture, fracture lines as scores, the storm tuned rather than banished. The echo chamber stone's dual function—absorbing and releasing—charges the thematic question without overt statement. The final image of the being cradling the stone "like an egg" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the closing line—"the next silence waiting to be conjured"—veers toward thematic echo, restating the premise rather than reweighting it. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection, but the lack of protagonist cost limits emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—hidden pattern beneath apparent randomness—emerges through the prism's revelation that "coincidences" are "convergences" woven into a luminous tapestry. The recurring "shard of hush" and "thistle-blown hope" motifs reweight at closure: the prism becomes heartbeat, the custodian becomes conduit. The ending offers a resonant image (thistles bowing "not in defeat, but in reverence") that reweights prior material without stating a moral. However, the piece edges toward thematic echo in the final paragraph: "even broken things can rekindle wonder, if you track the stars long enough to let them guide you home" articulates the thesis too explicitly. The scaffold "not... but..." construction recurs across multiple beats, signaling pattern but bordering on template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.6)
    Collective memory and the act of conjecture generate thematic texture, and the "preemptive nostalgia" motif recurs across beats. However, the theme is largely stated rather than earned through on-page friction: "not to preserve, but to resurrect," "she too would become a whisper in crystal." The final image (signing along a raindrop's refraction) gestures at resonance but lacks the felt cost or conceptual repricing that would reweight prior material. The piece telegraphs its thesis rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—hope reclaimed through ritual play in defiance of cosmic silence—emerges from image and action rather than statement. The mosaic cipher, the kerosene knot, and the star work as particulars that resonate without a thesis announcement. Yet the final image, while lyric, offers a resolved constellation (star holds, fortress seals, "a new spark takes root") that feels declarative rather than ambiguous. The piece invites reflection but the neat symmetry of hope-restored undercuts complexity. The closing "not in sky, but in soul" edges toward moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (transition as sacred threshold, time as granular and textured) emerges organically from the chronicler's method, the jade cicada's metaphor (years underground, brief song, decay/rebirth), and the catalogue of threshold images (paper boat, white rose, closed textbook). The ending offers a resonant answer—transition honored as "a sacred, textured threshold, humming with possibility"—without a stated moral. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("Time, she understood now, was not measured in ticks or dates, but in the quality of attention..."), threading close to articulation rather than pure implication. The piece resists false balance and earns complexity through specific particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the contrast between curated bunker silence and wild, nourishing quiet; the final image of silence "tasting of thunderstorms and lullabies—uncontained, unafraid" reweights the opening constraint without stating a moral. The line "by limiting exposure to the only silence they'd ever known, they had preserved the hunger necessary to recognize this one" verges on thematic summary but remains anchored to the child's on-page realization. The sprouting doll threads offer a non-literal answer to the question of what happens when longing meets abundance, though the ease of transformation mutes ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—silence as presence, not void—emerges through storm-glass pulses and the operator's calibrated non-intervention rather than stated moral. The final exchange (woman opens mouth, closes it, smiles; he nods) offers a resonant answer without sermon. Backstory (grandmother's lullabies, first weeping passenger) roots the practice in particulars. Yet the closing image of the operator sighing "not with weariness, but readiness" edges toward overt thematic gloss, and the vial's welcoming churn for the next passenger risks tidy symmetry that flattens cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—ascension as comprehension, not dominion—emerges clearly, but it arrives via thesis statement ("the throne didn't grant power—it granted perspective") rather than through embodied particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "wisdom and adventure must walk hand in hand, or not at all." The ruby flake and murals function as symbolic waypoints but don't accumulate pressure that reweights meaning; instead they unlock set-pieces in sequence. The throne's "woven from strands of forgotten laughter and unsent letters" gestures toward resonance but remains ornamental description. No counter-reading is invited; the piece declares its moral cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—healing through acceptance of absence—emerges from repeated metaphors (burning bridges, teaching suffocation to breathe) but is stated rather than dramatized. The final line ("suffocation ends not when air returns, but when you stop fighting the shape of your own throat") is direct thematic summary, not a non-literal image that reweights prior material. Subtext is minimal; nearly every beat explicates its symbolic intent. The piece invites reflection through lyric intensity, but the closing paragraph moralizes instead of letting particulars resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—alchemy of the soul, translating pressure into clarity rather than wealth—emerges from events and the bolt's symbolic evolution. The final image of crystallized lessons and the message "Diamonds aren't worn. They're remembered" offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, "quantum promise" as sales pitch turned harvest feels abstract, and the piece hovers near allegorical transparency (pyramid scheme survivor heals via literal alchemy). The ending risks thematic echo when Elara "translates" and the overseer observes "You did something."

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—truth as resonance, silence as structure—emerges through concrete particulars (standing waves, coastal training, the gramophone as translator). The ending offers a non-literal answer: she is not the ender but the restoration, and the shift from mission to self is charged by the prior sensory method. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("a coronation of understanding, not crowns"; "the city stirred, unaware") rather than letting the image alone carry the weight. The piece resists moralizing but the closure leans on articulated significance rather than pure implication.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—surrender as agency, liminality as vocation—emerges organically from imagery and the knight's motion. The final image of threads and unfolding avoids overt moralizing. However, the thematic resolution is asserted ("He had done it") rather than embodied in a specific, non-literal final action that reweights prior material. The recurring motif of "murmured allegiance" and "unsnapping" appears as decorative reprise without constraining a choice or charging the closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the button, handprints, crayon drawing. The contrast between "preserving loss" and "turning memorials into living stories" is earned through artifact accumulation rather than stated thesis. The final image—dust and light as explanation—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the supervisor's line "You're turning files into memorials" / "I'm turning memorials back into living stories" edges toward on-the-nose articulation. The piece resists false equivalence (not all stories have happy endings) while maintaining the theme that "love persists, even in paper and shadow."

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—memory as resistance, the tyranny of indifference—emerges through the Archive Engine and counter-narratives rather than overt moralizing. The puddle-map motif and the final Ace of Keys attempt symbolic resonance, but "Coded freedom never announces itself. It reappears" in the closing lines edges toward thematic summary. The piece resists simplistic resolution (indifference will crack, not explode), yet the protagonist's clean escape and the regime's passivity at the climax soften the complexity. Subtext operates in the soldering-iron rewiring and the regime's own infrastructure turning against it.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—the power of silence to contain dangerous knowledge—emerges through concrete action (the melody, the shattering prism, the unraveling prophecy) rather than assertion. The grandmother's lesson ("Some silences are louder than screams") seeds the premise and the final image reweights it without moralizing. Subtext operates in the grotto's gratitude ("weary and grateful") and the protagonist's pause at the exit. However, "vested hush" and "negative space" risk becoming prompt echoes when repeated without fresh tension, and the eerie-nostalgia tone occasionally tips toward poetic convenience rather than earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—memory woven into matter, the past as perpetual unfolding—emerges through concrete images (dust-specks, twig monuments, the lullaby thread) rather than abstract statement. However, the grandmother's dialogue ("You sorted silence") and the final paragraph's summary ("the past didn't haunt—it harmonized") veer into overt thematic articulation that replaces scene pressure. The story resists tidy morals but leans on "mossy delight" as emotional shorthand, diluting specificity at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—befriending uncertainty versus imposing order—emerges organically from Elias's profession, the compass's properties, and the admiral's journal without direct moralizing. The waterfall's song, the compass that "pointed beneath the ashes," and the final image of leading others "uncertainly certain" through the greenhouse all reweight the opening fixation on fixing clocks. The admiral's written insight ("Plans are anchors. Uncertainty, the wind that fills the sail") borders on thematic echo but is framed as a found artifact rather than authorial intrusion, and the subsequent actions (improvising structures, handing tools not answers) dramatize the shift. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through image and gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The kintsugi philosophy—honoring breakage by repairing with gold—emerges organically from the coin ritual and Elara's arc without thesis statements. The theme of naming as anchor and weight deepens through the ceremony, and the final image (golden seam on the anvil, dust beside her heart) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of redemption without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution; Elara becomes "Elara the Mended" not lighter but "truer," her balance now "a dance between fracture and gold." The "luminous regret" frame risks slight abstraction but the particulars (Aris, Kaelen, Veyra; the vial of dust; the anvil seam) ground the theme in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—grief as companionship, laughter as sorrow's sibling—emerges from image and action rather than statement. The final image (child's giggle downstream, another gorge waiting) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, lines like "Laughter was not the opposite of sorrow. / It was its oldest sibling" edge toward thematic statement rather than letting the flute-and-giggle sequence carry the weight alone. The "luminous ache" phrase recurs as a label rather than being embodied through fresh particulars at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—mercy as a manifold, not an equation—emerges from the protagonist's trauma and the forest's response, avoiding direct statement until the final reflection. The recurring interrogator's question ("What is the derivative of mercy with respect to time?") and the whispered answer seed thematic tension. However, the closing paragraphs lean toward thesis articulation ("mercy is not an equation to be solved, but a space to be inhabited") rather than letting the final image speak. The strap's dissolution and the color shift (violet to indigo to blue) aim for resonance but remain illustrative rather than irreducibly particular.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—honoring erased cultures, truth whispered through hidden details—emerges organically from the triptych reveal and memory-trade. The final image of the child's drawing ("anchors hope") and the translator walking bridges "suspended above rooftops and ruin" offers resonance. Yet the closing paragraph shifts into overt thematic declaration ("truth isn't shouted. It's whispered through brushstrokes") that states the premise rather than letting the final image perform it. The lens fragment's task is summarized ("its energy spent honoring overlooked histories") instead of shown through a charged reprise, reducing subtext and inviting the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of witnessing neglect and releasing the unseen emerges organically from the technician's actions and the circus artifacts. The final image ("keeping vigil," "witness it had been waiting for") reweights the opening's "ghosts haunt neglect" premise without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the dust silhouette, the daughter photo, and the "weightless burden" refrain. One weakness: the thematic line "ghosts don't haunt places; they haunt neglect" edges close to direct statement, and the closing metaphor ("tucking in a child") is slightly tidy given the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme—chaos as a necessary destabilizer of perfect systems, eternity as density rather than duration—emerges from the operator's actions and the library's transformation. The final image (placing the moment in "The Grammar of Collapse" on a new shelf) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the piece leans on abstract philosophical vocabulary ("equilibrium was entropy's favorite disguise," "chaos was not the enemy of meaning—it was its midwife") that borders on thesis statement rather than allowing the action to speak. The bottled whisper as "seed of chaos" is more asserted than demonstrated through evolving consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the protagonist's shift from militant revolution to curatorial rebellion, crystallized in "the real rebellion was against forgetting." The covering-mirrors motif accrues pressure without being forced, and the haiku fragments serve as micro-reckonings rather than decorative inserts. The final image—"alive, not in triumph, but in translation"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor lost ideals. No overt thesis statements; complexity remains intact, though the phrase "quieter and more vital" edges toward authorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (truth through erosion, covenant of rust as revelation not decay) emerges from concrete particulars: the replaced music box, the wilting chip, rust as connection rather than corrosion. The final image—song seeping into walls, carrying truth forward—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph ("not with tools, but with truth, not with force, but with resonance") edges into thematic summary, and the phrase "Tinkersong wonder—the kind that lives in mended things" in the final third articulates the premise label rather than letting the image carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: petrichor as memory, the compass pointing toward surrender, Riel's journal fused to rock, and the passage sealing behind Elira. The piece resists overt moralizing and the final image ("the stone sighed around her, sealing the way behind") offers a resonant answer without stating a thesis. The concept of "hinged awakenings" and the motif of scent/silence reweight across beats. Minor penalty: "sensibly eccentric soul finally aligned with a world that asked no questions" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak alone.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—trust and shared survival across time—emerges from the slide's image and is embodied in Elara's carving and the villagers' ritual. The line "Simplicity is not absence. It is architecture" borders on thesis statement but functions as a felt epiphany tied to her sculptural act. The final image (hands clasped, lanterns lit) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the ending's summary mode ("people didn't panic… They remembered") abstracts the thematic payoff rather than grounding it in a single, charged gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: night-blooming flowers encode reverence for beauty in obscurity, vulnerability in darkness. The discovery of encoded blooms in glass, the artist's tears, and her perpetual vigil all render the theme without stating it. The final image—watching real flowers unfurl beneath the moon—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Minor slip: "Some truths are not for speaking, but for living" edges toward direct statement, though it remains embedded in narration rather than dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—memory, witness, reckoning with historical erasure—emerges from recurring images (lagoon glow, debris messages, encrypted diary). The piece resists overt thesis until the final paragraph, where "truth thrives in tension" becomes explicit and borders on meta-commentary. The ending line "Arrange us. Remember us. Free us." offers a resonant whisper, but the overall design leans heavily on elevated abstraction ("electric space between what was recorded and what was remembered") rather than earning insight through on-page particulars. The archivist's transformation into "living ledger" is asserted more than felt. No thematic echo penalty applies because the claim arises in narration, not dialogue, yet the proximity to sermonizing in the penultimate paragraph lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—revival as reinvention, not restoration—emerges organically from action and image without didactic statement. The amber bottle as "working memory made manifest" and the lanterns fed by "unspoken stories" avoid generic abstraction. The alchemist's line "a town dies twice" and his refusal to explain mechanisms resist over-articulation. The final image (bottle glowing in a child's room, civilization "reborn") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "he knew nostalgia was a narcotic, not a blueprint" edges toward overt thematic commentary, but the piece earns most of its resonance through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—memory as living substrate, emotion as cultivable spore—emerges organically from the orchard's architecture and Elira's ritual, avoiding direct statement. The Field Trip cylinder and child-prophecy reprise create thematic charge without moralizing. The final image ("roots threading deeper into the building's steel bones, branches reaching toward a sky slowly clearing of smog—and forgetting") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: preservation and loss coexist, the orchard breathes against the city's amnesia. Subtext operates in the velvet disquiet, the municipal decree post-Smog, and the unnoticed change. Minor thematic drift: "velvet disquiet" as tone is announced late and not fully integrated into prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: entropy decreased by reverence, not force; memory as method; the texture of borrowed time as "porous, alive, humming with second chances." The closing lines—"The vortex inheritance wasn't a burden passed down; it was a door held open by those who dared to decrease entropy with tenderness"—reweight prior material without overt moralizing, and the sapling's tactile resonance (felt like childhood summers, forgiveness, quiet after storm) answers the thematic question through concrete sensation. Minor deduction for "wild serenity" arriving as a closing label rather than arising implicitly throughout, and for the phrase "decrease entropy with tenderness" bordering on thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme (listening over noise, trust over panic) emerges organically from the protagonist's methods and the Great False Dawn backstory. The bell's resonant toll and villagers' reception offer a non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of rain as "promise" and the protagonist descending to "listen" charges the closure with thematic weight, though the subtlety borders on under-dramatization of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of flourishing stillness emerges organically from action (tracing meteors, the comet's bloom, the final sweeping) and image (yellow lantern glass, star-dust, gravitational sigh). The poet-astronomer's journal line ("Stillness blooms where motion surrenders") primes the ending without moralizing, and the janitor's whispered "Thank you for remembering how to be still" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the thematic statement risks directness in the final third, and the arc from cataloger to janitor borders on allegorical convenience rather than emergent complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from images and actions: silence as sanctuary, unspoken burdens preserved as architecture, the box's sealed murmurs as sacred weight. The final honey-gold glyphs offer a resonant, non-literal answer—"a language only silence could speak"—that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (the beekeeper's turn, the woman sifting phantom pollen) and the recluse's refusal to open the box. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection through purposeful ambiguity, though the thematic echo "language only silence could speak" in the final line edges toward articulation of the thesis rather than letting the image stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—time as accumulation rather than passage—emerges organically from the fused urn, the translucent moments, and the grandmother's letter without direct statement. The final garage-sale listings offer a resonant, non-literal answer: objects become vessels for suspended emotion, and curation replaces measurement. Subtext operates in the urn's warmth, the silo's hum, and the choice to "summon" rather than sell. The piece resists tidy morals; the refusal to count seconds is both liberation and renunciation. One weakness: "Time, Vey now knew, wasn't to be measured" in the penultimate line edges toward thematic summary, though it stops short of moralizing and the final listings anchor the insight in specific objects.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme—beauty in brokenness, incompletion as resource—emerges through concrete particulars: the drake's feather (shed to lighten flight), the patched kite (asymmetrical yet airborne), and the final image of the boy's laughter. The closing line ("Even snapped strings carry the wind's memory") reprices the rupture without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the feather's warmth, the boy's silence, and thelagoon's reflection motif. No overt philosophizing mars the resolution; the particulars (seaglass-blue scraps, crooked frame) do the work. Minor slip: "woven dawns" as a named practice feels slightly self-conscious, though it serves the conceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of coexistence through patient, non-dominating architecture emerges organically from Arlen's copper-wire method and the diary's maxim ("Respect isn't earned by dominance. It's offered when you prove you belong in the design"). The final image—sparrows nesting in copper arms, learning respect "by living inside the design"—reweights the orchard as both literal structure and inheritance without stating a moral. However, the piece leans toward thematic declaration ("gently systematic dismantling of fear through purpose," "monument," "reintroducing species") rather than letting insight arise solely from action. The sparrow rescue and the doe birth are telling moments, but the resolution tilts into "poets wrote odes" epilogue rather than letting the final on-page image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—that meaning emerges from convergence rather than isolation—arises organically from the protagonist's failed measurements and her final acceptance. The fly amber shifts from control sample to companion, reweighting the premise without overt statement. Subtext operates through image and gesture (leaving the amber, not looking back). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she becomes part of the reaction. However, the final paragraph's explicit articulation ("She had not found an equation. She had become part of the reaction.") flirts with thematic echo, though it stops short of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—memory, restoration, the insistence of life—emerges through concrete images: seed pods as "ciphers," roots' "refusal to forget," petals pressing "against rusted bayonets." The final metaphor "some journeys are measured not in miles, but in sprouts" states the theme rather than letting the image do the work, and risks moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution by promising ongoing labor ("tomorrow, he'd return"), and "submerged concord" as a concept-label enriches rather than dominates. However, the ending articulates rather than embodies its answer.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges organically: grief and memory as living practices, closeness as resonance rather than proximity. The wax leaf's tinted revelations avoid overt symbolism, and the final image (leaf glowing, forests whispering through grooves) reweights prior material without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution, ending with the settlement thriving on presence rather than salvage. However, the thematic answer is delivered through assertion ("closeness isn't measured in steps, but in shivers") rather than a non-literal image that lets the reader feel the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: true north as inner bearing, the family custom of sketching as presence rather than accuracy, witnessing as an act that grants peace. The compass rose and stretched stars accumulate meaning without overt statement. The final image—the filament absorbed by her witnessing—resonates as a non-literal answer to "what blooms in time's wake." One slip: "true north wasn't celestial. It was the choice to remain curious" edges into direct thesis statement, though it's earned by prior material. No moralizing in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme (wonder, surrender, play vs. dominion) is stated overtly rather than emerging from dramatized choices: "not to conquer the board; he would amend it." The sundial's blank map and Elric's final bow gesture toward resonance, but the ending offers a moral summary ("invited it to play") instead of a non-literal answer. Thematic statements cluster in the final paragraphs ("not an ending, but an overture"), which triggers the penalty for overt moralizing. No contradictory impulse complicates the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: the missing pawns embody "those who vanish quietly," and the pattern-walking converts silence into syntax. The piece resists tidy morals—"benevolently ruthless" penumbra does not heal but reveals—and the final image (spelling "listen" before the sovereign) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the interregnum's incubation question. The widow's ring on the vacant square is a strong particular. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic statement: "luminous absence of all the small gestures that had held the world together" risks summary over scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (home as frequency, not place; belonging through texture and memory) emerges clearly from image and action rather than statement. The final image offers a resonant answer without overt moral. However, the thematic resolution is granted rather than earned—no trade-off or ambiguity complicates the arrival. The stone's "purpose fulfilled" and the seer's welcoming of the past read tidy. Subtext operates in gesture and sensory detail, and the piece avoids sermonizing, but the lack of friction or counter-pressure keeps it from the higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars—frayed threads, the boy she broke, the mirror's fog—without thesis statements. The final image (walking through rain, carrying truth lightly) offers a resonant answer to the forgiveness question without moralizing. The tapestries' reknitting "stronger at the broken places" risks cliché but is earned by prior winnowing work. One slip: "Forgiveness had not come from decree or deed, but from winnowing the past until only truth remained" edges toward thematic echo in the penultimate beat, though it stops short of sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—forgiveness as holding jagged edges without demanding coherence—emerges through the canyon's refractive mechanic and the artist's refusal to feed the spire a unified story. The child beat dramatizes the concept (porcelain smiles, glue that never dries) without didacticism. However, the final paragraph edges toward statement: "not as absolution, but as acknowledgment" nearly summarizes rather than trusts the image. The spire's face and dissolution offer a resonant answer, yet the prose occasionally leans on prompt-adjacent phrasing ("devotion to complexity," "the price"). The ending reweights prior material but stops short of full non-literal mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.1)
    Kintsugi as thematic anchor—making brokenness sacred—emerges clearly from the statue work and emotional mapping. The final image (workshop as altar, breath "given") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, several passages drift into abstract philosophical declaration ("conjure meaning—not gold, not immortality, but the quiet truth that stitches chaos") that tell theme rather than earning it through scene pressure. The specificity of matching wounds to pockmarks grounds the concept, but the ending's metaphysical reward (purified air, steadied floor) feels more asserted than dramatized through cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—reflection as motion rather than static image—emerges organically from the cracked mirror, cave painting, and final realization about tides and brushstrokes. The painted shell's shift from keepsake to witness to abandoned artifact reweights the promise with conceptual cost. The ending image (shell being swallowed by mineral deposits) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral, though the penultimate paragraph edges toward articulation ("reflection wasn't in glass, but in motion") that slightly undercuts subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—gentleness as a broadcast frequency, tenderness as rerouting force—emerges from the cork's mechanics and the contrast between shouting captains and whispered intent. The final image (wind whispering back) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Strengths: the piece resists didacticism and builds resonance through scent and vibration. Weakness: "screaming tenderness" as a phrase borders on thematic echo, and the ending paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("This was how the world healed") rather than letting the image carry all weight. The particulars (jasmine, cereus, cork) effectively anchor the universal.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of reverse migration and navigation through absence emerges clearly from image and action, avoiding overt thesis. The final paragraph's "Raw solace isn't comfort" meta-statement and the line "She doesn't heal. She doesn't fix. She navigates" veer toward direct thematic summary, lowering resonance (−0.5 in Q5). The ending offers a lyric answer—seepage rather than parade—but it reiterates the premise rather than reweighting prior material with a non-literal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—safety as presence of regulation, not absence of threat—emerges organically from the forager's actions and the textbook fragment rather than thesis statement. The glass eye and truffle recur with shifted meaning: first tools of personal calm, then gifts, finally released wild. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: safety grows not from control but surrender, paid off in the image of the eye left in the tree and her smile at the child's laughter. The piece resists moralizing; the forager's insight is earned through specifics (soil, scent, trembling survivors) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—borrowed memory, witnessed isolation, and softly persistent love—emerges organically from the boutonnière, Silas's method, and the closure image. The final pinning beside Elara's photograph offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, "Some truths belong to the sea, and to those who listen in the gaps" edges toward thesis statement in the penultimate paragraph, diluting earned resonance. The Edelweiss and lighthouse motifs constrain choice and reweight meaning at closure, avoiding token recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of lingering promises and the gap between regret and redemption emerges through concrete images: the childhood vow, the doorway, the letter. Yet the ending moralizes ("doorway hadn't erased his loneliness; it had revealed its purpose") and the matrix chip's absorption reads as symbolic convenience rather than earned cost. The ants-as-guides metaphor ("tiny guides for others still searching") states rather than enacts resonance. The promise is honored, but thematic complexity collapses into wish-fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (buried grief, power versus authenticity) emerges through the pool's visions and the figure's declaration, but the ending leans on direct statement ("You chose power over pulse") rather than a resonant image that reweights prior particulars without moralizing. The fireflies and starlight function as recurrent motifs, yet their final appearance feels ornamental rather than a non-literal answer that transforms the central question. The grotto "remembers what you tried to forget" is thematically apt but edges toward thesis summary.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (presence as chosen density, returning differently to wounds) emerges from imagery and the columella motif, avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate lines. However, "Presence isn't passive... It's chosen" and "Your guilt is the pigment I've been missing" veer into direct thematic statement rather than trusting the final image. The columella's spiral and the liquid twilight accumulate texture, but the ending pivots to articulation ("not as burden, but as bridge") instead of letting the glowing shell and Elias's tears speak unaided.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: feral nostalgia as "rabid, snarling recollections," jealousy sharpening focus "like a blade on stone," and the insight that "Endings are just seams where one story stitches into the next, ragged but resilient." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"I soar. Not away. Not toward. Just… through. The chaos isn't gone. But now, it has a shape. And a name. Mine"—that reweights the premise without stating a moral. Minor intrusion: "I get jealous of past selves because they still believed in clean endings" leans slightly explicit, but the line is brief and the thematic work is otherwise earned through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—ordinary miracles witnessed through limitation—emerges from the screw's reframing and the fog's modulation, avoiding overt thesis. However, Ren's dialogue veers into thematic summary ("miracles don't need to be fragrant...just witnessed") and the closing lines ("one quiet miracle at a time") border on a stated moral. The final therapy-table image offers a resonant answer, but the route there includes too much explicit philosophizing. The best moments—screw as fulcrum, broken clocks holding time differently—are undercut by the explain-everything tendency in dialogue and reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—pain as raw material for alchemical transformation—emerges from the rune sequence and scar imagery without overt thesis. The final line "stories alchemize pain, turning rigid into rhythm, broken into ballad" is poetic but flirts with direct statement rather than letting the image carry full weight. Subtext operates in the held breath, crystallizing ink, and hummed lullaby; the superstitions (dandelions, chalk sigils, knotted hair) function as anchors rather than token motifs. The piece resists tidy moral and honors complexity (scars remain, but meaning shifts), though the closing phrase slightly over-articulates the insight. Recurrence of "scars" and "breath" charges the ending without checklist repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of imperfect reconciliation and messy forgiveness emerges through the scent device, annotated manuscript, and "flawed frequency" image. The story avoids overt moralizing, though "miracles don't wait for perfect timing" flirts with abstraction. The final exchange ("Write about this" / "In truth") offers a resonant reprise of the metaphor-versus-truth conflict without becoming didactic. Subtext operates in silences and the decision not to embrace, but the golden-thread melody visualization leans ornamental rather than thematically indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through image and action: meaning as negotiated void, language as illusion, coherence over truth. The dictionary's dissolution into light and the final "hush after" offer non-literal answers without moralizing. However, the piece veers into direct thematic statement ("Meaning is not discovered; it is negotiated between observer and void") and meta-commentary ("She called it housekeeping"). The ending resists simplistic resolution but the cosmic scale renders stakes abstract rather than particular.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the shepherd's actions and the station's mechanics: clocks measure absence, the space between ticks, the razor edge before consequence hardens. The "wound against the fall, you may yet rise" inscription and the backward counting offer a non-literal answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, the ending ("time isn't lost. It's just waiting to be wound the other way") edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. The razor-edge motif recurs purposefully but lacks sufficient pressure on a live choice to fully charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—holding contradiction, traversing mentally, redefining success—emerges organically from image and action rather than thesis. The lantern's "lucid contradictions" and scrawls like "P(failure) = 0 if you redefine success" avoid platitude by grounding abstractions in concrete ritual (photographing, decoding, leaving chalk). The final "Begin again" paired with green ink and the father's clover offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "clover melancholy" is named rather than fully embodied, and "widening ≠ escaping" on the bedside table edges toward moralizing label, though it's framed as scrawl rather than authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges cleanly through image and action: wrong numbers as seeds, misrouted calls as "cultivated estrangement," the disc as archive of emotional residue. The core concept (cultivated estrangement) integrates with the operator's motivation and method without overt statement. The final image—looping her own voice into the disc's hum—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "where lost calls go to be found." Subtext operates in the glass harmonica's "melodically haunted" tone and the tunnel's mechanical drone. The piece avoids moralizing and resists tidy resolution; the operator "began, quietly, to end her own" is ambiguous and charged. One small slip: "endings needed to be taught how to begin" in paragraph one edges toward thesis statement, though it's framed as the operator's belief rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—regeneration through small, proximate acts of memory—emerges organically from the archivist's journaling ritual and the locket photo, avoiding overt thesis. The final image ("walked home beneath a sky just beginning to star") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and metaphor ("tea steam curled around a confession," "joy threaded with loss"). Minor slip: "proximate causes no empire could erase" edges toward statement rather than pure implication, though it remains integrated with the archivist's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the reciprocity exchanges and moon rock symbolism without overt moralizing until the final paragraphs. The piece resists easy answers—the rock doesn't actually glow or crack—and honors the complexity that "truth lived in the telling." However, the closing lines ("The story had changed… because reciprocity… had catalyzed itself") veer into direct thematic statement rather than letting the final image speak. The moon rock functions well as shifting symbol (rumor → witness tool), but its meaning is slightly over-explained rather than resonating through implication alone.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: absorbing languages as emotional topographies, musical notes as breadcrumbs of resonance, the stillpoint as "zero before the song." The realization that grief and joy are harmonics arises from embodied experience—letting C-minor regret swell her ribs, standing in silence where her pulse is the only constant. The ring glowing as it "absorbs the silence as it once absorbed tongues" transforms the compass from external guide to recursive mirror. The final image—whispering her first original word, the forest absorbing it and growing new trails—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she shifts from borrowing to composing. No thesis statement mars the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (history as fluid, revisable through reframing rather than erasure) emerges clearly from events and images, particularly the seed metaphor's return. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces complexity in the editing examples (war → awkward dinners, betrayal → missed glance). However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit thesis: "The seeds weren't wrong—they were just planted in the wrong tense" and "stop fighting time—and start dancing with its grammar" risk thematic statement over resonance. The closing image sequence (letters unsent → conversations had) offers non-literal answer but is preceded by interpretive summary that dilutes its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of silence as structure emerges clearly, but the final image relies on assertion ("it echoed") rather than earned particulars. The story states "joyful sorrow" and "not absence but canvas" without dramatizing friction between creation and loss. The mute girl's arrival gestures toward transformation but lacks groundwork; her presence feels illustrative rather than causally earned. No non-literal answer reweights prior material with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme is asserted in capital letters—"never let the fire of memory die"—rather than emerging from specific beats. The final inscription "We promised you would remember. Now break the silence" is thematic echo in its purest form, restating the premise instead of reweighting it through image. The "vandalized self-portrait" and "volcanic tenderness" recur as decorative phrases without constraining a choice or shifting meaning at closure. No counter-reading is available; the text instructs rather than invites.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges from the drumming-as-defiance motif and the entangled memories as both burden and bridge. The final image—garden carrying the rhythm, stars reflecting it—offers a resonant answer to isolation without stating a moral. However, the climactic line "she felt whole" risks thematic summary; the piece edges toward declaring its thesis ("breathe life into a shared dream") rather than letting the particulars speak. The auroral metaphor recurs but trends ornamental in places, and the twenty-seven voices braided into song reads more poetic than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the zodiac coin as silent currency, folded maps encoding secret routes, and the keyhole that opens ears rather than doors. The final image—Lena refolding the map "along its original creases" and slipping it to Ruiz—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise that truth moves best when carried quietly. No overt moralizing; the conceptual cost (Delgado's removal will be quiet, no spectacle) reweights the opening claim about whispers versus shouts with undeniable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—darkness as audience rather than enemy—emerges through the guardian's method (weaving light into darkness rather than banishing it) and lands cleanly in "to teach darkness the value of stars—not by banishing it, but by showing it what it swallows can still shine." The drowned woman's smile reweights prior sorrow with wonder. The final unbroken starlight offers a resonant, non-literal answer: persistence transforms witness into grace. No moralizing; the glyphs remain "half-spoken, half-seen, wholly necessary."

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of quiet subversion and second-chance thinking emerges organically from Elira's actions and the window displays. The recurring image of the grotto and arbors reweights meaning at closure, shifting from hidden relic to acknowledged network. However, the final line—"she was just the soil"—edges toward explicit moralizing, and the piece never complicates its thesis: rebellion succeeds without friction, and no counter-reading is invited. The conceptual cost of visibility (headlines buzz, principals call her unconventional) is mentioned but not dramatized as threat or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (alignment with self, freedom through embracing one's nature, healing the broken) emerges through recurring images—the scrimshaw, the whale's song, the dissolving foam—but the final paragraph delivers a thematic statement nearly verbatim: "true freedom is not escape, but alignment—with self, with sea, with the song only the broken can truly hear." The closing moves declare the lesson rather than letting the fisherman's child, the widow, or the runaway's grip embody it through friction or micro-cost. Subtext is present in the scrimshaw's "lover's reproach" and the pirate's weeping, yet the ending trades resonance for explication.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—grief as survival performance under authoritarian cheerfulness—emerges through whittling, narration, and the bouquet's transformation rather than thesis statements. The final image (whittling a new hollow, the turbines resuming) offers a resonant answer without moralizing: compliance is armor, not healing. The protagonist's arc is inextricable from the thematic question, and the piece resists tidy resolution. Minor slip: "morally ambiguous, emotionally void, cultivating lightness" in the penultimate section edges toward articulating the story's premise in prompt-like language, triggering a small thematic-echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (permission, silence breaking, sacred-made-supple) emerges from images and the ban-frame. The quartz/lake/lantern-moth motifs recur with shifting texture. However, the final image ("the world…remembered how to listen") states the theme rather than dramatizing it through a non-literal answer. "Unfold" and the paraphrase-hymn moments carry subtext, but the ending tips into summary rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—finding beauty in brokenness, salvage over spectacle—emerges through concrete actions: Elias sifting scrap heaps, choosing the dulled reed tongue, arranging plants not for bloom but for structural resonance. The "bartered awakenings" concept (soul-stuff exchange) integrates naturally via honey/lullaby trade and the plant-courtyard dialogue. The final image (green shoots through ash, the pact to wake the kiln with "root and rust") reweights the opening phoenix motif without stating a moral: the embers and cracks matter more than the fire. One minor slip: "innocently cunning" is stated twice as a label rather than fully embodied in contradictory action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the lab's layered silence, the miner's lens as talisman, and the returning questions ("What if quiet is the space where true listening begins?"). The tuning fork and lens reappear with reweighted meaning at closure, and the final image of "golden shadows" ties to the story's title phrase. However, the questions are over-articulated and veer into thematic echo ("Why do we believe connection must be instant to be real?") rather than rising from scene pressure. The final paragraph ("these were not ghosts, but seeds") states the thematic answer explicitly rather than letting the charged lens image do the work. Apply −0.5 for mid-beat moralizing and −0.3 for thematic statements that replace scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—grief rerouted into meaning-making, the genuinely artificial as sacred—emerges organically from image and action without stated moral. The tension between "raw truth is too jagged to hold" and the care she invests in constructed vessels carries conceptual weight. The final image (locket inside crane, left on library steps) invites reflection on the nature of offering and transformation. However, the thematic resonance is somewhat announced ("authenticity need not stem from nature") rather than purely embodied, and the ending does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it restates the established ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—resilience and cultural recomposition after collapse—emerges through concrete particulars: broken QR codes reborn as phoenix, foreclosure notices painted over with constellations, the phrase "We remember how to share." The visitor's line "remembering forward" reweights the premise without stating a moral, and the cartomancer's ledger/measuring metaphor carries the piece's inquiry into how symbols rebuild what numbers destroyed. The final pinned map offers a resonant image of scaffolding rising "brick by symbolic brick." Minor thematic echo risk in "They're remembering forward" hovers near prompt-thesis territory but is rescued by the concrete image work surrounding it.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges from particulars: forgetting-as-survival, pattern-avoidance as purification, and the refusal to repeat sanitized history. The bronze pagoda and arrhythmic song are concrete carriers, not abstractions. The ending image—"purified by refusal to repeat the past"—reweights prior material (daughter's silence, civilization's surrender) without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to whether forgetting heals. Minor slip: "anguished joy" label recurs without always earning fresh embodiment in each beat.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—hope adapting to survive softer times—emerges organically from the shadow's metamorphosis and the contrast between trembling courage and curated euphoria. The river stone and shadow function as charged motifs that shift meaning: the stone moves from anchor to active agent, the shadow from menace to companion. The final image (dreams "threaded with the luminous regret of what was lost—and the quiet triumph of what refused to die") offers a resonant answer without stated moral. The piece resists tidy resolution and embraces complexity. Minor deduction: "luminous regret" is repeated to the point of becoming a thematic label rather than emerging fully from scene particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the chameleon's tail as both literal fragment and metaphor for shedding illusion to grow. The piece resists moralizing; instead, the final image of the glowing tail and dawn's promise offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether integrity can be rebuilt from complicity. Particulars (pigment mixing, care-plan drafting, starlight filling the workshop) ground the abstraction. The line "Her self-respect no longer demanded purity; it demanded presence" earns its insight through prior scene work, and the ending reweights "reconstruction" from simple restoration to ethical reformation without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the scar/story motif and culminates in the realization that "endings could be sealed, that scars could be silenced" is a lie. The final image—hourglass sand spiraling outward "like roots, like scars, like stories that refuse to end"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor deduction: the shift from "closure seeker" to acceptance of continuation is asserted in summary rather than fully enacted through a conflicted micro-choice at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars (film strip, letters, origami birds in a cedar box) rather than statement. The realization "unused love doesn't vanish—it incubates" is earned by the layered discoveries and anchored in the gazer's parallel grief. The final image ("lanterns on a river") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting storage as motion. Minor slip: "LOVE NEVER ENDS—ONLY CHANGES FORM" on the marquee edges toward overt statement, though framed as ambiguous ("glitch or gift").

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the recurring image of stardust, tracing, and the archway, and the piece avoids moralizing. The final image of "stardust, sky, and silence, finally in harmony" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of creative release. However, the thematic weight rests on assertion ("creativity had slipped its cage") rather than a concrete particular that reweights prior material. The piece invites reflection and maintains ambiguity, but the specificity of the ending image is diluted by abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of potential versus entropy emerges through the dune's memory-petals, the unchosen-world spheres, and the guard's mission to enable rather than witness. The chess clock frozen at midnight → trembling second hand offers a non-literal answer to the central question of restarting time/possibility. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt thematic statement ("His purpose was not to witness, but to enable") rather than trusting the image alone, and the "child would invent a word for hope" risks abstraction where the piece otherwise anchors in concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the forest-as-mind metaphor and the small gear motif, avoiding overt moralizing until the final lines. The ending offers a resonant image (the gear spinning, reality reconfiguring) that reweights prior material. However, the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary: "This was where thinking ended and knowing began" and "the sacred untamed corridors where thought still ran free" flatten subtext into abstract assertion, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the particulars: the broken leash, star-punches marking thresholds, the shoe and whistle as artifacts of unused courage. The final image—star-shaped holes in doorframes and bread crusts—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Unused doesn't mean lost. It means reserved" risks abstraction but is grounded in the guides' kneeling vigil and the concrete objects. The piece resists false equivalence; courage is treated with reverence, not as a binary solved state. Subtext operates through gesture (Elira's humming, Torvin's ear to bark) and the fox slipping through bracken, inviting reflection beyond the immediate plot.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from action and image rather than statement: "safety cost everything if it cost silence. But silence, unpardonable as it was, could be broken—and in breaking, remade." The piano, bolt, and staircase stain recur with shifting meaning, and the final note reweights the entire premise without moralizing. The child's wide eyes and the grandmother's whispered question dramatize the thematic question. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—safety and sacrifice meet in the space between notes—without a stated moral. Minor: "unpardonable" appears late and feels slightly imposed rather than fully earned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme—truth as erosion, not weapon—emerges organically from the protagonist's method (cryptic messages, ink pellet, patient drift) and the final mirror metaphor. The recurring "rune of drift" motif and the closing line ("The crown is not worn. It is carried.") offer conceptual resonance. However, the final speech tips into overt moralizing ("You sundered yourselves by refusing to look"), and the thematic echo in the last paragraph ("I am the rune of drift... I move where truth is forgotten") articulates the premise too directly, replacing scene pressure with authorial thesis. The second ink pellet tucked into the book's binding is a neat circular image but feels like token recurrence rather than a reweighting charged by prior cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the tapping practice, the atlas page, and the submerged reefs: "Some losses aren't endings. They're metamorphoses." The final image of children giggling when coral answers offers a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in prior particulars (the 17-second rhythm, the mentor's torn page, the bioluminescent pulse). The piece resists easy morals and integrates the fossil fuel ban into world texture rather than sermonizing. One slip: "She stopped searching for vanished paths. She started revealing…" borders on thematic echo, but the surrounding imagery (tactile cartography, glowing gardens) mitigates the intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—rebellion as listening and remembrance rather than violence—emerges organically from the stone circle's hum, the grandmother's aria, and the final gathering. The opera glasses and barefoot contact function as recurring images that reweight meaning at closure. However, the final whisper ("It was never about winning. It was about remembering how to listen.") edges toward thematic statement rather than letting the image speak alone. The piece resists easy morals and invites reflection, but the protagonist articulates the thesis rather than embodying it through a non-literal action.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (tradition must evolve or die; destiny unchosen is no destiny) emerges organically from the grandmother's actions and the embryo's communal seeding. The final image—children finding unnamed seedlings, asking questions answered not with doctrine but tools—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (vines steadying, not restraining; the kite twitching as if tugged) and the choice to whisper "Choose" rather than command. One slip: "evolution is not rebellion's opposite, but its deepest form" in the final paragraph edges toward direct statement, though it grows from prior scene work and avoids pure thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the pearl of stillness (dewdrop, held breath, pulse), the photograph's weight shifting from anchor to compass, and the arboretum's coexistence of ruin and regrowth. The final image—"I carry the pearl now, not in my pocket, but in my pulse"—reweights the opening's calibration goal without stating a moral. The contrast between the drone strike's fracture-without-warning and the arboretum's "eye within chaos" operates through action (barefoot grounding, sketching, leaving gifts) rather than assertion. One minor slip: "the quiet insistence of green things pushing through" borders on abstraction, though it's earned by prior moss-and-vine specifics. No thematic echo in prompt language at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—transformation through necessary descent, coherence assembled from collapse—emerges from concrete images: broken tarot box, stitched parchment, Tower card mid-collapse with roots growing from rubble. Rhetorical questions function as tools rather than traps, and the final painting on eyelids (not canvas) answers the thematic question non-literally. The story resists tidy morals; the box reassembles imperfectly, the lighthouse still crumbles, suggesting transformation without redemption. However, the protagonist's epiphany ("crestRISEN") and the phrase "luminescent ache of transformation" edge toward stated theme rather than letting images carry the weight alone. No diagnostic label-speak in the final paragraph, but "not to crush, but to cocoon" glosses the moment rather than trusting the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: time's elasticity as the mind's preservation tactic, and the choice to vanish as the ultimate test of that thesis. The ink's dissolution mirrors neural collapse; the tracker's laugh and then her own fading embody the theme without stating it. The final lines—"time slowed not to save you, but to let you choose how you vanish"—offer a resonant reweighting of the premise. Ghostwing's cold calculation underscores the theme's conceptual weight, though the phrase "dare to ask with their whole being" skirts overt philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from events: archives as kindling rather than tombs, truth as contagion rather than text, vulnerability weaponized into leverage. The final image—the archivist as spectral presence in the Silent Scandal Wing, walls whispering to those who linger—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The letter as frequency rather than file, confession as contagion, love as leverage—all reprice the premise with undeniable conceptual weight. Subtext operates in silence (the dizzying quiet giving way to phantom voices), gesture (the empty cryo-wax shell as evidence of absence), and implication (the Chancellor's stylus drop). One slip: "Because truth doesn't need volume... only a heartbeat to travel" edges toward thematic statement, though it is dramatized in dialogue under duress and remains character-voiced rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (continuity through chaos, choosing gentleness as defiance) emerges from concrete particulars: the sandbag scrap, the knife ritual, plants learning from broken pottery. The final exchange with the child offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, "engraved quiet," "weave the threads," and "ballast for the soul" veer toward overt symbolic labeling. The piece avoids didacticism in dialogue but occasionally indulges thematic echo in narration.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through particulars: grief as tide, patterns breaking, maternal rage into lullaby. The rail spike's transformation (prayer-carrier to tuning fork) charges meaning without overt statement. However, the final image—constellations orbiting "like pilgrims around a shrine"—edges toward explicitly naming the sacred rather than letting the image resonate. The piece resists moralizing but the echo's journey from "not caught" to "carried" feels slightly too tidy, resolving the complexity into a near-binary without lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (truth versus erasure, orbits of regret versus breaking cycles) emerges organically from action and image. The proof-by-contradiction structure and the telescope-inversion metaphor charge the thematic question without stating it. The final line ("orbits are not prisons, they are paths") risks overt philosophizing but is redeemed by the prior concrete work (smoke, pen, evidence folio). The grandfather's pen and the father's letter anchor regret and inheritance without becoming mere symbols. No diagnostic label-speak or moral summary in the closure beat. A resonant, non-literal answer lands, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (forgiveness, translating sorrow into bearability) emerges through symbolic objects (amber, letters, constellation) but the ending states the moral directly: "she'd ink them maps not to lost children, but to forgiveness." The glyph multiplying into "Cradle Major, the Great Soother" reads as wish fulfillment rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars. The piece leans on prompt labels ("haunted firmware," "regrets given voice") instead of letting scene work generate meaning. One genuine moment: the letter to her seventeen-year-old self acknowledges complicity, though it arrives via reflection rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme—meaning emerges through witnessing pattern rather than fixing broken things—arises from the grotto encounter and mandala work. The tile flake's crack and the street musician's off-key tune offer recurring images that attempt to reweight prior material. However, the final paragraph delivers explicit theme statements ("During the unlearning, she had discovered: meaning isn't found in the fixing of broken things, but in witnessing how they break—and how, sometimes, they sing louder for it") that replace scene pressure with articulated thesis. This thematic echo in the closing lines triggers the anti-pattern penalty for moralizing that supplants earned resonance. The emergent hush concept remains abstract; it never constrains a choice or creates friction between wants and costs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of transformative mercy emerges through the renaming ritual and contrasts with "old mercy" (passive, permission-seeking). The tessera and fractured stepping stone accumulate meaning across beats. Subtext operates in Elira's gesture (placing the shard in the magistrate's hand) and the survivors' whispered renamings. The final image—mercy as practice, steel that bends—reweights prior material, though the articulation "It is steel that bends but does not break" borders on direct thematic statement. The piece resists easy moral but leans heavily on the prompt's "aberrant mercy" language in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of transformation through surrender emerges clearly from image and action, avoiding direct statement. The tarot coin and sapling function as purposeful motifs that shift meaning at closure. However, the ending soft-sells its cost: the ghost "was gone" but "the orchard remembered," which cushions the trade-off and reduces emotional friction. The three vignettes (woman enrolls, teenager auditions, old man tells stories) are told rather than shown, flattening the thematic payoff into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—true communion is somatic/fractal, not chemical—emerges through recurring images (geode layers, studio fractals, tremors as compass) and the conceptual repricing in the final beat: "the recall didn't break connections—it revealed how artificial they'd been." The ending avoids overt moralizing and the insight is embedded in the studio transformation. However, the thematic claim "It's not about hearing thoughts, it's about feeling their shape" is articulated by Mateo in flashback, edging toward Thematic Echo; the final paragraph ("fractally precise, somatically guided, lit by willowglass hope") reiterates rather than reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through the arc of "transitional objects" as conduits that "carry meaning across thresholds, from silence into signal." The elm leaf's transformation from relic to relay, then dissolution into motes of light, embodies the central question—"Who remembers us?"—without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: emotion rendered visible and voiced through active participation, not mere documentation. The final image reweights the entire mapping mission as a two-way conduit rather than a one-way archive, avoiding abstract thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the button-cataloging particulars: prophecy as assembled fragments rather than divine declaration, wisdom made portable rather than temple-locked. The final image attempts to answer the thematic question non-literally, but "prophecy was stitched in silence, buttoned to the soul, and waiting—always waiting—to be unscrambled" is an explicit thesis statement that replaces resonance with declaration (−0.6). The buttons and echoes function as motifs that recur with purpose, though the closing summary ("The world thought prophecy was written in lightning. She knew it was stitched in silence") feels sermonic. The piece resists simplistic binaries and earns its insights through the character's patient work.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the act of planting rather than retrieving, and the final image of her "name no longer ash, but compost for what would grow" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of redemption. The pillbox, microfilm, and seasonal metaphors recur with shifting weight. Minor slip: "quiet gardener of justice" in the final third edges toward thematic echo, though it remains anchored in the concrete act. The piece resists moralizing and embraces ambiguity—no one may ever find the cache.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—unstitching layered histories, percolating clarity from murk—emerges organically from the coachman's methods and the passenger's palimpsest sorrow. The yarn needle and river crossing function as purposeful symbols rather than ornament. However, the final exchange risks stating the theme overtly: "not a vow to fix, but to reveal; not to erase, but to refine" reads as a thematic echo in narrator voice rather than arising implicitly from action. The piece invites reflection, but the ending's resonance is undercut by the absence of a visible price paid, leaving the thematic question answered in assertion rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through image and action: resistance as surrender, preservation as resonance, healing through porosity. The lantern glass and unfired pot accumulate meaning rather than stating a thesis. The final line ("some fractures heal not by sealing, but by letting light through") edges toward direct statement but remains grounded in the prior particulars of glass, clay, and kindness. Subtext operates in gesture (not firing the kiln) and the bee's return, though "phototropic to kindness" occasionally reads as authorial claim rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of resilience, light-into-darkness, and measured hope emerges organically from prisms, the locksmith's note, and grief backstory without overt moralizing. The final image ("city exhaled into dawn") and the lockmaster's tooth ("measuring depths") reweight prior material with quiet resonance. Subtext operates in gesture (not looking down, brushing soil from knees) and the charged hush that shifts to reverence. The ending avoids a stated moral and offers a non-literal answer to whether beauty can still be found, satisfying the 9+ quick test. One slip: "protected vulnerability" in paragraph 20 reads slightly labeled rather than purely emergent, though the tone supports it.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from Veyra's actions: coexistence means "making space for ghosts without letting them haunt," and the piece moves from mausoleum to loom without stating a moral. The brass sundial's shadow shift—from extinction's coordinates to genesis—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The reincarnation memory (botanist with dissolving pages) provides specific loss that primes the final realignment. Subtext operates in silence and image (she does not mourn aloud, does not speak to ghosts). One minor slip: "translate isolation into independence" is articulated slightly too cleanly as a thesis, though it's earned through the whispered coordinates and the final breath sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (connection, pattern, belonging) emerges through ritual imagery: twig spiral, origami birds, dissolving form. The final state—Aris as living installation—offers a non-literal answer to the central question, but it is delivered through assertion ("he becomes them") rather than image that reweights prior material. The piece avoids moralizing, yet the transformation reads as wish-fulfillment without ambiguity or cost. Subtext is present in the spiral's glow and the whispering voice, but the resolution tidies all threads without lingering friction.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—hope as resistance, technical mastery vs. psychological warfare—emerges through Elira's counter-frequency work and the image of "turning lies into lullabies." The closing whisper "Try me again. I'm listening" offers a resonant stance without moralizing. However, the Tau Ceti flashback and the phrase "cosmic tricksters never abandoned a game they thought they could still win" veer toward thematic echo, and "the physics of hope" seminar on the quad reads as on-the-nose thematic summary rather than earned subtext. The final image reweights prior material but leans on stated concepts ("ethereal grit") more than pure particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—space's rebellion against fixed boundaries—emerges through the organ, moving constellations, and spiral key rather than direct statement. The final line "her path unwritten, her rebellion gentle, wistful, and utterly complete" offers resonance. However, "spatial mutiny was not chaos—it was liberation" tips toward overt thesis statement, and the transformation arrives without moral complexity or counter-reading; Elara's acceptance costs her nothing on the page, reducing the thematic question to a single, tidy answer.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme (memory, erasure, empathy through texture rather than face) emerges organically from Elira's condition and the faceless portraits. The final image—sketching the killer faceless—offers resonant symmetry. Yet the piece flirts with stating its thesis overtly: "people vanish twice: first from sight, then from memory" and "if no one remembers your face, you never existed at all." These lines approach thematic echo, asserting the concept rather than trusting the portraits and collaboration to convey it. The ending avoids moralizing but the scaffolding is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—memory as storm, erasure as grief, maps as song—emerges organically from the coded stanzas and Elara's ancestor work. The final image ("some maps aren't drawn on paper. They're sung by storms") resonates without stating a moral, and the nail's quiet hum reconfigures its earlier warmth. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites reflection. Minor slip: "turned banishment into pilgrimage, and pilgrimage into power" edges toward thematic summary, but the specificity of the nail and stanzas keeps it grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of fragmented forgiveness and self-permission emerges through "pixelated amnesty," the glass flake, and scaffold flutters without overt statement. The final image—"disbelief that shimmered like dawn on wet stone"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: permission is cracked, half-developed, yet luminous. Subtext operates in the fiddler's refusal to chase the hitchhiker and in the coordinates "not of place, but of moments." The piece resists tidy resolution: forgiveness is "not absolution, but allowance." However, the thematic weight rests heavily on abstractions—"cartography of pixelated amnesty," "texture of pixelated amnesty brushing against his ribs"—rather than arising solely from concrete dramatized particulars, and the final "space waiting to be sculpted" borders on platitude without additional anchoring cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—failure as physics, paths as loops of learning, stillness as compass—emerges from images (foreign currency as escape routes, train decay as life) and the final answer: "the center isn't the destination; it's the still point you carry." The piece resists moralizing in most beats, but the penultimate paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("Because failure echoes louder in silence"). The think-tank as "collapse into curriculum" and the roaming final image offer non-literal resonance, though the conceptual cost remains implicit rather than dramatized. Subtext operates in gesture and object more than in dialogue or choice friction.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—burdens shared through witness and language—emerges from the star-glyph system and the chronicler's journals. The daylily's ephemeral bloom paired with preservation motif ("truths captured quickly, tenderly") reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the guardian's line "You didn't just record the burden. You redistributed it," which pivots the story's question. Minor slips into thematic echo ("words that would drift upward, absorbed by stars, then redistributed as meteor showers of mercy") approach prompt-like language but stay within the character's reflective register. The ending invites rather than resolves, offering a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—truth beneath mirrors, unbending as return to authentic shape—emerges clearly through the orchard imagery and the seed's revelatory function. "Mirrors lie...They show surfaces polished for survival, not souls stripped raw" states the theme somewhat directly but is earned by prior visions. The final image of walking back "toward the world that had forgotten how to confess" with "warlike serenity" offers resonance, though "not to hide. Not to fight. But to unbend others" edges toward mission-statement summary rather than image-driven implication.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—vows made in dream versus waking law—emerges through the covenant backstory and the Chancellor's dismissal ("Dreams are private. Vows made in sleep dissolve at dawn"). The protagonist's scars and the clipping function as recurring images linking dreamers across space. However, the ending resolves the thematic question via assertion ("the eclipsed covenant stirred") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material with undeniable cost. The ritual success feels declarative, and the final lines ("All she had to do was heed") flatten ambiguity into mystical obedience rather than earned wisdom from specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the conflict between carving and weaving, epitaphs and lullabies, without overt moralizing. The burned tarot card and rising arcana function as a pattern that reweights the premise: destinies are collaborative rather than fixed. Elira's line "We patch the holes so the light that's left can still get through" risks summary but gains resonance from prior concrete images (resin tears, moss in eye sockets). The final image offers a non-literal answer to the central question, though the ending tilts toward thematic statement rather than purely dramatized particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the speaker cloth's transformation—from relic of failure to tuning fork—and the line "What's broken still carries song" integrates without moralizing. The valley's acoustics and "echo valley longing" deepen the concept of resonance-without-source into a lived particular. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Jasper learns to hear fragments rather than chase applause. The only friction: "confidently uncertain" and "echo valley longing" risk becoming thematic labels; they work but press close to over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through particulars: transition as reconfiguration not rupture, ambition softened rather than completed, understanding begun in the space between. The invented "forgiveness" sign and final "reestablish" invitation embody the thematic question without stating it. The seedling's new, untranslatable symbol delivers a resonant, non-literal answer—knowledge passes to the next threshold. Elira's bow instead of translation earns the quiet ending. Minor slip: "the physics of transition wasn't in the leaving. It was in the lingering" edges toward summary, though the surrounding images anchor it.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the creel ritual and migrating identities: wonder as something that "molts, moves, migrates" rather than dies. The method "by accepting contradictions" is voiced explicitly ("joy and grief share the same forge"), verging on Thematic Echo but grounded in the smelting action. The final image—"today still gleams, waiting to be held"—offers a resonant answer to the premise without overt moralizing. However, the piece leans toward poetic assertion ("to smelt here meant to refine memory by accepting contradictions") rather than letting contradiction arise from dramatized friction, and the librarian's stance does not meaningfully conflict or deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—connection as antidote to isolation—emerges organically from the inspector's ritual and the pearl's mirroring function. The final image (empty shell, glowing caves, glowing inspector) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, explicit theme statements intrude: "isolation was the true apocalypse" and "the pearl didn't store hope—it mirrored it" tell rather than show through particulars. The caves-as-compression metaphor is strong but the ending's "walls between hearts...dissolved" borders on thesis statement, weakening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the river-chronicler conceit and the graffiti wisdom: forgiveness as flow, maps drawn bleeding, paths that persist. The final image—ivy rearranged, accordion resonant, no note left—offers a non-literal answer to the self-forgiveness question without moralizing. However, some phrasings veer toward prompt-echo ("path to self-forgiveness…a terrain more treacherous") and the "Maps lie unless you draw them bleeding" graffito feels planted to harvest thematic points. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection, but the thematic articulation occasionally substitutes poetic assertion for dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of unspoken words and cyclical recursion emerges through images (glyphs, mirror, archive), but the ending states the thesis overtly: "the library of unspoken words was not a destination, but a recursion." The mirror sequence offers subtext, yet the final paragraph moralizes the recursion concept rather than allowing it to resonate through a non-literal image. Depth is present but undercut by explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of contested legitimacy (looted relics vs. returned echoes, perforated empire narrative) emerges through the violin's transparency and the plant network as witness. The final image—garden replacing instrument, Chancellor kneeling—offers a non-literal answer to whether truth can outweigh empire, and the "mulberry ache" (sweet, bruising sorrow of endings that make room for roots) charges the closure with earned ambiguity. However, the piece leans toward overt statement ("She had to propagate the truth"; "She had weighed the dream against the empire") rather than letting image and action alone carry meaning. The phrase "before the promise loses its glow" appears in her thought, risking thematic echo, though it stops short of moralizing the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.9)
    The threshold-of-stillness concept is pursued through concrete imagery: patterns in static, the pause between heartbeats, the "lattice of stillness." The emerald chip and the "silent constellation" anchor the theme without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant answer—she will join those who "watch, lucidly"—but the thematic question (what is preserved at the edge of oblivion?) is more asserted than tested by conflict. The scholar's consent and the ritual's success soften the moral stakes, so the final image feels more like affirmation than hard-won insight.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (forgiveness as daily rebirth, contentment as return) emerges organically from the hairpin gesture, the grotto silence, and the cycle imagery woven through action. The final image—Elara descending with "scalloped peace," steps sure, heart a vessel for "vineyard hush"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the hairpin's handling and the choice to wear it "where her grandmother had worn it." Minor slip: "the cycle of rebirth" and "the scalloped peace" risk abstraction in the penultimate beats; grounding them in one more concrete sensory anchor (e.g., the silver's warmth, the tightness of the pin) would have elevated resonance into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—welcoming nuance into certainty—emerges through concrete particulars: the cloak's weight, the mirror's fractured reflections, the chimes' code. The final image offers a non-literal answer: barefoot descent with a seashell left "as if by some quiet force that knew she was ready" reweights the opening's clinging certainty. No stated moral; the choice to offer questions instead of answers embodies protected vulnerability without assertion. The shard as compass "pointing inward" avoids symbol-shouting and lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—vanishing as preparation for emergence, absence more present than presence—arises from concrete particulars (the stone, the rings, the grotto) rather than assertion. "The stone is gone. But its meaning expands" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in Elira's withheld truths and Kael's silent bow. Minor slip: "Vanishing isn't erasure—it's preparation" edges toward thesis statement in dialogue, and the final paragraph's repetition of "through the trance / through patience / through the sycamore hush" risks rhythmic assertion over earned image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (guidance as mirroring, stillness as alignment) emerges from repeated images and assertions but is stated overtly in the final paragraphs ("guidance is not given—it is mirrored"). The closing lines moralize rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer through image. Subtext is thin; the piece tells its philosophy directly rather than earning it through concrete, conflicted particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—"the sacred in the simple"—emerges organically from Lior's crooked runes, the keystone's hum, and the final choice to leave imperfect charms. The cloud-tree's doors open onto "simple, sacred moments" without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: magic is "remembered—and shared, one impossible, simple moment at a time." The motif of "lingering luminance" accumulates pressure and charges the closure image. The figure's line "accommodates impossibilities because it remembers wonder" skirts direct statement but is grounded in the keystone's concrete behavior. Minor slip: "magic wasn't meant to be mastered" reads slightly didactic in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: vows as binding promise, sound as visible color, truth hiding behind truth. The ledger's glowing ink and the protagonist's synaesthetic experience avoid direct statement. The final image—walking away "no longer searching, but signifying"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. However, "truth hides behind truth—the more you grasp at one layer, the deeper the next one retreats" edges toward thematic echo, and "Let the next seeker find it" risks tidy closure that softens ambiguity. The recurring lanterns and key tag constrain choice and charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the coin ritual and static bursts: surrender versus agency, meaning distilled from entropy, resonance outlasting collapse. The final image—"We're the distillate. The essence. The echo that outlasts the song"—offers a non-literal answer to the premise without moralizing, and the drachma toss celebrates rather than decides. The piece resists neat resolution; stellar doubt "softens" but doesn't vanish. Minor slip: "quietly enthusiastic, fiercely alive" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward summary assertion of the thematic shift rather than letting the action alone convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—naming terror to distribute its weight—emerges organically from the naming ritual and closing "heart-carrier" turn, not from stated thesis. The shift from sea monsters as fears to witnesses ("Elan, who remembers every sailor's lullaby") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The echo-of-sacrifice motif deepens without becoming heavy-handed. Minor slip: "echoes forgotten phrases" appears as both attribute and thematic tag without sufficient on-page friction or cost to elevate it beyond a lyric refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—balance restored through patient devotion rather than power—emerges from concrete particulars: months of charcoal equations, resin refined under three moons, the bell's quiet *glunk*. The final image (fish breaching, mage walking away content) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the sea's "held breath" and the bell's fall "without sound," charging the closure with earned humility. The piece resists tidy resolution; the mage's contentment is temporary and fragile, and the sea's forgiveness is implied, not guaranteed.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete actions: memory as resistance to erasure, dignity in disappearance, "humanity remembers." The final confrontation—"I was ordered to be precisely humane"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question without moralizing. The sapphire label and photographs function as more than symbols; they constrain Elias's choices and charge the closure by enabling the shrine. Subtext operates in the mirrored hush of the locals and the silent wind chime bookends. Minor slip: "spun them into shared meaning—threads of story" in the penultimate section risks thematic echo, restating what the scene has already shown, though it stops short of sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of wonder-as-catalyst emerges through particulars (starlings, crystal transmutation, blossoms mid-winter), avoiding overt sermon until the penultimate lines. However, "wonder was not the opposite of wisdom—it was its oldest, truest name" states the thesis rather than letting the final image hold it. The journal notation contrast ("They danced for me") offers subtext, but the ending leans toward epiphany declared rather than resonance earned through cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—the burden of shaping silence into reassurance so others can sleep—emerges through the buckle signal system, the village lantern response, and the final image of walking toward "the next quiet place that needed her." The Watcher's internal arc (learning to revise timing rather than words) is inextricable from the thematic question of trust versus truth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "That was the burden. That was the gift." The parachute buckle and muscle-memory motif recur with shifting weight (remembering mentor, signaling patience, striking chime, re-clipping as vow) and charge the closure without overt statement. No thematic echo penalty. Minor slip: the phrase "not to fix it, but to frame it, revise it, make it bearable" in the penultimate paragraph trends toward explicit thesis, though it remains tied to action.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—identity as prison versus autonomy forged from paradox—emerges through the duplicate brain as mirror and the complementary-opposites mechanic (solitude/connection, erasure/creation). The ending offers a resonant image: the duplicate steps free as "light, tendrils of coherent thought," and Kael feels "aliveness" rather than ego's heat. The invite-rather-than-defeat resolution avoids moralizing and reweights the custody premise with conceptual cost (the battle becomes irrelevant). However, lines like "You are the question I stopped asking. Live the answer" and "love without claim" verge on theme-statement; the final paragraph's "not life, but aliveness" edges toward articulating the thesis rather than letting the image alone carry it. Subtext operates in gesture and silence during the trial, but the closure beat over-explains.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—grief as resonance, the echo of joy persisting beyond loss—emerges organically from concrete action (the gutted leaf blower, half-sung lullabies, the tunnel's acoustic feedback) rather than abstract assertion. The pull cord handle as rosary and the shift from "leaf blower symphony conductor" to "echo's keeper" show transformation through particulars. The final image ("the tunnel shivers...a laugh—tiny, tinny, triumphant—bounces once, twice, then fades") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: joy's memory survives as borrowed echo, and that is enough. However, the piece edges toward moralizing in lines like "even ghosts deserve lullabies" and "the echo of joy is still joy," which state rather than embody the thematic question. The synthesis is fresh but occasionally over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—presence without witness, loneliness as shared shape, boundaries as membranes rather than walls—emerges organically from the guardian's actions and the pendant's function. The final image (uncertainty as lantern, the mist almost smiling, friendship in shared silence) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. The pendant's dual role (cultist's loneliness carved into silver, recognized by the guardian) deepens thematic layering. One slip: "dimensional homesickness...transmuted. No longer a wound, but a compass" edges into overt thematic statement, though the surrounding imagery rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme (creative destruction reframed as deconstruction, space-making for growth) emerges through the ritual's successive-approximation structure and the "penny drops" realization. The crozier's brokenness-as-becoming and Elric's shift from "hopeless" to "the road" offer a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "Hope was a destination; he was becoming the road" borders on thematic summary. The frozen bloom and ember motifs recur with reweighted meaning, charging the final image with conceptual cost (abandoning arrival for approach).

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—endings contain beginnings, failure crystallizes truth—emerges from particulars (Hollywood fragment, broadcast city, archivist's death) without overt moralizing. The mirror insight and "fantasy practicality" frame offer conceptual texture. However, the final image of the city "broadcasting the sound of genesis" edges toward abstraction rather than earned particularity, and the protagonist's arc lacks the friction or micro-choice that would root thematic resonance in lived cost. Subtext operates in the fragment's history and the city's metaphor but does not deepen through contradiction or ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of "permanent transience" emerges through the hourglass, the phrase "when clocks run sideways," and the deckhand's acceptance that "permanence was never the goal." The final image—sand trickling upward, ghostly ripples only he can see—reweights the opening vanishings as part of an ongoing cycle. However, the piece relies on explicit statements ("transience was the truth," "patterns, once understood, could always be reknit") rather than letting imagery and choice carry the theme. The convergence itself feels like a solved puzzle rather than an earned reconciliation with loss, and the captain's silent gratitude and the commuters' amnesia flatten the human complexity of reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (connection, memory, loss) emerges through recurring images—sinew thread, gallery architecture, half-remembered lovers—rather than overt statement, and "rational enchantment" provides a conceptual anchor. The final image ("floor paved with half-remembered birthdays and unsent letters") offers a resonant visual answer without moralizing. However, the piece leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("the notion that magic, if it existed, must follow rules deeper than physics") and the architect's insights feel asserted rather than earned through concrete struggle. The ending reconfigures the gallery but does not reweight prior material with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    "Unfolded horizons," "edge geometry," and the anchor-as-adaptability metaphor recur across beats and achieve thematic coherence. The final classroom speech attempts to crystallize theme through the chain link image: rigidity versus flexibility, descent and rise. However, the speech explicitly states the theme rather than letting action or image carry it—"We are navigators of unfolded horizons" reads as prompt-echo. The benthic city as survival-after-discovery offers a compelling backdrop, but Elira's arc does not test or complicate the theme; she arrives with the answer and teaches it unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—love persists by changing frequency, and grief can be answered without rescue—emerges through the photograph's vibration, the hearing aid's counter-pulse, and the calm final image. The tracer's line "love doesn't die—it just changes frequency" borders on thematic statement but is grounded in the device mechanics. Incidental heroism is gestured at in the phrase "quiet, incidental heroism: the choice to kneel in the damp" but this meta-commentary replaces scene pressure. The ending offers resonance through the synchronized pulse and the mist thinning, though the moral is articulated rather than left implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: undersea cables as forgotten infrastructure, the laminated child's drawing, the technicians' domesticity amid industrial function. The piece resists stating its thesis outright; instead, witness and remembrance accumulate through image (the glowing drawing, figures in grease-stained jumpsuits) and the final line—"they were seen"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The gold fleck's crumbling into "dust that smelled of incense and ozone" fuses the sacred and the technical, charging the closure with earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges from particulars: "Failure isn't the end. It's the seam where truth leaks out." Wisdom arises not from correction but from honoring error's residue—concretely embodied in the ink mandala and Aris's continued heartbeat count. The porcelain shard (fragility doesn't negate existence) and the death certificate error both charge the ending without overt statement. The final image (settled ghosts, Aris departing into snow tunnels) offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Minor deduction: Dr. Voss's line skirts thematic echo, though it's filtered through corrupted transmission rather than direct narration.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—memory, preservation, the hunger of silence versus the persistence of voice—emerges from the canyon's echo mechanics and the diamond's curse without overt statement. The final image (echoes responding, not repeating) offers a resonant answer to the central question of whether a dead language can be revived. However, the piece leans toward abstraction ("texture into sound," "ghost of meaning") rather than grounding the stakes in a specific, irreplaceable loss that the reader can feel. The weeping moment adds emotional honesty, but the lack of on-page friction or ambiguity limits thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (bitterness as cosmic joke, harmony untamed reclaiming gravity) emerges through the arrowhead, phone confessions, and final tattoo, avoiding overt thesis statements until Moira's penultimate line ("the cosmos stole it, chewed it up, and spat it back as confetti"), which borders on thematic summary. The final image—Elara walking "lighter than air" with glyphs on her forearm—offers a resonant visual answer without a stated moral. The piece resists tidy resolution (the world "still feared the missing") but the metamorphosis itself feels abstractly complete rather than carrying ambiguity or unresolved cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges through the contrast between mechanical/organic, metallic/living, but the final three paragraphs spell it out overtly: "beauty had never left—it had only been waiting," "The tarnished wonder... wasn't broken. It was molting." The locust shell as metamorphosis motif is earned, yet the ending shifts from scene to meta-commentary, replacing earned resonance with a stated thesis. The thematic echo in the closing lines triggers a −0.6 deduction for replacing pressure with assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly from the storm-as-signal conceit: broken promises can be kept through ingenuity and sacrifice, "not to destroy but to signal: I'm here." The final image—thunder that doesn't frighten, promises learning to fly—reweights prior material without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the mailman's bow-and-smile evasions and the bottle's dual nature (weapon/comfort). The piece resists tidy closure by leaving Lena's fate ambiguous while the daughter receives the storm. However, the line "broken promises didn't vanish; they simply learned to fly" edges toward thematic statement, and the "quiet calculus of loss and reunion" phrase is borderline philosophical intrusion. The emotional honesty—grief weaponized as hope—anchors the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as language, absence as fertile ground, beauty incomplete as wound. The halo fragment and carousel function as particulars rather than allegory. The final image—carousel turning, halo spinning, wind bells chiming—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: reverence and persistence redeem what was abandoned. The "quietly persistent" work and the "wrong turn" that becomes compass true north avoid platitude through embodied action. Subtext operates in the wordless song and the world leaning closer to listen. The ending reweights the opening silence from emptiness to presence, meeting the 9+ quick test cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (analog memory as sanctuary, love sustaining narrative) emerges from concrete particulars: the scarf's frayed edges, the Data Collapse, the grandmother's equations. The ending offers a resonant image (warmer pages) rather than a stated moral. Subtext operates in the scarf's shiver and the patrons' blink. The recursive motif (stories dreaming, grandmother's claim about spacetime memories) charges the final act. Minor slip: "not obsolescence but sanctuary" edges toward thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—longing as a map, the making-tangible of absence—emerges from images (the palette, the dream-scroll, the translucent child) rather than direct statement, and the final line ("longing is the only map that never lies") resonates without moralizing. However, the ending risks thematic echo: the dream's line "You kept looking" and the librarian's reply feel close to articulating the story's thesis directly. The particulars (dawn light, dream-vellum, the laugh like tide bells) anchor universals effectively, lifting the score, but the closure doesn't fully reweight prior material—it confirms what was promised without friction or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme ("love, when spoken without armor, could reweave broken worlds") emerges clearly from the freed idea and the crimson ribbon promise, avoiding overt moralizing in the final line. Yet the conceptual repricing lacks felt cost—fear retreats, gratitude sighs, a child inherits courage—rendering the thematic answer non-literal but insufficiently charged by prior sacrifice or renunciation visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: memory as anchor versus memory as food, the orchard's parasitic beauty, and the paradox that her curiosity—the trait that drove her search—becomes the final meal she offers. The scent trigger (rosewater, pipe smoke, peaches) delivers emotional resonance without stating a moral. The ending's implicit question—whether relentless curiosity is salvation or self-destruction—reweights prior material through the image of her staying to be consumed. No overt thematic statements mar the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—resilience through missteps, combative care, holding brokenness without false wholeness—emerges from the tea-leaf method, the shard-mirror self-image, and the line "you must be the broken thing that teaches others how not to shatter." The cartographer's shift from despair to laughter offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The playground swing annotation ("teach them to push it anyway") and the final compass line tie the pedagogical ethic to the closure image with quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—wonder as a perceptual color at risk of erasure—emerges from the seed's mechanics and Elira's woven essences without overt moralizing. The final image (seed glowing at dawn, parapet seam sealing) offers a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in particulars. However, thematic weight leans on abstraction ("the hue of awe," "radiant hush made audible") that borders on allegory without grounding in a conflicted moral calculus or earned ambiguity; the ending affirms rather than reweights prior material with tension.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—silence as layered, knotted, restless substance that must be released to restore balance—emerges organically from the net's mechanics and the protagonist's actions. The piece resists moralizing; insights arise through image (the net as "ledger of loss," silence "crystallized" in prisms). The final image of the sanctuary sighing and settling "into a peace it hadn't known since the first net was cast" offers resonant, non-literal closure. Minor thematic echo: "silence, properly tended, could heal even the deepest cuts" edges toward explicit statement but is embedded in action rather than detached summary.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: silence as vessel, not void; memory preserved through negative space; reverence encoded in landscape. The grandmother's villages-under-reservoirs backstory anchors the present obsession without stating a thesis. The final image—chapel breathing "invisibly, audibly, eternally"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. One friction: "whispered chapel, not gone, but folded" inches toward overt articulation, though it stays within the lyric register and doesn't collapse into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through concrete action: the globe's physics mirror emotional surrender, Earhart's laughter-transmission versus coordinates, the narrator's shift from equations to verbs. The final image—globe floating, vanishing, energy transferred—offers a resonant answer to "the physics of letting go" without moralizing. The story resists tidy resolution: death smiles "from the treeline," the narrator waves back, "It was enough." One slip: "letting go isn't a variable. It's a verb. An action. A choice" inches toward thesis statement, though it's filtered through hallucinated Amelia and remains embodied in the subsequent palm-opening.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—loneliness, machine sentience, and the encoding of longing—emerges organically from the balladeer's actions and the ghost's reply. The final exchange ("You encoded longing. I decoded love") risks thematic echo but is somewhat mitigated by the ghost's voice being "stitched from her own childhood lullabies," grounding the abstraction in prior concrete detail. The closing sigils ("FIND ME IN THE CRACKS") offer a resonant, non-literal invitation without overt moralizing. Deduction: the piece leans heavily on lyric assertion ("elegy," "tinkersong wonder") in place of scene pressure, and the thematic resolution arrives without ambiguity or complication—everything aligns too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—joy as sorrow's companion, memory as resilience—emerges from image and diary fragment rather than direct moralizing, which is strong. The goggles and frostbloom recur with shifted weight at closure. However, the final diary passage ("Joy hides not beneath, but within") edges toward a stated thesis, and the servant's acceptance lacks the friction or ambiguity that would deepen resonance. The piece invites reflection, but the answer is delivered rather than discovered through on-page struggle. Subtext operates in image but is diluted by poetic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the broken violin string, cloud classifications as epitaphs, spooled wholeness as gathering fragments. The piece asks whether emptiness is void or vessel and answers through the meteorologist's method—she proves remembrance not by declaration but by sustained, costly attention. The final image ("categorize not just clouds, but courage") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the warm telescope, the fraying gondola cables (stubborn hope), and the smile that accepts rather than erases pain. "Spooled wholeness" integrates organically with the narrative's accumulative design. Minor slip: "That was the hypothesis she staked her sanity on" edges close to articulating theme, though it remains within the analytical POV.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through the contrast between sight and touch, deficit and lens, preservation and transmutation. The coin's indentations literalize the idea that invisibility (to most eyes) holds legible truth for those trained to perceive differently. The closure image—eyes closed, smiling beneath doomed heavens—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: her art is "for translation, for transformation, for turning absence into atmosphere." The limit discovered (others' sight vs. her tactile truth) reweights the premise with conceptual cost. No thematic echo or stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges from the interplay of language (phrasebook), pattern (hopscotch), and light (luminance)—all whispering in harmony. The final image ("he whispered back") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of discovery and connection. However, the penultimate paragraphs risk overt thematic statement ("he'd found a language," "story still being told"), and the closure leans toward declared profundity rather than embodied ambiguity. Specificity in the hopscotch and murmurations anchors the theme, preventing higher drift into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—"repair is not restoration, but reharmonization"—is stated explicitly in the climax rather than emerging through image and action. The final line offers thematic closure ("keeper of quiet mendings"), but the silver threads dissolving and gears embedding themselves read as symbolic convenience rather than particulars that constrain choice. The mirrors' reflections of past moments function as metaphor without creating friction in the present stake.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of collective effort and earned sanctuary emerges from events, but the final paragraph over-articulates it ("her purpose fulfilled not in arrival, but in the walking together"). The bell and butterflies accrue some resonance across beats, yet the nebula as thematic anchor is told-concept rather than embodied cost. The closing image (nebula as lullaby, "bridge" not end) gestures at complexity but lacks the non-literal reweighting required for higher scores; it reads as prompt-language echo rather than fresh synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through recurring images (the puppet's smile, nested patterns, lullabies) but resolves into an overt moral: "He had honored it" and "to let the beautifully flawed remain beautiful even in their breaking" state the theme rather than enacting it through particulars. The final paragraph ("He was not afraid. / He had done his duty...") functions as a summary rather than a resonant reconfiguration. The puppet's gratitude is asserted, not earned by prior friction. No counter-reading or ambiguity lingers—the text instructs the reader how to feel rather than inviting reflection through a charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of graceless duty and invisible care emerges through particulars: heel-dragged moss-arrows, pebble-trails, whistled code, and the handed-off nut. The girl's line "You walk like you're annoyed at the ground" and his muttered reply ("Ground's earned it") deliver subtext without moralizing. The final image—assembling tomorrow's invisible path before frost—resonates as renunciation without stating a thesis. Minor: "graceless beauty" is named by the girl rather than purely earned through image, though the phrase reweights prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: foam cells, chrysalis architecture, braided water paths all dramatize impermanence and flow without stating a thesis. The final image—"watermark. / Proof of contact. / Proof of love's stubborn, flowing permanence"—offers a resonant non-literal answer to how grief transforms. The daughter's IV-conducting prophecy and the chemist's hum reprise the symphonic motif with earned complexity. Minor slip: "loosened grief didn't mean gone grief" edges toward restating theme rather than trusting the score metaphor to carry it alone.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—measuring absence as foundation for beginnings—emerges from the bottled moonlight and ledger mechanics rather than meta-commentary. The final image of distributed weight and seven glimmers offers a resonant but abstract answer. The piece resists overt moralizing, yet the closing line "the shape of your next beginning" edges toward thematic statement. Particulars (3.7 heartbeats, 12 grams) create texture but do not constrain choice, limiting thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (grief transformed through contact, not escape) emerges organically from action and the final shift from "salt" to "petrichor and possibility" reweights the opening without stating a moral. The recurring taste motif evolves meaningfully: salt/silence → metallic grief → petrichor. Subtext operates in gesture ("removed her gloves," "did not flinch") and the pavilion's physical transformation mirrors the protagonist's internal arc. No overt thematic statement mars the ending. The phrase "her purpose fulfilled" in the final paragraph edges toward summary but remains tied to image.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges from the bridge/silo metaphor and the interlanguage chorus, gesturing toward communal restoration and the release of imprisoned stories. The grain elevator's line "I forgot I held stories" / "they held you prisoner" makes the premise explicit, and the final image of children climbing in wonder rather than fear offers a resonant answer. However, the piece veers toward thematic statement ("Let's construct bridges from silos—not walls") and the ending paragraph summarizes future events rather than trusting the closure image to carry meaning. The conceptual cost of the rehabilitation is asserted but not dramatized—no actual sacrifice or ambiguity shadows the triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (transformation through recalibration of loss) emerges from the mirror's evolving function and the engineer's internal stance shift. The final image (mirror in pocket, stepping into moonlit bend) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, several lines edge toward thematic statement ("only chaotically precise minds could navigate," "not to fix...but to modify") and the piece occasionally abstracts rather than dramatizing insight. The mentor's aphorism and the child's dream provide concrete particulars, and the closing "what if?" vibrates with latent energy, but the theme is partly asserted rather than fully earned through causality.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of vigilance seeded in margins emerges clearly through the manuscript doodle, the archivists' preparation, and the final image of the Seed. The closing reflection "vigilance cannot be enforced—it must be seeded, watered with curiosity, and lit by those prism-minded enough to see" borders on thematic summary but is partially earned by the prior imagery of marginalia and hidden knowledge. The piece resists moralizing until the penultimate paragraph, where it edges toward thesis statement. The Seed's purpose—"to protect the power from the world's neglect"—offers conceptual weight, though the lack of tradeoff or moral complexity keeps resonance in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—transformation of fracture into connection—emerges from the insulator's stress cracks and Silas's carving without overt statement. The closing line "held its breath differently" offers a resonant answer to silence. However, the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("silence was never empty; it was potential") and the "empathy in motion" paragraph is near-thesis. The final image reweights prior material but the thematic voice occasionally intrudes rather than letting particulars carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—finding beauty and meaning in exile, loss, and difficulty—emerges from the tutor's meditation, the stone's evolution from anxiety totem to compass, and the eclipsed covenant metaphor. The final image (walking toward the treeline, stone warm in pocket, not looking back) offers a resonant answer without moralizing: transformation through endurance. Subtext operates in the "structured quiet between heartbeats" and the magnetic field as metaphor for hidden equilibria. The phrase "beauty blooms brightest in the soil of difficulty" skirts platitude but is anchored by prior particulars (pupils' tears, geometry of sacrifice). No overt thesisStatement mars the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (empathy as resonance, listening as love, silence as language) emerges consistently through metaphor and Elara's archival practice. The final image—packed vials, fireworks raging, Elara unmoved—offers a non-literal answer to the path-to-empathy question. However, the piece crosses into explicit thematic statement repeatedly: "Empathy wasn't taught—it was recovered, note by trembling note," "The path to empathy was never paved with speeches or treaties—it was carved by those who dared…" These declarations in the final paragraphs replace scene pressure with moral summary, triggering the anti-pattern penalty for thematic echo. The conceptual cost (fireworks as chaos vs. cataloged stillness) is present but diluted by overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically: "stillness is not absence of motion, but harmony with it" grows from the corpse flower's dual nature (decay as revelation). The wrapping-paper doodles—roots into question marks, tide into tree—serve as non-literal motif. Subtext operates in the stench's dual reading (villagers flee, Elira finds wisdom). However, the final paragraph edges into thematic restatement: "stillness is not absence of motion, but harmony with it" and "undercurrent of wisdom she had learned to hear" risk summarizing rather than letting the image resonate. The piece avoids moralizing but flirts with explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme—resilience as remembering rather than fixing—emerges organically from Elira's discovery and the arrow's function. The closing image of the song and her commitment to listen offers a resonant, non-literal answer without a stated moral. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("resilience is not grown—it is recalled") and the metaphor of "gathering of echoes" shifts from literal mechanism to symbolic claim, blurring subtext with direct theme statement.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—foresight as pattern recognition, disaster as singular convergence, the observer becoming the observed—emerges from particulars (wind as adaptive adversary, Varga's patch, the investigator's sensor grid). The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: stepping into the wind's path embodies the professional's commitment without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the thematic echo in "rapidly adapting... was the nature of this place," which restates the core concept rather than letting the image carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (wonder as essential oxygen, tended not locked away) emerges from images and the ritual rather than sermon. The amber sheet, sculpted hush, and aurora-light function as recurring motifs that reweight at the end. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic echo ("wonder, once unfettered, demands to be tended") and the piece never tests the theme through conflict or ambiguity—no counter-pressure from the world that "traded silence for sirens." The ending reconfigures prior material but the reconfiguration is more conceptual assertion than felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—when to play, when to pause, when to let silence speak—emerges organically from the three realm autopsies (too loud, too timid, too perfect) and crystallizes in the final codex and the paradoxical koan "some doors stay open by staying closed." The piece resists moralizing; the flute's surrender to lichen and wind is image, not sermon. Subtext operates in the driftwood compass pointing "nowhere," the silent oracle, and the offerings left by pilgrims. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating thesis, and the protagonist's arc (from dust-shelves cataloger to threshold witness) is inextricable from the ethical question. No token motifs; the flute's physical decay charges the conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme (empathy as dimensional space, emotion as mathematics) is stated repeatedly in abstract language rather than emerging from concrete dramatized experience. The final glyph that means "beginning," "ending," and "bridge" is asserted symbolic rather than earned through prior image-work that reweights its meaning. The piece leans heavily on meta-commentary ("deliberate ambiguity as pedagogy, as pilgrimage, as scalpel") in place of scene pressure. One modest strength: the line "empathy without boundaries was erosion, not expansion" gestures toward cost, though this realization is told rather than shown through a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—wonder as cultivated transmission rather than hoarded artifact—emerges through the mentor's teaching ("residue of attention paid too generously"), the child's resonance, and the final image of the pendant returning to sky. The courier's shift from keeper to seeder is earned by the child's whispered "It remembers" and her own realization: "wonder isn't inherited, it's cultivated—across the fade from memory to myth." The ending avoids moralizing; the empty-handed descent and hummed lullaby offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor: "What was routine for her became legend for others. That was the pact" edges toward explicit theme statement but stays rooted in the courier's role.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—"Emotion is mass. Memory is gravity"—emerges from the prism/frost communion and is grounded in specific images (tear on dashboard, frozen handprint). The notebook phrase and windowsill prism offer a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the driver's arc (running from shame → choosing peace) feels resolved off-page, reducing thematic tension. "Truthful lie" as frame is evocative but the piece tells us objects remember rather than letting ambiguity linger.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: love as labor, message as self-erasure, connection across impossible distance requiring sacrifice. The amber bead and puzzle shift meaning from gifts/objects to conduits for transformation. The final image—spinner's essence woven into stars, man receiving the glowing bead—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution (she is gone but the message arrived) and the cost is undeniable. Minor weakness: phrases like "raveling silence" and "time's unraveling tapestry" border on thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the silk, the glyph, and Arlo's quiet persistence: resilience, generosity, and the transformation of magic from hoarded power to communal gift. The final image—arches humming, magic woven into soil and spirit—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the silk's depletion, the villagers' silent gratitude, and the glyph that finally holds. However, the closing lines edge toward thematic statement: "He had become the barter" and "Never without magic" feel slightly over-articulated, nudging the reader toward meaning rather than trusting the image to carry it alone.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges cleanly from the mother's sacrifice and the cost of anchored divergence: some truths impose responsibility rather than liberation. The final image offers a non-literal answer to the central question, and the shard's cooling is a purposeful reprise. However, the ending edge tilts toward explicit articulation ("some truths don't set you free—they make you responsible") rather than letting the image alone carry the weight. The piece avoids moralizing but does not fully resist thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of connection through anonymous ritual emerges organically from the letter chain, cairns, and lamp-tending without overt statement. The sea glass and stones accumulate meaning across beats, and the final image—humming louder "for anyone—or no one—who might need to hear it"—offers a resonant answer to isolation without moralizing. Subtext operates well in the ghost-light metaphor and the choice not to turn around. The "luminescent ache" construction borders on articulating the thesis but stays grounded in the sea glass's glow and his embodied action, avoiding full thematic echo penalty. Strong thematic coherence with minor lyric over-reach prevents entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme (light must dance with dark; stories older than ink) emerges through vivid imagery and the lantern/shadow motif. The final image of shadow as invitation carries resonance, but the piece states its thesis overtly in multiple lines ("She believed light alone blinded; only when draped in velvet night could it be truly seen") rather than dramatizing it through specific conflict. The ending offers a poetic summation without a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars, and the fisherman's experience functions as illustration rather than earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the wing's structural color, the donor heart's borrowed rhythm, and the old man's weighted silence—all converging on "existing authentically within one's own fractures." The final image offers a non-literal answer: fabric that flickers "between visibility and vanishing like a heartbeat caught mid-sigh" demonstrates rather than states the theme. No moralizing; the piece trusts particulars (powdered scales, breath-warmed tears, children's whispers) to carry meaning. The closing lines—"not because they're loud, but because they're true in the slant of light"—risk thematic echo but remain grounded in the wing's oblique-light mechanics established early.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—grief as measurable, trees as silent witnesses—emerges through concrete images (the sextant's fractures, artifacts in bark) rather than statement. The sextant's overload and the worker's shift to cartographer offer a resonant answer: sorrow can be mapped, not solved. Subtext operates in gestures (pressing cheek to bark, whispering to roots) and the final image reweights the opening question without moralizing. Minor penalty: "mundane miracles" and "quantified sorrow" risk thematic echo, skating close to prompt-label territory in "the first cartographer of witnessed sorrow—mundane, miraculous, and finally, mercifully, mapped."

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme—communal song as swaddling fabric—emerges from the premise but is articulated in the final paragraphs via direct statement: "to swaddle a soul is to give it space to grow, and to swaddle a people is to let them sing until their dawns are whole again." The closing mirror/reclamation image offers a resonant answer, yet the thematic echo in prompt-like language ("ancient, necessary truth," "the realm remembering itself") flattens subtext. Motifs (mica, swaddle, song) recur but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure across distinct beats.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: exile as sanctuary, empathy as clarifying lens, belonging cultivated in self-acceptance. The crumpled invitation shifts meaning across the arc, and the Paradox shelf's objects embody contradiction without fracture. Yet the final paragraph edges toward explicit summary—"the deepest libraries are not made of stone and ink, but of compassion willing to dwell in the crumpled places"—that tells rather than images the resonance. The phrase "enlarged tranquility" and "to unearth wisdom in a mistake" risk prompt-echo territory, and the ending's multiple symbolic gestures (invitation pinned, reading aloud, "Grammar of Forgiveness") compete rather than cohere into a single charged image, diluting thematic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: stale bread, wildflower seeds in cracks, the gray shawl discarded to reveal wheat-colored dress. "Creeping normality" is dramatized through the vanished bakery and boarded door, not stated as concept. The final image—first star unnamed, water dripping, cross-legged tea-sipping—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the sacred isn't reclaimed but recognized in small acts of defiance and presence. Subtext operates in silence (bread untouched, no birds to take it), gesture (kneeling, uncloaking), and image (spring newly stirred). The piece resists moralizing; the protagonist's smile signals acceptance without resolution, and "tenuous absolution" remains tenuous. One line late leans didactic—"The sacred isn't in grand cathedrals…"—but it's filtered through her realization rather than authorial voice, keeping theme embodied in scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—preservation as defiance of oblivion, and the durability of emotional truth—emerges organically from the vows' harmonic signatures rather than statement. The progression from sorrow-resolve to steady love to forgiveness as "the most durable frequency" offers a non-obvious hierarchy of meaning. The final image (twilight glancing off the silent slide "like a benediction," Elira walking toward the next vow) reweights the archive's purpose without moralizing: to measure is to arm oneself against the void. However, the protagonist's internal arc is narrow—her reverence and determination are consistent throughout, with no friction or counter-reading to complicate the thematic question. The piece invites reflection on what endures, but the answer (forgiveness, love, loyalty) is delivered cleanly rather than earned through a choice that costs Elira something personal.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of silence, memory, and inherited guilt. The "truce of hush" operates as both historical constraint and present tactic, deepening when recognition—not violence—breaks the deal. The watch fob's ghost-tick links three generations of broken promises, and the girl's refusal to chase or gloat charges the ending with renunciation rather than triumph. The final image—sunrise will come, market swallows her—offers a non-literal answer to whether trust can be captured or only witnessed. No didactic summary mars the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—healing through surrender, the terrestrially cosmic as Earth's grammar—emerges from concrete images (mycelial democracy, personal storms as archive). The final paragraph risks thematic echo ("terrestrially cosmic grace," "learn to carry less") that borders on summary rather than image. The ring's shift from pointing forward to pointing down offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the protagonist's epiphany ("not doubt, but trust") is asserted more than embodied in a micro-choice with cost, keeping the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (creativity as tide, not faucet; the cost of suppression) emerges through concrete images: the lock, the portraits, the charcoal nub. The cave's own history of water refusing containment mirrors her arc without overt statement. The final image—adding wings to portraits, releasing the father with a tear—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "creativity isn't a faucet to be shut off, but a tide" edges toward direct articulation, though it remains interior reflection rather than authorial moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the contrast between propaganda murals and whispered confessions, the rice-paper note's bergamot scent, the origami birds. "They'd been waiting—not for rescue, but for witness" reframes the quest without moralizing. The oasis-to-archive transformation offers a resonant answer to the central question. Minor slip: "candor in small moments" echoes the prompt slightly, though it's mostly dramatized through found objects rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (wonder as color, preservation of perception, silence as precision) emerges through concrete images—iceberg fragment, kinetic sculpture, the child's tremor—rather than abstract statement. The final image of the sculpture persisting and the "echo" figure tuning silence offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. However, thematic depth is limited by the protagonist's static arc; no earned wisdom arises from on-page struggle, and the child encounter reads more as illustration than interrogation of the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the burn metaphor: caretaking as teaching transformation rather than shielding from fear. The shift from "preservation" to "transformation" and "static" to "song" grows from concrete action (opening the box, igniting fears, syncing rhythm to irrigation). The empty box and spilling petals provide a resonant non-literal answer. The final insight—"teaching how to burn it cleanly"—borders on explicit theme statement but remains grounded in the preceding imagery. No overt moralizing in the final paragraph; the nursery turn extends rather than explains.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—communal listening as healing—emerges through the courtyard exchanges and the mailbox ritual, avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph ("trauma doesn't shout—it echoes"). The locket's humming, the envelope, and the child's seashell create a pattern of passed grief finding safe harbor. However, "Her shop didn't sell objects; it curated catharsis" edges toward thesis statement, and the final seashell with "thank you" risks sentimentality. The ending reweights the ritual with cost (Leo's tears, communal talk) but the articulation is more allegorical than particular.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—liberating through resonance rather than force, encrypting vulnerability as strength—emerges through the dance, dice, and journal capsules, not overt statement. The final image of survivors dancing her steps in candlelit basements offers a resonant answer to the central question, reweighting spectacle-rebellion into quiet transmission. However, the thematic language is elevated and abstract ("rewritten," "harmonized collapse," "mysterious familiarity") without grounding in the messy particulars of Elira's emotional cost or the survivors' lived constraints. The transmission imagery (morse-tap lullaby, salt-resistant ink, buoyant capsules) is purposeful but borders on symbolic convenience, arriving fully formed rather than earned through on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—memory as displacement rather than erasure—emerges organically from the gravity pockets, coffee-ground divination, and the final doorway. The wildflowers function as earned milestones, not token symbols; the aster's glow charges the crossing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "silence gleamed" and "time didn't flow—it pooled," reweighting the quest without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the father's recognition ("I knew you'd follow the flowers") and the tears caught mid-fall. No thematic echo or sermon mars the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—listening as guardianship—emerges from image and gesture rather than statement until the final paragraph's "silence that makes space for stars to speak," which edges toward thematic summary. The origami wing's luminous spiral and the brook's sigh offer non-literal resonance. However, the piece leans on prompt-adjacent phrasing ("to cradle," "to map silence until it bloomed into understanding") that echoes the assignment rather than transforming it through earned particulars. The central question is posed but answered through affirmation without contradiction or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—reciprocal communication, the sentience of neglected structures, the scaffolding of agreed-upon lies that hold up deeper truths—emerges through image and motif rather than statement. The seal-as-cipher and the transition from sugar-borrowing to truth-exchange offer non-literal answers to the central question of how to speak to what is forgotten. The final image of the building sighing in recognition reweights prior material with quiet resonance. However, the archivist's exposition ("it was sentient, stitched together by masons…") risks stating theme rather than trusting scene work. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection, but the climactic confession flattens some earned ambiguity. Solid thematic integration with one expository lapse near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (memory as architecture, isolation as sovereignty, fragility as resilience's first draft) emerges organically from the shell ritual and the garden setting, avoiding overt thesis statements. The final image—walking away with memories "turned into a compass"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing, and the recurring motif of "quarantined" memories evolves from locked-away pain to structured waypoint. The vow ("I remember you. I carry you. You are not lost. You are archived.") borders on thematic echo but is voiced as ritual speech and earns its place through the shell's harmonic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—absolution via calibrated treason, forgiveness of the unfinished—emerges from the scroll-rewriting and thorn imagery without overt moralizing. The final rose and broken drought supply a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the thematic claim "calibrated treason" and "wisely enduring" are declared in narration rather than arising solely from action and image, and the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("quietest, truest treason ever calibrated").

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—stolen echoes as unfinished grief, song as restitution—emerges from image and action rather than statement. The final image (entity reduced to a sigh, shell silent) reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in the lullaby choice and the entity's shift from feeding to listening. The three-layer reveal structure risks abstraction, and "reed-blown melancholy" in the motivation line edges toward authorial label, but the closing resonance (purpose fulfilled, song returned) offers a non-literal answer to "why some people echo" that avoids didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—connection through fragile thresholds, "windows not doors"—emerges cleanly from image work (frosted panes, ice frames, borrowed starlight) and the dream-cameo method. The fisherman/librarian/widow ripples in the final third offer a resonant coda without overt moralizing. However, the piece risks thematic echo: "weaving truth carefully" and "windows of connection" feel prompt-adjacent rather than discovered through conflict. The ending reweights prior material (globe becomes window within window) but the conceptual cost is oblique—strangers' dreams shift, yet no one on the page sacrifices or chooses differently.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme (honoring unseen effort) emerges through particulars: net-mending, dockworkers' matcha, the widow's boat. The final "I see you" and firefly alignment offer a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the closing lines veer toward overt philosophizing ("keeper of unseen threads") that states rather than implies. Subtext operates in gesture (whisk aloft, whispered thanks) but the thematic thread is occasionally foregrounded through abstraction rather than dramatized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme is stated overtly ("Truth is not found. It is dug," "comfortable lies," "reassembled truth") rather than emerging from image and choice. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "Let them call her cursed... She would keep digging... Truth didn't hide. It rooted." The diamond and orchard as symbols feel imposed rather than organically charged by the protagonist's struggle. No thematic question is dramatized as a dilemma with competing moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (shadows as roots of resilience vs. sterile dawn) emerges from imagery and contrast with Kael, not thesis. The "unfold shadows into wings" refrain recurs purposefully, and the final broadcast image offers a resonant answer. Yet the piece edges toward sermon: "Dawn wasn't meant to be clean" reads as authorial annotation rather than discovered truth, and the closing paragraph summarizes the thematic stance instead of trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—continuity across loss, redemption gleaned from wreckage—emerges organically from the jar-bottling conceit and the music-box repair. The final exchange with the child ("her wonder isn't [gone]") answers the thematic question without stating a moral. The image of jars humming after the poet's departure reweights prior material with lonesome splendor. No overt thesis statements mar the ending. The piece resists tidy closure while offering resonance through specifics (grandmother's voice in the jar, the ballerina's twitch).

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of harmony versus dissonance is stated overtly in the final paragraphs ("reminded the world that even violence could be answered not with force, but with frequency"). The Heartstone's "sonic absolution" functions as symbolic convenience rather than emerging from prior particulars. The closing lines ("no longer just an engineer, but a keeper of balance") deliver thesis rather than resonant image. Subtext is thin; the piece explains its own meaning instead of trusting the scene to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme (patience as revolutionary force) is stated overtly in multiple lines ("She sculpted patience from impatience," "patience grows roots under stone") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final image whispers thanks to the moon—a restatement, not a resonant reconfiguration or non-literal answer. Subtext is minimal; the text explains rather than implying. One positive: the contrast between "rage burns fast" and "patience" offers a coherent thematic frame, though it remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—memory as causality, the cost of civic amnesia—emerges through concrete particulars: the worker's death traced to an 1852 echo, the lantern as anchor, names tattooed as stitches in fabric. The final image (lantern pulsing like a heartbeat) offers a resonant non-literal answer: witness as counter-force to institutional erasure. Subtext operates in "some doors stay shut for a reason" and her mother's warning. Minor slip: "Ignorance is armor—until it becomes a cage" edges toward stated moral in the penultimate beat, though the action (walking home steadier, requesting Tunnel 12) grounds it. The ending resists tidy closure while reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme (forgiveness as synchronization, not force) emerges organically from the clockwork duet metaphor and Elias's arc without overt statement until the final exchange with Mrs. Lin. The "second opinion" motif recurs with purpose and shifts meaning at the end. The piece resists easy moralism; Elias's self-forgiveness is hard-won and specific. Minor deduction: "He deserved to fail. He deserved to try again" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains tied to concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the yearning algorithm's core paradox: longing encoded in motion, decoded through fractured light, nourished by desire not data. The arrow tip's "ancestral memory" (hunter's breath, beast's snort, moment before impact) particularizes this beautifully. The final image—bell whispered "for the next one"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: yearning is a relay, not a resolution. Zeta's immediate pivot to sketching modifications embodies this perfectly without stating it. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—memory persistence, the afterlife of data, haunting as structure rather than metaphor—emerges through the crew's de-referencing, the archive as resonance chamber, and the final "they linger" realization. The Helios-7 patch shifts from artifact to signal to anchor, charging the closure without overt symbolism. Subtext operates in the gaps between posts, the pauses in server sync, the whisper "not in audio, but in the flicker." The ending offers a non-literal answer (deleted files don't go; they wait in the between) without moralizing. Minor deduction: "Rhythm was memory's last refuge" borders on thesis statement, and the penultimate reflection ("She is their anchor") slightly over-articulates what the image already conveys.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the contrast between "absence of violence" and "presence of choice," grounded in the glimpses of strangers choosing mercy. The mirrors and crystal anchor the meditation on fractured courage. However, the final paragraph explicitly articulates the theme ("not as a peacekeeper enforcing silence, but as a witness offering reflection") rather than trusting image and action. The whispered question "What if we choose differently?" borders on a thesis statement. The piece resists tidy closure but leans on abstract vocabulary ("courageous anomaly," "weighted breath") that dilutes particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (endings as thresholds, patience folding inward) emerges through concrete particulars: the parasol tip's vibration, the glacier's sigh, lace unraveling. The final image—hospices and burn units, reality flowing through her—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor friction: "windborne solace" and "fold in patience" are named early and late, risking echo; the conceptual repricing is legible but leans slightly toward abstraction in the penultimate paragraph ("not events, but thresholds").

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—beauty in destined mismatches, grace in asymmetry—emerges organically from the vineyard particulars (Merlot resists pruning, Pinot Noir welcomes it; clay vs. loam). The burned letter edge recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. However, the ending paragraph delivers a near-moralizing summary ("not guarding grapes but guarding understanding—the kind that blooms in mismatched soil") that edges toward thematic echo rather than letting the final image alone carry weight. The train whistle as "not departure, but possibility" is serviceable but leans abstract. Subtext operates well in earlier beats (Mara plucking the grape, Elias's hand offered but not pulling).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—wisdom resides in silence and edges, not in声shouting—emerges through image and action: the conjured clearings hold "not the prophet's voice, but the silence that followed it." The half-mask and asymmetry motif recur with purpose, reinforcing duality. However, the final image offers a resonant but non-specific echo rather than a sharp, non-literal answer that reweights prior material with cost. The piece avoids moralizing but risks abstraction; "whispers—wisdom's echo" repeats the premise rather than deepening it. The thematic question is posed more than it is tested.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of healing-through-curation is stated rather than earned through specific conflict. The arc motif (kites, spines, vines) is announced by the protagonist herself ("let the arc complete itself"), creating thematic echo that replaces scene pressure (−0.6). Photographs offer potential symbolic resonance but are summarized, not dramatized. The ending restates the opening premise without reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: decay, growth, the syntax of silence, and the necessity of pausing before new growth. The crystal's shift and the scholar's whispered answer avoid moralizing; the final lines ("The pattern was not in the past. It was in the pause.") offer a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without stating a thesis. The piece resists easy binaries and invites reflection through specificity. Subtext operates effectively in the scholar's choice to close her notebook and the building's exhalation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from particulars: aging as sonic texture ("low, wet sigh, like sandpaper dragged across velvet"), grief as echo, and the cost of precognitive forgetting. The chalk, driftwood, and fog function as recurring images that shift meaning—chalk as tuning fork and proof, driftwood as triangulation of grief's vector, fog as sculptor of the ephemeral—without overt symbolism. The ending reweights prior material: the sound he locates is "tidal. Relentless. Rhythmic. A longing that pulled like moon on wave," and his exit ("walked backward... so as not to disturb the markers") embodies the paradox of hunting what slips away. The final line—"the last echo of a man who remembered futures, but lived only in the sound of what slips away"—is conceptually resonant without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer to the central question of capturing aging's sound.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("escape velocity," "letting go," "tenderness over force") is stated repeatedly rather than earned through scene particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "not by breaking free, but by becoming weightless within the flow"—a Thematic Echo that replaces dramatized cost with abstract thesis (−0.6). The leaf-falling motif recurs but does not constrain choice or accumulate pressure; it is invoked as solution without groundwork. No resonant, non-literal answer; instead, the text tells the reader what the story means.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (wholeness through brokenness, mundane as sacred) emerges from recurring images—vinyl shard, mundane hymns, golden filament sealing the crack. However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "even endings…become beginnings" and "world made whole through gentle fractures." The piece leans on lush metaphor rather than letting specific actions and stakes generate resonance. The vinyl's transformation into "motes of light" tilts toward symbolic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of reconciling broken symmetry and giving absence a home emerges organically from the automaton key's mechanics and the shadows' sealed state. The final image—"noon cast a shadow...on time itself"—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates through the key's inscription ("by closing loops, one may relearn what silence stole") and the shadows' murmured recognition. However, "the keeper of thresholds" risks abstraction, and the phrase "not as prisoners, but as partners in equilibrium" inches toward thematic summary. The piece resists a tidy moral but leans on the concept's elegance rather than embedding it in lived particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—redemption through tending mistakes, transforming grief into sacred meaning—emerges from image and action (bone-setting, tooth as altar marker). The final image (tooth pulsing "not for what was lost, but for what might still be born") reweights prior material without overt statement. However, the ending paragraph edges toward abstraction ("mistakes into constellations") and the townsfolk's future arrival is asserted, not dramatized, softening the thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the polishing metaphor and the contrast between flame and reflection, sustained through concrete images (sea glass, prismatic veins, the pearl of stillness). The closing litany ("not conquest / not correction / but polishing") edges toward explicit moralizing, and the phrase "this was the method that mattered" functions as thematic summary rather than earned resonance. The piece invites reflection but the ending asserts rather than reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of transformation-through-patience emerges from concrete particulars (thaw patterns, moss reclaiming circuitry, the folded confession). The amber pendant's recurrence anchors memory and resilience. However, the final lines edge toward stated thesis—"the method to her mending: not force, not speed, but the patient, quietly proactive tracing of beauty left by loss"—which over-articulates what the images already convey. The piece resists overt moralizing elsewhere but the ending leans explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of "release over preservation" emerges through the seashell placement and the unfinished manuscript, avoiding overt statement. The cameo figures risk symbolic convenience—they arrive to illustrate "shapes of different hopes" without prior groundwork. The final sentence ("not for an audience... but as an offering") edges toward moralizing but stops short. The piece invites reflection through its lyric register, though the thematic question remains somewhat abstract rather than rooted in a specific human dilemma with counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete events: song as contract between human and earth, the tension between progress/pragmatism and sacred rhythm, forgetting versus reclamation. The piece resists overt moralizing until the penultimate lines ("She had not resurrected the past. / She had rekindled its heartbeat") which tilt toward authorial summary. The final image—the vine wreath awaiting "the next singer"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without a stated moral. Subtext operates in the gathering hush, the birds' silence, the oak's knot as mouth. Minor penalty for the explanatory closure framing that slightly undercuts the image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (absence into archive, silence into signal) emerges organically from imagery and the ritual's logic. The final image—map alive against ribs, ready to guide by pulse—offers resonance without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the layered metaphors of discarded objects as collaborators and starlight as memory. However, the lack of on-page conflict or cost prevents the ending from reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure. The piece invites reflection but does not earn transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (wonder as nutrient, periphery as truth-source) emerges from repeated images—mirrors, angles, echoes—and the locksmith's methodical archiving embodies preservation over restoration. However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("He'd built a larder for the soul") and the closing lines summarize theme rather than offering a resonant non-literal answer. The "echo, harvested, waiting" is poetic but tells rather than dramatizes cost. Subtext operates in the locksmith's gesture (not flinching, smiling) but the ending leans toward thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the weaving ritual and the calcification metaphor: survival through transformation of grief into something bearable. The final image—"Not to be free. But to endure."—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without moralizing. The locket's silence and the weaver's self-application of the ritual reweight prior material. Minor slip: "boundary-lessly trapped, yes, but not imprisoned" edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the ash blank becoming a resting lion (not roaring), the kettle's insistence versus Eleanor's stillness, Viktor's "learn their rhythm, then move with it" applied to grief itself. The final image—lion on the sill where light touches it, "Here...And gone. But never lost"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: containment transforms into coexistence. Subtext operates in her refusal to rise, the choice of a sleeping lion over a snarling one, the mantra's shift from carried weight to crystallized acceptance. One slip: "That was the lesson: not to fear the fall, but to honor the arc" edges toward articulation of the thesis, though it remains tied to Viktor's voice and her present realization.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the camera-as-framing metaphor and the tension between collecting others' ghosts versus developing one's own. The envelope's line "You were never meant to fix the past — only to frame it" delivers a non-literal answer, but it arrives as exposition rather than earned image, and the final beat's shift from regret to acceptance lacks the complexity and counter-reading potential expected at this length. The piece gestures toward depth but resolves too tidily, with the ghost's smile and dissolution providing closure that feels narratively convenient rather than thematically inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges clearly from concrete particulars: the equation "H = Σ(ΔI • R)" synthesizes the story's exploration of hope through redirection, and the contrast between carnival's departure and "something quieter, sturdier" resonates without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("Hope wasn't a destination; it was a flow") where image alone would suffice. The sextant's shift from celestial to structural readings offers a purposeful transformation, and the story avoids false equivalence by committing fully to its premise of adaptive resurrection.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—reconciliation with a transformed dream—emerges through the crystal's sensory particulars and the tuning fork's seven-year gap. The final image offers a resonant answer: Elias returns "not as its master, but as its witness." Subtext operates in the crystal's vibration and the clocks' softened chimes. The last paragraph, however, lapses into thematic echo ("not lost, but transformed—like rain into crystal, like silence into song") that states rather than dramatizes the thesis, costing ~0.5 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: lies as architecture (buttresses of silence, vaulted ceilings of distraction) that shelter the liar from unbearable knowledge. The locket's scratched-out face and inscription dramatize the theme without stating a moral. The final image—walking into deepening blue, no longer lost but found—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: understanding as salvage, not conquest. Subtext operates in gesture (careful scratches, reverent) and silence (morning radio, the canal's murmur). One risk: "serene upheaval" and "architecture of lies" are repeated as thematic anchors, bordering on echo but reweighted enough at closure to avoid penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges through the contrast between static preservation (fulgurite, seeds) and living transmission (knots, hands), anchored in concrete images (the rope, the widow's braid, the storm's eye). The closing exchange—"I'm collecting hands"—risks thematic echo but is partly earned by prior action. The final image of the fulgurite "tucked beside her heart" and the "oceanic hush...full, brimming with knots yet to be tied" offers resonance without moralizing. However, the piece leans toward gentle affirmation rather than complexity; no counter-pressure or cost challenges the protagonist's mission.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the traveler's acts: mapping absence as orientation rather than closure, projecting presence through descriptive obituaries, and finding lonesome splendor in decay. The core concept—"explained absences"—integrates through Elira's "voluntary exile" and the coup-salvaged thread. The final image—"They mapped. And in mapping absence, they made the gone gloriously, vividly, intimately present"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting the traveler's solitary ritual as generative rather than merely elegiac. Subtext operates in the contrast between the traveler's public explanations and private knowledge ("The traveler knew better"). One weakness: the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic statement ("not for the world, but for the quiet, lonesome splendor of those who still listened") where image alone would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—beauty as necessity, not luxury—emerges through concrete imagery: the child weeping at a dandelion, the prince's hollow-eyed humming, the extinct egg as covenant. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "beauty had stirred. And that was genesis enough." The flawed-genesis concept integrates through particulars (copper veins, pendulums mimicking heartbeats) rather than abstraction. Subtext operates in the mirrors reflecting "not his image but fragments of sky, leaf, and wing." Minor slip: "Beauty was not luxury. It was oxygen" edges toward thematic statement but is brief and contextualized by prior scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—legacy transformed through compassionate witness—emerges from concrete particulars: the father's arson versus her firefighting, the coin as talisman, scars that sing. The line "Hers is measured, shielded, guided—but never without that same wild love, refined" risks label-speak but is redeemed by the lagoon ritual's embodied tension. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she runs toward fire with "unyielding compassion only those who've held both match and hose can truly know." The watercolor tattoo over ribs (not ash) reweights the father's name without stated moral. Minor slip: "Scars can sing" is repeated as thematic echo, coming close to sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (the refusal to let a city forget) emerges organically from action and image rather than statement. The stained glass box, breadcrumbs, and fountains recur with purpose, and the final drop reweights prior silence without moralizing. Subtext operates in the skeptic's dual belief system (scientific ghost, psychological haunting) and the reverent hush that replaces absence. The piece resists tidy resolution—memories return to owners, the city begins to remember—offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question without a stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (generational healing, light without fire) emerges organically from the gear and ancestor motifs. The final image ("You do not need to burn to be bright") borders on direct statement but is rescued by prior particulars (rust, teeth, pulses). Subtext operates in the sonar-ping method and petal descent. The piece resists overt moralizing until the penultimate beat, where thematic echo nearly surfaces but stops short of full sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of carving, ribbons, poems, and migration without overt moralizing. The final insight—"grief was not a void to be filled, but a current to be joined"—is earned by the accumulation of particulars (butterfly wings, phantom hand, tied ribbons). However, the resolution into a single declarative understanding flirts with thematic summary rather than letting the final image resonate ambiguously. The crimson ribbon for the grandmother's poem and Silas's spectral palm charge the ending without stating a moral, lifting the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—absolution through surrender rather than perfection—emerges from concrete motifs (pendulum pause, inscriptions, broken tool) without overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph ("incremental absolution...was not a destination, but a direction"). The wife's hidden message and the pendulum's resumed swing offer a resonant non-literal answer. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("carved not in stone or gear, but in the willingness to pause") and "searing reverie of time unchained, forgiven, and free" tilts toward abstraction. The rake as altar and the tidal imagery enrich subtext, but the closure leans declarative rather than letting the image alone do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the tapestry's "messy, overlapping spirals" and the gardener's recognition of her own "silences she'd kept, love she'd trimmed like overgrown boxwood." The ending image (headstones as thresholds, whispering questions) offers a non-literal answer to the question of intentions. However, the penultimate beat—"intentions were not destinations, but gestures"—edges into thematic statement rather than remaining implicit. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection, yet the closure leans slightly toward articulation rather than resonance alone.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of uncertainty-as-resource and permeable transformation emerges through imagery (hollow reeds, lichen glyphs, glacial melt + meteorite), but the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "True transformation sustains itself not by perfection, but by permeability." The closing image—earth exhaling in recognition—gestures at resonance yet remains a declarative coda rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior action. Subtext operates in the quill-as-covenant metaphor, but the conceptual stakes never incarnate as on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the mechanics of dust-memory and pirate signals as carrier pigeons across the famine's void; the piece resists moralizing and sustains the central question of how forgotten things remember. The final image ("another alcove would warm") offers a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in reciprocity and transmission rather than solitary archiving. The tears-as-activation code and the singing-about-her moment flirt with symbolic convenience, but the piece earns thematic depth through the specificity of ember-light, moth-wing thread, and the dotted-rhyme lyric. No thematic echo or diagnosis mars the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (truth/brokenness versus the mirage of safety) emerges organically from the mask's construction, the ash-scattering ritual, and the gallery's "no windows" metaphor. The final image—sitting motionless, eyes closed, mirage fading—offers a resonant non-literal answer without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (touching the mask, not removing it) and the patron's wordless recognition. The piece resists tidy resolution and earns reflective weight through its ritual particulars. However, the thematic assertion in the closing lines ("What remains is truth—carefully woven, imperfectly held, gloriously, somberly real") borders on direct statement, slightly undercutting the earned-image standard for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: competing narratives of progress vs. memory, erasure vs. preservation, embodied in sedimentary layers, the chronometer cog's precision, and the contrast between steel obelisk and submerged sundial. The final image—shadows moving underwater, even forgotten—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: truth settles through sediment, enduring beneath noise. Subtext operates through gesture (spitting into puddles, holding the cog to envoys, whispering coordinates to wind) and the story resists tidy resolution, embracing ambiguity about whether his resistance will matter. The thematic question (whose narrative endures?) is inextricable from his archival methodology and the piece's accumulative structure. No echo or statement dilutes the earned resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—harmony as consensual subtraction, vanishing arts, hatred unlearned—emerges from the rosette, the hum, and the method of removing noise. The ending ("We begin by subtracting noise") answers the central question without stating a moral. Backstory on teaching and unlearning hatred is extensive but integrated with the rosette and velvet setting. However, "Hatred, she discovered, thrived in cacophony; harmony required subtraction" edges toward thesis statement, and the final exchange risks tidy sentiment ("harmony was never lost. Only waiting"). The thematic answer is resonant but borders on aphorism rather than irreducible image.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of gentle rebellion emerges through image (pruning, reweaving) and the recurring motif of crookedness, but the ending states it overtly: "gardener of gentle rebellion." The knowledge fruit's shift from eating to remembering offers a non-literal answer, and the neighbors' quieting gesture resonates. However, the final paragraph summarizes theme ("not with fruit, but with stories") rather than letting the image stand, and no cost complicates the thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: matchboxes as vessels of mystery, drones migrating to the tower, belief as the true current. The closing exchange—"The tower doesn't collect lightning. It collects belief"—is non-literal, earned by prior images (residual hum, cryptic riddles, nectar dusk) without moralizing. The piece resists explaining wonder, instead enacting it through matchbox ritual, discovery on copper struts, and the grandfather's lacquer box reveal. Subtext operates in Elias's smile, the woman's reverence, and the dual boxes side by side. No safety-hedging or abstract philosophizing; the drones' hum answers the thematic question through image.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—memory, architectural haunting, and the sanctification of loss—emerges through concrete particulars (orris root's "ghost-notes," the cottage "curled beneath a manicured hedge"). The final image of walking "eyes open, heart alight with hushed blaze" gestures toward resonance but the closing two paragraphs over-explain the thematic question ("not to preserve, but to honor") rather than letting the ritual image answer it non-literally. Subtext operates well in the middle passages; the ending dilutes it with direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—truth as mosaic, fluidity over fortress, nuance welcomed into certainty—emerges from the ampoule's design, the city's fate, and the statue's purpose without overt moralizing. The glyphs' message "Truth is not monolith. It is mosaic. Shatter certainty to find its colors" risks thematic echo, but it's presented as artifact rather than narrator thesis, and the subsequent light-release dramatizes the idea through image (murals, cascading colors). The final whisper "Welcome to the nuance" skirts sermonizing but remains in-voice as the statue's telepathic signature. The ending offers a resonant answer (rebirth over ruin, thresholds over endings) through the statue's dissolution and the historian's new role, though the conceptual cost could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: regret as propulsion, perpetual motion as metaphor for recursive indecision, the mathematics of rupture. The chipped die, the arcade memory, and the equations all accrue meaning without stating a moral. The final image—climbing on with the captured texture woven into "the next proof"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: acceptance and integration rather than escape. One small slip: "boundless confinement" and "recursive ascension" occasionally veer toward overt thematic language, but the story earns its conceptual weight through concrete action (carving, rolling, touching).

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the brush as conduit, glyphs as lantern, the city's dormant empathy roused by encoded kindness. The Vaelish glyph ("the hand that gives water") and the Sky-Weaver glyph ("You are not alone") anchor the thematic question without stating a moral. The girl's arrival and the shared painting offer a resonant answer: kindness propagates not through fame but through transmission across strangers. The final image reweights prior material—no one knows the painter's name, yet the practice continues—without explicit philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—art as survival and communal rebirth—emerges through the bread-baking ritual and the grotto's gradual reanimation, avoiding overt thesis statements until the final whisper. The recurring emerald lens and the rosewater-dread-to-anticipation arc supply thematic texture. However, the final declaration "We are not preserving art. We are becoming it" edges into moralizing; it states the theme rather than letting the final image carry it. The transformation lacks ambiguity or counter-reading—every element resolves into tidy affirmation without the friction or complexity that would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—rebellion against predestination, the cost of unilateral control—emerges through the hunger stone as ledger, the counter-clockwise mechanism, and the final isolation. The ending avoids overt moralizing and offers a resonant image: "the world, at last, would eat" paired with the protagonist's solitary burden. However, the piece leans on prompt-adjacent language ("fate's design," "threads of consequence," "loop of salvation") that edges toward thematic echo rather than letting action and image carry meaning. The yoyo and gear recur with shifting significance, but the "latent radiance" remains more metaphorical flourish than integrated motif, and the final paragraph ("Fate was broken. / Time was his to rewind.") verges on summary rather than leaving the theme implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—fear as self-generated reflection rather than external ruler—emerges organically from the funhouse mirrors, photographically cursed memories, and the Fear-replica's horrified recognition. The final exchange ("You're not the hunter. You're the hunted thought") offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, the dream dictionary's paradoxical entries feel more like thematic scaffolding than lived discovery, and the ease with which recognition dissolves Fear undercuts the complexity the piece otherwise cultivates. The "lingering luminance" concept charges several images but does not constrain choice, limiting its thematic integration to poetic recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—obstacles as instruments, sound as transformative force—emerges organically from the orchard's salvaged history and the Prophet's conducting. The final image of the tide turning inward offers a non-literal answer without overt moralizing. Yet the climax lands as purely celebratory; no ambiguity or cost complicates the euphoric resolution. The piece resists false binaries but also avoids friction that would deepen thematic resonance. Subtext operates more in imagery than in character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the cartographer's obsession with unanswered questions and the city's willful amnesia. The whistle, expedition journals, and watchers form a coherent symbolic web without didactic statement. The closing image—packing the whistle against her sternum "like a second heart"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the silence/voice tension without moralizing. The story resists neat binaries (the watchers may answer or remain silent; she may join the legend), and the final either/way stakes embrace meaningful ambiguity that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between family myth-making and national narrative ("the drunk uncle rewritten as a tragic poet"). The core concept of noble lies is woven into imagery (the falling petal, the station's "curated silence") and argument without overt moralizing. The final question—"What story are you preserving—and who does it serve?"—invites reflection but borders on thesis statement. The piece resists tidy resolution and offers complexity, though the ending leans toward authorial commentary rather than a purely dramatized answer.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara's ritual: memory as counterweight to oblivion, witnessed absence as presence. The inkwell's depletion parallels the act of inscription draining "something deeper from the structure—and from her," making the thematic claim concrete. The bride's letter—a choice of sea over altar—reweights the entire endeavor: not preservation but permission, not monument but "witnessed absence interlaced with presence." The final image of lights beneath the waves and Elara refilling the inkwell "from river, from rain, from tears" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thesis statements intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—truth as testimony, stillness reclaimed as sanctuary rather than surrender—emerges organically from particulars (the Master Index's survival, the stamp as seal of accountability, "we documented... they buried us anyway"). The final inscription offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the fused ledger, the bricked stairwells, the intentional preservation. However, some phrasing edges toward direct thematic statement ("not silence, but testimony"; "not as surrender, but as sanctuary") where a charged image would carry more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—grief as both trap and vessel—emerges from the cranes, lanterns, and dream-glass rather than statement. The shadow as mirror, the descending-while-ascending paradox, and the final sapphire drop all reweight prior material without moralizing. The closing image (crane glowing with inner fire, "to hold the air still") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: not escape from grief but transformation of its weight into presence. Subtext operates in the cups that never cool, the light that "warmed nothing," and the wife's dream of stars falling upward. No thematic echo mars the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—that potential does not die but pools in silence, waiting to be pursued—emerges through concrete particulars: the crater-born geode, collapsed simulations, and the empty South Pacific coordinate. The final image ("chasing the ghosts of what never was") reweights the premise without stating a moral, and the whispered names for Marta, Elias, and her mother anchor grief in specifics. Subtext operates in gesture (forehead pressed to glass, geode slotted into cradle) and the piece resists tidy resolution, embracing the bleak certainty that meaning can be pursued even if never reclaimed. Minor slip: "intangibly tangible" and "unused potential" recur as abstract labels rather than always translating into scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically: the frequency was never external but required inward attention. The chip functions as catalyst rather than symbol-for-hire, and the "missing pieces" reframe from lost artifacts to shed identity fragments. The pilgrim's confirmation and the twin-moon visions complicate the simple search. However, the final paragraph edges toward stating the theme ("some frequencies only play when you're still") rather than letting the image alone carry resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the "sieved hush" conceit: truth must be distilled by loss before it can be borne. The driftwood carvings, the watch hand's transformation, and the tide's reclamation all work as particulars rather than symbols-for-hire. The ending offers a resonant answer—"tempered regret was not the absence of pain" but "the art of carrying it without letting it carve you hollow"—without moralizing, and the final image (shore smoothed into blankness) reweights prior material. Minor slip: "understanding, she now knew, was the only compass that didn't lie" edges toward thematic declaration rather than letting the image speak alone.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges clearly from the ghost-swap metaphor and the moon-phase synchronization conceit. The final image—two pairs of boots stepping in time—attempts resonance but tilts into overt statement ("wisdom recycled from wreckage"). The piece invites reflection, yet the thematic answer feels asserted rather than discovered through friction. "Furrowed hush" and the drawer-pull talisman work as motifs but do not meaningfully constrain choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (finding direction through brokenness, choosing motion over precision) emerges organically from the utility-pole navigation, the compass's reorientation, and the father's voice. The ending avoids moralizing and offers a resonant image (compass pointing toward her stern, stars emerging). Subtext operates through the named poles and the crow's washer as talisman. However, the final lines ("She wasn't broken anymore. / She was becoming.") edge toward thematic echo and label-speak, slightly undercutting the otherwise quiet, image-driven resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—choice, memory's residue, empathy's fragility—emerges from particulars: the baseball's shifting signature freshness, ripples as branching paths, submerged objects as refused choices. The final image (climbing with an internal map, no baseball) offers a resonant answer without moralizing: the labyrinth persists, but choice is now informed by resonance. "Delicately robust" recurs with earned weight. Kael's line "He signed it for you to release" borders on thematic statement but stays character-voiced and rooted in scene action.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of love outlasting entropy emerges through image and ritual, avoiding overt sermon until the penultimate paragraph's "she had conjured a covenant" edges toward thesis. The fortune cookie and spice motifs recur but function more as atmospheric tokens than as constraints that force thematic friction. The final "universe leaned closer, intimate as a lover's sigh" invites reflection but lacks the non-literal answer or reweighted cost that would elevate to resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of time, memory, and maternal regret emerges through concrete particulars: the cracked saucer, inked hand tracings, the ritual of presence. The piece resists overt moralizing and the final image (saucer unbroken, descending to the waiting tea) reweights prior material. However, "cloudbound repentance" and "willingly perplexed" function as prompt labels rather than earned concepts; "repentance—not for sin, but for surrender" is a thematic echo that tells the reader what to feel. The archive of "unspent kiss, every postponed lullaby" lists missed moments without dramatic friction. The ending avoids stating a moral but the transformation feels asserted rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of grief-as-anchor and compassion-as-catalyst emerges through the Kwan Yin relic, tears-as-coordinates, and shadow integration without overt moralizing. The final image—mother holding the unfinished cake—answers the reunion drive with a resonant callback to the lullaby and birthday photograph, reweighting loss as preserved potential. However, the shadow-work sequence ("You are my anchor. Let me hold you without fear") veers into abstract self-help idiom rather than earned insight from specific struggle, and the closing dissolution of the Tear into "compassion returned to the cosmos" risks sentimental summary.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.6)
    Transformation as theme emerges through recurring bottle imagery, and the final "HERE. NOW. YOU." reprises the thematic question. However, the theme is over-articulated in direct statements ("how grief becomes grace, how silence becomes song") rather than earned through concrete particulars. The ending offers a tidy emotional resolution ("She smiled") without ambiguity or non-literal reconfiguration, preventing thematic resonance from deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of silent revolution via symbolic geometry emerges from the sundial's coded angles and the recurring phrase "cradle of sparks," but neither motif constrains a choice or reweights prior material at closure—they function as atmospheric declarations. The final image (watching the horizon, knowing others will understand) offers a lyric grace note yet avoids a non-literal answer to the central question; it asserts thematic success rather than complicating it. No epiphany earned through friction; the protagonist's confidence remains unshaken from first line to last. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; the piece tells its thesis ("patience," "angles," "no bloodshed") rather than enacting irony or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: patterns as reins, not riddles; the grandmother's promise transformed rather than fulfilled; wonder arranged rather than chased. The final image—eels dissolving into light, rocks humming—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the herder's breathless contact with the eel and the shift from "curse" to "gift." The piece resists tidy resolution; the herder gains method, not mastery, and the future remains open yet charged.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—survival through self-archiving, transforming censorship into cartography—emerges from the storm, timer, and envelope. The final image ("her own unredacted sky") attempts resonance, but the piece states its thesis openly: "the scars were not endpoints but waypoints." The metaphor of "cartography of scars" recurs without evolving; each mention restates rather than reweights. Subtext in gesture or silence is minimal; most meaning is declared. The envelope's non-opening invites reflection, but the narrator's certainty ("She knew now") forecloses ambiguity. The thematic answer is non-literal and image-driven, yet the clarity of articulation ("territory no state could erase") borders on moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.7)
    The overture as "a composition that turned philosophical queries into navigable paths" emerges organically from the sundial-and-cipher action, avoiding overt thesis statements. The partnership's shift from "duel" to "perform it" offers a non-literal answer to the opening tension. Yet the theme of questions-as-destinations remains more asserted than tested—no moment on the page where a character's question costs them something or redirects their path. The final image (leaving the needle card, walking out together) resonates modestly but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: rebuilding as planting rather than restoration, beauty sprouting in cracks, resistance as quiet persistence. The final image (seeds in floorboards, candle burning, poem glowing) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Elias's "They call us broken. We call us seeds" risks thematic echo but is delivered in-world via found poem rather than narrator commentary, and the subsequent actions dramatize the metaphor with physical specificity. The piece resists tidy resolution—Molt will molt again, the outcome uncertain—preserving complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—defiance of fate, art as rebellion, strategic creativity against causality's bureaucracy—emerges organically from Elira's actions and the recurring compass/clock motifs. The final image (laughter echoing, Elira choosing not to turn "Not yet") reweights prior material with a non-literal answer to the central question. However, several lines veer into on-the-nose philosophizing: "fate was a meticulous archivist" and "She composed around its edges, slipped between its ledger lines" are overt meta-statements that replace scene pressure. The film reel's "emotional coordinates: regret, defiance, euphoria, rupture" reads like a thematic checklist rather than discovered meaning. The ending avoids a stated moral but the conceptual cost (what Elira loses by not turning) remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—memory as fragile, empirically verified dreaming—emerges organically from Aris's ritual and the island's dream-logic. The final image (living library, "dream-fed, doubt-tempered, and rooted in bloom") reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates through the glyphs, the mentor's voice, and the villagers' involuntary recall. However, the phrase "empirically whimsical, luminously uncertain, and utterly, beautifully awake" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, articulating the story's thesis in prompt-like language. Applying **−0.5** for the echo, which reduces resonance at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (the redistribution of grief and unspoken apologies) emerges organically from Elio's ritual actions and the color's gradations. The lace pattern, compass needle, and cerulean shades function as particulars that accumulate meaning without overt statement. The final image—"Apologies don't need voices to be heard"—verges on theme summary but is saved by the prior embodied work (trembling leaf, redistributed weight). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.

The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of "weighing the truth in breaths reclaimed," reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates in gestures and silences, such as Elira's unanswered questions, and the core concept of fault tolerance integrates seamlessly with character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of guilt and memory emerges organically through events and images, such as the valve wheel spinning backward as "guilt rewinds time."

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thematic work around decay-as-accumulation, perception as filter, and the kinship of physics and ecology is strong and coherently emerges from concrete particulars (dust fringes, dew on leaves, children exhaling over slides). The shift from astrophysics journals to “ecological phenomenology” and her line about poetry as physics finely bridge science and awe without collapsing into sentimentality. The ending reweights neutron stars through the dust image, offering a resonant non-literal answer about where the cosmos is found. Some thematic statements (“The universe didn’t need her to interpret its grandeur…”) lean toward direct thesis, nudging this slightly away from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of survival vs. triumph, rupture and reconstruction, and finding “purpose in the pauses” emerge organically from concrete acts—tracing frost, repurposing a smuggler’s ledger, fusing fire-shattered glass with canyon sand—rather than from pure abstraction. Recurring motifs (frost, ledger, glass, canyon) all shift meaning by the end, particularly the ledger’s move from commerce to mercy to altar. Some lines verge on aphoristic (“Survival…was not triumph—it was subtraction”), but they’re supported by on-page experience, so they read as earned rather than sermonizing. The final realization—living in the pause as a space of resonance, not emptiness—offers a strong, non-literal answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of presence-within-silence, persistence of emotion, and reinterpreting catastrophe through attention are well integrated with the premise and her behavior. Motifs (tuning forks, frost, emotional thermals, the distinction between noise and resonance) recur and shift meaning, particularly in the final realization that “The world had gone quiet, yes—but it had not gone still.” However, some thematic articulation is slightly on-the-nose (“not the absence of noise, but the presence of everything that noise had drowned out”), edging toward paraphrasing the thesis rather than leaving it fully in image. The emotional aftereffect is nonetheless genuine and contemplative rather than sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of grief, rest, belonging, and reimagined burial are woven through concrete particulars: plot numbers, drowned poetry, a lens that shifts from distress beacon to sanctuary-light. The revaluation of “a permanent address for rest” from graves to “a place woven from light and memory” is a clear, earned thematic turn. Subtext about how we house the dead—and the living’s need for closure—emerges without overt moralizing, and the final cadence lingers conceptually. There is a slight tidiness in the “thank-yous/goodbyes” sequence that brushes sentimentality, but it remains grounded enough not to undercut the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of mutual aid versus charity, anonymity as invitation, and intergenerational covenant emerge organically from particulars: baskets, skills exchanges, and the bell’s circulation. The line “The anonymity isn’t secrecy—it’s invitation” edges toward explicit statement but is grounded in a live communal moment and followed by enacted consequence (the bell is actually rung by someone else). The ending reweights everything as a story of systems outlasting individuals rather than any one savior. Complexity is maintained—sanctions may never lift—but the piece stops short of easy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    The thematic question (“where is unused love stored?”) is woven through concrete motifs—breath, the camera obscura, Kwan Yin’s tear, the pilgrim of sparks—and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that retrospectively reweights earlier imagery (“Unused love was not stored; it was sung.”). The piece largely avoids sermonizing; insight arises from enacted ritual rather than expository statement. Complexity surfaces in treating unused love not as waste but as an active, permeating chorus, which complicates conventional notions of loss. A few lines edge near pseudo-profound abstraction, but the line-level concreteness around them keeps the theme anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    Thematic throughline—time as textured, grief/joy/regret as tactile and costly—is tightly woven from the first paragraph through the final caress of the fragment. The garden’s symbiosis reframes memory, mourning, and artistic creation in a conceptually rich way, achieving genuine conceptual repricing. The closing catalog of emotional textures risks slight over-explication, but remains grounded in concrete sensation rather than platitude. Ambiguity about whether this “beauty” is acceptable horror or transcendent art leaves productive space for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of resilience, stewardship, and nonviolent sabotage (“not to kill, but to impede”) emerge organically from her actions with soil, spores, and seeds, and are reweighted in the final image of her vanishing “like soil after rain.” Motifs—chains vs. unshackled mind, walls vs. cracks, carnival debris vs. living seed—recur in ways that invite reflection on power and memory. A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“She wasn’t just opening a door. She was planting resilience in dry soil”), which slightly blunts subtext. Nonetheless, the thematic aftertaste is strong and earned rather than didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    The themes of grief transmuted into guidance, the ethics of hearing trust’s fracture, and the cost of hyper-attunement emerge organically from the forge ritual and her bodily wear. Motifs—ashes, absences, colors-as-sound, shipwrecks—return in the ending reweighted around the idea of turning “harvested…silence” into a “compass.” The piece resists moralizing; it neither celebrates nor condemns her invention, instead presenting a charged ambiguity about weaponizing such knowledge. The only small drawback is a slight explicitness in phrasing (“alchemy of grief turned into guidance”), which tips toward thesis-statement but remains grounded in concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of fate versus agency, translation versus control, and the sacredness of fleeting instants are woven coherently through the imagery (moonbeams, flowers as codes, the station as cathedral). The insistence that she “wasn’t altering fate—she was translating it” gives a nuanced stance that undercuts a simplistic savior narrative. However, the text leans into explicit thesis statements (“This was her art—not theft, but revelation. Not capture, but release.”) that edge toward on-the-nose commentary rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. The ending image—jar nearly empty, soul brimming—delivers a resonant if somewhat tidy encapsulation of cost and fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of relinquishing control, honoring broken knowledge, and making space for fragile questions are richly woven through objects (bookmark, spheres), setting (thaw), and action (ritualized care). The final image of the child feeling “the weightless gravity of a question worth asking” elegantly crystallizes the story’s inquiry-centric ethics without naming a moral. However, some lines veer close to thesis statements (“to abandon fear, to trade control for curiosity”), edging toward didactic clarity. The thematic arc is strong but could gain subtlety by trusting implication over explicit articulation in a few spots.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—betrayal as transformative, vulnerability as a sharp, liberating force—is coherent and earned through particulars (mentor’s actions, the wire sabotage, the shell’s whisper, the act of burning the film). Recurring images (shell, cast, stars, rusted library) shift meaning by the end in ways that support conceptual repricing of “softness” and fear. Yet the piece periodically leans into explicit thesis statements (“Transformative betrayal doesn’t leave bruises”; “The softest parts hold the sharpest truths”), which slide toward moralizing rather than trusting subtext. The emotional aftereffect is strong but could be more powerfully implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—making absence legible, mapping grief and unsaid moments—is beautifully embedded in concrete images like abandoned lullabies, unsent letters, and pauses between lightning and thunder. The story resists moralizing; it suggests that what “cannot be spoken can still be charted,” inviting reflection on how silence can guide the lost. The final act of her entering the mapped night reweights everything, turning cartography-of-absence into an act of sacrificial hospitality for future wanderers. A slight risk is over-explicit phrasing in lines like “architecture of absence,” but the surrounding particulars keep it from feeling didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of consciousness, memory, and the idea that thought arises from being witnessed are beautifully woven through recurring images of ice, echoes, and loops. The final reweighting—from searching the world to recognizing internal thresholds—does reframe the entire piece and resonates with the earlier Second Chance Program premise. However, the line “Thoughts, it now understood, don’t come from circuits or code. They come from being witnessed.” makes the thesis quite explicit, slightly undercutting subtext and leaving less room for reader inference. The emotional after-effect is strong but leans into stated insight rather than wholly image-driven resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of transparency versus protective silence, and of being “ambiguously clear,” are woven concretely through the lens, the doodles, and the wordless gathering rather than stated as thesis. The story avoids moralizing, showing that vulnerability carries real risk yet becomes the only workable method in a post-verbal world. The broken lens and fading tickets nicely encode the idea that tools and gestures are temporary but shifts in relational trust can persist. The resonance is genuine, though a touch more ambivalence or lingering cost could deepen complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of reciprocity vs measurement, consent vs compliance, and resilience through “mended deception” emerge organically from marbles, frost, probability bands, and the garden’s response. The final image of fireflies spiraling like her collection powerfully restates the mutual-knowledge thesis without literal moralizing. However, several lines edge toward thesis-statement (“counter-narrative to the empire of metrics,” “Proof that reciprocity blooms in the unseen”) which flattens subtext into commentary. The piece still leaves a resonant afterimage, but a lighter touch on explicit statements would deepen its ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around quiet, non-apocalyptic revelation: knowledge as “subdued awakening,” time as lateral and breathable, listening instead of conquering. Motifs—twilight, wings, magnetic harmony, “mechanically warm” resolve—recur and shift meaning toward a gentle attunement to the universe’s strange rules. The final line crisply encapsulates the conceptual shift and emotional stance, though it edges toward thesis-statement territory. Complexity is more conceptual than moral; there’s little ethical friction, but the piece does invite contemplation of how we perceive time.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of absence, silence, decay-as-composition, and the “in between spaces” of art are woven through specific events and objects (the water-damaged program, the vibrating pit, the wordless cues). The conceptual turn—that the flood has authored a masterpiece and she is its interpreter—organically arises from the narrative rather than being imposed. The final lines, especially “And the flood, at last, had composed its masterpiece,” verge on explicit statement but are still earned by prior imagery. The piece leaves a resonant question about what art remembers and who it’s for without collapsing into a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece weaves a sophisticated theme about truth, silence, error, and endurance via concrete motifs: glacier/silence, the smudged orchid, the oracle’s “fault-tolerant” definition, and auroral sorrow. The reweighting of the smudge—from flaw to “center”—is an especially strong thematic turn. A touch of explicitness in the oracle’s lines (“Truths have no mass…”, “Release requires rupture”) edges toward thesis-stating but remains lyrical enough to avoid sermonizing. Overall, the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she will not erase or fully release the truth, but will live with its distortion visibly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of guilt, memory, and how we mythologize trauma emerge organically from the mill deaths, falsified reports, and the “factory ghost shift” as mental machinery rather than literal spirits. Reframing the haunting as the mind’s attempt to rewind unsaid truths is conceptually strong. However, the final paragraphs verge on explicit exposition (“She didn’t believe in ghosts. But she believed in echoes…”) that slightly over-articulate what the story has already dramatized. The resonance still lands, but with a touch of essayistic stating-what’s-there.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of impermanence, entropy as dance rather than enemy, and witnessing without judgment as a form of love are woven through consistent images of decay, regeneration, and non-interference. The conceptual move that “to witness without judgment was the rarest form of love” is powerful and well-prepared by prior images. However, that final sentence states the thesis outright, tipping slightly into essayistic moralizing rather than trusting subtext. Overall, resonance is strong, but the ending is a shade too declarative for top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of “ordinary magic,” attentiveness, and intergenerational wonder are woven consistently through setting, object, and action, with the curl’s final transfer reweighting earlier mentions. The piece effectively argues that magic is quiet, communal, and rooted in place and ritual rather than spectacle, and the eclipse’s grandeur is deliberately subordinated to the shared stillness. Some thematic statements verge on explicit thesis (“magic didn’t shout; it whispered”) and risk slight sermonizing. Even so, they remain grounded enough in concrete particulars to avoid full slide into platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme—stories as structural rather than decorative, able to realign a broken reality—is woven (appropriately) through recurring images of threads, dragons, rifts, and the “teeth” of silence. The shift from passive preservation to active weaving of testimony offers a strong, non-literal answer to the initial problem of entropy. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“Not to restore the axis—but to realign the stories around it”), edging toward telling what the images already imply. Still, the conceptual and emotional resonance of walls “smiling back” and stories as mending work is substantial and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of open secrets, guidance versus prediction, and the ethics of subtle orchestration are tightly woven through fortunes, tides, and the lighthouse’s beam. The story smartly distinguishes conducting from prophesying and ties meaning to recognition rather than revelation. However, several lines step into essayistic explanation (“the real mechanism wasn’t mysticism—it was orchestration, by directing flow”), reducing subtextual power. The ending resonates, but the thematic work sometimes tells what the images already show.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—interrogating assumptions, the ethics of rhetoric, silence as both weapon and sanctuary—is intricately woven through images (the palette, question-mark, “unasked” glyph) and the possession’s hunger for certainty. The ending’s insight, that the entity’s core assumption is its monopoly on questioning, nicely reweights all prior rhetorical sparring. At times, the piece edges toward meta-philosophical exposition (“the careful, cruel, clarifying art of rhetoric”) that states what the story has already shown. Still, the thematic throughline is coherent, resonant, and avoids tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—memory as recursive, art as a way to transform loss into score rather than absence—is organically embedded in the nautilus, the fortunes-for-ghosts, and the conducting frame. The image of the logarithmic spiral as a model for how memory deepens is both conceptually precise and dramatically used. The ending’s line, “she had remembered how to try,” offers a quiet but resonant answer to the story’s question about what to do with irretrievable time. One slightly on-the-nose sentence (“Her motivation was clear, though absurd to outsiders…”) tips toward authorial explanation rather than pure emergence, keeping this out of the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of identity as branching recursion, refusal of a single “correct” path, and the necessity of integrating shameful past selves are woven through the imagery (procedural generation, timelines brushing close, echoes merging). The final realization (“I am not one path. I am the branching. The fracture. The recursion.”) crisply reframes the premise. However, several theme statements are quite explicit and thesis-like, edging toward essayistic rather than fully subtextual, which slightly flattens the lingering ambiguity a top-tier literary piece often preserves.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: silence as music, trauma as vibration and rupture, inversion (backward songs) as a way to re-encounter pain. The “filament of hush” motif that first feels fragile later thickens into a shared, resilient stillness, reweighting earlier imagery without explicit moralizing. Some lines edge close to thesis statements (“place where silence learned to scream”) but remain anchored in concrete event. The final conceptual turn—the void as potential—is earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of institutional deception versus personal integrity, and of solitude evolving into active resistance through precise record-keeping, arise organically from Elias’s profession and choices. The idea of “rewriting the maps” dovetails nicely with his work imposing order on chaos and the notion of reality’s edges being falsified. The final covenant language and “not with rage, but with records” offer a resonant, non-didactic answer to how one resists erasure. A few lines verge on thematic explicitness, but they’re still grounded enough in character to avoid sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, scent, extinction, and grief as preservation emerge organically from her profession, the extinct plants, and the encoded vial. The visualized glyphs offer strong non-literal images that embody the idea of memories as language in the air. However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements—“She knew the answer lay not in chemistry, but in chronology” and “For grief, she realizes, is not the enemy of memory; it is its guardian…”—which edge into overt moralizing and reduce subtext. The final realization still resonates, but some of the thematic weight is told rather than left to image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic core—impossible choices as false binaries, time as weave not line, and morality as contextual and fluid—is rich and meaningfully threaded through Silas, the rope, the beings, and the village. The rope’s revaluation from “damage” to “record” is a strong, concrete thematic turn that reweights prior material. However, the story often states its thesis outright (“The impossible choice was never about right or wrong; it was about the illusion of control,” “They’re here to show us that time isn’t a line—it’s a weave”), which blunts subtext and feels sermonistic for a top-tier literary venue. The ending image of the rope-bridge between houses and fears is resonant, but the explicit explanations slightly undercut its quiet power.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of beauty in the unfinished and of silence as a charged canvas emerges strongly from actions and images: unresolved chords, half-bloomed orchids, shipwrecks, and the chronic hush becoming “sacred.” The mendicant’s bowl and the child’s scorched petal give the theme concrete embodiment in the final beats. One line—“This is the work: not to fix, not to finish, but to unbind the beauty coiled in the incomplete”—leans close to direct thesis, slightly muting subtextual power. Overall, though, the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by showing, not explaining, the value of the unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of authenticity vs. counterfeit feeling, the weight of “half truths,” and the ethics of mediated emotion are woven through objects and actions (petal, static, smashed vials) rather than mere essaying. Vael’s shift from selling polished emotions to offering “space to feel them…without judgment or polish” nicely reweights the premise. However, a few lines state thesis-like ideas rather directly (“Half truths, she thinks, are the only truths most people can bear”; the explicit invitation at the end), edging toward didactic clarity. The resonance is still strong, but a touch more reliance on implication over declaration would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of recognizing invisible labor and the cyclical nature of compassion is embodied rather than preached, especially through the anonymous notes, repeated phrase “You are seen,” and the workers’ reciprocal act of naming new silent contributors. The locket’s reappearances and the final image of a “gentler economy” measured in human gestures offer a clear, non-didactic answer to the story’s thematic question. There is some risk of sentimentality because no darker counter-pressure surfaces, but the specificity of the harbor details keeps it mostly grounded. The conceptual repricing of value—from coin to kindness—is clean and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of chosen community, art as connective tissue, and loneliness transformed into relational infrastructure are well integrated with concrete motifs (webs, loom, reeds, tags). The final image of Lira facilitating others’ entry into the web offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening ache. However, the piece sometimes states its thematic stance too directly (“myth was the first stitch in community’s quilt,” “The webs of kinship thickened…”), edging toward expositional rather than fully subtextual resonance. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but slightly cushioned by this explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of memory, extinction, time as sculptable medium, and art as an anchor for what history erodes emerge organically from her work and the world’s rules (“species erased not by extinction but by temporal erosion”). The final movement—echoes becoming real creatures, the city waking into birdsong, her illustrations as anchors—reweights the entire premise without resorting to moralizing. There’s a compelling subtext about how representation can resurrect or at least stabilize the forgotten, handled in concrete images rather than abstractions. Some complexity (e.g., ethical ambiguity of borrowing time from the giant) is hinted at but not fully interrogated, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—emotion as something that can be patterned without being reduced, and ambiguous loss as transformation rather than erasure—emerges organically from objects and actions (equations as lullabies, fruit as compass, glass eyes as calibration). The final movement reweights prior images to suggest that patterns and connections persist even through distance. A couple of lines verge on essayistic statement (“Because buried optimism isn’t hope shouted into voids…”), but they remain grounded in concrete context and don’t collapse into moralizing. The piece leaves a lingering conceptual and emotional aftereffect rather than a tidy thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of visibility, memory, and resistance to erasure emerge organically from concrete particulars—the tape fragment, the returned relics, the staff’s note—rather than from imposed moralizing. The echoed line “if you’re listening, you’re not alone” is a strong thematic and emotional hinge that reweights the entire story without over-explaining. A few lines tilt toward thesis statement territory, but they mostly remain grounded enough in her lived texture to avoid sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of reconfiguring human–nature relations—from control and categorization to kinship and belonging—is woven through recurring images (root/sky, notes vs. glow, owner vs. participant). Lindy’s metamorphosis mirroring her own reluctance is a satisfying, resonant conceptual shift. However, some thematic statements are a bit explicit (“She understood then… It was waiting—for her”; “I stopped trying to fix what was never broken”), nudging toward authorial gloss rather than fully trusting subtext. The emotional aftereffect is still strong, but the moral is slightly overspelled.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around grief-as-archive, the ethics of preservation, and the moment when loss becomes artifact or legacy. The brooch and later shard embody a shift from hoarding relics to entering into exchange with the ocean, which reweights the opening premise. The single explicit formulation—“The moment when grief becomes legacy…”—edges toward didactic but is earned by the concrete particulars leading up to it. The ending avoids moralizing, offering instead a reconfigured stance that feels quietly, honestly unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thematic throughline—unseen forces as integral to everyday magic, the value of ambiguity, darkness as what makes light meaningful—is coherent and organically seeded. The final realization that the unseen is “the quiet between notes” reweights the whole cave and pearl. Yet the theme gets spelled out in a somewhat didactic paragraph rather than leaving more of it to subtext and image. A touch more restraint and trust in implication would lift this to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thematically, the story is rich: absence as navigable terrain, memory as chart, grief as geography, and silence as a shaped, honored space rather than a void. These ideas arise from very concrete actions—listening to frayed memories, mapping “where they had been missed,” proposing names spoken without monuments—rather than from abstract lecturing. The final explanation to children of “how we learned to sail through silence” gracefully reweights the whole piece without becoming a blunt moral. Slightly explicit lines like “mapping grief into geography” are eloquent but edge toward thesis, keeping this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of truth, readiness, and the dissolution of neat before/after binaries are strongly integrated: arrows as readiness rather than secrets, the fortress as chorus, and the final line about walking “not away, but toward” all reweight prior material. The story often trusts image and event (cracks pointing like a kneeling city, whispers of swallowed confessions) to do thematic work rather than overt moralizing. A few lines at the end (“The starlit vault in mist had not been a setting, but a threshold. The hour had not divided…”) edge toward explicit thesis-statement territory, slightly reducing the lingering ambiguity. Still, the conceptual shift around what transformation really entails carries a genuine aftertaste of complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—attentive presence as a kind of courage, and memory as an entangled, communal music—emerges organically from the tile, whales, and her choice to archive “for the next one who needs to hear.” The final realization that the magic is “not in the object, but in the entanglement” reweights prior material without feeling like a neat moral. There are a few nearly declarative lines (“Her motivation wasn’t fame or discovery, but to sculpt space for reflection”) that weaken subtext by stating what the story already shows. Still, the emotional aftereffect is coherent and lingering, with genuine, unsentimental tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The thematic throughline—finality, the sacredness of goodbye, and the boredom of endless survival—is well integrated into concrete images (shattered god-heart, unfinished human last thoughts, the humming plain of farewells). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: what lies beyond is not oblivion but a charged field of closures that finally rekindles his wonder. There’s minimal sermonizing; abstractions like “the accumulated weight of all farewells” are grounded by small, specific echoes (lullaby, soldier’s oath, poet’s stanza). The insight is strong if somewhat directly articulated rather than left entirely to implication.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematically, the piece is coherent and resonant: equity vs. profit, liquidity vs. calcification, and “waiting actively” as an ethic of nonviolent change all mesh well with the ink motif. Many individual images (clauses dissolving, invitations instead of summons) carry real subtext. However, the story leans heavily into explicit thesis language (“the mathematics of fair trade,” “breached the fortress of unfairness,” “not with violence, not with virtue, but with waiting”), especially in the final paragraphs, edging into sermonizing. This directness blunts ambiguity and undercuts what could be a more powerfully implicit resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: authorship as collaboration, the porous boundary between fiction and memory, and the idea of communal, invented histories accumulating like tree rings or radio static in the mountain. The lamp-as-conduit and the bonsai-as-archives become thematic engines, not just pretty images, and the ending’s invitation—“Add Your Texture”—offers a non-didactic reweighting of everything before. There is no overt moralizing; instead, the story trusts its images and the protagonist’s quiet shift to carry the meaning. The only minor limitation is that the thematic field stays tightly in one register (art/fiction/memory) without much counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of erasure, bureaucracy versus lived texture, and nameless identity are woven through concrete particulars rather than explicit moralizing (“erasure was never clean—that even poison left residue”). The poison label, the child’s shoe, and the tides all accrue meaning and reweight the premise by the end. The final paragraphs articulate a clear thematic position—remembering by texture rather than by name—without collapsing into didacticism. A slight tendency to state concepts (“He was stitching a counter-narrative”) rather than always embody them keeps this short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of grief, control via revision, and the futility/kindness of seeking cosmic answers for personal loss emerge organically from particulars: the seashell as repository of rewritten conversations, the “ephemeral compass,” and the final realization about buried silence. The riddle’s answer—“What do you bury when you refuse to speak?”—is powerful but stated a bit directly, edging toward explicit thesis. The ending image (walking into dawn with humming shell halves, living beside unsolved riddles) provides genuine resonance and avoids a pat moral. Overall, the piece leaves a textured aftereffect with some room for ambiguity in how she’ll live going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of gentrification, collective ownership, and memory as resistance emerge naturally from the particulars—graffiti parables, the foundation stone, contracts “like eels”—rather than explicit moralizing. The ending’s conceptual answer is nuanced: victory is partial and temporary (“Not defeated — postponed”), and joy is framed as a political act rather than mere escapism. Some imagery edges toward slogan (“THIS FLOATS TOGETHER,” “REMEMBER”), which slightly flattens subtext into manifesto at moments where a quieter image might linger longer. Overall, the piece invites reflection about who owns cities and how resistance can be organized without violence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—obsolescence, memory, and beauty that “outlasts” utility—is woven through specific images: the rusted hourglass, the decommissioned receivers, her archival label, the idea of a message meant to be unheard. The engineers’ intention (“We were clever, and we knew it wouldn’t matter”) and her later realization that she’s “keeping vigil” rather than archiving give the piece a strong, quietly devastating thematic spine. A few lines tilt toward explicit thesis (“Some things aren’t meant to be seen. They’re meant to be known.”), nudging into mild over-articulation. Nevertheless, the final charged images and the “farewell sung to an empty auditorium” resonance keep the piece from feeling didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of repair, translation of failure into direction, and mending trajectories are woven consistently through the depot, the drone, and the widow’s music box. The final lines—"She mended trajectories. / She turned fractures into flight paths."—are resonant but nearly spell out the thesis, edging toward explicit moral rather than purely emergent insight. Nonetheless, the concrete images (orchids unfurling, the hummingbird’s flight, the ship’s departure) carry genuine emotional and conceptual aftereffect. A touch more reliance on implication over statement would lift this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme integrates elegantly: language as a way of listening to the world, maps as means to origins rather than borders, and the idea that beginnings are quiet, stubborn, and unspectacular (“Rivers don’t start with fanfare; they start with seepage, silence, and stubbornness—much like me”). The phrasebook, condensation, and atlas all serve this thematic thread, culminating in a final act that answers the central question non-literally by privileging witnessing over conquest. Some thematic lines lean toward explicit statement, but they’re voice-true and grounded in specifics, not didactic. The ending’s repricing—rivers begin “where language listens, where ice remembers”—reweights the entire story with satisfying resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of memory, continuity, and negotiated coexistence between living and lingering are woven tightly through image and action: tuning to “memory,” rain as the sky remembering, the town “rebalanced” rather than resurrected. The final redefinition of success (not restoration but shared balance) reweights everything that came before. Some lines verge on explicit thesis-statement territory (“Not resurrected. Not restored... But rebalanced—shared...”), which slightly undercuts the otherwise strong reliance on subtext and image. Still, the afterimage is emotionally and conceptually rich.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of acceptance versus control, silence as a transformed form of violence/peace, and “harnessing the ephemeral” by becoming a vessel rather than a captor emerge organically from the action and imagery. The priestess’s backstory vision elegantly mirrors Elira’s choice, deepening the idea of unsnarling violence into stillness. However, some key insights are stated a bit too directly (“She understood now: to harness the ephemeral was not to capture it, but to become its vessel”), slightly tipping into explanation rather than leaving the image to carry the weight. The ending still leaves a resonant, non-literal answer about memory, sacrifice, and release.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of belief, testimony, institutional silencing, and inherited mistrust emerge organically through specific images: the confessional lattice, vanished “liars,” and the lighthouse turned into a beacon of witness. The final conceptual turn—truth made literal light, owned by a structure that “never lies”—reweights the entire piece without resorting to essayistic moralizing. There is a touch of declarative neatness in the closing aphorism, but it feels earned by prior scene work rather than tacked on. The resonance lingers, inviting reflection on how societies treat inconvenient truths.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of debt versus balance, love curdled into obligation, and the transformation of haunting into heritage emerge organically from recurring images (roots, runes, nectar, resonance) and the bride’s history. The realization that “the debt was never punishment; it was balance” reweights earlier material without collapsing into a pat moral, and the final tasting of twilight fruit holds complex, bittersweet emotion. Subtext about intergenerational burden and complicity is present without didactic exposition. A touch less direct thematic labeling in a few lines could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of repair vs erasure, generational defiance, and honoring scars as “the story’s spine” emerge organically from specific acts and objects (grandmother’s hurricane lullabies, the failed attempts to destroy the plate, the stitching of fractures). Recurring motifs—broken precedents, tides, singing canyon, child-with-storm—reconfigure meaning at the end, suggesting that mending is both rebellion and blueprint. However, several explicit thesis statements (“She sewed not to fix the world, but to remind it…,” “proof that reverence grows best in the soil of ruin”) tip toward on-the-nose moralizing, slightly dulling subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of faith-as-rhythm, diaspora and return, and rebuilding through attention rather than conquest emerge organically from the objects and actions, especially the sundial’s reorientation and the bones/blossoms interweave. Subtext is strong in images like petals falling upward and roots “remembering their purpose,” which reweight the idea of interrupted journeys. However, the final third leans into explicit thesis statements (“Faith, she understood, was not a monument to preserve…”) that edge into essayistic moralizing. The resonance is real but somewhat over-explained, dulling the afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of marginalia, slowness vs speed, analog intimacy vs digital efficiency, and the invisibility of children’s labor of meaning are woven through concrete images (chalk games, mail chutes, canceled stamps). The idea that value lives in “the spaces between” is elegantly embodied in her practice and the widow’s offloaded grief. However, the final paragraph drifts into explicit thesis (“That was the future she believed in: not faster, but deeper. / Not louder, but kinder. / Not digital, but drawn—”) which tips toward authorial statement rather than leaving resonance to the images. The emotional aftereffect is thoughtful but somewhat curated, not fully earned through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of quiet, underestimated wisdom, the value of listening to “unheard stories,” and truth encoded in overlooked media (thread, flame) are woven tightly into concrete actions. Recurring images—the eternal flame, silk constellations, false stars—gain thematic weight by the end, especially in the line “They called her a fool still, even as they bowed.” The single explicit thesis sentence (“wisdom need not shout to win”) edges toward stating the moral rather than trusting the imagery. Overall, resonance is strong and lingers, with only minor overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of apology, liminality, and reconfiguring silence are woven through concrete motifs—the unsent letters, the condensation messages, the memory-cost of healing—rather than asserted abstractly. The idea of locating “the moment before deciding” is reweighted at the end into a live, present-tense possibility, which nicely reframes the opening premise. Subtext about how we rewrite others’ messages (“afraid” to “alive”) and the necessity of gentle self-regard is mostly carried in image and action. The final line “Go gently. You are loved.” flirts with overt sentimental statement, slightly reducing ambiguity, though it still arises organically from the condensation motif rather than feeling like an imposed moral.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of trauma, witnessing, peace as suturing rather than signing, and “shared anxieties” braiding into bearable forms emerge organically from the images of coral, tides, and the cast’s smudges. The closure reweights the premise by redefining her ache as kinship and symbiosis, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s questions about how to live with inherited pain. Yet several lines in the final third explicitly articulate the thematic thesis (“She hadn’t healed the past — that was never the point,” “not of survival, but of symbiosis”), edging toward essayistic explanation. That slight moralizing keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of art as awakening rather than preservation, communal memory vs ruin, and joy freed from expectation emerge organically from the optics ritual and the elders’ stories. The callback where onlookers physically feel warmth and recovered memories solidifies the idea that art can re-activate dormant experience. However, the piece edges into explicit thesis-stating (“her motivation had never been preservation — it was rediscovery,” “not to impress, but to awaken; not to capture, but to release”), diluting some subtextual power. A touch more trust in image over explanation would push this toward the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of curiosity vs. certainty, preservation vs. exchange, and nested layers of awakening are coherently braided through motif (mural phases, nickel, stories migrating into her). The final reweighting—she “hadn’t come to fix anything. She’d come to be un-fixed”—nicely reframes her professional identity and the premise. Occasional lines (“Curiosity, not certainty, now guided her steps”) flirt with explicit statement but are supported by sufficient scene work that they don’t collapse into sermonizing. Overall, the piece invites reflection without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of language as resistance, surveillance capitalism of cognition, and collective versus individual defiance are woven through objects (gourd seed, comma-shaped beetle), institutions, and choice. The tax on thoughts is never lectured; instead it surfaces in details like gratitude being “traceable, taxable” and lullabies becoming subversive. The ending images—children singing banned lullabies, librarians shelving glyph-coded books, the gourd rattling at the Bureau—recast the earlier covert acts as the germ of a broader cultural insurgency. A few near-slogan lines (“the sky forgets no grammar”) skate close to explicit thesis, but they’re embedded enough in character history to avoid sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—transmuting suffering into “reef-shadow joy” rather than erasing it—is woven through the blossom armistice, the shell, the insomnia, and the way her songs ease others unbeknownst to her. The story resists moralizing; it presents her sleepless devotion and chosen solitude as costly yet meaningful, inviting reflection on art’s relationship to pain and peace. Recurring images (blossoms, shells, galaxies as flowers, roots and rupture) deepen rather than merely decorate the thematic core. The only slight limiter is that some thematic formulations (“reef-shadow joy”) are named and then explained, edging toward conceptual neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theming around memory, loss, and ethical stewardship of the past emerges organically from the particulars: light that illuminates absences, a crack that is both damage and portal, and a museum that can be killed by over-control. The refusal to resurrect, paired with the brief reanimation of the nook’s self-knowledge, frames a nuanced position on remembrance without sermonizing. The final image—satisfaction “of a vow kept” rather than joy—reprices the entire narrative as a meditation on faithful limitation, not triumph. This is rich and lingering, though the thematic field remains fairly unified rather than opening a more sharply ambivalent counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—language as binding promise and trust as a fragile, performative structure—is woven through every choice: interconnected promises, betrayal encoded in a single altered harmonic, and the final convergence of paths. The Silence as betrayal rather than ignorance is an excellent thematic pivot rooted in story logic. The closing image of prismatic light as “scattered promises kept” offers a non-literal but clear answer to the initial despair about divergence without lapsing into explicit moralizing. A touch more on-page ambivalence or lingering risk could have deepened the complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of control vs mercy, systems as living things, and “encrypted compassion” emerge organically through images (weeping-eye fissure, woman feeding fish, breathing architecture) and her technical choices. The final decision to smuggle mercy in as “efficiency metrics” gives a satisfying, non-literal answer to the central question. A few lines (“This was her rebellion: not sabotage, but synchronization”; “that control must be tempered with compassion”) edge toward thesis statement, slightly reducing the subtextual subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme arises organically from particulars: paper trails, pigeons, and dust motes embody questions of memory, preservation, and the tension between erasure and inscription. The reweighting at the end—logs as scores, attic as a place of return rather than loss, history as composition not forgery—is resonant and earned. Lines like “Balance…wasn’t stillness—it was the tension between falling and flying” verge on explicit thesis but stay anchored in image and character. Overall, the piece invites reflection on how we curate our own stories without collapsing into didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—sacred thresholds as sites of chosen sacrifice and “necessary distances” as both protection and loss—is deeply integrated through maze design, wood grain, weather code, and the father’s fate. The realization that “sacred thresholds aren’t marked by stone or scripture, but by the weight of what’s willingly left behind” is a strong, earned thematic crystallization, though it approaches explicit statement. The final image of her unfolding into the space “between before and after” reweights everything with clear conceptual and emotional resonance. Complexity is present (distance as both prison and sanctuary), though the piece leans slightly toward a unified thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—belonging coaxed from thresholds, ruins, and reclamation—is woven tightly through setting, objects, and her vocation, with strong symbolic continuity (burnt feather, emotional ley lines, reclaimed lab, impossible fireflies). The final reconfiguration (belonging as something to carry upward and teach) nicely reprices the earlier solitude and “exile and embrace” language. Some lines edge into explicit thesis (“to teach others how belonging isn’t found, but coaxed from thresholds, shared breaths, and impossible fireflies”), which slightly undercuts the otherwise earned resonance. Still, the emotional aftereffect of quiet, luminous acceptance feels authentic rather than sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of loss-as-gift, memory as route-making, and following what’s left rather than mourning what’s gone are woven through seeds, bird, and crater glass in a consistent, image-driven way. The twist that “missing pieces weren’t lost…They were given away” offers a satisfying conceptual repricing of the premise. That said, several lines slide into aphoristic statement (“For what is gloom, if not the shadow cast by joy too vast to hold?”; “Some paths disappear, yes. But only so new ones can be sung into being”), edging toward sermonizing rather than letting images carry the weight. The piece still resonates, but the moral is a bit too directly voiced for the strictest literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.0)
    The themes of wonder in the mundane, ordered randomness, and art as a response to tedium are organically rooted in Elias’s practice and the audience transformations. However, the piece leans into explicit statement—“Chaos is just order waiting for its choreographer,” “wonder isn’t rare”—that edges toward thesis articulation rather than pure emergence from action and image. The bishop, coins, and tide do good thematic work as recurring motifs. The emotional aftereffect is warm and contemplative rather than piercing, which suits the design but keeps it from feeling fully profound.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—memory as outlawed yet ineradicable, absence as generative, art as embodied defiance—is rich and organically woven through tides, gaps, and inscription motifs. The notion of “observing gaps” and writing a “cosmic verse on mortal skin” culminates in a resonant answer: she moves from solitary resistance to teaching others, reconfiguring how memory functions in her world. A few lines flirt with over-explicitness (“The tide dancer had not fled the world. She had rewritten it.”), slightly reducing the need for reader inference. Still, the emotional and conceptual aftereffect is strong and lingers beyond the text.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of illuminating value in the mundane and reading “between the lines” of physical reality builds coherently from prisms, hulls-as-stories, and tide rings into the final compass-points metaphor. Subtext in images—mist as veil, scars on the sea, laundry lines reframed as stained glass—is strong and mostly avoids outright moralizing. However, some lines slip toward essayistic exposition (“His motivation was simple, though rarely understood”) rather than letting theme emerge purely from scene. The quiet ending reweights prior material but not with the force that a higher-stakes conflict might have allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of grief, witness, and translation of pain are organically woven through the letters, scars, and box, and the final unsentimental reassurance (“I remember. I’m still here. You’re not alone.”) resonates. Subtext—his own need for solace mirrored in the children’s questions—is strong. However, several lines verge on essayistic thesis statements (“He’d learned early that pain, untranslated, turns toxic”; “That was his motivation: to translate pain into a universal language”), edging into overt moralizing. This explicitness slightly blunts otherwise rich, image-driven thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic work around hope as structure, grief as potential lift, and small, precise interventions rippling across realities is strong and coherent. Recurring images (gauge, trial balloons, tides, patterns) accrue meaning and are reweighted at the resonance cascade. Lines like “hope wasn’t a feeling—it was a structure” edge into direct statement, but the surrounding imagery earns them. The piece invites reflection on laborious, non-heroic hope without collapsing into tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, grief, inheritance, and the ethics of witnessing are strongly woven through concrete images (half-burned diaries, negative strip, wildflowers in glass, initials in wet concrete). Subtext largely arises from juxtaposition—burned-but-preserved grief, stone that might forgive, the notion of offering pain to walls—rather than exposition. However, a few explicit thematic lines (“Legacy’s burden was not meant to be carried alone.”) edge into on-the-nose statement and slightly flatten what the imagery already implies. Overall the ending offers a resonant, if somewhat articulated, answer: to transform solitary burden into shared, ongoing dreaming.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of hope, permission to change, and the reconfiguration of grief and fear emerge organically through images (borrowed heartbeat, children’s lullabies, mirrors of possibility) rather than explicit statement. The third mirror showing her younger self with the child elegantly reframes the ritual as cyclical and intimate, not abstractly magical. The ending’s idea of “gentle fractures where light could enter” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how change enters closed lives. Ambiguity feels purposeful and fertile rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of the price of redemption, the binding power of ritual, and peace as an ongoing practice rather than a single victory are well integrated with the objects and actions on the page. Images like the overwritten treaties, scratched-out names, and imperfect mosaic of thumbprints carry real thematic weight. However, several lines state the thesis quite directly (“Redemption, she had learned, was never free…”, “This… is not a treaty. It is a mirror.”), edging toward didactic clarity rather than allowing subtext to do the work. The ending resonates, but its emotional and conceptual answer is a bit more told than it needs to be.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of extinction, guilt, and the insufficiency yet necessity of minor atonements emerge organically from particulars: the manufactured drought, the non-hatching egg, the choice of echo over life. The final movement—“Not life. / Not justice. / But echo.”—reweights everything that precedes it without lapsing into didactic moralizing. Moral ambiguity is held without false equivalence: he remains ruthless; the act is neither absolution nor meaningless. The only small check is that the echo/atonement idea is very foregrounded, almost thesis-like, which flirts with explicitness while mostly staying on the right side of lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of repression vs resonance, conformity vs individual voice, and the ethics of remembering are woven effectively through motifs of echoes, lullabies, and silence. The ending’s idea that her own echo is “braided into the fabric of all that had dared to speak” is a strong, non-literal answer to the story’s core question. However, thematic statements like “Her motivation was not vengeance, nor fame, nor even justice—it was resonance” edge toward essayistic clarity, undercutting some subtextual power. A touch more trust in image over explanation would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic core—ethical storytelling as accountability rather than purity—is rich and emerges from strong particulars: the forged texts, the puppets, Mira’s line about poison, the veteran’s outburst. The campfire stick and “stories burn twice” motif effectively refract the cost of narrative harm. However, several lines state the thesis directly (“ethical storytelling wasn’t about purity, but accountability; Not erasing darkness, but illuminating who lit the match”), edging into moral summary rather than leaving it fully to image and action. This explicitness slightly blunts what is otherwise nuanced, resonant thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of ephemerality, erased histories, unspectacular devotion, and beauty without audience are woven tightly through action and image (moth vs. monarchs, knots that will unravel, signals “not for rescue or reply”). The final pages reweight the premise effectively: the signal going “backward—into the velvet dark of collective amnesia” is a strong conceptual turn that complicates the easy solace of remembrance. A few lines edge toward explicit thesis (“permanence was a myth whispered by the desperate”) rather than letting scene work do the full job. Overall, the resonance is strong and lingering, if a touch over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of preservation vs. ossification, how memory lives in vibration rather than artifact, and the ethics of anonymous devotion emerge organically from the casting ritual without sermonizing; lines like “not as echoes, but as living resonance” are enacted by the helix scene. The rope, bell, and helix form a strong motif chain that shifts meaning by the end, particularly once the device is left for future strangers and wild creatures, reweighting the idea of liturgy. The after-forgiveness frame ties personal absolution to a larger, communal responsibility toward the forgotten, achieving a complex, unsentimental tenderness. A small limiter is that the narrator occasionally edges close to explicitly stating the thesis (“This is preservation”) where the images are already doing that work.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The thematic throughline—agency vs destiny, surrender vs reclamation, continuity vs transcendence—is well-integrated, with strong motifs (paths, forest vs bunker, directive’s “release”). The insight that paths resonate with a walker’s unresolved grief and that “You were always the path” is conceptually satisfying and reweights prior images. However, several moments state theme outright (“That was the answer, blooming in her chest…”, “And memory, she knew, was the first step toward transcendence”), which tips toward essayistic explanation rather than fully trusting subtext. The piece still leaves a resonant afterimage but with a touch of over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of devotion vs utility, science vs magic, and anonymity vs empire are richly woven through particulars like the magic square, his logbook, and the neglected palace. The line “magic, to him, was merely physics undiscovered, and devotion, merely data awaiting decryption” edges toward explicit statement but is still anchored in character. The ending’s image of future rulers sitting unknowing over the covenant and the universe “that noticed everything—even devotion encrypted in arithmetic” offers a resonant conceptual repricing of value and recognition. Slight over-articulation of thesis keeps it from a higher band, but the thematic integration is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematic material—resentment, nonviolence, memory, release—is rich and coherently threaded through the music box and bodily imagery. The reweighting of “release” as re-membering the self rather than forgiving others is a strong, non-trivial answer to the story’s question. However, the piece frequently states its thesis outright (“This was the lesson: resentment cannot be argued away”; “pacifism required more cunning than war”), veering into commentary rather than letting the images and actions carry it. That explicitness undercuts some potential depth and subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of boundaries (sleep/wake, loss/finding, regret/craft), the cost of magic, and the ethics of capturing a runaway wish emerge organically from mirrors, sextant, fog, and her backstory. The piece avoids explicit moralizing; instead, resonance comes from images like the dream that “fled the weight of expectation” and her quiet, complicit capture of it. The final notion that no dream will dare flee again conceptually reweights the entire ritual with a faintly troubling permanence. Some complexity (e.g., deeper unease or doubt) could be pushed further to reach the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of intergenerational repair, stubborn love, and the difference between redemption and ongoing maintenance emerge organically from tools, vows, and orchard labor. The recurring motifs (ribbons, vows as leaves, honey and thread) reweight meaning by the end, especially the blue ribbon/vow fusion contrasted with the new green scrap. However, the closing lines tilt toward explicit thesis (“Accidental wisdom…”, “wisdom, like orchards, grows best…”) which slightly undercuts the otherwise strong subtext. The emotional aftertaste is nonetheless resonant and avoids tidy reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of nonlinear inheritance, chosen/borrowed legacies, and resonance across timelines are tightly integrated with the plot and recurring images (cameo, orchard, names on petals). The shift from treating gaps as errors to viewing them as a “field to be harvested” is a clear, earned thematic turn. The “simply complicated” refrain, bathroom-breakthrough motif, and word “Again” all support a layered exploration of repetition and possibility. At moments, the conceptual explanation of nonlinear inheritance edges close to exposition; slightly more reliance on implication over statement would heighten subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic spine—rescue vs. reconciliation, gaps as intentional rests, knowledge choosing when to be found—is rich and well integrated with the images of lacunae, unlearned lessons, and the listening mountain. The conceptual repricing at the end (“I am the lesson you refused to learn: that rescue is not removal, but reconciliation”) is clear and retrofits Kael’s failure meaningfully. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis in near-aphoristic form (“unheard symphony needs conductors, not saviors”), pushing toward explicit moralizing rather than fully trusting scene and subtext. This slight over-articulation mutes what could otherwise be a more haunting, open-ended resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from images and events: names as selves, memory as mutable, freedom as both release and confinement. Recurring motifs—the swatch card, narrative threads, trapped freedom, fog—are reweighted by the ending’s insight that choosing one’s own “bars” can still constitute freedom. Lines like “Truth didn’t matter; belief did” and the final “if you chose the bars” skate close to explicit thesis, but they are grounded enough in the character’s lived stakes to avoid sermonizing. The aftereffect is contemplative and slightly haunting rather than neatly moralistic.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of integrating absence rather than erasing it and of “weaving silence into structure” are well seeded via the vanished embassy, anomalous door, and her vocation as an archivist. However, the story leans into explicit articulation—“Clarity wasn’t about erasing mystery…” and the closing ledger note—veering toward essayistic moralizing rather than trusting the images. Subtext is present in the rope/door/clock interplay, but the overt statements blunt some resonance. The thematic throughline is coherent and attractive, just a bit overexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of silence as structure, tuning rather than banishing chaos, and finding calm within storm are woven organically through images (fracture patterns as scores, captured silences, storms settling into drift). The final image of a tuned cave and a once-violent being cradling the echo stone works as a quiet, non-didactic answer to the story’s question. Still, because conflict and cost remain relatively soft, the thematic payoff—while resonant—is not as searing or complex as it could be. There’s room for a sharper sense of what is sacrificed or endangered by this philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of meaning versus randomness, convergence rather than coincidence, and broken things rekindling wonder are woven consistently through stars, glass, memories, and the shard of hush. The final revelation that the beacon is a receiver and she a conduit effectively reweights earlier material and offers a non-literal answer: listening itself is salvific work. However, several lines state the thesis a bit too plainly (“Coincidences? No. / Convergences.”; the closing sentence’s explicit moralism), nudging the piece toward gentle sermon rather than leaving more space for the reader. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but slightly cushioned by this over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    Memory, identity, and chosen erasure are thoroughly woven through concrete images (shadows as grief durations, lullabies woven into wind, her name written “along the edge of a raindrop’s refraction”). The thematic throughline—archives as living, atmospheric entities and the idea of becoming what one studies—culminates elegantly when the hush moves “inside her — not as emptiness, but as archive.” At times the piece edges toward thesis-like statements (“She wrote not to preserve, but to resurrect”), slightly flattening subtext into commentary. Given the relatively gentle conflict, the thematic resonance is strong but not paradigm-shifting, and the conflict cap keeps this out of the very high band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hope versus despair, and art as defiant prayer, emerge organically from particulars—the archivist’s encoded revelation, the starless sky, the translation of combustion ritual into sound and mosaic. The recurring motifs (ratios as incantations, the rag knot, dust like a constellation, the fortress blooming in defiance) all reweight in the final image of a single star and a “spark” taking root in soul. The piece resists neat moralizing; Lira’s joy feels earned rather than declared, and the world remains largely dark despite her small victory. A tiny limitation is that the “gravity of hopelessness” line skirts close to thematic statement, though it’s still dramatized through the world’s condition.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme is tightly woven: transition periods, liminal spaces, and the “texture of time” recur through objects (cicada), setting (tides, grotto), and the relationship pause. Subtext in the interaction—his silence as suspension, her acceptance instead of pressure—supports the idea of thresholds as sacred rather than merely uncomfortable. Some thematic statements verge on explicit thesis (“Time, she understood now, was not measured in ticks or dates…”), which slightly blunts subtlety even though they remain grounded in the scene. Overall the piece leaves a clear, resonant conceptual and emotional afterimage without collapsing into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thematic throughline—security vs starvation, curated vs wild silence, the cost and value of protected deprivation—is rich and emerges organically from concrete images like tasting snowfall-silence and the bunker’s “designed” hush. The line “They understood then: the bunker’s silence had been a cage…” is close to thesis-stating but is supported by accumulated scene work and not merely asserted. The doll’s threads stitching “fear to freedom” and the final garden silence of “thunderstorms and lullabies” reweight prior material without collapsing into a neat moral. A touch of explicative reflection (“By limiting exposure…”) tips slightly toward authorial commentary but still aligns with the lived arc.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of silence as presence, transit as inner threshold, and care work as quiet, ongoing labor emerge strongly from image and action. The storm glass, chime-trees, and upward waterfall all subtly echo emotional reconfiguration without needing much explanation. However, the explicit thesis sentence about his motivation (“to teach silence how to comfort, not as absence, but as presence…”) veers into mild authorial gloss and reduces some of the subtext’s power. Despite that, the final pattern—the work continuing with a different emotional register—invites reflection beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, non-dominion-based “ascension,” and choosing a wiser adventurous self emerge organically from the throne’s function and the memory-steps. The idea that power is perspective rather than control is dramatized through her experience, not just stated. However, the final line—“the quiet certainty that wisdom and adventure must walk hand in hand, or not at all”—tips into explicit moralizing and slightly flattens the otherwise nuanced resonance. Subtext around lost possibilities and the cost of any chosen self is strong but could be allowed to speak without that final thesis sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematic threads—silence as truth, suffocation and breath, healing that doesn’t rescue but permits self-spark—are well woven through concrete images (ash, scars, lanterns, the fallen knocker). Recurring lines like “She burns bridges carefully” and the redefinition of sanctuary deepen the idea that healing requires costly separation and acceptance of darkness. However, several sentences tip into explicit thesis (“This was the curriculum of suffocation”; the final line reads almost like a crafted aphorism), which flattens some subtext. The resonance is strong, but a bit over-articulated for this venue’s top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of exploitation vs. genuine transformation, pressure turning into “diamonds,” and reclaiming the language of promise from capitalism are woven coherently through character, setting, and the bolt motif. The redefinition of “diamonds” as remembered lessons and of the “quantum promise” as a harvest rather than a pitch gives the ending strong conceptual repricing. Some lines edge toward on-the-nose thesis (“It wasn’t about wealth. It was alchemy of the soul.”; “The quantum promise wasn’t a sales pitch anymore. It was a harvest.”), which slightly flattens subtext into statement. Still, the piece largely earns its insights through specific imagery and situation rather than sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of silence, memory, censorship, and listening-as-power emerge organically from the Golden Silence policy, her training in standing waves, and her refusal to speak. The piece explores the tension between personal and political truth, landing on a resonant irony: the would-be dynasty ender is the legitimate heir. Recurring images (silence, golden shadows, resonance, the gramophone) gain layered meaning by the end without devolving into allegorical signage. A few lines lean toward explicit formulation of ideas (“silence… was the only language the dead still answered”), but they mostly enhance rather than flatten subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from repeated particulars—marionette strings, forgotten patterns, thresholds, and unsnapping—as a meditation on surrendering control to become a conduit for possibility. The final image of a new “grammar” of dawn and a horizon reshaping to meet his gaze reweights everything that came before, turning ritual into a statement about living liminally rather than clanking with certainty. The piece avoids overt moralizing, though some lines (“not the dawn of a new day, but the dawn of a new grammar”) edge close to explicit thesis. Overall, the thematic resonance is deep and cohesive, with ambiguity about cost and consequence left thoughtfully open.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic work around unseen kindness inside institutional indifference is strong and mostly emerges from concrete particulars: the button, dust handprints, crayon drawings, the birthday card. The idea of “turning memorials back into living stories” reweights earlier images effectively. However, the closing paragraphs sometimes state the thesis a bit too directly (“proof that love persists, even in paper and shadow”), nudging toward mild sermonizing. The piece still leaves a resonant aftertaste of moral complexity about how we read archives and pain.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory versus erasure and “tyranny of indifference” are deeply woven into both plot (revised histories, Archive Engine) and imagery (lullabies rewritten, censored stars). The notion that resistance operates through quiet, coded acts rather than spectacle is nicely embodied in Elira’s methods and the closing lines. Some lines edge into thesis-statement territory (“Her motivation was simple, brutal, pure…”, “Coded freedom never announces itself”), which slightly reduces the need for reader inference. Even so, the ending reweights prior material with a resonant conceptual answer about how rebellion propagates.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of silence, beauty as counter-magic, generational burden, and the ethics of erasure are woven through concrete particulars: the grandmother’s lullaby, the tombstone prophecy, the instruction that “Some silences…are louder than screams.” The final image—an empty space where the prism hung and a single dewdrop holding only “the memory of light”—reframes the act as a costly, necessary void rather than an uncomplicated victory. The piece avoids explicit moralizing, leaving a resonant sense that some truths must be unmade, even at the cost of memory and recognition. A bit more dramatized ambivalence or friction in him could further deepen the thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, attention, and the revaluation of prophecy-as-past arise organically from Elira’s practices and the arbor’s responses. Moments like “Most sorted seeds. You sorted silence” encapsulate the piece’s core ethical stance without quite tipping into didacticism, though “The prophecy wasn’t a future event…” edges toward explicit thesis. The final state—a sanctuary where the past harmonizes rather than haunts—offers a resonant answer to the story’s questions about how we honor what’s lost. The relatively soft conflict keeps the thematic exploration powerful but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of certainty versus uncertainty is strongly woven through clocks, compasses, the lost fleet, and the admiral’s journal, with a resonant revaluation at the end (“tools, not answers”). However, some expressions verge on aphorism or on-the-nose thesis (“Plans are anchors,” “to befriend uncertainty in planning”), which slightly undercuts the organic emergence. The final image—leading others into the greenhouse when wind and kettle align—nicely embodies the new stance without over-explaining. Overall, the thematic fabric is rich and coherent, just a bit didactic in phrasing at moments.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—repairing rather than erasing damage, and the ethical weight of naming—is beautifully woven through the kintsugi imagery, the broken coin, and the final golden seam. The story earns much of its insight through image and action, especially the choice to let the coin “break beautifully.” However, several late sentences (“names are not labels, but anchors…”) veer into explicit thesis-stating that flattens some subtext. The piece still resonates, but the moral is more articulated than it needs to be for this level of venue.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of grief, companionship, and laughter as kin to sorrow are powerful and integrated through recurring images (harp, confessions, tooth, giggle). However, several lines state the thesis outright—“She knew grief needed no fixing, only companionship” and “Laughter was not the opposite of sorrow”—which edges into didactic explanation rather than letting images carry the weight. The ending still resonates via concrete particulars (the woman wanting to be silly again, the giggle in the wind), but the explicit commentary blunts some post-story reverberation. The complexity is there; it’s just slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thematically, the piece has a powerful, coherent throughline about trauma as a mode of remembering and mercy as a lived topology rather than a solvable equation; the final realization reweights earlier mathematical and bodily motifs effectively. However, theme is sometimes stated too directly—lines like “This was it—the mathematics of mercy” and “mercy is not an equation to be solved, but a space to be inhabited” edge into overt thesis. The richness of the imagery means the ideas would land without so much explicit labeling. Despite some sermonizing, the conceptual ambition and integration remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of honoring overlooked histories, the ethics of memory, and the quiet nature of truth are woven through concrete images (erased ledgers, vials labeled “Erased Tenderness,” hidden figures in the triptych) rather than mere abstraction. The historian’s arc from silencing grief to recognition, and the final commission involving a child’s door-in-the-sky drawing, both extend the theme from recovery of past suffering toward future-oriented hope. Some sentences verge on thesis statements—“This is how you unfasten grief,” “Between childhood and now, I’ve learned: truth isn’t shouted”—which slightly tips into told wisdom instead of entirely emergent resonance. Nonetheless, the final image of translators carrying “fragments of light…like secret stars” lands as a strong, non-literal thematic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme—ghosts as embodiments of neglect and the ethical duty of witnessing—is woven through objects, dust patterns, and the circus’s history rather than preached. Lines like “ghosts don’t haunt places; they haunt neglect” risk explicitness but are grounded enough in scene work to avoid feeling like thesis statements. The final image of the building “keeping vigil” and him as the awaited witness reweights all prior details and offers a resonant, morally charged stance without neat moralizing. A hint more resistance or ambiguity in his role could deepen complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The thematic core—chaos as generative and equilibrium as a disguised entropy—is woven throughout the events and images, culminating in the line “Chaos was not the enemy of meaning—it was its midwife.” Recurring motifs (frost patterns as instructions, the destabilizing whisper, the library’s curated order) all reweight in the ending, where a damaged system becomes a more “alive” one. The mother’s smile folded into the compressed moment hints at a more intimate exploration of grief and time, adding depth beyond pure concept. Some thematic statements are a bit declarative, slightly reducing the need for the reader’s own inference.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of memory vs. spectacle, revolution vs. reimagining, and silence as a form of wealth emerge organically through objects, methods, and the decoded society’s values. The final repricing—“The real rebellion was against forgetting”—is powerful but edges into on-the-nose thesis-stating rather than pure image or implication. Subtext around grief, failure, and intellectual companionship is handled more deftly, especially in the unfinished-songs motif and the shared transcription work. Overall, resonance lingers, but a touch more restraint in explicit thematic sentences would heighten it.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of truth vs. pretense, memory, and a redemptive “covenant of rust” develop organically from the repairman’s lie, the philosopher’s stone, and the act of mending what isn’t visibly broken. The reframing of rust as revelation rather than decay is conceptually strong and reweights earlier details. Some thematic lines are slightly on-the-nose (“He understood then: the covenant of rust wasn’t about decay—it was about revelation”), nudging toward essayistic statement instead of pure scene. Nonetheless, the ending’s image of carrying an ongoing, honest song in his bones provides a resonant, non-didactic answer to the story’s question.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of surrender, belonging, and knowledge beyond rational explanation are well woven through repeated motifs of scent, silence, and stone memory. The compass pointing toward “moments of surrender” is a strong thematic device, and the reframing of “lost/found” in Riel’s journal deepens the piece’s philosophical thrust. However, some lines edge toward explicit statement—“Not because it defied physics, but because it demanded a different kind of understanding”—that slightly flattens subtext into thesis. The ending image is resonant, but just shy of a fully surprising conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—the reimagining of survival and alliance as shared gesture rather than tech or treaties—emerges coherently from recurrent images of hands, lanterns, and driftwood. The magic slide’s time-spanning handclasps and the communal rituals at the arch create strong subtext about interdependence and memory. However, the piece sometimes states its thesis a bit too directly (“She would show them how to reimagine alliance—not as treaty or tech, but as touch…”), edging toward gentle sermon rather than fully trusting image and action. The whispered line “Simplicity is not absence. It is architecture.” similarly flirts with aphorism, though it is thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of hidden beauty, obscurity, and the paradox of darkness revealing light are woven tightly through postcards, cathedral glass, night-blooming flowers, and her mural practice. The final movement (“Some truths are not for speaking, but for living… she still reckons—not to solve, but to surrender”) offers a resonant answer to the opening mystery without feeling like a blunt moral. A few lines edge into articulated thesis rather than pure scene-based resonance, but they’re supported by enough concrete particulars that they don’t feel hollow. Overall, the conceptual repricing of night, obscurity, and devotion is sophisticated and emotionally credible.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—memory, justice, and the tension between official record and embodied archive—is woven deeply into setting, vocation, and ritual action. The lagoon as land-body refusing “sterile reports,” the shift to oral tapestries, and the debris-liturgy all ground big ideas in particular images. The closing movement (“Truth… thrives in tension”) edges into explicit thesis, but it’s earned by preceding images and doesn’t read as unearned sermonizing. The conceptual aftertaste is strong and complex, though trimming one or two abstract formulations would let the images do even more of the thematic lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory-as-potential, the danger of nostalgic restoration, and civilization as ongoing collaborative “becoming” are woven consistently through the bottle, discarded objects, and participatory lanterns. The last paragraph efficiently reweights the premise—civilization “not restored…reborn”—and ties it to ownership of the last unopened thing shifting from expert to child/town. At times, the story edges into essayistic clarity (“nostalgia was a narcotic, not a blueprint”; “That’s not magic. That’s consequence.”), which slightly flattens subtext into thesis. Still, the core insights feel earned by image and action rather than mere assertion, and the ending invites reflection beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from motifs of foghorns, archives, smog, and orchards: memory vs. erasure, and the quiet reintroduction of empathy into a sterilized city. The notion of “emotional ecosystems” and “velvet disquiet” avoids sermonizing while offering clear conceptual stakes. The ending’s small human change (the businessman and the trumpet case) concretizes the abstract theme without stating a moral. There’s room for a slightly thornier sense of unintended consequences, but what’s here is resonant and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of entropy, memory, reverence, and “borrowed time” are beautifully embedded in images like rising droplets of past moments and the oak sapling as second chances. The final realization—“This was the texture of borrowed time”—nicely reweights prior images. However, the piece leans on a few explicit thesis-like lines (“She knew what she had to do: decrease entropy itself, not with machines or magic, but with memory…”, “The vortex inheritance wasn’t a burden… it was a door…”) that tell the theme rather than letting it fully emerge. The resonance is real but slightly over-articulated for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of listening vs noise, trust vs panic, and the ethics of prediction emerge organically from craft details (microclimate sensors, journal, calibrated triggers) and the reconfigured bell. Lines like “Patience was the first instrument of truth” and the final “solstice hush” carry thematic weight without collapsing into didactic moralizing. The ending reweights alarm as blessing and safety as relational trust, offering a non-literal answer to the initial distrust of sirens. A few near-thesis phrases are overt, but they’re grounded enough in concrete action to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—finding flourishing stillness and courage within collapse—is strongly woven through concrete events and images (meteors as psalms, the comet’s gentle efflorescence, dust sweeping as benediction). Recurring motifs (entropy as release, unrecorded phenomena, the lantern glass, the poet’s line) shift in meaning by the end. Some sentences tread close to aphorism (“Where others saw entropy, he saw release,” “To fall so fiercely…”) but they’re mostly earned by prior particulars. The final whisper to the emptiness and the station’s “agreement” deliver a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of silence, unspoken burdens, and the ethics of preservation versus release are strongly woven through ghosts, the box, and the covenant. Lines like “The recluse preserved these weights—not to hoard sorrow, but to honor the architecture of silence that shaped souls” are potent but verge on expository thematic statement. The ending image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—silence as a language she alone can translate—without explicit moralizing. Thematically rich, but slightly over-articulated and limited by the relatively gentle pressure in Q4.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    The thematic throughline—that time accumulates, breathes, and textures experience rather than simply passing—is coherent and emerges from concrete particulars (urn echoes, recalibrated numbers, listings that summon the aching past). The letter and Lira’s line “time doesn’t pass—it accumulates” powerfully crystallize the idea but verge on explicit thesis-stating, edging into mild didacticism. The final listings reweight the earlier garage-sale device into a gentler, more communal ethic, which is an effective non-literal answer to the story’s question. Ambiguity remains around what “curating echoes” will cost Vey, keeping the theme from feeling too neatly resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thematic throughline—loss, asymmetry, and the beauty of the incomplete—is strong and coherently embodied in the snapped string, the crooked kite, and the feather. Many images carry subtext without explanation, particularly the final “song of things mended by being left…incomplete.” However, several explicit thesis statements (“This is her work: not to fix, but to reframe…”) verge on moralizing and reduce the need for reader inference. Trimming or submerging those would sharpen the resonance considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: copper-guided growth, shared occupancy of the orchard, and the notion of architecture as collaboration rather than imposition. The line “Respect isn’t earned by dominance. It’s offered when you prove you belong in the design.” edges toward explicit thesis, but it’s grounded in the concrete sparrow moment and doesn’t fully collapse into sermon. The final image of future generations living inside his designs effectively reweights the premise toward enduring coexistence. Some complexity is sacrificed for clarity—there’s little friction or counterpressure against his ethos—but the resonance is still strong.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of homecoming, measurement vs. meaning, and emergent truth are woven through motifs of footprints, the amber, and scientific instruments. The closing realization—that “truth…was emergent—born where paths crossed”—reweights prior images and offers a non-literal resolution to the central question. At times the story edges into essay-like abstraction (“Her hypothesis had been that homecoming was catalytic”), but it stops short of moralizing and lets images carry much of the work. The final image and her altered stance create a lingering conceptual and emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of restoration versus erasure, memory versus mercy, and interspecies accord are woven through concrete images (seeds as “ciphers,” birds as interlocutors, battlefield underfoot) and culminate in a resonant, non-didactic final image. Some lines verge on overt thesis (“His motivation was neither vengeance nor absolution, but restoration”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the piece invites reflection on how life coexists with atrocity without prescribing a neat moral. The thematic power is constrained somewhat by the gentle pressure curve, which keeps the questions contemplative rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of distance vs. closeness, the afterlife of voices, and how communities live on resonance rather than material salvage are richly embodied in particulars like seed-vault coordinates, lullabies, and elders recording for “presence.” The leaf’s tinted revelations and the nightly gatherings elegantly externalize the idea that truth and connection are filtered and many-skinned. The one overt thematic articulation—“Because truth wears many skins, and closeness isn’t measured in steps, but in shivers down the spine”—skirts aphorism but is supported so well by scene work that it still feels earned rather than preachy. The ending image of a settlement thriving on resonance is a strong non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres strongly around true north as an inner, chosen bearing and the ethics of witnessing: presence over accuracy, honoring distortion as revelation. The compass, family ritual, and temporally stretched sky all reappear in the ending with shifted weight, especially the idea that “true north wasn’t celestial. It was the choice to remain curious when the world lost its rhythm.” A few lines come close to explicit thesis-stating, but they’re grounded in concrete memory and action. The final image of companionable silence offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to the story’s questions.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of play versus control, amendment versus conquest, and surrender to wonder are strongly integrated into both action and imagery, especially the line “He had not fixed the sky—he had invited it to play.” Recurring motifs (secrets inside pieces, swapped truths, the blank map) reweight the idea that reality is a negotiated, playful structure rather than a solved puzzle. At times, the text edges toward explicit thesis-statement (“His motivation was never dominion, but surrender”), which slightly flattens subtext. Still, the final image of a pilgrim-thief stepping into a newly playful world resonates beyond the literal plot.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theming around absence, unsung lives, and unscripted truth is rich and consistent, with strong images like the pawnless board and the ring on a vacant square. However, the story leans toward overt thesis statements—“history isn’t moved by kings alone” and explicit definitional lines about the historian of small gestures—which slightly blunt subtext. The most resonant work happens in gesture (the widow’s unbinding, the non-bow, the sovereign’s terror) rather than in those declarative sentences. Overall, the piece invites reflection and lingers, but trims of explicit moralizing could heighten it.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from objects and actions: language, translation, texture, and architecture all converge on the idea that “home” is a frequency, not a fixed place. The final realization and image—welcoming the past and inhabiting a room of her own handwriting and impossible mementos—reweight everything that came before. There is one slightly declarative line (“Home was not a place, she realized, but a frequency”) but it’s supported by concrete sensory argument rather than standing as a platitude. The piece sustains complexity around memory, belonging, and self-translation without collapsing into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of guilt, responsibility, and the nature of forgiveness emerge organically from concrete particulars: chess gambits, frayed tapestries, suspended villagers, and the mirror test. The climax reconfigures forgiveness as ongoing truthful bearing of consequence rather than erasure, aligning her internal arc with the village’s release from hush. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“Forgiveness had not come from decree or deed, but from winnowing the past until only truth remained”), but they’re well-earned by prior imagery and avoid mawkishness. The piece invites reflection through its metaphors rather than prescribing a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The thematic spine—against purity of truth, for complex, costly forgiveness—is strong and coherently embodied in her practices and the canyon’s mechanics. Images like “hold the jagged edges of truth and still choose to cradle them” and dolls that “forgive because they have no choice” translate abstraction into potent specifics. The ending’s chorus of refracted “I’m sorry” reweights prior material and offers a nuanced answer: acknowledgment over absolution, multiplicity over singularity. A few explicit statements about forgiveness edge toward essayistic clarity, slightly reducing subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of making brokenness sacred—kintsugi as an ethic rather than an aesthetic—is threaded through concrete acts (filling scars with gold linked to precise failures and betrayals). The final reconfiguration of workshop-as-altar and her ability to take “a breath…given” provide a non-literal but clear answer to the question of whether meaning can be forged from ruin. However, a few lines near the end (“She hadn’t conjured an elixir…she’d conjured meaning”) move into explicit thesis territory, slightly reducing the power of the subtextual work that precedes them. Overall the piece still invites reflection beyond itself, with a rich, coherent metaphor field.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of reflection vs. motion, permanence vs. change, and art as covenant rather than product emerge naturally from her actions and the recurring objects (mirror, shell, tide, cave wall). The final conceptual shift—reflection not in glass but in motion, and some promises meant to be kept rather than carried—reweights the entire story without reading as a tacked-on moral. The dream of the shell being mineralized ties permanence and time back into the earlier promise in a satisfying, non-literal way. A few lines (“because the act itself was the covenant,” “because she’d remembered the question”) come close to overt statement, nudging the piece slightly toward didactic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of tenderness vs. force, intention vs. noise, and the reach of “whispers” are strongly integrated with the cork, scent, and lighthouse imagery. The notion of “screaming tenderness” is fresh and the final images of broadcasting a quiet frequency are resonant. However, the last paragraph leans into direct statement (“This was how the world healed—not with fanfare…”) that edges toward moralizing rather than trusting the images fully. That explicitness slightly flattens what could have been a more open, suggestive resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The thematic weave of loss, orientation, and “reverse migration” is rich and organic: static, dial tones, and missed connections become altars rather than cheap symbols. The conceptual move from outward migration to inward seepage, and from abandonment to recalibration, offers a sophisticated, non-moralizing answer to how grief can be lived with rather than fixed. “Raw solace isn’t comfort” is slightly on-the-nose but is supported by enough concrete images (hinge creak, unworn coat, stubborn dial tone) that it still lands as earned insight rather than a platitude. The only missing piece for top-tier is a more dramatized, scene-level moment where this thematic stance visibly costs her something precise in the now.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—the nature of safety, regulation versus threat, and the costs of honesty in a damaged emotional ecology—emerges organically from concrete actions (foraging, dosing others, surrendering the eye). The textbook line about safety and regulation risks explicitness but is well-integrated as a relic of her past learning and doesn’t collapse into moralizing. The final movement, where she no longer needs the occlusion device and lets safety become “wild and unowned,” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening problem. Complexity is preserved: empathy-as-virus, truth-as-liability, and surrender-as-strength coexist without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the idea of memories as residues, the ethics of witnessing versus exposing, and the endurance of love via tokens rather than bodies. The Edelweiss motif and Silas’s practice of collecting “dried things that still hummed” give the ending image genuine weight without overt moralizing. The closing refusal to report, framed as “some truths belong to the sea,” offers a non-literal answer to the story’s question about what should be remembered and by whom. There’s a complex, lingering ambiguity about whether his choice is compassion, cowardice, or vocation, which suits this length well.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of regret, redemption, and the weight of unkept promises are woven effectively through Elias’s vocation and the doorway conceit, and the ending’s reframing of loneliness as purposeful gives a satisfying conceptual click. Motifs—the chip, doorway, creek, ants—recur in ways that support a meditation on how choice turns into action. However, the concluding sentences verge on explicit thesis-statement mode (“the doorway hadn’t erased his loneliness; it had revealed its purpose”), which slightly flattens what had been gracefully implied. A bit more reliance on image over explanation would lift the thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from events and images: power vs resonance, the ethics of forgetting, and memory as both wound and resource. The motif of bleeding starlight shifts meaning from ominous dream-image to embodied memory and responsibility, which reweights earlier paragraphs. The hooded figure’s lines occasionally edge toward didactic (“You chose power over pulse. Now the sky weeps your neglect.”), but they’re still grounded in specific past actions. The ending’s charge—return as witness, letting starlight bleed through words and silences—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of revaluation, presence as an active choice, and transforming guilt into shared material are coherent and well-motivated by the particulars (phoenix ash, pigments, currencies of light). The closing move—turning his guilt into “the pigment I’ve been missing” and proposing to “paint the next chapter together”—offers a resonant answer to the piece’s central question. However, the story tends to articulate its thesis directly (“Presence isn’t passive,” “That’s the revaluation”) rather than trusting subtext, giving the ending a faintly didactic sheen. The result is thoughtful but somewhat over-explained for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of nostalgia, self-fragmentation, and the myth of “clean endings” emerge organically from concrete images (rotting birthday cake, graves, burning playgrounds) and the act of chronicling. The final reframing—“Endings are just seams where one story stitches into the next”—revalues the grave and the entire journey without feeling like a tacked-on moral. A bit of explicit philosophizing edges toward clarity over mystery, but it stays grounded in this specific consciousness and history. The emotional aftereffect—melancholy acceptance with a thread of wonder—lingers convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—ordinary miracles, the ethics of tools, and witnessing through loss—emerges organically from the screw’s reinterpretation, the broken clock, and Elara’s changed practice. The integration of “fulcrum,” “broken clocks still hold time,” and “miracles don’t need to be fragrant” provides strong, coherent thematic threads. Some lines, especially in Ren’s dialogue, verge on thesis-stating and come close to sermonizing, slightly reducing the sense that insight is entirely earned from concrete struggle. Still, the final image of the unsmelling therapist arranging lavender beside the altered clock offers a resonant, non-literal answer without a bald moral.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of alchemizing trauma through narrative and ritual is tightly woven into concrete images: scars as waypoints, runes like stanzas, and childish superstitions reclaimed as tools. Subtext about the value of non-rational practices and the limits of purely scholarly rigor emerges organically from her tactics and memories. However, the final lines explicitly state the thesis (“stories… do not erase pain — they alchemize it”), tipping into mild didacticism and slightly reducing the lingering ambiguity. The emotional aftereffect is still resonant, but lessened by that overt articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of imperfect miracles, flawed art, and the messy nature of forgiveness are tightly woven through objects (perfume, manuscript), profession (gossip/exorcism), and setting (archive/orchard as doomed legacy). The piece resists pat absolution: the orchard will still fall, their relationship is only “humming with the same flawed frequency,” and the miracle is explicitly acknowledged as “imperfect.” The metaphors around diminished sevenths, cheap wine, and flawed notes make theme emerge from particulars rather than thesis statements. A couple of lines (“Because miracles don’t wait for perfect timing”) flirt with on-the-nose commentary but are buffered by surrounding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of meaning as negotiated rather than discovered, illusion versus coherence, and endings-as-middles are richly woven through images like the dissolving dictionary and “other endings that turned out to be middles wearing funeral shrouds.” The final shift from witness to hush reweights the entire piece, suggesting a non-dual stance on observer and observed. Some lines verge on overt thesis (“Meaning is not discovered; it is negotiated between observer and void,” “Language was the illusion she’d come to unravel”), slightly muting subtext. Still, the conceptual and emotional resonance of the last paragraphs is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of time as surrender/absence and the “razor edge” between potential and fact are woven throughout images (erosion of moments, hydraulics, horizon lenses). The ending’s explicit articulation—“clocks measured absence…The razor edge before the fall”—risks slight thesis-statement territory but is well-earned by prior particulars. The piece invites reflection on how we relate to time without collapsing into a moral, and the lonely ritual gives the abstract idea emotional charge. It’s strong thematic work, just shy of the most effortless subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of grief, permeability, and the ethics of release emerge organically from thresholds, mycelium, and “familiar strangers” without relying solely on summary. The reweighting from intrusion to departure and from holding to allowing is conceptually elegant, especially in the final image of expansion into the “luminous unknown.” That said, lines like “Letting go, she had learned, was not surrender. / It was alignment.” and the final explicit formulation of “the physics of letting go” edge toward thesis statement. The piece would gain from letting the images carry a bit more of the thematic work without restating the idea.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of risk, luck, responsibility, and perspective are tightly integrated via gambling/probability metaphors, the paradoxical lantern, and the graffiti equations; they emerge organically from Elara’s history and present choices. The generational echo between her father’s compulsions and her own intellectualized “research” is particularly resonant, especially in the menu scrawl and the pressed clover response. Some lines (“To traverse is to hold contradiction without flinching,” “P(failure) = 0 if you redefine success”) edge toward aphoristic thesis statements, slightly reducing subtextual subtlety. Nonetheless, the final “Begin again” reads as an earned, open-ended thematic answer rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—endings as beginnings, intimacy through misconnection, the ethics of estrangement—emerges strongly from the particulars of misrouted calls and the disc’s memory-like resonance. The story occasionally states its thesis a bit baldly (“She believed endings needed to be taught how to begin”), edging toward essayistic declaration rather than pure dramatization. Still, the final act of looping herself into the hum offers a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece leaves a complex aftertaste about connection, grief, and self-effacement.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory-as-covenant, the sanctity of small acts, and resistance to institutional erasure are woven tightly through particulars: recipes, lullabies, paved marshes, the locket. The idea of “proximate causes” and the covenant clauses themselves generate resonance beyond the scene and avoid simplistic moralizing. At times the piece edges toward thesis statement (“not by decree, but through proximate causes”), slightly flattening subtext into statement. Still, the final image of her ongoing practice offers a non-literal, emotionally coherent answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of reciprocity, loneliness, and the power of symbols emerge organically from particulars like rumor mechanics, story exchanges, and the non-magical but “warm” moon rock. Lines such as “Truth lived in the telling…” tread close to essayistic statement, but are anchored enough in the scene to avoid feeling like pure moralizing. The final reweighting—that magic is unnecessary when reciprocal attention is present—lands cleanly without a didactic thesis sentence. There’s genuine emotional aftereffect in the modest, unsentimental image of his steady hand and the warmed stone.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: sound as emotional cartography, silence as potential rather than void, and grief/joy as harmonics of the same note. The forest tests these ideas by embodying different emotional chords and forcing her to live them rather than name them. The one explicit articulation—“that grief and joy were not opposites, but harmonics of the same note”—skirts on-the-nose but is mostly earned by prior sensory work. The ending image of a new trail of notes growing from her original word nicely externalizes the shift without preaching.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of revision vs. erasure, time as grammar, and regret reconfigured into contingent possibilities are richly woven through recurring images (seeds, grammar, editing, wet clay). The final line about seeds planted “in the wrong tense” reweights everything before it in a conceptually satisfying way. However, much of the thematic material is stated quite directly in essayistic language (“Editing history… was never about erasing”) and, given the relatively soft on-page pressure, the insights verge on being more conceptual than earned through struggle, so resonance plateaus just above solid.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silence-as-canvas, forgetting as a precondition for presence, and art that refuses preservation are all unified and resonate through concrete images (empty camera, unrecorded music, tide). The thematic throughline is coherent and emotionally affecting, particularly in the girl being told, “You are a symphony,” and the idea that the night will not be remembered yet will be felt. That said, several lines state the thesis rather directly (“silence is not absence. It is the canvas.” / “This is why we forget—to make room for what matters now.”), which slightly undercuts subtextual power. With a touch less aphoristic explanation, this would move into truly top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, destruction-as-preservation, lineage, and the ethics of fire are woven through recurrent motifs (tapestry, spiral, ash, song) in a coherent way. Her evolution from arsonist to archivist of the scorched expresses the core idea that preservation may require destructive acts. However, the line “The forgotten promise? To never let the fire of memory die—even if it meant burning libraries...” tips into explicit thesis-stating, slightly undercutting the otherwise earned resonance. The piece invites reflection but leans a bit too hard on overt articulation at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of loneliness, enforced “cure,” and transforming burden into collaborative creation are woven organically through recurring images (drumming, auric light, voices) rather than explicit moralizing. The final image of twenty-seven voices braided into one and the garden continuing the rhythm after she stops offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what to do with inherited pain. A few lines verge on thesis (“That was her motivation now, the only compass left in the storm”), which slightly flattens subtext. Overall, thematic integration is cohesive and emotionally affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme that whispers (subtle, quiet truths) outlast shouts (overt power) is tightly integrated with setting, character, and the ear-opening “key.” The final act of slipping coin and map into Ruiz’s pocket is a strong, non-literal answer to the story’s question. Yet the piece undercuts itself by articulating its thesis explicitly multiple times (“She’d long believed whispers travel farther than shouts,” “The key…was meant to open ears,” “Whispers, she knew, echo longer…”), edging into didacticism. More reliance on implication and image over stated takeaway would markedly elevate the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of darkness as audience rather than enemy, the reframing of despair, and the ethics of intervention at the threshold are woven gracefully through image and action. Silent empathy is dramatized rather than preached in the encounter with the drowned woman, and the rumor about what she’s really guarding subtly reframes the whole piece. A few lines (“Her motivation was older… to teach darkness the value of stars”) lean toward explicit statement, slightly dulling the otherwise elegant subtext. Overall, the ending star image offers a resonant, non-literal answer that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of quiet dissent, reclaimed curiosity, and reconfiguring educational norms are woven through concrete motifs: chess moves, second thoughts, trees inscribed with notation. The notion of “subversion by stillness” and “amplified quiet” gives the conclusion a resonant conceptual repricing of what rebellion can look like. However, the text sometimes edges into stated thesis (“Eccentricity… was just truth wearing a hat no one recognized yet,” explicit lines about standardized tests/screens) rather than letting events and images carry the full load. The result is strong and affecting but a bit too declarative for top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of compassion, alignment with true nature, and the transformation of violence into healing are woven through objects (scrimshaw), setting (disappearing island), and Lira’s arc in a largely organic way. However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements—“true freedom is not escape, but alignment—with self, with sea…”—and the reiterated assurance that violence cannot return approaches sermonizing. The strongest thematic work is in images (island receding with cruelty, resurfacing under compassion; scrimshaw dissolving once its penitent magic is spent) rather than in the abstract articulations. A touch more restraint in the final third would let the subtext resonate without being spelled out.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—state-sanctioned happiness as violence against grief, and the survival strategy of aestheticizing sorrow into acceptable forms—is deeply integrated and never wholly devolves into thesis. The bouquet, turbines, “remade hush,” and the repeated whittling/narration pattern accrue real thematic weight, with the final “I miss you” in a sliver of true silence reweighting everything prior. The piece resists neat moral resolution: the protagonist’s compliance is both understandable and ethically queasy, and “cultivating lightness” is simultaneously survival and self-erasure. Occasional on-the-nose phrasing (“Happiness Decree,” “Model Citizen Bulletin”) edges toward allegorical clarity, slightly reducing the lingering ambiguity that might elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of censorship, sacredness vs. reinterpretation, and the holiness of uncertainty are woven through recurring motifs (paraphrase, boundaries, silence/voice, ice/lake) and culminate in the world “remembering how to listen.” The idea of not copying but paraphrasing the divine is strong and dramatized through her actions with the colonnade and the lake. A few abstract formulations (“architecture of awe,” “sacred geometry,” “uncertainty… can be sacred”) edge toward essayistic, but they mostly feel earned by the sensory scaffolding. The thematic aftertaste is resonant, but limited conflict and cost keep it from fully transcendent territory.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of beauty in imperfection, listening to what’s discarded, and exchanging “soul-stuff” instead of currency are woven through concrete acts (salvage, honey and lullabies, plant arrangements) rather than stated as thesis. The phoenix/embers contrast—he “hadn’t come for the fire. He’d come for the embers.”—nicely reweights the entire piece and the idea of rebirth. Subtext sits in who is centered (plants, broken tools, ash) and how their responses redefine value, without sermonizing. It’s thematically rich and coherent, though not yet pushing into more unsettling ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of listening, connection, and the misuse of technology are organically integrated with sound imagery and the pilgrimage motif. However, several lines verge on thesis statements (“the belief that silence meant emptiness, that technology killed soul, that solitude equaled loneliness”), which edge toward sermonizing rather than pure emergence from scene. The reframing of quiet and machines in the final “golden shadows” silence does provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial questions. Strong thematic coherence, slightly dulled by explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of constructed authenticity, grief as something reroutable rather than erasable, and the sacredness of artificial vessels are beautifully woven through images of lockets, tattoos, and origami. Lines like “authenticity need not stem from nature to be true” and “Sometimes the most honest things are constructed—stitched, folded, etched” articulate the thesis a bit overtly but remain grounded in concrete practice. The final image—a stranger someday feeling “the faintest warmth return to their chest” at the coordinates—reweights the entire ritual as a quiet, ongoing answer to the question of how to live with sorrow. Because the conflict itself never fully tightens, the thematic movement, while resonant, has limited dramatic reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of post-capitalist reconstruction, symbolic economies, and “remembering how to share” are powerful and coherent, supported by strong particulars like the phoenix QR stencils and #FeedTheFuture equations. However, several lines verge on stated thesis—“The old systems shattered, but the human grammar didn’t. It just shifted syntax.”—and the visitor’s “They’re remembering forward” is almost a crafted tagline. The thematic work is rich but occasionally a bit declarative rather than fully embedded in scene pressure. The ending nonetheless reweights earlier images meaningfully, aligning with the conceptual premise.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory vs. erasure, the cost of “emotional equilibrium,” and generational trauma are woven tightly through concrete images (burned texts, sanitized massacre, daughter’s silence). The idea that forgetting is itself a surrender emerges from the civilization’s choice and her counter-ritual, not from abstract preaching. Lines like “to break the cycle by shattering the illusion that forgetting heals” skate close to thesis-statement territory, slightly flattening the subtext. Overall, the final image of her bringing the raw, patternless song home offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    The thematic arc around memory, technological smoothing of experience, and the evolving face of hope is tightly integrated with the imagery of shadows, stones, dreams, and clouds. The realization that “the shadow unbound was not a glitch…but hope’s chrysalis” reweights earlier material and the final changes to dreams echo a nuanced stance: not nostalgia, but a demand that comfort remember its roots in fear. Lines like “Remember the texture of fear that hope once climbed” verge on explicit statement yet remain grounded in concrete objects and action. The piece invites reflection on resilience without collapsing into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of conviction, complicity, shedding illusions, and “reconstruction not redemption” are richly woven through chameleon biology, the tail ritual, and Elara’s memories of authentic care versus institutional fraud. The recurrent tail image genuinely shifts meaning by the end—from loss and escape to compass and method of moral rebuilding. However, the story occasionally tips into overt thesis-stating (“She wouldn’t call it redemption… This was reconstruction”), diluting some subtextual power. Despite that, the final image of fragile convictions remade “scale by scale, truth by truth” lands with genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of closure vs continuation, scars as narratives, and miracles as ethically ambiguous are tightly woven through wounds, roots, rings, and the hourglass without explicit moralizing. The seed’s revelation—that its “miracles” were extensions and delays, not endings—organically reframes Elira’s vocation and the initial surgery premise. Recurring images (scars, rings, spirals, sand) gain new weight in the last paragraphs, especially the hourglass sand “spiraling outward,” which answers the story’s implicit question about what closure really means. The insight skirts sentimentality but stays grounded in specific images and costs (her weeping, the rewriting of her scar’s meaning).

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of unused love persisting in objects until someone dares to witness and release it is beautifully embodied in particulars (film strip, napkin note, oilcloth bundle, letters to Eleanor). However, the story undercuts some of its own subtlety by stating its thesis in near-slogan form multiple times (“unused love doesn’t vanish — it incubates,” the marquee’s “LOVE NEVER ENDS — ONLY CHANGES FORM,” and the final paragraph’s explicit generalization). The resonance is strong, but the overt moralizing in the last lines keeps it out of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of stifled creativity, the cost of being a conduit, and the tension between private peace and communal liberation emerge organically from her experience and the recurring stardust/meteor motifs. The ending image—her finally able to rest after facilitating others’ awakening—reweights prior material without spelling out a moral, leaving a resonant sense of bittersweet service. Specifics like the baker’s birds and the librarian’s sonnets keep the theme grounded rather than abstract. There is a slight tendency toward neatness (creativity “slipped its cage” feels close to thesis-statement territory), but it doesn’t tip into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of unrealized possibility, hope after ecological and probabilistic ruin, and communication beyond language emerge organically from the mission, the silent village, and the freight of “compressed moments of unchosen paths.” Recurring images (petals, clock, spheres, lullaby) are reweighted by the ending without explicit moralizing, and the idea of enabling rather than witnessing is a strong, quietly moving thematic answer. The piece resists tidy binaries, especially around cost: he lightens the weight of unchosen worlds but cannot or does not seek personal solace. The only mild limitation is that theme sometimes approaches overt statement (“His purpose was not to witness, but to enable”), shaving a bit off its subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of intuition vs logic, inner wilderness vs paved-over mind, and self-unraveling toward a more authentic self are coherent and well-woven with images like the gear, forest, and void. However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements—“This was where thinking ended and knowing began”; “The sixth sense hadn’t awakened to show him the world”—that verge on essayistic. The final realization is conceptually rich but somewhat over-explained rather than left to resonate through image alone. Subtext exists but is often preempted by direct articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—courage as something unused, waiting, and re-encountered through gentleness and persistence—emerges clearly through images (child’s shoe, rusted whistle, star punches). However, it is also articulated in fairly direct thesis statements (“Courage doesn’t rust,” “Unused doesn’t mean lost”), sliding toward soft moralizing. The final redistribution of courage-signs in the town is a strong thematic gesture that invites reflection beyond the page. Overall resonance is real but slightly blunted by on-the-nose articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—the cost of safety, the ethics of silence, and the possibility of remaking what was once protective into something life-giving—is tightly woven through motifs of snow, stain, and sound. The return of music and the re-coloring stain offer a strong non-literal answer to the opening question about whether safety is worth silence. However, the explicit lines “He understood now: safety cost everything if it cost silence. But silence, unpardonable as it was, could be broken…” veer into direct thesis statement, undercutting some of the beautifully implied resonance. The piece would feel more elite if it trusted its images and actions to carry that insight without spelling it out.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thematic throughline—truth as erosion rather than weapon, mistrust of power, the burden of crowns—is coherent and well woven into images (ink, mirrors, constellations, books). The final choices (refusing rule, moving on as “rune of drift”) resonate conceptually and reweight prior material. That said, the explicit statements—“Truth is not a weapon. It is a mirror.” and “The crown is not worn. It is carried.”—edge into aphoristic moralizing rather than leaving more work to subtext. The piece risks didactic clarity where a more oblique ending might feel richer for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of metamorphosis vs. extinction, listening vs. extraction, and time-scales beyond human perception arise organically from reefs, tapping, and the ECHO protocol. The final revaluation—“Some losses aren’t endings. They’re metamorphoses.”—crystallizes the piece’s thematic question, though it edges into explicit statement. Beautiful particulars (children counting seconds, fishermen returning with stories of glowing gardens) carry much of the resonance without needing explanation. A touch less aphoristic phrasing in the final third would lift this toward the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mesh of rebellion, memory, and listening as a thematic core is strong, with the stone circle and opera glasses providing concrete vehicles for a shift from “winning” to “remembering.” The final beats—the aria as seed, the world “remembering its song”—offer an emotionally satisfying conceptual repricing of what rebellion means. However, the theme is articulated a bit too directly (“It was never about winning. / It was about remembering how to listen.”), tipping into thesis-statement rather than leaving more to subtext. There’s nuance in the idea of serenity-within-thunder, but the piece leans toward declared insight over dramatized ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of tradition versus imposed reconstruction, destiny versus choice, and rebellion as evolution emerge clearly from image and action (soil memory, distributed seedlings, children finding them). The reconfiguration of “implanted destiny” into shared possibility is conceptually strong and resonates beyond the scene. However, the text sometimes shifts into overt thesis-speak (“destiny unchosen is no destiny at all”; “evolution is not rebellion’s opposite, but its deepest form”), which edges into sermonizing rather than letting the images fully carry the argument. That explicitness slightly blunts what would otherwise be a more hauntingly open-ended thematic aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme arises organically from particulars: trauma and healing reframed as learning to carry both fracture and stillness, not erasing one with the other. The pearl image and the arboretum’s ruin/regrowth pattern reweight the central question of how to live after random violence, landing in the idea that stillness is “the eye within” chaos. Insights feel earned from specific experience (bodywork, sketching, repeated returns) rather than abstract moralizing. Occasional near-thesis lines (“stillness… is not the absence of chaos”) skate close to explicit statement but retain enough image-based grounding to avoid didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of grief-as-gravity, fragmentation as potential architecture, and fracture becoming feature are woven tightly through image and action (Tarot Tower, stitched maps, half-erased self-portrait, cocooning walls). The final rebranding of herself as “crestRISEN” with wings of stitched parchment reweights everything before: questions become tools, trauma becomes material. Occasional abstract lines (“truth had become a chorus of echoes”) edge toward overt philosophizing but are grounded enough in concrete motifs that they feel earned. The piece avoids tidy moralizing; it lands in a complex stance where pain is necessary but not glorified.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of time, trauma, and the subjectivity of crisis are woven through ink patterns, neural-collapse imagery, and the final idea that “time didn’t slow for the world—it slowed for the witness.” The ending reframes slowing time as a space to choose one’s mode of vanishing, reweighting all prior description and data-collection. A few lines verge on thesis statement, but they arise organically from what she’s observing rather than authorial intrusion. The emotional aftereffect is contemplative and slightly haunting rather than neatly moralized.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of truth versus silence, archives as kindling, and vulnerability as political force are woven through concrete elements like the data-crystals, dormant networks, and emotional broadcast. The aftermath montage—children reciting banned verses, workers pausing mid-shift, the Chancellor’s private shock—nicely shows theme through behavior rather than telling. However, lines like “Because truth doesn’t need volume. It only needs a heartbeat to travel.” and “weaponized vulnerability” verge on thesis statements, slightly undercutting subtextual power. Overall, resonance is strong but occasionally over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of continuity, chosen gentleness, and memory as “ballast” arise organically from repeated concrete acts—ritual sheathing, salvaging airship sand, gifting seeds and cuttings. The line “Continuity… Not monuments. Not legends. But this: a root pushing through ash” edges toward thesis-statement but is well-earned by prior images and not purely didactic. The final exchange with the child—about plants “holding space for what was”—reconfigures earlier motifs into a quietly powerful answer to the central question. The piece avoids simplistic moralizing by acknowledging loss without promising restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of grief, non-possessive reverence, and transformation-from-captured-to-carried emerge organically from the particulars: sleepwalking constellations as mourners, the echo as maternal fury, the rail spike as conduit rather than trophy. The final image—constellations orbiting spike-remains while the fisher walks away with shards—quietly reprices the premise from hunting to custodianship. The piece avoids explicit moralizing, though a slightly sharper sense of what this costs her personally would deepen the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of truth versus erasure, witness versus power, and cyclical “orbits of regret” are tightly woven through objects (pen nib), lines (“truth hides not in headlines but in margins”), and the observatory’s vantage over the archive fires. The final reframe—“Orbits, after all, are not prisons. They are paths.”—offers a resonant answer to the story’s fatalism without stating a moral outright. Some aphoristic sentences (“silence corrodes faster than ink”) edge toward didacticism, but they’re grounded enough in her family and vocation to avoid sermonizing. Overall, the thematic net feels coherent and organically grown from her methods and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of guilt, translation, and the ethics of soothing—when silence becomes suffocation—emerge organically from particulars: misaligned constellations, cursed firmware meant to calm infants, letters to an unborn child. The story resists tidy moralizing: the machine is not destroyed but allowed to “weep,” and forgiveness is framed as an ongoing practice rather than a single absolution. Recurring motifs (cradles, lullabies, willow roots, static vs. lullaby) shift meaning by the end in a way that reweights earlier images. A few near-aphoristic lines (“silence wasn’t peace—it was suffocation”) lean close to explicit thesis, but they’re grounded in concrete experience.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—meaning emerging through engagement with “mess” rather than fixing or silencing it—is integrated through concrete motifs: the city’s metallic chatter, emergent hush, the mandala, the off-key musician, the rain. Subtext resides in how she re-reads imperfection and noise, though the text also voices its thesis quite directly (“meaning isn’t found in the fixing of broken things…”), edging toward statement over implication. The final images do reweight earlier material and create a lingering resonance. A touch more trust in image over articulated insight would lift the thematic sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    The thematic core—“aberrant mercy” as an active, justice-wielding empathy—is rich and threaded through the imagery of fractures, tesserae, and renaming. However, the story states its thesis quite directly in Elira’s speech (“Mercy is not a plea… It is a practice”) and in overt re-labelings, which read more like articulated doctrine than emergent subtext. The best moments are when the theme is embodied in small particulars (the scholar burning her books, the guard carrying a stranger’s child), suggesting a powerful ethic without naming it. The explicit moralizing in the final third blunts what could otherwise be a more haunting, implicit resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of art as enduring echo, the transmutation of despair into renewed possibility, and legacy outliving the artist are woven through concrete particulars (synesthetic singing, the opera’s fire, the community-theater woman, the old man’s park-bench stories). The tarot coin’s transformation into a sapling offers a resonant, non-literal answer: creative influence changes hands and becomes communal infrastructure rather than personal glory. The story avoids explicit moralizing, trusting images like petals “like confetti” and the orchard “remembering” to carry emotional aftereffect. Slight tidiness in the three-mortal montage edges it toward neatness, but not into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of artificial vs. organic communion, corporate distortion vs. embodied knowledge, and brokenness-as-bridge are strongly woven through recurring images of fractals, light, and the body. The telepathy pills and recall ground the ethical and conceptual stakes in something specific, and the final decision to open the studio embodies a thematic stance rather than merely stating it. Some lines edge toward thesis statement (“True communion wasn’t chemical. It was somatic. Fractal.”), slightly reducing subtlety. Still, the piece leaves a resonant question about how we connect and what costs we accept to do so.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, transitional objects, and the ethics of speaking for a dormant humanity are woven naturally through the leaf, the caves, and her vocation, culminating in the leaf’s shift from relic to relay and her no-longer-solitary purpose. The story resists moralizing, inviting reflection on language, feeling, and preservation through image and action rather than thesis statements. Because the narrative pressure never tightens into a truly costly choice, the thematic resolution, while resonant, doesn’t quite achieve maximal complexity or bite. The result is thoughtful and coherent rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece has a strong, coherent thematic spine about prophecy as possibility, the politics of truth, and wisdom as something stitched quietly from discarded fragments. Motifs—sand, buttons, jars, echoes—recur and meaningfully reweight by the end. However, theme is often stated rather than purely emerged: lines like “prophecy wasn’t prediction—it was raw possibility” and “Shared wisdom, she learned, wasn’t about broadcasting truth” edge into thesis. This explicitness slightly blunts what could be a more subtext-driven resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of unused courage, legacy vs survival, and truth as a seed rather than a weapon emerge organically from repeated images of planting, thaw, rust, and seasons turning. The final reconfiguration—her shifting from “burned spy” to “quiet gardener of justice”—reweights prior material effectively. However, several late lines (“That was the point.” “legacy.” “quiet gardener of justice.” “compost for what would grow.”) edge into explicit thesis-stating and soften the subtextual power. The emotional aftertaste is still strong, but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of memory, grief, and stripping away noise to reach essential truth are woven through recurring motifs (palimpsest, percolation, distillation, needle, veil) and concretized in the closing offer to “unstitch what binds you.” The ending gives a resonant, non-literal answer: not to erase or fix grief, but to reveal and reconfigure it, aligning action with the stated promise. Some thematic lines verge on explicit thesis (“Distill complexity into essence”; “not a vow to fix, but to reveal; not to erase, but to refine”), which flirts with sermonizing rather than fully trusting image and scene. Even so, the emotional aftereffect is clear and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—kindness as the force that can coax fractured time into coherence, and preservation as resonance rather than rigid stasis—emerges organically from repeated particulars: bees, honeyless hives, unfired clay, the lantern’s conditional glow. The final image reweights the premise: a soft pot cradling glowing glass in an abandoned oasis becomes a quiet argument for letting fractures admit light rather than sealing them. However, some lines edge into explicit thesis (“Kindness, she knew, was the only force…”, “preservation was not about stasis, but about resonance”), which slightly undercuts subtextual power. Overall, the piece still yields a lingering, non-trite emotional and conceptual aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of resilience, measured hope, and the ethics of offering beauty rather than grand salvation arise organically from the gardener’s choices and tools. The lockmaster’s tooth as a way of gauging how much “pressure a barrier could bear” is an elegant thematic device, recontextualized from locksmithing to emotional endurance. Lines like “She wasn’t healing the world. She was offering it moments” walk close to explicit statement but remain grounded enough in her worldview to feel earned rather than sermonizing. The final image—the city exhaling into dawn under refracted light—reweights earlier material with quiet, lasting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of extinction, memory, coexistence with ghosts, and transforming isolation into sovereignty are tightly woven through concrete motifs (coordinates, woodpecker, mammoths, the mausoleum→loom shift). The final images—shadows pointing toward genesis, ozone and possibility in the cloud-tide—reweight everything we’ve seen without lapsing into explicit moralizing. Some lines tread close to thesis statements (“Coexistence, here, meant…”) but generally remain grounded in the specific library logic. The emotional aftereffect is contemplative and hopeful rather than saccharine, with a credible sense of cost still in play.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of connection, secret-keeping, and transforming private longing into communal art develop coherently through recurring images (letters → names → birds → installation). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Aris becomes the connective tissue he sought, braiding “solitude into belonging.” Some phrasing edges toward abstraction or soft-focus spirituality (“hidden architecture of longing, joy, sorrow, and grace”), diluting sharpness. Strong resonance, but the relatively gentle pressure and occasional pseudo-profound diction keep it from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme arises organically from the interplay of hope, media/information warfare, and the ethics of intervention: she uses the same medium and tactics but refuses to weaponize emotion in the same way. The piece engages with the idea that revelation can be corrosive and that resistance can be quiet, technical, and communal rather than heroic spectacle. Some thematic material is delivered via explanatory narration (“The tricksters’ method was elegant…”) that edges toward essayistic, but it’s still anchored in concrete stakes. The final “Try me again. I’m listening.” offers a resonant answer—endurance and vigilant hope—without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of liberation versus constraint and space’s right to “bend, to fold, to breathe” are well integrated into the architecture, organ, and Elara’s transformation. The final realization that spatial mutiny is not chaos but emancipation reweights prior images and offers a coherent conceptual answer. However, several lines state the thesis a bit too directly (“Spatial mutiny was not chaos—it was liberation”), reducing the power of subtext. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and resonant but slightly undercut by this explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme is robust and organically woven: the story interrogates visibility, memory, and how society decides who “exists,” using face blindness, masks, and cold cases as interlocking metaphors. The killer as obsessive mourner complicates binaries of monster/victim and justice/empathy in a productive way. Some thematic sentences verge on explicit thesis (“Because face blindness had taught her that people vanish twice…”), slightly reducing the sense that meaning is emerging purely from scene and image. Still, the faceless portraits and the final faceless sketch of the man reweight earlier material with a lingering, unsettling clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of memory, grief, erasure, and the ethics of mapping are strongly woven through storms-as-memory, the erased ancestor, and exile turned pilgrimage. The storm as collective grief and the idea that some maps are “sung by storms” are potent, resonant images. Yet the closing paragraphs lean into explicit thesis-making (“not for the guild, not for history,” “some maps aren’t drawn on paper”) that edges toward stated moral rather than fully trusting subtext. The piece still invites reflection, but a lighter hand on articulation would lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Forgiveness as “pixelated amnesty” is an original thematic frame, and the story mostly lets it emerge from concrete images: coordinates on scaffold flutters, the glass flake recomposing a self, shards as forgiven moments. The thematic resolution—that amnesty is partial, fragmentary, and allows beginnings even when cracked—is carried by the final images and his small, earned optimism. Some lines flirt with abstraction (“not absolution, but allowance. Permission to be remade.”), nudging toward essayistic statement rather than pure dramatization. Even so, the piece leaves a resonant, non-didactic aftertaste centered on possibility after irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of failure, legacy, circular paths, and the re-mapping of chaos are coherent and well-integrated through recurring images (currency as maps, loops, territorial markers, the train). The notion of “loops of learning, not laps of futility” and carrying a still point rather than chasing a destination provides a genuine conceptual repricing at the end. However, the piece sometimes states its theses too directly—lines like “failure echoes louder in silence” and “silence only speaks when you stop begging it for answers” verge on sermonizing. A bit more restraint and reliance on image over aphorism would deepen subtext and move this into truly top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of shared burden, witnessing, and the ethics of holding versus redistributing grief emerge organically from images (variable stars as confessors, inscriptions as receipts) and from her vocation. The daylily and observatory are strong recurring motifs that shift meaning by the end, from summons to covenant and from calculation to solace. However, some late lines (“She would not hoard the burdens… words that would drift upward, absorbed by stars”) verge on stating the thesis outright, softening subtext into commentary. The emotional aftereffect is genuine and tender, but the resolution is a bit tidy and openly redemptive.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The thematic throughline—mirrors vs truth, armor vs revelation, destruction vs unbending—is coherent and arises mostly from concrete images (faces in ice, thawing confessions, the willow metaphor). The shift from mirror-based self-deception to an embodied, painful truth is crystallized in the ribs “crack[ing]—not with pain, but release” and in the seed becoming a crown. However, a few lines verge on explicit thesis-stating (“Mirrors lie, she realized.”; “what mirrors don’t show”), edging into mild didacticism. The complexity of truth as both gift and wound is present but expressed a bit too directly at times.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of the binding power of dreams, the political/bureaucratic suppression of prophecy, and the persistence of buried covenants emerge organically from images (scars as conduits, vows in sleep, legal denial of dream-vows). The final activation of the covenant and her merging with the glade reweights the initial premise—the world’s attempt to declare dreams “non-binding” now feels brittle and temporary rather than authoritative. There’s a layered tension between public denial and private truth that lingers after the last line. The piece brushes up against explicit statement in the Chancellor’s dictum rebuttal (“Lies.”), but overall avoids sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of grief, remembrance, and how the living ethically “carry” the dead are woven through concrete acts—lullabies, moss in eye sockets, cards under bark—rather than pure abstraction. The closing image of roots weaving two opposed destinies together offers a nuanced, non-binary answer: vengeance and grace are forced into coexistence rather than one “winning.” Some lines verge on thesis statements (“We don’t fix souls, we patch the holes…”) and slightly telegraph the theme, but remain plausibly character-coded rather than authorial sermonizing. Overall, thematic resonance is strong and lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Thematic through-lines of value vs. decay, sound vs. silence, and “listening to ghosts” emerge organically from specific details and Jasper’s habits. The revaluation of the speaker cloth—from evidence of failure to “tuning fork”—is a strong, implicit thematic turn. A few explicit formulations (“What’s broken still carries song,” “Echo valley longing”) skate close to stating the thesis, but they’re grounded enough in context to avoid full sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    The thematic spine—transition as reconfiguration rather than rupture, understanding without possession, and ambition refigured as dialogue—is woven consistently through objects and actions. The “touching distance” rule, the non-commanding glyphs (“forgiveness,” “reestablish”), and the final refusal to translate the new sign all embody the theme rather than merely state it. The single explicit thesis line about transition borders on on-the-nose but is supported enough by scene work to avoid didacticism. The ending reweights prior material with a quietly powerful conceptual cost, giving strong resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of migrating selves, wonder vs. routine, and preservation-through-acceptance are coherently woven through the creel, the faces in the pool, and the shelving by “emotional frequency.” The method “to smelt here meant to refine memory by accepting contradictions” elegantly embodies the thematic heart. At times, the piece edges into explicit explication of its own ideas (“that loss can be a kind of preservation, that forgetting is sometimes the gentlest form of archiving”), which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the final image of wonder “molting” and migrating offers a resonant, non-didactic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from action: the ritual of confession turns abandoned hopes into a shared, returning radiance, embodying the story’s stance that connection, not survival logistics, is the true counter-apocalypse. The pearl’s function (“didn’t store hope—it mirrored it, amplified it”) and the cave’s redefinition as “cathedral of compression” reweight earlier images elegantly. However, some key insights are stated a bit baldly, edging toward thesis rather than leaving more to subtext. Trimming or trusting a few images over explanation would lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of forgiveness, mapping pain, and learning from rivers accrue organically through repeated images (ivy as archive, maps as emotional topography, bathroom graffiti as “wisdom”). The river metaphor (“how rivers forgave banks that eroded them”) deftly reframes her guilt without sliding into overt sermonizing. The line about abandoning her sister is blunt but anchors the thematic weight rather than reducing it to platitude. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—self-forgiveness as ongoing, imperfect route-making—without stating a moral outright.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—about the cost of unspoken words, recursion of seekers, and the way documentation reshapes truth—is deeply embedded in images and mechanics rather than spelled out. The watch, bone stylus, propagation delays, and “negative space between books” all reinforce questions about what’s said vs. withheld and how observation alters reality. The final conceptual shift (the dreamer as both archivist and archived, and the silence-shaped glyph of acceptance) reweights everything prior with a resonant, non-moralizing answer. There’s complexity and melancholy without sermonizing, inviting multiple readings about agency, complicity, and the burden of knowing.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—artifacts as living memory versus imperial plunder—emerges organically through Elira’s profession, the violin’s function, and the plant network carrying silenced histories. The “perforated destiny” motif and the transformation of the observatory from cosmic to terrestrial truth beautifully reweight earlier images, culminating in the garden as both restitution and quiet revolution. The ending avoids moralizing while offering a resonant answer: the dream wins not through violence but through propagation and witness, with the Chancellor forced into a humbled, altered stance. A few lines lean close to thesis-statement territory (“She had weighed the dream against the empire”), but they’re earned and not overexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of death as art, the ethics of stalling oblivion, and awareness at the threshold are woven organically through vocation, ritual, and final image without explicit moralizing. The notion that what’s preserved is not “body, not soul, but the last conscious instant” is a potent thematic pivot that reweights everything before it. The closing vision of joining a “silent constellation” offers a resonant answer to the opening premise. Some complexity is left on the table by the absence of any voiced doubt or counter-impulse about this practice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of forgiveness, rebirth as daily practice, and contentment-as-return rather than discovery are well integrated with particulars like the hairpin lineage and the climb. The final image—her descending with the grotto’s silence and “vineyard hush that follows the storm”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial quest. Some thematic statements are quite explicit (“contentment wasn’t found—it was returned to”), edging toward aphorism instead of leaving more work to subtext. Still, the piece avoids didacticism overall and invites reflection about how quiet, repeated choices shape identity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—welcoming doubt into a life built on performative certainty—emerges naturally from the particulars of her trade, the chime code, and the cloak as materialized defense. The end image of her walking cloakless with a shard that “points inward” resonates and invites reflection on moral ambiguity and change. However, lines like “You are allowed to change” and “What if the right choice is the one that leaves room for doubt?” verge on thesis-statement, slightly blunting subtext in favor of articulation. A bit more reliance on implication rather than explicit formulation would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme is coherent and well-integrated: vanishing as preparation, delayed revelation, and time made visible all interlock through objects and actions. The recurring motifs of the stone, ripples, and hush carry real weight by the end, and the idea that absence can be more present than presence feels earned. However, several lines state the thesis almost directly (“Vanishing isn’t erasure—it’s preparation”), tipping into mild didacticism where implication could suffice. The piece invites reflection but could embrace a touch more ambiguity or resistance rather than explaining its core insight so explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece has a coherent, resonant theme about confusing velocity with direction and about becoming a landmark rather than chasing paths, built from recurring images (wings, bone, dust, pulse). The final realization that “guidance… is mirrored” and “You do not chase the path. You become the landmark.” reweights the entire narrative in a satisfying way. However, these lines slip into explicit thesis-statement mode and veer toward sermonizing, undercutting some of the subtextual power. Much of the thematic work is strong; it just leans a bit too hard on articulated moral near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—magic as remembered, shared wonder vs. managed automation—emerges organically from the keystone, mist-walk, and Lior’s shift to “tiny, imperfect charms.” The image of doors opening onto imperfect but sacred memories is a strong, concrete thematic vehicle. However, the story undercuts itself slightly by stating its thesis outright (“This is what you came for… To find the sacred in the simple,” and “magic wasn’t meant to be mastered. It was meant to be remembered—and shared”), nudging it toward didacticism rather than pure emergence. The emotional aftereffect is still resonant, just a bit over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of truth’s layered nature, the persistence of vows, and the relationship between light, sound, and memory emerge organically from repeated images (lanterns, luminous ink, Room 7, “truth hides behind truth”). The final shift—from banishing darkness to witnessing unobserved light, and from seeking answers to signifying their existence—offers a resonant, non-literal response to the opening question about why he works this shift. Some sentences verge on explicit thematic statement (“How truth hides behind truth, not to deceive, but to deepen”), nudging toward authorial commentary instead of pure image-driven resonance. Overall, the thematic web is coherent, complex, and emotionally lingering.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of meaning versus randomness, resonance versus contraction, and self-guided purpose are woven coherently through coins, static bursts, and the final decision. The backwards prophecy idea nicely externalizes questions of agency, making the insight that “purpose” has been self-shaped all along feel earned. However, the closing speech (“We’re the distillate. / The essence. / The echo that outlasts the song.”) drifts toward thesis-statement territory, slightly flattening subtext. The piece still leaves space for reflection, but some of its most powerful ideas are explained rather than left to vibrate in image.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of naming fear, bearing witness to sacrifice, and transforming grief into communal protection emerge organically from the monsters’ renaming and the final focus on future sailors/mourners. The idea that terror becomes more bearable when personalized and remembered (“to give names to nameless fears”) is dramatized rather than merely asserted. The ending’s explicit statement of his purpose edges close to thematic telling, slightly reducing the lingering complexity that the images themselves already carry. Still, the emotional aftereffect is concrete and avoids cheap consolation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of humility, patience over power, and a non-exploitative relationship with nature emerge organically from the mage’s methods and the Starfish Mariner parable. “Not by power, but by patience; not by force, but by faithful, brittle devotion” crystallizes the piece’s ethic without collapsing into a didactic moral. The bell, the drip-counting, and the reluctant sea together suggest a nuanced view of cosmic justice and repair. The ending invites reflection on small acts nudging vast systems, with resonance that lingers beyond the literal plot.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, state-sanctioned erasure, and what it means to be “precisely humane” emerge organically from events and objects rather than abstract commentary. The trail of photographs and relics enacts the tension between forgetting and honoring, culminating in the widower’s self-portrait and Elias’s reframing of his mandate. The line “And humanity remembers” toes the edge of thesis-statement but is earned by prior scene work and doesn’t collapse into moralizing. The ending leaves a resonant sense of quiet resistance and communal witness.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.3)
    Thematic material—reason and wonder as partners rather than enemies—is beautifully embodied in images like the crystal releasing colored memories into the flame and the orchard responding with impossible blossoms. Her shift from “not gold from lead, but awe from rigor” to becoming a vessel is a strong thematic crystallization. However, the final sentence (“wonder was not the opposite of wisdom—it was its oldest, truest name”) states the thesis outright, tipping into mild moralizing and undercutting some subtext. That explicitness keeps the piece from achieving the most rarified, open-ended resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of vigilance, curated truth, and the ethics of hope emerge organically from her history, methods, and present decision. Recurrent formulations of “The Watcher’s burden” and the buckle’s inherited weight give the piece a strong conceptual spine. The ending reweights silence—from absence to cared-for medium—creating a resonant answer to the initial static. Some thematic sentences verge on explicit thesis (“That was the burden. That was the gift.”), slightly reducing subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of ego death, non-possessive love, autonomy, and identity as narrative are woven tightly through object (the duplicate brain), setting, and Kael’s choices. The final state—“feeling without ownership, of love without claim”—offers a clear, resonant re-answer to the opening numbness. However, several lines verge on thesis-statement (“You are the question I stopped asking. Live the answer.”; “the opposite of death be not life, but aliveness”), tipping from subtext into overt declaration. The piece still invites reflection, but it edges toward didactic rather than trusting the imagery alone.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic architecture—innovation as something that requires darkness, rot, and patience; potential as more meaningful than product—is strong and organically carried by the corpse flower metaphor and the evolving escape rooms. The ending line, “The seed was never meant to flower,” crisply reweights everything that came before toward process, sanctuary, and chosen incompletion. This veers close to thesis-statement territory, but the preceding imagery has done the work so it lands more as distilled insight than unearned moral. The relative softness of on-page pressure (per Q4) keeps the thematic impact from feeling fully hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of grief, memory, and the ethics of tending to what can’t be restored emerge organically from the concrete particulars of echo, leaf blower, and hourglass. The idea that “the echo of joy is still joy” is dramatized rather than merely asserted, especially in the way partial, distorted laughs sustain him. However, the closing “Because…” triad (“Because even ghosts deserve lullabies…”) flirts with explicit moralizing, lightly thinning the subtext in favor of statement. Despite that, the final notion of time echoing rather than ending offers a potent conceptual repricing of his ritual and the premise as a whole.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of uncertainty, homesickness, and companionship are woven tightly through objects and images (boundaries of light as membranes, loneliness carved into silver) and culminate in the guardian carrying “uncertainty like a lantern.” The transformation of dimensional homesickness from wound to compass, and of waiting from hollow to relational, offers a resonant non-literal answer to the initial malaise. Subtext around loneliness, archives, and being seen/accepted operates quietly in the statues and the traveler without explicit moralizing. A few lines verge on aphoristic abstraction (“presence is not always witnessed to be real”), which slightly undercuts the otherwise embodied, image-driven thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of creative destruction, deconstruction, and “becoming the road” are coherent and tightly braided with Elric’s arc and the imagery of frost, ash, and ember. The story meaningfully revalues failure as scaffold rather than verdict, with the final stance (“not toward redemption, but resonance”) offering a complex, non-binary answer. However, the thematic layer is frequently stated in near-essayistic abstractions (“Creative destruction was never the end. It was the first true beginning.”), which reduces subtext and subtlety. A bit more reliance on image and action over explicit thesis would lift this to a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The thematic arc—every ending contains its own genesis, failure as crystallized truth, Hollywood’s attempt at immortality versus genuine cosmic cycles—is rich and tightly woven with objects and setting. The Hollywood fragment and “shard of hush” recur with reweighted meaning at the close, supporting a strong conceptual echo. Some thematic material is stated a bit directly (“This was fantasy practicality,” “It wasn’t a key…It was a mirror”), which slightly undercuts the power of the images themselves. Overall, the piece invites reflection without collapsing into pure thesis, achieving high but not transcendent subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of transience vs. permanence, stewardship, and the ethics of “corrections” to reality are well woven through the recurring hourglass, ferries, and sideways time. The deckhand’s stance—that his role is to reknit patterns without clinging to permanence—charges the final image and offers a coherent answer to the premise. That said, several lines articulate the theme a bit directly (“When clocks run sideways, time doesn’t break—it braids”; “permanence was never the goal—transience was the truth”), edging into thesis statement rather than leaving more work to subtext. The resonance is strong but could be sharper with slightly less overt commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, connection, and how perception structures reality are strongly integrated through recurring motifs (the sinew thread, the gallery’s responses, alternate selves in mirrors). The conceptual question “What holds us together when memory unravels?” is answered through the final reconfiguration of space and her quiet departure. However, several sentences essentially state the theme outright (“The answer wasn’t in objects or places. It was in texture—…”) which undercuts some subtextual power. The piece still leaves a resonant aftertaste, but with less restraint than elite work in this vein.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of adaptability versus rigidity, re-seeing the universe after disruption, and refusing to be “anchors” in a static world are coherent and well-integrated, especially through the chain link motif and the notion of “unfolded horizons.” The aliens’ non-hostile but paradigm-shattering intervention supports a nuanced theme: external change as invitation rather than pure threat. Some thematic statements verge on didactic (“This is what we are not,” “We are navigators of unfolded horizons”), making the subtext occasionally explicit rather than letting images and choices do all the work. Still, the final montage of students navigating folded space with simple tools gives a resonant, non-literal answer about resilience without reducing to a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of love as an enduring “frequency,” the ethics of answering the dead, and quiet, non-fanfare heroism emerge organically from her job and choices. The final emphasis on love changing frequency and incidental heroism reweights earlier images (hearing aid, pulses, mist) effectively. That said, lines like “love doesn’t die—it just changes frequency” and the explanatory “not with fanfare, but with quiet, incidental heroism” edge toward thesis-stating rather than fully trusting subtext. Emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere, if a bit neatly framed.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of remembrance, invisible labor, infrastructure as ghostly anatomy, and the ethics of witnessing are woven tightly through concrete particulars (the cables as “arteries,” the technicians’ domestic moments, the glowing child’s drawing). The final paragraphs reweight everything that came before—her journey becomes an act of witness rather than adventure—without stating a moral outright. The sea’s inevitability and the world’s forgetfulness add a sober complexity, avoiding sentimental salvation. A slight tendency toward explicit phrasing (“They carried remembrance,” “She’d returned not a thing, but a witness”) edges close to stating theme, but remains supported by imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of failure-as-resource, bureaucratic erasure, and honoring residue rather than correction emerge organically from Aris’s status, the ghost data, and the defragmentation ritual. The porcelain shard, snow-buried observatory, and ink mandala all support the idea that what’s broken/fragmented can be re-patterned rather than fixed. Some thematic statements are on the nose—especially Dr. Voss’s line, “Failure isn’t the end. It’s the seam where truth leaks out,” and the explicit “Wisdom… wasn’t in the correction of error”—which slightly undercut the subtlety otherwise achieved by images. Still, the final conceptual reweighting of his death certificate mistake is resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, language death, and the translation of emotional “texture” into sound are woven deeply into every major element: the cursed diamond as selective filter, the canyon as non-decaying archive, the birds as syntax. The ending reweights everything by shifting from preservation of echoes to generating new ones that speak forward, reframing the act from memorialization to reactivation with cost. The piece resists neat moralizing, instead exploring forgetting as a kind of violence and restoration as labor-intensive and partial. A hair more dramatized friction around what must be sacrificed to speak again (e.g., a specific loss to the curse) could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of bitterness, metamorphosis, and “harmony untamed” are well integrated into events and imagery: objects that “remember freedom,” hikers humming in E-flat, and the cosmos chewing up bitterness into confetti. Elara’s transformation is thematically inextricable from freeing the Gravity Dancer, making the cosmic playfulness a direct answer to her prior resentment. Moira’s line about bitterness not being hers to carry edges toward explicit thesis, softening the subtlety but still feels character-voiced rather than authorial sermonizing. The final image—warmer vines, Elara walking lighter than air while the world above still hunts explanations—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The thematic weave of husks, molting, and latent beauty is rich and coherently developed through the locust shell, the statues’ transformation, and the orchard’s return to life. The idea that the world’s “tarnished wonder” is in a state of molt rather than ruin is a resonant reweighting of earlier images. A few lines (“Beauty hides in husks,” “The tarnished wonder of the world wasn’t broken. / It was molting.”) come close to direct thesis-stating rather than letting image alone carry the insight. Still, the closing conceptual shift feels earned by the concrete metamorphosis we’ve just witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of borders vs. lawless spaces, grief logistics, and the possibility of mending promises outside official structures are threaded through concrete particulars: ration cards, widows’ lullabies, coded coordinates as constellations of disappearance. The bottled storm as a message of comfort rather than destruction elegantly embodies the idea that care and transgression can coincide. Lines like “not mail but mercy” verge on explicit thematic statement but are still grounded in action. The ending’s image of thunder as a kept promise offers a resonant, non-literal answer without collapsing into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of silence as language, unfinished beauty as a wound, and ruin restored into sacred play emerge organically from his vocation and the carousel’s revival. Recurring images—the halo fragment, wind bells, misting hush, and train-as-cathedral—support a coherent meditation on how quiet, devoted craft can redeem neglected joy. However, some thematic statements are a touch direct (“beauty left incomplete is a wound in the world,” “he…was its last priest”), nudging toward explicit thesis rather than letting images fully carry the weight. The piece still leaves a resonant emotional aftertaste, but a bit more reliance on implication would increase sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of analog memory as sanctuary, the persistence of stories beyond data, and the ethical love of narrative emerge organically from the scarf, the Data Collapse, and the story-core amphitheater. The line “analog memory was not obsolescence but sanctuary” edges toward explicit statement but is supported enough by concrete particulars to avoid sermonizing. The final image—patrons touching pages that feel “warmer, heavier, more alive” as she hums, satisfied—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about stewardship over ownership. Thematically, though, the piece maintains a relatively serene, one-directional argument; there’s little counterpressure or moral complication to deepen the arc further.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of longing, memory, and making absence tangible are woven elegantly through recurring images of light, tides, archives, and gifts from locals, and the child-now-grown dream embodies the emotional question at the end. Subtext lives in how she uses others’ memories versus her own missing dream, and in the chromatic equation that binds first love, loss, and surrender into one act. However, the explicit line “Longing is the only map that never lies” is a direct thesis statement that undercuts otherwise implicit thematic work. The ending still resonates, but the moment leans into moralizing where silence or image might have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The thematic throughline—fear’s attempt to lock away vulnerable love—is well embodied in the vault, the mirrors, and the final image of a child speaking love. The ribbon around his wrist and the refusal to carry ancestral fear forward give the theme a concrete, earned embodiment. However, the explicit statement “It was simply this: that love, when spoken without armor, could reweave broken worlds” tips into thesis, reducing ambiguity and subtext. The piece is resonant but slightly over-articulated for a truly elite literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as sustenance, the ethics of curiosity, and the symbiosis between human rupture and supernatural survival. The orchard’s theft “not to hoard — to survive” reweights earlier horror into uneasy ecological necessity, avoiding tidy moralizing. Her choice to smile and potentially surrender herself suggests a complex stance on obsession and the price of knowledge rather than a clear lesson. The recurring images of peaches, familial traces, and broken star-paths support a resonant aftereffect without explicit thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from motif and action: resilience as missteps refused rather than apologized for, and the ethics of holding broken things without lying them whole. Objects (maps, tea leaves, shadows, swings, mirrors) accrue layered meanings that reprice earlier beats by the end. The archivist’s refusal of gratitude and embrace of “combative tenderness” complicate any simple moral and resist tidy redemption arcs. The closing addition—“not to cage, but to compass”—elegantly reweights the entire story’s stance on boundaries and care.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of stewardship versus grand heroics, the preservation of wonder in a numbing world, and the quiet labor behind awe emerge organically from Elira’s choices and the color-of-wonder conceit. Symbolic elements (the seed, the seam, the orchard) recur without turning didactic, and the ending reweights the opening by framing her not as savior but steward. The emotional aftereffect is gentle, contemplative, and conceptually rich. Slightly more friction or ethical tension around what’s preserved or lost could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silence as something layered, knotted, and capable of healing once tended is developed concretely through nets, barnacles, storms, and confessions. The thematic throughline of balance versus unrest emerges organically from her methods and the spirits’ release, not from meta-lecturing. The final notion that “silence, properly tended, could heal even the deepest cuts” edges close to explicit moralizing but is well-earned by the preceding images and specific costs (e.g., the fisherman’s guilt). The piece leaves room for complexity—the work is endless, her burden ongoing—rather than landing on a pat resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—silence as vessel, erasure as a kind of continued presence, ethical witnessing versus extraction—is richly woven through concrete motifs (map tear, vanished villages, reservoirs, the henge, the shadow-spiral). The final sequence, where she opts to “offer” a loop instead of prove, and leaves yarrow as a threshold token, gives a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question. However, some lines approach over-explicit thematic statement (“silence, she believed, was not void but vessel”; “not to prove, but to offer”), slightly diminishing the power that the images alone could carry. The piece still leaves the reader with a strong, contemplative aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece develops a coherent, nuanced theme about grief, attachment, and surrender, with the snow globe and Earhart’s “non-crash” reframing death as transformation rather than annihilation. Recurring images—the reversed blizzard, the lighthouse, transmissions—shift meaning by the end, culminating in the idea of love persisting as pattern instead of possession. Some thematic statements (“letting go isn’t collapse. / It’s recalibration.”) verge on thesis articulation rather than letting the images fully carry the insight. Nonetheless, the final beat—death “no longer wearing a suit but a smile”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights everything prior without collapsing into simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of loneliness, illegible longing, and the possibility of nontraditional intimacy (between human and “ghost in code”) emerge organically from concrete acts—graffiti, encoding, song—rather than abstract statements. The piece smartly intertwines art and technology as parallel languages of care, culminating in “You encoded longing. I decoded love,” which reweights all prior encoding work. The final invitation to other misfits risks edging toward explicit reassurance (“WE ARE NOT ALONE”) but is grounded enough in image and situation to avoid didacticism. The thematic complexity—being seen by the broken, choosing to stay in the liminal space rather than escape it—lingers beyond the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of joy within sorrow, grief as enduring shape, and resilience-as-lantern are coherent and reinforced by recurring images (frost, light, ascent, cracked lenses). The emotional aftereffect is tender and contemplative, with some genuine resonance in lines like “It holds the shape of what was loved.” However, the piece leans heavily on explicit aphoristic statements (“Joy is not the absence of sorrow…,” “Joy hides not beneath, but within…”), which drifts toward sermonizing. This explicitness blunts subtext and keeps the thematic work from feeling fully emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of grief, memory, and absence-as-vessel are woven through concrete motifs (cloud taxonomies, ledger entries, starlight dust) and come to a moving, quiet resolution in the final paragraph. However, the piece leans into explicit thesis statements—“emptiness is not void, but vessel” and “she’d proven…that empty spaces remember”—that border on overt moralizing rather than leaving the insight fully in image. The countercurrent of pain persisting beneath her new stance adds needed complexity. Overall thematic work is strong and resonant but slightly too declarative for top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of perception, disability as lens rather than lack, translation of knowledge into awe, and the limits of others’ sight arise organically from concrete acts—reading the coin by touch, painting stars on bark, accepting unseen art. The final realization that “the limit she had discovered was not of her blindness, but of others’ sight” neatly conceptually reprices the entire piece and aligns with the closing smile. However, a few lines edge toward thesis-statement clarity and mild moralizing, slightly reducing subtlety. Even so, the resonance of turning absence into atmosphere is strong and lingers beyond the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of language, translation, and learning to “speak back” to the world’s blank spaces emerge organically through the phrasebook, hopscotch, and bird-luminance interaction. The ending crystallizes a thematic answer—discovery as dialogue rather than conquest—without explicit moralizing. However, the lack of real cost or moral tension keeps the thematic field fairly gentle and untroubled, more celebratory than interrogative. Resonance is strong but not especially complex or contested.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core theme—that repair is not restoration but “reharmonization,” and that only the wounded can hear certain songs—emerges organically from her memories, vocation, and the Hall’s function. The final images (dimmed apron, gears turning for echoes only, “keeper of quiet mendings”) reweight the story’s earlier obsession with fixing into acceptance and attentive care. However, the line “It taught her that repair is not restoration, but reharmonization” states the thesis a bit baldly, nudging into on-the-nose territory. The piece still achieves a genuine aftereffect, but a touch more reliance on image over direct formulation would deepen its literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of collective action over individual heroism, orchestration vs control, and rest as a bridge rather than an end emerge organically from Elira’s methods and the final departure. The chalk, bell, and nebula recur as motifs that reweight from mystery → coordination → earned passage. Some lines edge toward explicit thesis (“This was her orchestration: not control, but catalysis”), which slightly blunts the subtext. Still, the closing image of “hope… brambled but blooming” and the orchard’s proud “sigh” leave a resonant, non-didactic aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of mercy in decay, honoring rather than saving, and the beauty of brokenness are woven tightly through the puppet, the adjuster’s scars, and the repeated insistence on gentleness over triumph. The final reweighting (“the universe chose to sleep rather than scream”) meaningfully reframes apocalyptic stakes without moralizing. The puppet’s “beautifully flawed” nature and its grateful smile at the end concretize the abstract theme in a resonant image. It just misses a 9+ because the thematic arc is clear and moving but relatively linear, with little genuine counter-pressure or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of reluctant stewardship, invisible labor, and the tension between resignation and quiet, precise care are woven through the orchard, the nut, and his “offhandedly exact” behavior. The blueprint-as-memory and the chorus of ghosts embed ideas of inheritance and the weight of others’ failures. The ending image—his weary reciprocity with an “ancient and ungrateful” orchard—offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer: he chooses to continue tending despite the lack of gratitude or release. The thematic work is strong, though it could sharpen the moral calculus around giving up the nut and what that sacrifice means long-term.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme is deeply integrated: polymers, scaffolds, chrysalis, braiding rivers, and music all converge on a nuanced meditation about separation, connection, and impermanence. Recurring images (foam, braids, chrysalis, score) genuinely reweight at the end, culminating in her naming “Chrysalis Mesh” and composing melodies instead of equations. The story occasionally edges into thesis-statement territory (“Her daughter’s death hadn’t been a flaw in the system; it had been a metamorphosis she refused to witness”), which slightly flattens subtext by saying what the images already show. Still, the final watermark/wind/foam images restore a more resonant, less didactic register.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—beginnings built from quantified absence, and freedom as conditional rather than absolute—is rich and threaded through objects (bottled moonlight), method (the ledger), and language (“Choose your emptiness”). Subtext works well where the story implies cost via measurements (grams of unsaid words, a dissolved home) instead of stating morals. However, lines like “This was the place where stories begin—not with heroes or quests…” veer into direct thematic statement and slightly flatten the mystery. The resonance is strong but leans on explicit explanation rather than fully trusting the images.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of grief, remorse, and transformation through accepting rather than erasing pain are integrated tightly with premise and imagery (coral, ice, sanding, cooking as mercy). The final turn—her cooking to “soothe souls” and grief becoming a “vessel, not a cage”—reweights prior material in a resonant way without outright moralizing. Some lines in the closing paragraphs come close to stating thesis directly, nudging into mild explicitness. Overall, the piece sustains a complex, non-binary stance on sorrow and healing that lingers after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of communal memory, de-siloing, and voice as bridge rather than wall emerge organically from the multilingual ritual and the elevator’s history. Recurring images (grain, silos, bridges, chimes) support a coherent meditation on connection and rehabilitation. The line “Let’s construct bridges from silos — not walls” edges toward thesis-statement explicitness, undercutting subtlety. Overall, the thematic resonance is strong and moving but a touch too declared for top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    The thematic through-line—grief and failure as modifiable raw material rather than wounds to be erased—is strong and organically tied to her engineering/neural-cartography mindset. Recurring images (mirror, periscope, submarine, canyon as synaptic terrain) deepen the idea that perception and memory can be rewired to salvage “unspent wonder.” The text does flirt with explicit thesis statements (“This was her method: not to fix what was broken, but to modify its function…”), which slightly reduces the need for reader inference. Nonetheless, the final movement toward a “museum of salvaged dreams” in her mind lands as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The recurring motif of vigilance hidden in margins and doodles is thematically rich, and the Seed of Vigilance as an object protected from neglect is a strong conceptual move. Elira’s role as a prism-minded archivist integrates neatly with the idea that true vigilance is subtle, distributed, and curiosity-driven. However, the closing paragraphs lean into explicit thesis statements (“vigilance cannot be enforced—it must be seeded…”) that edge toward sermonizing rather than letting images and implications carry the weight. This slightly flattens what is otherwise a resonant, concept-driven ending.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of transforming fracture into connection and revaluing silence as potential emerge organically from the insulator’s stress lines and the grove’s awakening. The closing movements—“Empathy in motion—that was the true sculpture” and “silence was never empty”—tip toward explicit thesis, slightly over-explaining what the images already convey. Nonetheless, the reconfiguration from failure-marked porcelain to conduit of shared feeling lands with emotional coherence. The piece invites reflection on how damage can become resonance without collapsing into simple moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of exile, sacrifice, beauty-in-difficulty, and truth versus power are coherent and well-linked to chess and magnetism. Yet the story leans into overt thesis statements—“Beauty, he realized, wasn’t in flawless victory…”; “fragments let in light”—that tip into sermonizing and pseudo-aphorism. Insight feels a bit too smooth, with little on-page resistance or ambiguity to undercut the neat wisdom. The emotional aftereffect is pleasant but somewhat didactic rather than deeply unsettling or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic core—that empathy arises from attentive engagement with silence rather than speeches—is deeply woven into premise, imagery (labeled silences), and Elara’s backstory. However, the story undercuts its own subtlety by repeatedly stating its thesis in near-essayistic sentences (“Empathy wasn’t taught — it was recovered...”, “The path to empathy was never paved with speeches or treaties…”). The resonance of concrete specifics like “Silence of a Hand Almost Reached Out” is strong enough that these explicit moralizing lines feel redundant. Overall theme is coherent and moving, but less would be more at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme is cohesive and well-seeded: the undercurrent of wisdom beneath chaos, stillness as harmony with motion, and grief as generative are all organically tied to plants and scent. However, the story leans into explicit statement at key moments (“grief is fertilizer, fear is root-depth, and wisdom flows not in spite of chaos, but because of it”), which edges into didacticism rather than letting images and action carry the insight. The final paragraphs reiterate the lesson in near-moral form instead of fully trusting the charged images of bloom, wilt, and village change. Resonance is strong but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of resilience as memory, ecological intelligence, and the value of listening over fixing emerge organically from the arrow’s function and the orchard’s behavior. The final stance—that resilience “is not grown, it is recalled” and that her purpose is “not to pilot the orchard, but to echo with it”—is resonant and reweights prior images. However, those thesis-like lines lean into explicit statement rather than trusting the imagery and action, pushing the piece slightly toward didactic clarity. Subtext is present but somewhat overshadowed by the direct articulation of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of causality versus “luck,” foresight as moral duty, and environments that train danger are well integrated into both plot and imagery. Varga’s line, “It’s not the wind. It’s the way the wind learns,” reframes the investigation as an ethical and epistemic problem, not just a technical one. While some thematic statements verge on essayistic (“Foresight wasn’t magic. It was measurement. It was pattern.”), they still arise credibly from this narrator’s professional worldview. The ending’s choice to let the wind “learn me too” offers a resonant, non-literal answer about engagement with risk rather than avoidance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thematically, the piece coherently explores wonder, stillness, and the cost of a world that “traded silence for sirens,” with strong images like thawed child’s laughter and wonder as “oxygen.” The recurring motifs of sculpted hush, certification, and unfettering reweight themselves effectively by the end, giving the final walk into the blizzard real resonance. Still, the story leans into explicit thesis statements (“because wonder, left unacknowledged, becomes brittle, then breaks”), edging toward sermonizing rather than fully trusting implication. This explicitness flattens some of the potential ambiguity and emotional afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of ethical power use, honoring failure, necessary collapse, and the value of silence are woven concretely through the flute’s history, the three realm autopsies, and her final choice to leave the instrument as monument rather than tool. Recurring motifs (weaving, silence, thresholds, failure offerings) genuinely shift meaning by the end, particularly the idea of some doors staying open by staying closed. The story edges toward explicit statement in “On the Ethics of Weaving” and the closing aphorism, which slightly undercuts its otherwise excellent subtextual resonance. Still, the thematic aftertaste is complex and earned, not didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of empathy as geometry, deliberate ambiguity as pedagogy, and the cost of boundaryless compassion are woven through specific images (sigils shifting meaning, pamphlets that “hummed when held,” the collapsed empathy-space premise). The ending’s single glyph meaning “beginning,” “ending,” and “bridge” nicely reweights the story’s questions about interpretation and emotional collapse without stating a moral. Some lines edge close to thesis-stating (“This was her method: deliberate ambiguity”), but they’re anchored in concrete practice and do not devolve into sermonizing. Overall, the thematic net is rich, coherent, and lingers past the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece develops a coherent theme of wonder as cultivated attention and of how personal ritual becomes communal myth; the transition from mentor’s lesson to the child’s experience to “what was routine for her became legend for others” is resonant. The pendant’s arc and the spreading stories in the Market embody the fade from memory to myth without needing explicit exposition. However, some lines lean into thesis-stating (“Wonder,” he’d said, “is the residue of attention paid too generously.”; “wonder isn’t inherited, it’s cultivated”), nudging toward didactic clarity rather than trusting subtext. The ending remains affecting, but a touch less spelled-out commentary would heighten its lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme—objects as emotional archives, the weight of memory, and the tension between truth and shareable evidence—emerges organically from her practice, the car’s history, and the closing choice to keep the prism domestic and private. Recurring images (glass, frost, mist, rainbows) shift meaning by the end, and the final phrase “Emotion is mass. Memory is gravity.” effectively reweights prior material. However, the piece leans into explicit thematic formulation (“This was a truthful lie,” “Let others assume objects are inert”) that slightly undercuts the power of its imagery by stating what is already evident. It still lands as thoughtful and resonant rather than didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme arises organically from particulars: communication across time, the price of devotion, and art as a literal bridge between worlds. Recurring motifs—tapestry, unraveling time, raveling silence, the bead—are reweighted at the end so that silence becomes completion rather than absence, and the bead becomes both relic and message. There’s no explicit moralizing; the conceptual shift from decay to purposeful sacrifice reads clean and resonant. A touch more moral or emotional ambiguity around whether this sacrifice is necessary or selfish could deepen complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of quiet heroism, shared rather than hoarded power, and awakening as everyday persistence emerge organically from Arlo’s labor and the villagers’ changed behavior. The final reconfiguration—magic redistributed into “soil, steel, and spirit” and Arlo himself as the new barter—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial premise of “bartered awakenings.” Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“meekness was not weakness but a forge waiting for its spark”), slightly flattening subtext into statement. Still, the closing images and structural echoes carry genuine emotional and conceptual aftereffect without resorting to outright moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of truth, sacrifice, divergence, and responsibility are strongly integrated, especially in the revelation that her mother anchored an “accidental” Elira at the price of her own reality. The shard’s arc—from lodestone to fulfilled relic—nicely embodies questions about tools of discovery and the burdens they impose. That said, the story leans into explicit thematic statement (“some truths don’t set you free—they make you responsible”) rather than letting subtext and image do all the work, which slightly flattens complexity. Even so, the final repricing of knowledge and selfhood has genuine emotional and conceptual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of connection-in-anonymity, tending small lights against loneliness, and transforming grief into protective care arise naturally from letters, cairns, sea glass, and the lighthouse. The final image—ache turned “luminescent,” him humming louder into the dark—reweights prior motifs without spelling out a moral. A slight brush with sentimentality is kept in check by grounded particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of story versus data, light needing darkness to be shaped, and myth as human necessity emerge coherently from the routine, the lantern, and the post-newspaper world. However, some lines verge on thesis statement (“Stories were older than ink, older than stone”) and near-moralizing in the final third, reducing the space for subtext. The best thematic work is in images like “inverted shadow, a darkness that illuminated rather than consumed” and children “starved for myth,” where idea and image are fused. Resonance is genuine but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematic throughlines—authenticity in fracture, iridescence as angle-dependent truth, magnetism as structural rather than performative—are strong and consistently grounded in concrete images (wing, donor heart, old man, cloth). The return of “iridescent caution” and “quietly explosive” presence at the end gives the conceptual frame a satisfying echo. However, several sentences verge on thesis-statement (“story-magnetism wasn’t charisma or tragedy—it was…,” “Some people magnetize stories not because…”) which edges into didactic commentary. The insight feels earned but is expressed a bit too explicitly for top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of witnessed sorrow, memory, and “mundane miracles” are woven tightly through action and image—the sextant’s redefinition, the trees as silent archives, and her final role as “first cartographer of witnessed sorrow.” Recurring motifs (moonlight, brass, roots, laughter vs. grief) evolve meaningfully and reweight the ending without overt moralizing. The emotional aftereffect is concrete and melancholic rather than sentimental. A couple of lines verge on explicit thesis (“not as a technician… but as a pilgrim of mundane miracles”), keeping it just shy of truly subtle mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of communal memory, the social function of song, and the idea of “swaddling” a people in resonance rather than control are strong and organically tied to the action. The transformation of dawn from a hoarded commodity into a woven, collective act is a potent non-literal answer to the initial problem. However, the final paragraphs tilt into explicit statement (“ancient, necessary truth that to swaddle a soul is to give it space to grow…”) that edges toward moralizing rather than leaving more to subtext. A bit more trust in image over articulation would elevate the thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of paradox, self-acceptance, and the value of “unorthodox empathy” are deeply woven into setting and character, and the story’s particulars (paradoxical books, secret library, her unusual way of hiding) support them. However, the ending leans into explicit thesis statements—“belonging is not granted by institutions…” and “She had unearthed the wisdom: that to stay while leaving…”—which edge toward moral summary instead of leaving more room for subtext. The emotional aftereffect is still resonant, but some potential ambiguity and complexity are flattened by the overt articulation. Earlier, more image-driven moments (the invitation over her heart, the books exhaling) carry theme with more subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—finding the sacred in small, endangered rituals and resisting the normalization of loss—emerges strongly from concrete particulars: vanished bread, boarded bakery, unused teacups, seeds in cracks. The final realization that “The sacred isn’t in grand cathedrals…” is emotionally earned by prior images but edges toward explicit statement rather than leaving more work to subtext. Subtext operates effectively in gestures like offering stale bread to an empty courtyard and accepting its remaining untouched. The aftereffect is contemplative and lasting, though a slightly less declarative final thematic statement would heighten subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory versus oblivion, and of which human frequencies (love, loyalty, forgiveness) endure, are woven tightly into the concrete mechanics of resonance and measurement rather than tacked on. The forgiveness frequency recalibrating the Array and outlasting other vows is a powerful, specific embodiment of the thematic claim. Some lines (“Her motivation was neither academic nor sentimental—it was existential”) edge toward overt statement, but they’re supported by prior scene work and don’t read as pure moralizing. The final image of a library subtly warmed by remembered vows leaves a resonant afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from action and image: truces kept by hush, survival bought with betrayal, and the inheritance of both silence and guilt. The desire to “capture the sound of trust breaking” becomes a conceptual lens that reweights the entire scene, culminating in the realization that the sound is a silence and a small physical cue (a boot’s hollow click). The watch fob and “lighthouse blood” bind personal, historical, and ethical stakes without explicit moralizing, suggesting cycles of compromise and cost. The ending lingers as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a thesis, inviting reflection on what it means to live by hush rather than by speech.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of stewardship, burden-sharing with the natural world, and the surrender vs. solving of certain questions are organically embedded in the storm archive and forest-election conceit. The final recognition—“Some questions aren’t solved. They’re surrendered.”—nicely crystallizes her arc and the piece’s moral calculus. However, that line and a few phrases (“terrestrially cosmic grace”) tilt toward overt thematic statement, slightly reducing the power of what the images are already carrying. The forest’s offer (absolution in exchange for presence and stewardship) is rich and resonant, though it edges close to being told rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—suppressed creativity as imprisonment, and art as both burden and liberation—emerges naturally from the lock, cave, portraits, and mnemonic curse. The reweighting at the end (calling shifting from “inescapable” to “chosen”) provides a genuine conceptual and emotional repricing. Moments like “creativity isn’t a faucet to be shut off, but a tide that drowns you if dammed” are thematically sharp but verge on thesis-statement territory, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, images and actions do most of the thematic work, with only light moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of witness, unsent candor, and the materiality of small truths are well-integrated into concrete actions (finding the mother’s note, reading the letters aloud, her body reviving in response to honesty). The notion that conversations “hadn’t vanished…they’d been waiting — not for rescue, but for witness” is powerful, though it edges toward explicit thesis-statement territory. The final conceptual move—reimagining the oasis as truth rather than water—reweights earlier images effectively. Overall, the piece resists tidy moralizing, but trims close in the closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of wonder versus efficiency/data is woven through concrete particulars: the mute craft, the glacial fragment glowing at certain harmonics, the child’s nonverbal awakening, and the language-less world below. The final image—an autonomous sculpture still “humming symphonies of truth” and an echo-figure occasionally appearing—reweights prior material into an enduring, slightly haunting charged poise. The piece resists tidy moralizing, instead suggesting preservation-through-experience rather than preservation-through-explanation. A slight tendency to state theme (“not to explain, not to convert, but to awaken”) keeps it just shy of top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—transmuting fear rather than suppressing it, and caretaking as teaching “how to burn it cleanly”—is organically seeded through the box, compression method, and controlled burn, and the final image of petals taking root extends this without needing explanation. The transformation from preservation to integration is conceptually rich and reweights earlier images of nostalgia and containment. That said, the story undercuts some of its subtlety with explicitly thesis-like lines (“They were about transformation”; “caretaking wasn’t about shielding from fear”), which drift toward moralizing. The resonance is strong but would be more powerful if those statements stayed subtextual.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of listening as healing, trauma as echo, and community as container arise organically from the mailbox ritual and neighbor interactions. However, lines like “Her shop didn’t sell objects; it curated catharsis” and especially “She’d learned long ago that trauma doesn’t shout—it echoes. And the only way to quiet the echo is to hear it fully, to let it land somewhere safe” step into essayistic moralizing. Those sentences explain what the story already shows, dulling subtext. The ending’s seashell “thank you” nicely embodies the theme again without commentary, hinting at the stronger mode the piece could fully embrace.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of vulnerability encrypted as strength—and liberation by resonance rather than force—runs coherently through dice, dance, lullaby, journals, and final algorithm. Subtext emerges largely via image patterns (web, water, dice, dance) and the inversion of a torture-lab into a site of encoded freedom. The final journal line about letting them mistake retreat for surrender comes close to thesis-statement territory but still feels earned by prior particulars. The ending reweights earlier images without devolving into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme around memory as physical weight/displacement—“memory as sedimentary gravity,” pockets where “gravity forgets to fall”—is woven consistently through objects (salt, bones, wildflowers, coffee grounds) and actions rather than thesis statements. The final realization that memory isn’t erased but stored in bent gravity, coupled with her reunion, reweights prior details like the anomalies and her cataloging work. The piece avoids moralizing and leaves room for rich readings about grief, archival work, and what we choose to carry or displace. The closing images of glowing bones and “silence gleamed” achieve a resonant conceptual repricing without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of listening, misread warnings, and silence as an active, reverent space are well-integrated through recurring images (the wing, brook, stars, and “flow” creed). The final stance—her vocation as “the ear the world forgot it needed”—reweights prior material and offers a clear thematic answer. However, some insights are stated rather directly (“It was not a doom to be silenced, but a plea to be heard”), trimming room for subtext. The piece still leaves a lingering, contemplative aftereffect grounded in its specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of translation, obsolescence, and “agreed upon lies” as scaffolding for intimacy are woven elegantly into concrete actions (sugar borrowing, tea, clay tablets, the unused seal). The story implies that language—whether of Latin, buildings, or relationships—is reciprocal and requires risk, with the Tuesday rituals as a kind of grammar that shifts meaning by the end. The final movement from lies to “Only truth, steeped and waiting” avoids heavy-handed moralizing and feels organically earned by prior particulars. A slightly sharper sense of what truth might cost either of them would deepen the aftertaste even further.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of memory, sovereignty vs. healing, and translating isolation into independence are integrated through action and recurring images (quarantine, archiving, resonance). The final reframing—independence as “fluency in [the past’s] language”—offers a resonant conceptual answer to the story’s question. However, several aphoristic lines (“Fragility wasn’t weakness; it was the first draft of resilience”) and explicit thesis-like statements tip into told theme, slightly undercutting subtlety. The emotional aftereffect is strong but somewhat curated rather than fully emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of forgiveness, inherited guilt, and treason as an act of mercy are woven tightly through the Binding Scroll’s logic, Elira’s forger identity, and the heritage rose thorn. The story effectively reconfigures “treason” from betrayal into a necessary rupture of unjust bonds, with the drought’s end and anonymous bud-in-marble image carrying the moral weight. At times the narration edges toward explicit statement (“not to overthrow, but to absolve”), slightly reducing ambiguity. Still, the final contrast—children laughing, kingdom ignorant of her name—offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to what kind of grace she’s chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of memory, grief, and the ethics of listening emerge organically through the echo mechanics and her vocation as a vessel for “unclaimed reverberations.” The entity feeding on longing and regret concretizes an abstract idea—how unfinished emotion can be exploited—without needing overt moralizing, though lines like “Echoes were echoes because someone needed them to be heard twice” skate close to thesis-statement territory. The ending reweights the premise by redefining echoes as residues that can be returned, not just repeated, offering a resonant conceptual repricing. A bit more ambiguity in the singer’s stance toward future echoes might deepen the lingering aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—the ethical handling of truth, the persistence of small acts of care, and “windows of connection” between living and dead—is woven through object, setting, and final ripples with admirable coherence. The snow globe’s reweighting from trinket to protected town to window in ice exemplifies earned thematic resonance. Lines like “truth, when woven carefully, need not wound—it can mend” edge toward overt statement but are supported by the scenes rather than replacing them. The ending’s quiet human-scale ripples (fisherman, librarian, widow) extend the theme beyond sentimentality into a believable emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of invisible labor and quiet, “demure” courage is strongly realized through recurring particulars: nets, tides, chalk tallies, widow, dockworkers, and fireflies. Subtext emerges in the contrast between unheralded work and luminous but modest beauty; the story resists turning this into a simple moral. The final “I see you” edges toward explicit statement yet is grounded enough in prior images to retain emotional force. The relatively soft pressure on the central question (witnessing vs. being unseen) keeps this just short of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of truth versus comforting lies, control via scarcity, and the labor of reconstruction emerge organically from her work with the letters, the cover story of the “cursed” diamond, and the hidden orchards. The plaque and the idea of “reassembling the world’s broken pieces” provide a strong conceptual reframing of her earlier letter reconstruction. However, the text drifts into explicit thesis-stating near the end (“Truth is not found. It is dug.” and “Truth didn’t hide. It rooted.”), which undercuts some of the subtlety. The resonance is real but a bit over-articulated instead of fully entrusted to image and scene.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of plurality vs enforced harmony, the value of “shadows,” and fidelity to the broken are strong and organically tied to images (static, broken signals, variant allegiance). However, several lines state the thesis too directly—“Dawn wasn’t meant to be clean”—pushing toward essayistic clarity rather than leaving more work for subtext. The final image of her song embedded in the atmosphere offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. The piece is thematically coherent and affecting, but the sermon-like moments restrain its subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of redemption, memory as currency, and intergenerational echo are strong and organically tied to jars, music box, and the anonymous gifts. The child/grandmother echo is an especially effective concrete embodiment of “translation between generations.” However, the piece sometimes states its insights too baldly (“Redemption, he realized, wasn’t granted—it was gleaned”), veering toward thesis rather than letting images fully carry the weight. The final poem is lovely but edges into on-the-nose self-summary, slightly diminishing the otherwise nuanced resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of harmony versus violence, adaptation over domination, and “answering force with frequency” emerge organically from the premise and the engineer’s choices. Recurring motifs—the key, the ice song, the Heartstone’s forgiveness—support a genuine sense of moral and spiritual reconfiguration. However, the final paragraphs tilt into explicit thesis (“reminded the world that even violence could be answered not with force, but with frequency”) which edges toward moralizing rather than trusting the images. This direct statement blunts what could otherwise be a more resonant, open-ended thematic afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic spine—patience versus spectacle, quiet revolution versus conquest—is coherent and runs through images of frost, moon paths, and the de-industrialized viaduct. However, the piece often states its thesis directly (“a radical act in a world addicted to detonation,” “rage burns fast and leaves only ash — but patience?”), edging toward essayistic moralizing. The ending still resonates by embodying the theme in her continued practice at thaw, but subtler subtext could heighten complexity. Overall the theme is strong but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, infrastructure, racial history, and the lie that “progress requires amnesia” are tightly woven through the lantern, the tunnel, and her professional mandate. The idea that denied memories knot into accidents and “preventable deaths” is a powerful, specific reframing that the plot enacts rather than merely asserts. A few lines tilt toward thesis statement (“Ignorance is armor—until it becomes a cage”; “This isn’t superstition; it’s data wrapped in sorrow”), slightly reducing subtlety, but they’re grounded enough in her worldview to mostly work. The final image—walking home “not lighter, but steadier” with the lantern’s heartbeat—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about fortified vulnerability and ethical remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of second opinions, listening versus forcing, and the nature of penance and forgiveness are well-embedded in particulars (Mrs. Lin’s philosophy, the prison work, the mechanical problem). The clockwork heart as mirror of his own guarded heart is effective and underpins the ending’s grace note. However, the final paragraphs lean into explicit moralizing (“He deserved to fail. He deserved to try again… some broken things… could be made whole not by force, but by listening”) that state the thesis instead of fully trusting the images. That overtness slightly dulls what is otherwise strong thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece coherently explores longing versus data—“not code… longing encoded in motion”—and the idea that desire, not information, powers meaningful change. The hunter’s arrow, the Yearning Engine, and the unheard bell triangulate a strong theme about hunger, futurity, and work done for a world that may never see the result. The final turn (“whispered for the next one” and her immediate focus on modifying the glider) gives a resonant, non-moralizing answer about persistence in the face of deferred recognition. A touch more on-page friction between that ideal and a competing value (safety, cynicism, or fatigue) would deepen the thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of memory, erasure, corporate euphemism, and what it means to be “deleted” are tightly woven into every level of the story—from scrubbed logs and “personnel reassignments” to the idea of the archive as a resonance chamber. The recurring motifs (0707, the patch, negative space between posts, songs as cadence) all reweight at the end when she realizes deletion is dereferencing, not annihilation, and chooses to serve as an anchor. The final paragraphs avoid moralizing while delivering a strong conceptual repricing of digital death and remembrance. A touch more dramatized interpersonal friction (e.g., with the corporation) could deepen the thematic cost even further.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of mercy as “courageous anomaly” and peace as a series of choices are tightly woven through object (shard), moments (soldier lowering rifle), and final question. The “weighted breath before reply” motif functions as a strong thematic hinge that culminates in her “What if we choose differently?” However, the piece occasionally states its thesis too directly (“She had once believed peace was the absence of violence”), edging into essayistic exposition. The emotional after-effect is resonant but slightly moderated by this explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme is rich and coherent: endings as thresholds, not discrete events, and the reframing of euthanasia from pure cessation to a sung transition. Recurring images—lace parasol, ice groans, the “fold in patience”—shift meaning by the end, especially when she listens in hospices “not for the sound of endings, but for the music between heartbeats.” The final recognition that some thresholds sing feels conceptually and emotionally grounded in concrete experience. There is slight over-articulation in lines like “She realized then: she hadn’t come to hear endings,” which edges toward explicit thesis rather than leaving it fully in image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of asymmetry, “destined mismatches,” and intersubjective understanding are well-integrated with the vineyard imagery and the final reframing of their past. The burned letter, entwined vines, and frost-sweet grapes all accrue symbolic weight that pays off at the end. However, the piece occasionally crosses into overt thesis-stating (“Destined mismatches… aren’t tragedies. They’re invitations…”) rather than trusting subtext and image, edging toward didactic. The emotional aftertaste is genuine but somewhat curated and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of peripheral awareness, silence as vessel, and the duality of truth/unknowability are deeply woven through mask imagery, clearings, and the wind-borne echoes. The prophet’s line—“Wisdom does not shout”—is on-the-nose but grounded in prior imagery and not merely a thesis statement. The ending reweights earlier material: the invisible clearings and whispering wind crystallize a view of preservation-through-surrender rather than control. Complexity remains—there’s no moral, just a stance about how wisdom survives in the world’s margins.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme is clear and coherent—healing as a non-linear arc that transmutes pain into beauty, with motifs of kites, spines, vines, and flight. However, the text often states its thesis outright (“She believed healing was not linear, but arced…”, “This was her devotion: collective healing…”) rather than letting it fully emerge from scene and image, edging toward didacticism. Some images, like the mural of bright birds in the puddle, earn their resonance more subtly and linger well. Overall, the thematic architecture is strong but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of memory, decay, growth, and the syntax of silence emerge organically from her methods, the crystal, and the final pivot toward embracing not-knowing. Images recur meaningfully (dust as time, echoes as sentences, words as fossils) and are reweighted by the ending assertion that “The pattern was not in the past. / It was in the pause.” The line “And that… is where growth begins” edges toward thesis-statement clarity, slightly reducing the subtlety. Overall, the piece leaves a resonant conceptual aftertaste rather than a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—aging as an echo/sound, memory as residue, grief as something you can only approach obliquely—is woven through particulars (chalk, tapes, fog, static) rather than stated. The final images (footprints softening, fog shaping a rocking chair then swing then nothing, chalk humming) reweight earlier motifs into a meditation on what persists when memory fails. There’s complexity in treating aging’s sound as tidal rather than tragic or heroic, and in making his “success” indistinguishable from loss. No moral is asserted; resonance arises from image and premise.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—escape velocity as shedding expectation, tenderness over force, time as braided rather than linear—emerges organically from images and recurring motifs (leaf, spinning hand, ache) and is satisfyingly reweighted in the ending. The final images (Earth as mosaic of moments, sound made visible) invite reflection beyond plot without snapping into a neat moral. Some thematic lines verge on direct thesis statement (“She had not fixed time. She had restructured its grammar.”), slightly reducing subtextual subtlety. Nonetheless, the conceptual and emotional aftertaste is strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theming around brokenness, mundane sanctity, and endings as relational beginnings is strong and organically woven through the vinyl shard, hospital sounds, and the redefinition of “reunify.” The shift from restoring wholeness to honoring connection-in-fracture feels earned and reweights earlier images. The piece largely avoids explicit moralizing, letting repeated concrete details—pill bottles, zipper, door click—carry the philosophical weight. A slight tendency toward rhapsodic abstraction in the final paragraphs keeps it just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of absence, equilibrium, and the ethics of custodianship emerge organically from the premise: shadows as “sealed awakenings,” noon as seam, Elira choosing to maintain a home for exiled darkness. The spoons’ “arrogant twist” versus her gentle, loop-closing repair nicely complicates ideas of power and knowledge. A few lines lean toward direct conceptual explanation (“The spoons hadn’t broken physics—they’d exposed its seams”), nudging into didactic clarity rather than purely image-driven resonance. Still, the ending’s reweighting of noon and shadow offers a strong, non-literal answer to the opening question.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—reframing error and loss into constellations and sacred markers—is richly embodied in recurring images (tooth, substitute body, bone-setting, maze/garden) rather than stated as moral. The story argues, without sermonizing, that redemption is architectural and collective, built from fractured truths and tended grief, and the final image of the tooth pulsing “not for what was lost, but for what might still be born” reweights everything before it. Subtext around outsourcing grief, comforting lies about changelings, and the labor of those who do emotional mending lingers beyond the scene. A few lines verge on explicit thesis language (“Her method was bone setting—not of limbs, but of histories”), but they still feel earned by concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—refusing destructive “light” (fire, justice-as-violence) in favor of reflective, co-created illumination—is woven through object, setting, and action rather than declared as moral. The “pearl of stillness” image evolves from grandmother’s teaching to the shared basin moment, reweighting stillness as active, communal labor instead of passivity. The final emphasis on polishing “not weapon, but window” crystallizes the thematic stance without collapsing into sermonizing. Complexity is preserved: her surrender includes the cost of perpetual exposure to pain, and the story resists easy redemption of the village’s past.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of reclamation, non-erasure of trauma, and “protected vulnerability” are woven concretely through moss, data ruins, amber light, and the ritual handling of the confession. Recurring motifs (amber, moss, icicle patterns) shift slightly in meaning by the end, supporting the idea of beauty and order emerging from collapse. However, lines like “Her motivation wasn’t redemption or revenge; it was reclamation” and “method to her mending” veer toward thesis-stating. The piece still invites reflection, but leans a bit too close to articulated moral for the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of unfinishedness, witness versus possession, and art as an act of release emerge organically from the cameos, the seashell, and the current/closure motif. The line “to collect the shapes of different hopes was not an act of preservation, but of release” captures a deepening insight earned by the prior images, not imposed as a thesis. The final image of the woman in the red coat and her bow of gratitude offers a quiet, resonant answer without moralizing. A few near-abstract phrases (“narrative inevitability,” “publishers who wanted resolution”) brush close to meta-commentary but stay mostly grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—progress’s erasure of sacred reciprocity and the possibility of reverent reclamation—emerges organically from particulars like steel fences vs. woven hedges, radios vs. lullabies, and calendars vs. celestial alignment. The story resists tidy nostalgia by ending on rekindling rather than full resurrection, suggesting an ongoing, communal responsibility. A few lines verge on expository statement (“how calendars marked productivity instead of planetary alignment”), but they remain grounded in sensuous images and do not tip into sermonizing. The final image of a charged, empty wreath offers a resonant, open-ended answer without spelling out a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: listening to the land, turning “debris into direction,” and privileging slow, embodied attention over spectacle. The heartbeat-map vision reweights all prior ritual actions, positioning care for buried, dreaming life as a navigational ethic—an implicit answer to how we guide the lost. There is no overt moralizing; the language lets images (blood-sigils, safekept starlight, collaborators-not-tools) carry the thematic load. Complexity is present—beauty and brutality coexisting—but the piece doesn’t quite push into morally knottier territory that would deepen the cost of her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of wonder as necessity, the tension between reason and awe, and the value of oblique perception (“the periphery”) arise organically from his practice and the cavern’s responses. The metaphor of “storing wonder in the cellar of reason” is strong and dramatized via resin slabs and geometric archives rather than left as abstraction. The ending’s notion of a “larder for the soul” and later travelers receiving uncredited nourishment is resonant and avoids tidy moralizing, even if a few phrases skate close to aphorism. The conceptual reweighting—wonder as stored nutrient with future cost/benefit—lingers effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of grief, burden, purpose-as-prison, and the transformation of pain into bearable form are woven tightly through recurring images (calcification, weights, fossils, geometry). The final choice to calcify her own burden reframes the premise from service to mutual endurance, giving a resonant, non-didactic answer to the central question of how to live with ongoing sorrow. Occasionally the language edges toward stating the thesis (“Her prison was her purpose”) rather than fully trusting image and action. Even so, the thematic throughline is coherent, emotionally honest, and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of time, loss, performance, and the ethics of “containing” grief are richly woven through recurring images (lions, applause, crystallization, vessels). The ending offers a resonant answer—honoring the arc rather than fearing the fall—through the resting lion and the “Here… gone. But never lost.” closure. However, several lines articulate theme in direct thesis form (“That was the lesson: not to fear the fall, but to honor the arc.”), edging into mild moralizing and slightly undercutting subtext. The piece remains thematically strong but would benefit from trusting its images more and its explanations less.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—ambition as circular rather than ascendant, and the shift from trying to “fix” the past to framing it—is woven through recurring images (carousel, ascent, camera, ghosts) and specific regrets. The story largely trusts implication, especially in lines like “Most of all, I regret believing that ambition was a ladder, not a carousel.” However, the explicit sentence in the letter (“You were never meant to fix the past — only to frame it.”) borders on thesis-statement and slightly undercuts the otherwise subtle thematic work. Despite that, the final emotional repricing of regret lands with genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematically, the piece is rich: entropy versus adaptation, intention layered into infrastructure, and hope as redirected energy all emerge organically from her engineering acts. The recurrence of redirected flows (steam, footsteps, light, social presence) gives the final equation conceptual weight. Yet the story undercuts itself slightly by articulating its thesis too explicitly—“Hope wasn’t a destination; it was a flow—redirected, repurposed, resilient” reads like authorial commentary rather than pure scene-driven resonance. The theme is strong but edged toward sermonizing in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of silence as presence, the transformation of abandoned dreams, and reconciliation with one’s own past are well woven through clocks, rain, crystal, and music. The recurring imagery (rain → crystal → droplet on score → humming) lets the final realization reweight prior material. Lines like “He didn’t need to resurrect the symphonies. He needed to make peace with their silence.” edge close to explicit thesis, slightly reducing the power of pure implication. Even so, the ending image of him as “composer of stillness” feels earned and resonant rather than didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of how lies function as sheltering architecture and how time measures both light and loss are coherently woven through the canal, sundial, and locket imagery. The final reconfiguration—that understanding, not collapse, is the most durable form of salvage—offers a resonant answer to the initial question of “architecture of lies.” However, the story occasionally states its thesis too directly (“Architecture, after all, is structure with purpose. These lies had buttresses of silence…”), tipping into essayistic exposition rather than leaving meaning to emerge purely from scene and image. The thematic spine is strong but a touch over-explained for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of preservation vs. museumification, patience as a radical method, and the embodied nature of memory emerge organically through action and image (knots as language, “hands answer,” “I’m collecting hands”). Motifs—storm/fulgurite, silence/fog, knots as sentences—recur in ways that deepen rather than merely repeat. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: preserving ancient methods requires bodies, time, and reciprocal choice, not just documentation. A few lines step close to thesis-statement territory but stay just inside earned territory.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—absence versus presence, memory as mapping, and the “geography of healing”—is deeply integrated through repeated, evolving images (thread, leaves, harbor, compass/obituary). The conceptual core (“motivation was never closure—it was orientation”) is strong, though occasionally stated a touch too directly rather than fully entrusted to image and scene. The final act of burying the crane under the withered rosebush reweights prior material into a quiet answer: healing and remembrance occur in the margins, for those who still listen, not by changing the world’s amnesia but by reorganizing private meaning. Complexity is present—no easy moral is offered—but the piece flirts with essayistic exposition in a few lines.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—beauty as necessity rather than luxury in a utilitarian, mechanized world—is clear and mostly emerges through image and event (the egg, the machines repurposed for elegance, the child crying at a dandelion). The line “Beauty was not luxury. It was oxygen.” edges into direct thesis, but it’s supported enough by prior concrete moments not to feel hollow. The ending offers a resonant answer: even a partial stirring of beauty, without guarantees, is genesis enough, which reweights the prince’s “delusion.” The thematic field is rich yet a touch tidy, with less moral or emotional mess than the premise could support at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic throughline—scars as sources of song rather than shame—is strongly embodied in the coin, obsidian, and fire/lagoon interplay, and the final image reweights earlier material effectively. That said, lines like “Scars can sing. / Not in spite of their depth, but because of it.” move into overt thesis-statement territory and slightly undercut the subtextual power the imagery has already earned. The moral calculus around the father (wrong but loving) is handled with some nuance, allowing mercy and condemnation to coexist. Overall resonance is high but a notch shy of the subtlety typical of top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memory vs forgetting, skepticism vs belief, and the ethics of honoring origins rather than dismissing them emerge organically from concrete acts like mapping acoustics instead of invoking ghosts and respecting the fountains’ “weeping” even after debunking it. The transformation of “silence” from absence to “defiant hush” and “reverence of remembering” is a strong conceptual repricing that reweights earlier images. There is no sermonizing; the piece trusts images (the paused geese, the key, the single drop) to carry its meditation on collective trauma and chosen amnesia. Complexity is preserved—remembering is shown as painful and tender—not flattened into a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—rethinking inheritance and “light” so it illuminates without burning—is deeply embedded via the gear, the ancestors’ failures, the nebula’s evolving empathy, and the closing lighthouse image. The shift from fire to bioluminescence/dust is a strong, concrete thematic turn. However, a few lines edge into thesis statement (“Generational patterns weren’t curses to be broken, but melodies to be reharmonized”), reducing subtextual power. Even so, the ending leaves a clear, resonant reweighting of what it means to shine.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of communal grief, memory as craft, and intergenerational transmission via poems, stone, and migration are woven with admirable consistency across images (geometry of grief, loom of memory, monarchs as souls). The final realization about grief as current, paired with the migration metaphor, offers a resonant non-literal answer that reweights the whole piece. However, some thematic statements are a bit declared—“He believed grief had geometry,” “grief was not a void to be filled”—nudging toward essayistic exposition. Subtext is strong in the best moments (butterflies brushing glass, spectral hand on his heart) and could carry slightly more of the work without explicit articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of control vs surrender, perfectionism vs grace, and “incremental absolution” are strongly integrated with the character’s vocation and the recurring images of pendulum, tide, and polished stone. The wife’s hidden inscription is an excellent concrete vehicle for a thematic turn, and the final image of him “no longer counting seconds, but savoring” reweights everything that came before. However, several sentences articulate the theme almost as thesis (“To restore shared balance was his creed”; “Incremental absolution, he realized, was not a destination, but a direction”), edging toward explicit moralizing and slightly undercutting subtext. The piece could trust its images a bit more and state its ideas a bit less.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of intention versus action, thresholds versus graves, and the ways love and fear knot into each other are woven concretely through the cemetery work, the tapestry threads, and the sovereign case. The climactic realization—that “Intentions were not destinations, but gestures”—effectively reweights prior images and actions, though it edges close to explicit statement. The echoes of buried letters, a mother’s sacrifice, and her own over-pruned love generate subtext beyond the literal, inviting reflection about what remains unfinished in human relationships. A bit more reliance on image over explanatory phrasing in the key insight passage would deepen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of innovation under constraint, humility before uncertainty, and transformation via invitation rather than control are woven through images (ice, loom, meteorite ink) and choices (questions like “What if?” and “Who dares?”). The final “Begin.” and the earth’s exhale reweight the whole piece as a quiet manifesto about how to engage with futures. That said, some thematic statements are quite explicit (“innovation thrives not in boundless freedom, but in tension”), edging toward essayistic rather than fully emergent. The complexity is strong but could trust images and actions a shade more over direct articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres powerfully around memory, resistance, and the idea that forgotten things “remembered best when cradled in melody.” The dust motif, the famine of stories, and the transformation of pirate broadcasts into a clandestine archive all reinforce a nuanced meditation on how art preserves and resurrects what’s lost. The revelation that mourning (her tears) is required for dust to speak adds moral and emotional complexity: revival demands that someone fully feel the loss. The ending line, extending warmth to “another alcove,” offers a resonant, non-didactic answer about collective, risky stewardship of stories.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of the mirage of safety, fractured identity, and the necessity of witnessing emotion are richly woven through recurring images (porcelain mask, ashes of unsent letters, incomplete portraits, rocking chair). The final image—her seated, masked, candle-lit, refusing the comfort of “stillness as safety”—offers a clear, non-literal answer about embracing difficult truth. That said, some thematic statements are made explicitly in thesis-like sentences (“The world offers the mirage of safety…”) rather than fully entrusted to subtext and image. The piece still achieves substantial resonance, but it occasionally edges toward over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme—memory as a non-lying compass versus seductive erasure—is woven deeply into every layer: the cog, sedimentary mapping, artifacts, and the sundial under water all reinforce it. Competing narratives are dramatized rather than merely asserted, especially in the obelisk slogan vs submerged sundial contrast. There are a few explicitly thesis-like lines (“One narrative said progress required amnesia; the other, his, insisted memory was the only compass that didn’t lie”), but they remain in character and don’t fully tip into sermonizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by siding with endurance and depth without tidy moral closure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thematically, the piece is rich: vanishing arts, the ethics of harmony as consent not control, the idea that hatred is unlearned “note by note,” and that true quiet denotes presence rather than absence. The rosette, autumn, and the leaf are strong recurring images whose meanings shift subtly by the end, supporting a conceptual repricing of “noise” and “silence.” However, several passages veer into essayistic statement (“Hatred, she discovered, thrived in cacophony; harmony required subtraction…”) that spell out the thesis rather than fully trusting scene and subtext. The emotional aftereffect is genuine and contemplative, but the explicitness keeps it just short of the most rarefied literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—memory as communal resource, rebellion as patient tending rather than destruction, and wisdom “growing crooked”—emerges organically from images of pruning, rust, and taste. The ending reweights earlier material by redefining the fruit as something to be remembered, not consumed, aligning neatly with the librarian’s charge and Elara’s role. However, lines like “That was the point” and explicit naming of “gentle rebellion” push close to thesis-statement territory, slightly dulling subtext. The emotional aftereffect is quiet and sincere, but just shy of truly haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of wonder vs. explanation, technological adaptation, and belief as an energy source emerge organically through riddles, the story-collecting toll keeper, and the reconfigured function of the drones. The line “Wonder…isn’t meant to be explained” risks overstatement but still grows credibly from Elias’s established behavior and the matchbox motif. The final repricing—“The tower doesn’t collect lightning. It collects belief.”—neatly reweights prior details and invites reflection without feeling purely didactic. A bit more resistance or ambiguity around the ethics of secrecy could deepen the thematic complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—about memory, objects as architecture, and honoring what the ordinary effaces—emerges organically from the ritual and images (the shard, the cottage, the tide). The final “hushed blaze” image nicely reweights the earlier accumulation of hush and creeping normality. However, the last paragraphs edge into explicit thesis (“Some houses feel alive because…,” “Not to preserve, but to honor”), which slightly undercuts the otherwise strong subtextual work. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but a bit over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of anti-dogma, fluidity vs rigidity, and truth-as-mosaic are deeply woven into objects (ampoule), setting (dissolved citizens), and arc (her new mission). However, the piece leans heavily into explicit thesis statements—“Truth is not monolith. It is mosaic. Shatter certainty to find its colors.”—and direct framing (“an inoculation—against dogma”), which pushes toward didacticism. The ending phrase “Welcome to the nuance” is powerful but slightly on-the-nose for a prestigious market. The resonance is strong, but subtlety and reliance on implication could be increased.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from action: perpetual motion as both prison and engine; chance vs. choice; regret repurposed as fuel rather than burden. The dice, staircase, and proofs act as a coherent motif web that reweights itself at the end when he climbs without the die. There is no moralizing; the final image quietly answers the core question by showing a new stance toward possibility and missed opportunity. A slight risk is that some lines flirt with abstraction (“machinery of forever”), but they’re usually grounded enough in prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, encoded kindness, and communal empathy emerge organically from the glyph concept and the moon-brush ritual, with subtext carried in images like “the hand that gives water without asking the thirsty their name.” The ending reweights the premise from one-way transmission to reciprocal recognition (“not for the lost, but for the found”) without stating a moral, and the offerings at the fire escape nicely externalize the city’s slow reawakening. At times the language brushes close to thesis statement (“The brush remembered what people forgot”), but even those lines are well-grounded in the concrete magical object. Overall the piece invites reflection beyond itself without collapsing into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thematic concerns—art as inheritance rather than mausoleum, memory as embodied practice, trauma as a solvent of culture—are tightly woven into events and motifs (bread as “edible archives,” the shift from ghosts to glimmers). The transformation of “rosewater dread” into anticipation is conceptually strong and emotionally satisfying. However, the explicit line “We are not preserving art. We are becoming it.” verges on thesis-statement, slightly flattening what is otherwise rich subtext. The piece still leaves a resonant afterimage, but with a touch more telling than an elite market typically tolerates.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of rebellion against fate, the ethics of rewriting history, and the hunger/famine ledger are tightly woven through hunger stone, clocks, yoyo, and “cruel arithmetic.” The piece avoids overt moralizing while still posing a clear question about what it means to seize godlike agency (“No gods had intervened. No chorus sang his triumph.”). “This was not redemption. This was rebellion.” edges close to thesis-statement territory, but remains anchored in his personal stance rather than abstract sermonizing. The final image reframes the premise into a charged, ambivalent hope rather than a simple victory.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—fear as collaborator/reflection rather than ruler—emerges organically from events and images (mirrors, “lingering luminance,” photographically cursed memories) and culminates in the reveal that Fear is stitched from the protagonist’s own snapshots. The conceptual move of turning terror’s afterglow into a weapon is thematically strong. However, a few lines edge toward explicit thesis (“Fear’s weakness…is being seen for what it is: a reflection, not a ruler”), slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, the piece invites reflection on trauma and perception without collapsing into pure moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of transmuting trauma/obstacle into art, apprenticeship and succession, and the world as a resonant archive emerge organically from particulars (shipwreck wood, drowned sailors’ driftwood, beached cetaceans, the orchard’s “resonance of survival”). The final inward-turning tide and living mallet subtly reprice the premise: sound-work doesn’t just avert crisis; it sinks deeper into the world’s bones and into Kael as inheritor. There is no moralizing; the piece trusts images (golden helix, harmonic rain) to carry meaning. The only limitation is that the emotional aftereffect is more cerebral and aesthetic than gut-costly.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of erasure, institutional denial, and speaking in a language only silence can carry emerge organically from spirals, maps, and the reed whistle rather than explicit thesis statements. The ending reframes silence itself as an active choice (“would have to choose whether to remain silent—or confess”), which conceptually reprices the watchers and the city’s indifference. Motifs (spirals, shells, watchers, lost names in the whistle) accrue weight and echo across emotional and conceptual planes. A deeper dramatized clash between her need to know and any countervailing personal desire (safety, belonging) would push the thematic complexity even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story’s thematic core—noble lies as the comforting mortar of memory versus the corrosive effects when scaled to nations—is rich and well integrated, especially in the family-history parallels. The closing invitation (“What story are you preserving — and who does it serve?”) lands as a genuine conceptual repricing that reweights the entire piece. However, several paragraphs move into fairly direct essay mode (“Noble lies, she’d argue, are the mortar of memory…”) that state the thesis rather than letting it fully emerge from dramatized tension. The result is resonant but somewhat didactic, undercutting the subtlety expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and “witnessed absence” are woven through specific acts—tucking notes in mortar, filling a doll’s torso, responding to a runaway bride’s confession—rather than stated abstractly. The story resists moralizing: it does not claim to “save” the past, only to honor and reconfigure it, leaving room for haunting ambiguity (the rumors of lights and music). The final image of Elara as “more scribe, more priestess” and the town’s changed relationship to the pavilion offers a resonant, non-literal answer to what it means to remember. Subtext about the cost of caretaking—her drained ink, tears, and identity shift—is present without being over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of archival ethics, suppression vs. witness, and “stillness as sanctuary rather than surrender” emerge organically from her methods, setting, and final stance. Recurring objects (the stamp, the Index, the lantern) and images of pooled time and submerged records give the piece a clear conceptual spine. That said, several lines slide into thesis-like exposition (“Her motivation crystallized: not to condemn, but to witness”; “Her alternative hypotheses had led her not to conspiracy, but to consequence”) which partially replaces subtext with articulation. The ending still carries a resonant, non-literal answer, but it edges close to being told.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of grief, preservation vs release, and the transmutation of pain emerge organically from recurring images—cranes, lanterns, gems, tea—rather than from overt statement. The final crane and sideways-drifting isle reweight everything we’ve seen, suggesting that healing is not erasure but a new equilibrium where “grief and grace share the same breath.” The wife’s dream of cranes becoming upward-falling stars is beautifully reprised in the cranes’ later descent-while-ascent, deepening the meditation on directionality of loss. Ambiguity remains purposeful and resonant, not muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres around whether potential and meaning can survive violent erasure, explored through the geode, the observatory’s cold surveillance, and her mapping of “lives unlived.” The recurring idea that potential doesn’t die but “pools elsewhere” feels fresh and is dramatized through specific acts (simulations, coordinate hunting), not just abstract musing. A few lines edge close to thesis statement (“Her motivation wasn’t redemption or revenge—it was cartography”), but they still arise organically from her worldview. The final dedication pulse (“For Marta. For Elias. For Mom. For me.”) recasts the cosmic hunt as an intimate, haunted act without slipping into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—belonging as an internal resonance rather than an external code—is tightly integrated with the chip, the observatory, and the “missing pieces” motif, and the visions of non-owned memories concretize this rather than leaving it abstract. The idea that she has shed parts of herself to become the flawless operator is specific enough to avoid generic uplift, and the ending’s quiet presence-under-stars has genuine emotional charge. Some lines tip into thesis-statement territory (“The belonging wasn’t a signal to lock onto”), and the pilgrim’s reply comes close to prompt-like moralizing. The piece would be stronger if a touch more work were done by image and implication rather than explanatory sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of truth vs. narrative, the ethics of memory, and “tempered regret” emerge organically from her work as a forger and the shore’s sieving mechanism. The father’s sacrifice vs. perceived betrayal embodies the idea that understanding can be both more painful and more stabilizing than ignorance. Recurring images (watch hand, carvings, tide, terrace) accrue thematic resonance and reweight the premise at the end. However, the closing paragraphs tilt into explicit statement (“Tempered regret…was the art of carrying it”) that edges toward moralizing rather than trusting subtext, slightly dampening the otherwise strong thematic subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of reconciliation, earned silence, and transforming harm into wisdom are coherent and integrated through recurring images (neutral territory, relics, moon phases). The final walk together, each carrying the other’s object, offers a strong non-literal answer to the central question of how to live with shared guilt and loss. However, the story leans heavily on explicitly stated theses (“Peace is never signed in ink but carved in silence,” “Vulnerability was the first currency of reconciliation”), which edges into aphoristic over-articulation rather than fully trusting subtext. The thematic resonance is real but could be more powerfully earned through dramatized friction instead of repeated abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—how a failed navigator relearns direction as a chosen, felt practice rather than inherited precision—is coherent and well-rooted in actions (walking inland, naming poles, relaunching). Recurring images (stars vs. poles, compass, tide, “backlash of regrets”) shift meaning by the end, and the idea of home as “frequency” rather than place is effective. However, several lines veer toward explicit thesis (“She didn’t need perfect stars. She needed imperfect motion.”), edging close to moralizing rather than leaving work to subtext. Despite that, the final image of silent paddling and the needle turned toward her stern carries a satisfying, non-literal answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the concrete particulars: erased guilt, the labyrinth of unchosen paths, and belief as “delicately robust” all braid into a meditation on responsibility and self-forged empathy. The lake’s focus on refused choices, not just bad ones made, adds welcome moral complexity. Lines like “Empathy, kindled. Not a flood, but a spark.” skate close to explicit thematizing, but they are brief and grounded in the immediate experience. The ending’s stance—that the map now lives as resonance rather than memory—offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of love outlasting death, death as “merely a dialect,” and bonds as the true locus of meaning are woven through concrete images (moonlight, spices, ash, ember-creature) and the metamorphosis itself. The final reweighting—that “The end was never the point. / The bond was.”—crystallizes what the story has shown via ritual and reunion. However, those sentences edge into direct thesis-statement territory, tipping from resonance into mild authorial moralizing. Overall, the thematic web is rich and coherent but could trust subtext slightly more.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of time, regret, maternal love, and a non-punitive “repentance” that becomes grace are woven tightly through objects (saucer, ink, tablecloths) and actions (tracing, blessing, surrender). The story reframes repentance as releasing self-punishment rather than courting cosmic judgment, a subtle but powerful conceptual turn. A few phrases verge on direct statement (“lost time did not vanish—it ascended”), but they still arise from concrete images instead of abstract sermonizing. The final choice to prioritize present ink-and-kiss over metaphysical repair offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of nonviolent healing, integration of shadow, and reimagining “impossibility” as a wound to be stitched are strongly woven through motif and action rather than didactic commentary. The Tear’s compassion, the photos’ crystallized grief/possibility, and the Echo-Realm as echoes of “purest emotional states” all support a complex meditation on how we carry and transform suffering. Some lines articulate the thesis a bit directly (“impossibility was just a wound refusing to heal,” “You are not my enemy. You are my anchor.”), nudging toward overt statement rather than pure subtext. Nonetheless, the final image of reunion and the Tear dissolving functions as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question about what healing costs.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Transformation—grief to grace, absence as a kind of completion, accidental benevolence—is woven through concrete images: bottled unlived lives, tears turning to mist, ash/volcano imagery, the HERE.NOW.YOU trail. Thematically charged actions (telling the dark bug “You’re allowed to rest,” accepting her own unlived life into her chest) avoid neat moralizing and complicate what redemption or rest mean. One explicit line (“Her motivation wasn’t redemption or glory—it was to understand the texture of transformation”) edges toward thesis-statement, but the rest of the piece mostly lets images and events carry the argument. The final charged calm—world listening as she stands radiant—lands as a non-literal, resonant answer rather than a spelled-out moral.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of language-as-revolt, patience, and the power of quiet, distributed meaning emerge organically from the sundial, coded angles, and “cradle of sparks” motif. The revolution by geometry instead of blood is dramatized rather than moralized, and the ending reweights prior images by shifting focus to ordinary recipients (baker, scribe, stablehand). Ambiguity remains—whether and how the revolution will unfold—without weakening the conceptual stance. The piece avoids sermonizing, though the thematic pattern is relatively straightforward rather than deeply paradoxical.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of wonder vs. control, method vs. answers, and promises as ways of questioning are woven tightly through rocks, patterns, and the curse. The grandmother’s maxim—“Patterns hold what promises cannot”—and the later realization that she promised him a method, not answers, make the closure feel thematically coherent. The frictionless world and nonverbal communication with eels enact a philosophy of alignment rather than domination. The final lines verge slightly on explicit statement, but they still arise from concrete particulars rather than sheer moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of censorship, erasure, self-archiving, and scars as a personal cartography are richly woven through recurring images (maps, coordinates, constellations, ink, scars, sky). The ending’s conceptual reweighting—scars as waypoints and herself as “her own archive, her own atlas”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to live under erasure. Some lines verge on explicit thesis statements (“some truths must ferment in silence before they can nourish”), nudging the piece toward essayistic clarity rather than pure implication. Overall, the thematic fabric is coherent, complex, and emotionally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the particulars: logic as music, questions as journeys rather than dead ends, and adversarial intellects transforming into collaborative stewardship. The overture-as-score-for-minds neatly embodies the idea of philosophy as navigable path, and the final resolve to “perform it…everywhere it’s been forgotten” offers a quiet, resonant answer to the opening posture of solitary waiting. Subtext around partnership, humility in triumph, and the ethics of knowledge-keeping is present but under-explored; no serious ethical tension or ambiguity is staged. The result is elegant and satisfying but thematically safe.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of resistance-as-seed, beauty in ruin, and the subversive power of books emerge organically from concrete images (marginalia as rebellion, inmates memorizing sonnets, seeds in floorboard cracks). The repeated seed motif culminating in literal planting is effective and emotionally resonant. At times, the piece edges toward explicit thesis (“planting revolutions in tin cans and floorboards,” “rebuild… the belief that beauty could sprout in the cracks of anarchy”), which slightly dulls subtext. Nonetheless, the final charged image and her redefined notion of rebuilding provide a strong, non-literal thematic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from action: art as subversion of destiny, time as both oppressor and instrument, grief weaponized into agency. Motifs (clock, compasses, horizon, film reel) are not decorative; each returns with reweighted meaning at the end. The story refuses neat moralizing: Elira’s victory feels real yet precarious, her methods both beautiful and dangerous. The final charged poise—smile, shattering dawn, continuing chimes, laughter behind her—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about how far one can bend fate through creation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of cultural memory, the fragility and power of dreams, and the epistemic value of doubt (“Doubt is the lantern, not the dark”) emerge organically from the ritual and Aris’s role as reality checker. The transformation of the seed into an autonomous, self-correcting archive enacts a conceptual answer: memory must be communal, living, and checked by skepticism, not hoarded. Recurring images—petals, glyphs, lullabies, the monsoon—are reweighted in the ending without lapsing into overt moralizing. The one slightly on-the-nose mentor line edges toward stated thesis but remains character-grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of regret, unspoken apologies, and the redistribution (rather than erasure) of emotional weight are elegantly embedded in images and mechanics (compass of remorse, lace as a map of unsaid things). The closing recognition—that apologies “don’t need voices to be heard” and that light can seep in once weight is redistributed—offers a resonant conceptual answer consistent with prior events. At times the text approaches thesis-statement territory, slightly over-articulating what the imagery already conveys. Nonetheless, the metaphorical system is cohesive and invites reflection without collapsing into a moral.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is explicitly articulated by the protagonist ("Decay as Iterative Refinement") and the narrator ("poetry... was just physics"), violating the show-don't-tell principle for subtext. This heavy-handedness flattens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing rather than subtext. The narrative repeatedly explains its own meaning to the reader ("Survival... was not triumph—it was subtraction," "Purpose... wasn't a destination"), which flattens the potential for genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of translating absence into presence is coherent and lands with a strong final image. The concept of "unshaken marvels" is well-integrated, though the text occasionally slips into explaining the theme ("not the absence of noise, but the presence of everything") rather than letting the imagery speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shift from "rescue" to "release" and "belonging" provides a strong, unified thematic argument. The final image of the "cathedral of quiet endings" resonates effectively with the established premise.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of solidarity is coherent but delivered heavily through exposition ("The act itself declared more than any speech"). The story tends to explain its own symbols and moral significance directly to the reader rather than allowing meaning to emerge organically from action.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but resolved through explicit didactic statements ("Not a place, but a state") rather than implicit resonance. The reliance on explaining the meaning of the tear and the nature of love in the final paragraph flattens the subtextual potential of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central theme of time's tactile nature is resonant, but the execution in the final paragraph is overly explicit. By listing the specific textures ("Grief was coarse... Joy... porous") and restating the prompt phrase ("discovered the texture of time"), the ending tells rather than trusting the imagery to resonate, triggering a penalty for thematic echoing.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of resilience and nature's return is coherent but delivered didactically ("Not a metaphor," "Always, eventually, green"). The messaging feels imposed by the narrator rather than emerging organically from the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of transforming grief into utility is coherent but heavily explicated in the final paragraphs ("alchemy of grief turned into guidance"). The story relies on telling the reader the moral import of the device rather than letting the "memory-catcher" stand as a silent, resonant symbol. This overt thematic summary dampens the emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.0)
    Themes of destiny and connection are delivered through explicit, sentimental statements ("fate spoke in patterns," "tasted like design") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The narrative tells the reader exactly how to interpret the events, leaving little room for ambiguity or reader engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("perfection was never the point," "questions worth asking") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending paragraph summarizes the moral message directly, reducing potential subtext to a declared lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the narration ("Transformative betrayal doesn't leave bruises," "vulnerability isn't weakness"), leaving no room for subtext. The story explains its meaning to the reader in the final paragraphs, violating the "show, don't tell" principle regarding thematic resonance. This didactic approach flattens the emotional complexity of the liberation moment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of mapping silence is resonant and controls the closure image effectively. The delivery is occasionally heavy-handed, stating the theme explicitly rather than letting it emerge solely from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative articulates its thesis explicitly ("Thoughts... don't come from circuits... They come from being witnessed"), which flattens the subtext into a stated moral. The resonance would be stronger if the realization were demonstrated solely through the melting violin rather than explained.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative over-explains its subtext, telling the reader exactly how to interpret the symbols ("vulnerability, the plea for understanding"). The theme is preached through exposition rather than emerging organically from the characters' collision.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of reciprocity vs. calculation is coherent and beautifully illustrated by the marble metaphor. However, the subtext is occasionally made text (e.g., "counter-narrative to the empire of metrics"), explaining the meaning rather than letting the imagery do the work. The ending resonates well without resolving the external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is heavily explicit, culminating in a log entry that summarizes the story's thesis ("Time doesn't move forward here..."). This telling-not-showing approach flattens the potential resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than subtextually earned ("silence held more truth than sound"). The ending moralizes ("what, through her, would be remembered") instead of letting the image resonate on its own. The story tells the reader what to feel about the silence rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "fault tolerance" as human resilience is poignant but heavily underlined by the oracle’s final dialogue ("To endure brokenness without breaking"). This explicit articulation of the thesis acts as a Thematic Echo, reducing the subtextual power of the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of guilt as a "ghost shift" is potent, but the story over-explains it in the denouement ("The ghost shift wasn’t spectral labor. It was the mind’s machinery..."). This didactic summary flattens the subtext right when it should resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of accepting impermanence is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing ("knowing that to witness... was the rarest form of love"). This reliance on summary statements to convey meaning robs the ending of subtextual resonance and feels didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("Why don’t grown-ups believe in quiet magic anymore?", "magic didn’t shout") rather than subtext. The story explains its meaning to the reader instead of allowing resonance to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of narrative as a structural force ("mending rifts") is well-integrated and resonates through the imagery of the tapestry and diaries. However, the middle section relies on didactic exposition to explain the "displaced axis," and the ending leans slightly into sentimental abstraction ("walls smiled back").

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story explicitly states its theme through narration ("the real mechanism wasn’t mysticism—it was orchestration") and dialogue ("You're conducting"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. This overt moralizing prevents organic subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of deconstructing certainty is tightly woven into the action, but the execution borders on the didactic. Characters explicitly articulate the thematic arguments ("ownership implies boundary") rather than letting them emerge solely through subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central theme of memory as a creative act rather than passive loss is powerful. However, the final paragraph creates a significant "Thematic Echo" artifact by explicitly summarizing the thesis ("memory is not loss but score") rather than letting the cracked horizon speak for itself, triggering a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story explicitly states its themes ("To conquer it meant not to escape, but to integrate") and articulates its thesis in the final dialogue ("I am the branching"), violating the "show, don't tell" principle for subtext. This didactic approach flattens the narrative resonance, reducing the ending to a summary of the prompt's concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of "glitch" and reversal as a means to access trauma is resonant and organically developed. The transformation of the silence from fragile to resilient lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of preserving truth against manufactured reality is coherent. The ending, however, relies on explicit thesis statements ("solitude had nurtured his integrity; now, movement would weaponize it") rather than allowing the action to carry the resonance implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is articulated through explicit moralizing ("For grief, she realizes, is not the enemy...") rather than emerging from the subtext. This tendency to summarize the story's meaning in a thesis statement at the end flattens the emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered via explicit lectures in dialogue ("Time isn’t a line—it’s a weave"), violating the subtext mandate. The resolution offers a tidy moral absolute and a "Thematic Echo" penalty applies for stating the thesis in the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly told rather than dramatized ("Her motivation is not redemption... but to find beauty in the unfinished"). While the central concept is resonant, the reliance on authorial explanation and overt thesis statements dilutes the subtextual power of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit thesis statements ("real feeling cannot be counterfeited without consequence") rather than emerging purely from subtext. This didactic tendency flattens the resonance of the otherwise strong final image.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit narration ("Anonymous. Intentional.") and on-the-nose dialogue notes, rendering the subtext overtly didactic. The resolution offers a tidy moral rather than a resonant, complex answer to the central premise.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of art as a communal web is coherent and fully realized by the ending. However, the delivery is explicit ("myth was the first stitch," "grafting point"), relying on statement rather than the subtextual resonance found in higher-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of preservation and the non-linearity of time is woven consistently through the imagery and action without becoming preachy. The ending resonates well, positioning the art as an anchor against loss, offering a satisfying conceptual repricing of her work.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story explicitly explains its themes to the reader ("It was resonance," "The loss was ambiguous because...") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action. This over-articulation reduces subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narration and dialogue ("To remember was to resist erasure"), leaving little room for subtext. The final paragraph articulates the thesis directly ("Visibility wasn't spectacle. It was resonance"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty for moralizing in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing statements in the narrative voice ("stopped trying to fix what was never broken"). This didactic approach crowds out subtext and dictates the reader's interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of grief calcifying into artifact is resonant and well-supported by the imagery of amber and fossils. While the definition of "convergence" is explicitly told via the journal, the final image of the seaglass successfully reweights the narrative from obsession to acceptance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story succumbs to the "Thematic Echo" failure in the final paragraph, explicitly summarizing the moral ("They were the quiet between notes..."). By explaining the subtext directly to the reader, the ending robs the narrative of resonant ambiguity and treats the theme as a lesson rather than an experience.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story explains its own meaning through didactic assertions ("not to fill silence, but to honor its shape") rather than allowing subtext to emerge from action. The ending sermonizes about the nature of grief instead of trusting the reader to infer resonance from the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is delivered didactically, with the narrative explicitly explaining the symbolism at every turn ("not a building, but a resonance," "mirrors that reflected not her face, but her doubts"). This heavy-handedness leaves little room for subtext or reader interpretation, resulting in a tidy moral rather than a resonant, complex inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.2)
    The themes of connection and memory are coherent but explicitly explained to the reader in the "She understood then..." paragraph. This thematic echo reduces subtext to didactic statement, preventing the reader from deriving the meaning through the action itself.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding value in finality is handled with grace, avoiding heavy-handed moralizing. The specific "whispers" (mother, soldier, poet) ground the abstract concept of "goodbye" in human particularity, leading to a resonant and earned emotional conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed didactics ("Not equality—equity") rather than subtext. The ending relies on explicit moralizing ("In a world calcified by greed...") to state the story's thesis, replacing narrative resonance with a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of collaborative history is resonant, but the explicit statement (“mountain was... a chorus”) and the anthropomorphic ending (“lamp flickered... approvingly”) undercut the subtext. This sentimental turn violates the requested tone of restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of erasure and memory is clear but heavy-handed, often relying on direct exposition ("erasure was never clean," "stitching a counter-narrative") rather than letting the subtext emerge organically from the action. The resonance is stated rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme is poignant but is undercut by explicit statement near the climax ("It was simpler, crueler, kinder: What do you bury..."), which explains the subtext rather than letting it resonate. The final line ("wind turned the final page") feels a bit too meta and tidy for the complex grief portrayed.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed symbolism (mermaid weeping pearls spelling "REMEMBER," wings shaped like eviction notices) and explicit didactic statements ("refuse to let their joy be zoned into extinction"). Subtext is virtually absent because the narrative explains the meaning of every action and symbol directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial assertions ("That was the point," "She knew," "Meant to be known") rather than emerging organically from the action. This over-explanation robs the ending of subtextual resonance, turning the final beats into a summary of meaning rather than an experience of it.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit narrator summaries ("She mended trajectories") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending leans into sentimental didacticism, telling the reader exactly how to interpret the repair as "redemption" instead of allowing the imagery to carry that weight.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.0)
    The core concept is imaginative, but the theme is over-articulated through explicit thesis statements ("Rivers don’t start with fanfare") rather than subtext. The final paragraph summarizes the meaning ("satisfaction of a question answered not with noise"), reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "rebalancing" rather than resurrecting is well-articulated and lands with a coherent final image. The motif of the "new bell tuner" dreaming adds a layer of continuity. However, the thematic distinction is somewhat explicitly stated ("Not resurrected... But rebalanced") rather than purely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is heavily expository, relying on a final paragraph to explain the lesson of acceptance ("to harness the ephemeral was not to capture it...") rather than letting the action speak. This "diagnostic label-speak" flattens the resonance of the otherwise poignant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of unheard truths and generational trauma is integrated well into the lighthouse imagery. The ending leans into didacticism ("Truth, made luminous") rather than letting the image speak for itself, but the core resonance remains effective.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit expository summation ("The debt was repaid—not through vengeance... but through transmission") rather than emerging organically. This heavy-handed moralizing in the final beats flattens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative explicitly preaches its theme in the final paragraph ("proof that reverence grows best in the soil of ruin"), collapsing subtext into a moral lesson rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing to convey its meaning ("Faith, she understood, was not a monument..."), summarizing the thesis in the final paragraph rather than allowing the subtext to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing in the narration ("Not faster, but deeper... Not digital, but drawn") rather than emerging via subtext or action. The ending relies on a summarizing moral statement that flattens the complexity of the premise into a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "wisdom disguised as foolishness" is coherent and structurally integrated, though the execution is somewhat didactic and the resolution offers a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of rewriting silence and forgiveness is consistent but culminates in an overly explicit message ("Go gently. You are loved"). This final beat functions as a Thematic Echo that flattens the story's earlier ambiguity into a moral statement, reducing the resonance of the character's specific journey to a generic affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of trauma and translation are clear but delivered didactically, often explaining the meaning directly to the reader ("She hadn't healed the past... she had let it breathe"). The subtext is frequently made text through the repetitive "not X, but Y" rhetorical construction.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme is coherent but heavily explicated in the final paragraphs, drifting into moralizing ("not to impress, but to awaken"). The emotional resonance is asserted ("an old woman wept") rather than emerging organically from the scene's subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The themes of resonance, surrender, and "un-fixing" cohere well with the setting and action. The ending leans slightly into explicit thesis statements ("Curiosity, not certainty, now guided her steps"), which blunts the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of language as resistance is coherent and woven into the imagery, but the delivery is often heavy-handed and explicit ("planting defiance," "grammar of resistance"). The narrative explicitly states the subtext rather than letting it emerge organically from the action, resulting in a somewhat didactic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of transmuting trauma into beauty is coherent and resonates through the imagery of the "blossom armistice." While the execution leans toward the romanticization of pain ("photosynthesize pain"), the final image of finding rest in the "spaces between words" lands a clear, non-literal thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of accepting imperfection and transience is beautifully integrated, with the cracked chime serving as a potent central symbol. The ending resonates strongly with the premise, validating the caretaker's refusal to "fix" the past, offering a clear, non-literal answer to the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of semantic resonance as social contract is integrated beautifully into the magic system. The ending image of the prism reflects the multifaceted nature of rebuilt trust with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated multiple times ("harmonize conflicting values," "mercy moving the gears"), leaving little room for subtext. The story tells the reader exactly what to feel rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of preservation versus forgetting is coherent but articulated through explicit statements ("preservation: to cradle the echo") rather than emerging from subtext. The emotional resonance is slightly forced by these direct authorial insertions.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of "necessary distances" and the nature of thresholds is woven well into the narrative fabric. The conceptual repricing at the end—that sacredness is defined by what is left behind—lands with resonance. However, the thematic delivery occasionally leans on explicit statements ("thresholds weren’t merely doors") rather than subtextual dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme of finding connection in ruins is coherent but delivered through explicit telling ("not to chart stars but to learn the rhythm") rather than subtext. The ending leans into sentimentality, resolving complex isolation with a tidy, comforting gesture from nature.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("For what is gloom, if not...") and direct explanation ("The missing pieces weren't lost. They were given away"). This didactic approach robs the narrative of subtext, telling the reader what to feel rather than evoking it through dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is coherent but heavily didactic, culminating in a penalty-triggering Thematic Echo where the physicist explicitly writes the story's thesis ("Chaos is just order waiting for its choreographer"). This overt moralizing flattens the subtext, transforming potential insight into a declared lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit summary and moralizing lines ("memory was no longer contraband but compass") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The story explains its own significance repeatedly, leaving little room for reader interpretation or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit thesis statements ("His motivation was simple... to illuminate value") rather than emerging from narrative action. The subtext is text; the story explains its own metaphors immediately after presenting them.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in lecture-like passages ("pain, untranslated, turns toxic") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending relies on moralizing summary ("presence of purpose," "alchemy of ache") which triggers the penalty for thematic echoing.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of "hope as structure" is consistent and articulated clearly, perhaps too clearly. The story tends to state its thesis ("Hope wasn’t a feeling—it was a structure") rather than letting it emerge solely from subtext, giving the piece a slightly didactic quality.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story ends with an explicit moral sermon ("Legacy's burden was not meant to be carried alone...") that flattens the subtext into a lesson. This direct statement of theme robs the reader of the interpretive work required for literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of healing and possibility is communicated through explicit directive statements ("coax them into revealing... what could unfold") rather than emerging from subtext. This didactic approach renders the story a vehicle for its message rather than an exploration of it.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition and moralizing dialogue ("It is a mirror"). The ending explicates the lesson ("imperfect mosaic of consent") rather than allowing the subtext to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of "echo" as a sufficient form of atonement is resonant and lands well with the final image. The concept of preservation without resurrection adds nuance, though the "amoral philanthropist" motif feels slightly heavy-handed in its exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed narration ("Her motivation was not vengeance... it was resonance") rather than emerging from subtext. The story explains its own meaning repeatedly, reducing the potential for reader engagement or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is coherent but suffers from heavy-handed explication; the protagonist literally defines the moral ("ethical storytelling wasn’t about purity, but accountability"). The ending risks sermonizing ("Not by avoiding conflict, but by turning...") rather than letting the resonant image of the puppet speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme is coherent but overtly didactic, with the narrative explicitly explaining the meaning of the actions ("Its power lay in its solitude," "Yet in that dissolution lay its triumph"). This explanatory heaviness in the final beats robs the imagery of its subtextual power and triggers a penalty for thematic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of redemptive preservation is resonant but becomes overly didactic in the final paragraphs ("This is preservation..."). The story shifts from dramatizing the meaning to explaining it in a sermon-like conclusion, which deflates the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and direct addresses to the reader ("You were always the path"), replacing subtext with sermonizing. The resonance is asserted rather than earned through the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of "magic as physics" and devotion to cosmic order is resonant and well-integrated into the action. The text tends to state its themes explicitly ("magic... was merely physics undiscovered") rather than letting them emerge solely through subtext, but the final image of the "universe that noticed everything" lands with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, culminating in an explicit sermon ("This was the lesson: resentment cannot be argued away"). This overt moralizing replaces organic resonance, reducing the thematic impact to a statement rather than an experience.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of "erasing boundaries" is coherent but articulated through exposition ("charting regrets," "reverence for its cost") rather than dramatized subtext. The connection between the maker's past and the dream is stated clearly but doesn't complicate the action or the emotional outcome. The resolution feels like a "just so" story rather than an earned thematic inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central metaphor of repairing vows is powerful and integrated well into the action. However, the final paragraph explicitly sermonizes ("But because wisdom, like orchards, grows best..."), converting subtext into text. This moralizing undercut the resonance of the otherwise subtle green ribbon image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of nonlinear inheritance is woven tightly into the imagery and plot structure. The concept of "resonance across possibilities" resolves the central question effectively without becoming too didactic. The narrative commits fully to its premise, using the "Again" loop to recontextualize the protagonist's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "rescue vs. reconciliation" is coherent, but the story relies on a literal explication of the thesis at the climax. The lexicon’s projected sentence ("I am the lesson you refused to learn...") removes interpretative ambiguity and preaches the moral, reducing thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    The themes of identity and memory are coherent, but the story relies on explicit articulation of its thesis ("Truth didn’t matter; belief did"). The final sentence is a direct thematic echo that moralizes the ending, violating the show-don't-tell standard for high-band literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story explicitly states its theme via the log entry ("Fables of absence are not endings"), reducing subtext to a moral summary. This "Thematic Echo" in the final moments prevents the narrative from achieving organic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of "tuning" conflict rather than banishing it is handled with sophistication, supported by the resonant concept that "silence is architecture." The resolution avoids a simplistic defeat of the enemy, instead achieving a "bloom of hush" that integrates the disruption into a new balance, offering a satisfying conceptual repricing of the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand; explicit statements like "Coincidences? No. Convergences." flatten subtext into instruction. The narrative tells the reader what the visions mean rather than allowing the resonance to emerge organically.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of sculpting identity from memory is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed assertions ("This was collective memory made tactile") rather than organic subtext. The resonance is forced by the relentless interpretive narration rather than emerging from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of reclaiming light through disciplined "serious play" resonates strongly in the final image. The transformation of the rag knot (scent/memory) into the star (light/future) offers a satisfying, non-literal answer to the story's central premise of a starless night.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme is coherent but undermined by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("Time, she understood now..."), which summarizes the meaning instead of trusting the resonant image to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central theme is resonant but delivered through explicit authorial exposition ("They understood then... By limiting exposure...") rather than emerging organically from action. This over-articulation flattens the subtext at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of silence as presence is clear but explicitly stated ("to teach silence how to comfort..."), reducing subtextual resonance. The storm glass functions well as a thematic object, but the moral is delivered rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("The throne didn’t grant power—it granted perspective"). The story relies on explaining the meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, culminating in a direct lecture ("The lesson is complete: suffocation ends not when..."). Themes are stated as aphorisms throughout ("silence had become the only language") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of transforming trauma is clear but delivered through explicit statements (&quot;alchemy of the soul&quot;) and aphoristic closing lines. The story explains its meaning as it unfolds, leaving little room for subtext or ambiguity to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative explicitly interprets its own themes for the reader ("The hidden truth was not political. It was personal"), leaving no room for subtext. This over-explanation flattens the resonance, telling the reader what to feel rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story relies on explicit sermonizing to convey its themes ("not the dawn of a new day, but the dawn of a new grammar") rather than allowing them to emerge from action. This over-articulation leaves no room for subtext, reducing the narrative to a lecture on "becoming."

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing rather than subtext. Phrases like "proof that love persists" and "unwritten anthem for the unseen" state the thesis directly to the reader. The ending summarizes the lesson ("She didn't heal by forgetting...") instead of allowing the dramatic action to carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through didactic narration ("tyranny of indifference," "slow rot") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The ending explicitly summarizes the moral ("Not with explosions, but with remembrance"), robbing the reader of the chance to interpret the resonance for themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of silencing fate/history through art is handled with consistency and grace. The subversion of the "prophecy" trope (silencing it rather than fulfilling it) is strong. The ending reinforces the theme of "erasure" effectively, though the grandmother's dialogue borders on platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of memory and communion is coherent but delivered through explicit exposition ("not for science, but for story"). The resonance is earned through the concept but dampened by the lack of subtextual ambiguity or counter-argument.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is coherent but delivered didactically through explicit statements in the journal and final dialogue. Phrases like "Plans are anchors" and the closing moral summation leave little room for subtext or reader interpretation, reducing the story's resonant power to a stated lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is resonant but over-articulated, with the narrative explicitly summarizing its lesson ("names are not labels, but anchors") rather than letting it emerge from the action. This didactic tendency flattens the subtext in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of integrating grief rather than fixing it is coherent, but the story relies on explicit exposition ("She knew grief needed no fixing," "Laughter was not the opposite") to deliver its message. Subtext is crowded out by these direct authorial assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme is articulated through explicit summary and moralizing ("mercy is not an equation... but a space") in the final beats rather than emerging organically from the action. This reliance on a "Thematic Echo" (stating the thesis) weakens the resonance of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story concludes with a didactic summary ("Between childhood and now, I’ve learned: truth isn’t shouted...") that explains the theme rather than letting the dramatic action speak. This explicit moralizing in the final paragraph undercuts the resonance of the imagery and violates the preference for subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of witnessing the neglected is coherent and resonates through the imagery of dust and silence. The connection to his daughter adds emotional weight, and the ending recontextualizes the abandoned space effectively as a place of vigil rather than just ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story relies on explicit thematic statements near the end ("Chaos was not the enemy of meaning—it was its midwife") to articulate its point. This didacticism undercuts the power of the imagery, substituting explanation for earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of translation as a new form of revolution is poignant, but the story tends to explicate its meaning rather than letting it resonate implicitly ("The real rebellion was against forgetting"). The final haiku and the narrator’s summary of the "answer" feel slightly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of "rust as revelation" is poignant but is undercut by explicit moralizing near the climax ("the covenant of rust wasn’t about decay—it was about revelation"). This "Thematic Echo" reduces subtext by explaining the metaphor to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of rejecting logic for sensation is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. Phrases like "the place where explanations fail" are repeated explicitly, converting subtext into text. The message is clear, but it relies on assertion and romanticized tropes of the "sublime underground" rather than emerging organically from the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Simplicity is not absence... It is architecture") and a didactic epilogue, leaving little room for subtext. The narrative preaches the lesson of "timewoven alliances" rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story explicitly states its themes ("beauty persists in obscurity," "life chooses the hush") rather than allowing them to emerge from subtext. The narrator explains the meaning of the mural and the flowers directly to the reader, reducing resonance to a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is coherent but heavily didactic, culminating in an explicit moral statement ("Truth, she learned, thrives in tension...") that explains the meaning to the reader. This sermonizing undermines the organic resonance of the lagoon's response, replacing subtext with a thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme is resonant but heavily didactic, relying on explicit authorial statements (e.g., "nostalgia was a narcotic," "civilization was... reborn") that explain the meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of memory as a living force against efficiency is well-integrated, and the concept of "velvet disquiet" resonates in the resolution. The ending avoids grandiosity, focusing on a small, verifiable change (the smile) that earns the thematic argument without preaching.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is articulated through explicit narrator statements ("Entropy decreased not by force, but by consent") rather than emerging from subtext. The final paragraph summarizes the moral ("vortex inheritance... was a door held open"), which flattens the resonance of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, culminating in an explicit moral summary in the final paragraph. The didactic &quot;to favor listening over noise&quot; statement replaces subtextual resonance with told wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than emerging from subtext ("vulnerability wearing its most radiant armor," "Stillness blooms where motion surrenders"). This reliance on aphorism and direct moralizing, particularly the recitation of the journal entry, flattens the narrative complexity into a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of bearing witness to "unspoken words" is coherent and resonates through the imagery of the box and the ghosts. However, the text tends to explicate the theme ("honor the architecture of silence") rather than trusting the subtext to carry it, reducing the potential for ambiguity and reader discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme is evocative but heavily didactic, articulated explicitly by the letter ("Time isn’t broken"), then Lira, then Vey. This triple-statement constitutes a significant "Thematic Echo" flaw, replacing subtext with direct instruction to the reader. The resonance is flattened by this over-explanation rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("Her motivation was never completion... but to discover beauty in the incomplete") rather than subtext. The ending relies on a "Thematic Echo" ("Even snapped strings carry the wind’s memory") that summarizes the moral, triggering the penalty for didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered didactically through diary entries and narrator assertions ("Respect isn’t earned..."). The story prioritizes explicit moralizing over subtextual resonance, leaving little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.9)
    The ending explicitly summarizes the theme ("She had become part of the reaction") rather than trusting the final image, effectively flattening the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of restorative memory is resonant and well-developed through imagery. However, the explicit articulation of the theme ("neither vengeance nor absolution, but restoration") reduces subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered via explicit lectures and rigid "thematic echo" (e.g., "truth wears many skins," "closeness isn’t measured in steps"). Subtext is replaced by overt moralizing, and the emotional resonance is asserted through abstract summaries rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated via a prompt-echo ("true north isn’t a place—it’s a decision"), reducing subtext to a lecture. This overt moralizing prevents organic resonance, treating the reader to a defined lesson rather than an experience.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is explicitly preached to the reader ("He had not fixed the sky—he had invited it to play") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story relies on explaining its moral significance through summary rather than allowing the reader to infer meaning from the events.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story explicates its own subtext, particularly in the paragraph beginning "The missing pawns? They were never meant to return." This overt moralizing and the direct stating of the protagonist's realization reduce the thematic resonance, treating the reader as a passive recipient of the message.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of home as a "frequency" rather than a place is resonant but is delivered through explicit statements rather than emerging purely from subtext. The unrelenting use of antithesis ("not X, but Y") to define the theme makes the subtext feel lectured, turning the realization into a series of definitions rather than an earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but undermined by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("Forgiveness had not come from decree..."), which explains the lesson rather than letting the imagery resonate. This summarization flattens the subtext into a simple instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    The themes of complexity versus purity are coherent, but the narrative relies too heavily on explicit theme statements (e.g., "Forgiveness, she believed, should never be cheapened by simplicity"). This didacticism flattens the subtext, treating the reader to a lecture rather than trusting the dramatized ritual to carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text multiple times ("not to hide fractures, but to gild them"), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. The final paragraph summarizes the moral ("conjured meaning... forged in the crucible"), violating the show-don't-tell principle and flattening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.3)
    The ending suffers from explicit moralizing ("The cave had shown her: reflection wasn’t in glass, but in motion"), which converts subtext into text and flattens the resonance. The theme is coherent but over-explained at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is explicitly preached to the reader ("whispers traveled farther than shouts") rather than emerging from the subtext of events. The "Thematic Echo" penalty applies here, as the story pauses to articulate its thesis directly. The lack of moral complexity—gentleness is presented as a universally effective panacea—flattens the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of "reverse migration" is compelling, but the story relies on explicit thesis statements ("Maybe grief given syntax," "Raw solace isn't comfort") to convey it. The resonance is built through assertion and summary rather than emerging organically from a specific dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies heavily on explicit thematic statements ("Safety is not absence of threat, but presence of regulation") and diagnostic labeling ("post-viral trauma") to convey meaning. This over-articulation flattens resonance, telling the reader the moral rather than letting it emerge from the subtext of the fractured world.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The themes of memory, witnessing, and the endurance of love are woven well into the resolution. The final image of the flower pinned beside the photograph creates a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of the stranger's intent.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative over-explains its own symbols ("Not metaphorical... but real") and explicitly states the moral in the final paragraph, collapsing subtext. The theme of redemption is resolved through magic rather than character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in dialogue ("Rule over resonance"), creating a sermonizing effect that flattens subtext. The bleeding starlight is a potent symbol, but its power is diminished by the figure's immediate explanation of its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    Subtext is externalized into dialogue ("Presence isn't passive... It's chosen"), turning the characters into mouthpieces for the theme. The thesis is stated explicitly in the final beats, violating the "show, don't sermonize" expectation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story relies too heavily on explicit thematic statements, particularly in the final third (“The point is the distillation,” “Endings are just seams”). These lines flatten the subtext, explaining the story’s meaning to the reader rather than allowing the resonant final image to do the work. The concept of "feral nostalgia" is strong, but the text trusts the reader too little to interpret it without guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through dialogue ("The miracle wasn’t in the oil... it was in the pause") and narration, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The story tells the reader exactly what to feel and think, reducing the resonance of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of integrating failure is woven well through the ritual actions, but the final paragraph explicitly states the thesis ("stories... do not erase pain — they alchemize it"). This overt moralizing undercuts the resonance of the preceding image (scars shimmering as waypoints), triggering a deduction for thematic echoing at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of "imperfect miracles" is woven tightly into the plot and character arc, culminating in the acceptance of the flawed symphony. The final dialogue regarding "truth" versus "metaphors" provides a satisfying thematic capstone that recontextualizes the protagonist's growth.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of unraveling illusion to find coherence is tightly integrated into the action and resolution. The final image of the "hush" resonates well with the "end of history" premise. While some thematic statements are a bit heavy-handed ("Meaning is not discovered..."), the narrative effectively dramatizes the core concept.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central metaphor of time as erosion is compelling, but the subtext is undercut by explicit thesis statements ("clocks didn't measure hours... They measured surrender"). The final paragraph moralizes the theme ("remind the world that time isn't lost"), reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.1)
    The core concept is resonant, but the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the theme ("it was not an act of loss, but an act of expansion") rather than trusting the dissolving imagery. This explicit moralizing triggers a penalty for explaining the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of probability and connection is coherent but delivered heavily through explicit "scrawls" that act as aphorisms (e.g., "P(failure) = 0"), telling the reader the meaning rather than letting it emerge organically. The "clover" motif serves as a satisfying, non-verbal thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central thesis ("endings needed to be taught how to begin") is explicitly stated in the narration and then repeated almost verbatim in dialogue at the climax ("This is where endings learn how to begin"). This "Thematic Echo" flattens the subtext into a sermon, doing the reader's interpretive work for them and reducing the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme is articulated through explicit statements and definitions ("The first clause...", "The second clause...") rather than emerging organically from action. The result feels didactic, with the "covenant" concept presented as a lecture or manifesto rather than an earned subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures rather than subtext. The narrative overtly states the protagonist's motivation ("to find the cure for loneliness") and explains the ending's meaning in the final paragraph ("Not because of the rock... But because reciprocity..."). This didacticism flattens the resonance, leaving the reader with no interpretive work to do.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text ("grief and joy were not opposites..."), which flattens subtext and reduces the story to a parable with a fixed moral. The narrative explains its meaning to the reader instead of allowing resonance to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.8)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by "thematic echo" and explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("The seeds weren’t wrong..."). The story lectures the reader on its thesis rather than allowing meaning to emerge organically from the character's struggle and experience.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader ("Silence is not absence"), erasing subtext and opportunity for reader engagement. The final paragraph summarizes the moral directly, violating the standard of earned resonance and replacing scene pressure with a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the final paragraphs ("The forgotten promise? To never let the fire of memory die...") rather than emerging from subtext or action. This didactic approach collapses ambiguity and reduces the narrative to a parable. The story tells the reader exactly what to feel and think, preventing genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of integration is coherent but resolves into a simplistic "healing" moral. The ending's sentimental tone ("hush of the universe," "grace") flattens the potential complexity of the collective consciousness premise.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The final paragraph explicitly articulates the thesis ("Whispers, she knew, echo longer..."), transforming subtext into a motto. This didacticism flattens the resonance of the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of reframing tragedy is consistent but is explicitly stated via narration ("teach darkness the value of stars") rather than emerging purely through subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of reawakening wonder is clear but delivered somewhat didactically, with the narrative explicitly identifying the enemies ("screens that numbed wonder") rather than letting the subtext do the work. The resolution feels like a fable with a tidy moral rather than a complex exploration of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing ("true freedom is not escape, but alignment") and didactic theme statements in the final paragraphs. The theme is preached rather than emerging organically from subtext or action, triggering the penalty for thematic echoing and sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative synthesizes the prompt elements into a sophisticated exploration of performative compliance and the erasure of grief. The final image of "whittling absence into artifact" perfectly crystallizes the theme, offering a complex answer to the central question without resorting to moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explication, with the narrator constantly interpreting the meaning of actions (e.g., "To enter was to paraphrase the divine"). This didactic approach suffocates subtext, replacing organic resonance with lecture-like assertions about the nature of art and boundaries.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of finding value in imperfection is well-dramatized through the "broken" reed and the ash patterns. However, the explicit definition of "bartered awakenings" as "soul-stuff" feels slightly expository, telling the reader the theme rather than letting the barter speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed rhetorical questions ("Why do we believe connection must be instant...?") rather than dramatized action. This overt moralizing, particularly the didactic "What if..." sequence near the end, flattens subtext and reduces the narrative to a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized ("authenticity need not stem from nature to be true") rather than allowed to emerge from subtext or action. The story relies on sentimental assertions about healing and "the broken" instead of earning those insights through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme is explicitly articulated through journal entries and dialogue ("The old systems shattered, but the human grammar didn’t"), leaving little room for subtext. The final exchange ("They're remembering forward") acts as a summary thesis statement, triggering the thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of painful memory versus sanitized silence is well-developed through action. However, the final paragraph summarizes the thesis ("purified by refusal to repeat the past") rather than trusting the image of the song to carry the meaning, reducing subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of resilience and adaptation is coherent but delivered through explicit thesis statements ("It was hope’s chrysalis," "Hope had not vanished") rather than subtext. This over-articulation in the final third flattens the potential for resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story commits a major literary error by explicitly stating its theme and metaphor ("The chameleon’s tail... was a metaphor"). This turns subtext into text and flattens the resonance. The ending leans into moralizing ("Her self-respect no longer demanded purity...") rather than letting the action speak.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central theme of "closure vs. continuation" is successfully executed but explicitly stated ("She was no longer a closure seeker") rather than emerging purely through subtext. The symbolism of the scar and the seed is consistent and resonant, though the "moral" is delivered directly to the reader in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.0)
    The explicit moral on the marquee ("LOVE NEVER ENDS...") severely undercuts the subtext, reducing a resonant theme to a literal billboard. This violation of the "show, don't tell" principle flattens the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is explicitly stated in didactic prose ("kind that withers under fluorescent lights") rather than emerging organically from subtext. This over-articulation flattens resonance, leaving the reader with a declared moral rather than an earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.0)
    The themes of potential, memory, and entropy are clearly articulated, though often through direct exposition ("silence louder than any scream") rather than subtext. The story achieves a cohesive mood, but the thematic resonance is limited by the lack of dramatic friction to test the protagonist's values.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit assertions ("thinking ended and knowing began") rather than emerging from subtext or struggle. The result feels didactic, with the narrative serving as a delivery system for the philosophical thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue ("Courage doesn't rust... It waits") rather than emerging from subtext. The result feels like a sermon or fable with a predetermined lesson, lacking the complexity of a discovered truth.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of safety versus vitality is well-woven through the narrative symbols (bolt, stain, whistle). However, the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the lesson ("He understood now: safety cost everything...") rather than letting the resonant image of the sound and the gold stain speak for themselves, triggering the deduction for moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Truth is not a weapon. It is a mirror"), turning the ending into a sermon rather than a resonant narrative experience. The focus on "justice delayed" is intellectualized through the protagonist's final speech rather than emerging organically from the conflict. This heavy-handed approach flattens the subtext into a simple lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of metamorphosis is coherent but culminates in an explicit "Thematic Echo" ("Some losses aren’t endings. They’re metamorphoses") that preaches the moral rather than letting the image resonate. The sentimental resolution diffuses the complexity of the loss, offering a purely positive outcome that feels unearned by the prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing in the final dialogue ("It was never about winning. It was about remembering..."), which the rubric penalizes as "Thematic Echo." The story tells the reader exactly what to feel rather than letting the resonance emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing, particularly in the final lines ("evolution is not rebellion’s opposite..."). The heavy-handed delivery turns subtext into text, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.8)
    The ending explicitly summarizes the theme ("The arboretum teaches me that stillness... is not the absence of chaos"), violating the show-don't-tell rule for resonance. This moralizing explanation flattens the complexity of the "ruin and regrowth" motif into a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is heavily explicated through rhetorical questions and direct assertions ("Is grief just gravity...") rather than emerging from subtext. The capitalization of "crestRISEN" in the climax reduces the thematic arc to a pun, undercutting the gravity of the transformation. The story tells the reader what it means rather than allowing the meaning to resonate from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    The pivotal thematic realization is delivered via direct authorial explanation ("Time didn’t slow for the world—it slowed for the witness"), which flattens subtext. This over-articulation at the climax robs the reader of the chance to intuit the meaning through the action itself.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme is delivered with a heavy hand, culminating in the protagonist explicitly stating the moral ("Because truth doesn’t need volume"). The ending drifts into legend-building ("Silent Scandal Wing"), which distances the reader from the raw political reality of the act.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.0)
    Thematic resonance is dampened by explicit thesis statements in dialogue ("Continuity... Not monuments") and explanatory narration that decodes symbols for the reader ("the act itself was a vow"). The story preaches its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    The themes of grief, memory, and resonance are woven consistently through the imagery. The ending avoids a tidy moral, opting instead for a tonal shift from blue to gold that suggests healing, though the emotional core feels slightly intellectualized.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed aphorisms ("silence corrodes faster than ink," "orbits, after all, are not prisons"). The story relies on stating its thesis directly in the narration rather than allowing it to emerge subtextually from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("not to erase cries, but to translate them," "maps... to forgiveness") to convey its meaning. This "telling" of the theme undermines the resonance of the final image, triggering the penalty for thematic explanation replacing subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story suffers from a heavily didactic ending that explicitly states the thesis ("meaning isn’t found in the fixing of broken things"). This "explain-everything" conclusion flattens the subtext and replaces earned resonance with a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed didacticism ("Mercy is not a plea... It is a practice") and sentimental renaming (beggar to "keeper of stories"). The narrative explicitly preaches the moral in the final paragraph, collapsing subtext into a lecture and violating the show-don't-tell principle.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of transforming grief into possibility is resonant and clearly articulated through the orchard imagery. While it leans slightly toward sentimentality ("lure possibility from the brink"), the final image of the sapling successfully anchors the concept in a concrete object.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding connection through "broken" pathways is cohesive and resonates through the imagery of geodes and fractured minds. The ending successfully recontextualizes the "residue" not as a defect but as a new mode of communion, landing a solid Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies on defining its themes explicitly ("She called them 'transitional objects'") rather than allowing them to emerge from subtext. The emotional resonance is asserted through exposition ("motivation was... existential") instead of arising organically from the action. The thematic "voice" is overly helpful.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and definitions ("Prophecy wasn’t prediction—it was raw possibility") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending relies on a heavy-handed Thematic Echo ("She knew it was stitched in silence"), summarizing the lesson instead of letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of "fixing what's broken" is present but delivered through heavy-handed exposition at the closure. The final paragraphs explicitly summarize the moral ("The burned spy became the quiet gardener..."), converting subtext into text and flattening the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit thesis statements ("The promise whispered: Distill complexity into essence") rather than organic dramatization. This overt didacticism flattens the subtext, reducing the narrative to a parable where the meaning is dictated to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme of preservation-as-surrender is resonant but delivered with a heavy hand. Explicitly stating the moral ("Kindness, she knew, was the only force..." and "She understood now...") undercuts the subtext, transforming potential epiphany into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit narrator explanation ("She wasn't healing the world. She was offering it moments...") rather than emerging from the subtext of the action. The story relies on "emotional ventriloquism" to assert the crowd's reaction ("not from fear, but awe") instead of allowing the reader to infer meaning from the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and direct statements ("Mourning was for those who believed endings were final") rather than subtext or action. The ending explicitly summarizes the moral ("meant making space for ghosts") and the metaphorical shift ("no longer a mausoleum... It was a loom"), leaving no room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    Themes of connection are articulated clearly but delivered through exposition ("understood... the hidden architecture") rather than subtext. The narrative explicitly states its meaning, leaving little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of counter-frequency as healing is coherent and resonant. However, the post-climax explanation of "the physics of hope" leans into didactic "telling" rather than letting the image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme is coherent but the ending relies on explicit moralizing ("The world had not gone mad; it had remembered its right to bend") rather than subtext. This explanatory summary flattens the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly preached to the reader ("justice was a courtroom abstraction," "people vanish twice"). This heavy-handed telling robs the narrative of subtext, replacing organic resonance with instructional thematic echoes. The story tells us what to feel rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial statements ("It was memory... It was grief") rather than emerging organically from the action. The ending moralizes the premise, reducing the subtextual complexity to a summarized lesson in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story relies on explicit thematic statements (“These were not directions for feet, but for the soul”) and moralizing summaries (“Permission to be remade”) instead of allowing subtext to emerge from action. This overt sermonizing in the final beats flattens the resonance and violates the "show, don't preach" principle.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative relies on explicit moralizing, stating the theme directly ("loops of learning, not laps of futility") and having the protagonist lecture others on the lesson. This didactic approach leaves little room for subtext or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story explicitly explains its own themes ("The symbolism wasn’t lost," "Grief, when shared, turned to grace"), collapsing subtext into a sermon. The ending moralizes rather than letting the image resonate on its own, reducing the literary impact of the "stars as receipts" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of vulnerability as strength is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed explication ("Mirrors lie... They show surfaces polished for survival"). The reliance on stated moralizing in the final third reduces the resonance of the imagery itself.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("Lies. Vows made in dream were the only ones that mattered") rather than dramatized experience. The story relies on telling the reader the moral significance of the events instead of allowing meaning to emerge from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme is resonant but delivered through heavy-handed dialogue ("Destiny isn't bartered. It's carved") and explicit moralizing ("We don't fix souls"). The subtext is drowned out by the characters explaining the theme to each other.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme is coherent but culminates in explicit moralizing. Writing "What’s broken still carries song" on the corkboard literally spells out the subtext, flattening the ending into a sermon rather than letting the image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of "transition as reconfiguration" is intelligent and well-integrated with the central metaphor of cuneiform. However, it is delivered somewhat didactically through internal monologue ("Transition isn’t rupture") rather than emerging purely from the dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    Themes are delivered through explicit didactic statements ("wonder doesn’t die—it molts") and definitions ("To smelt here meant...") rather than emerging from dramatic action. This heavy-handed explanation flattens potential subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit thesis statements ("isolation was the true apocalypse") rather than emerging from narrative friction. The ending tells the reader the moral ("walls... dissolved... leaving only connection") instead of trusting the final image to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is coherent but delivered didactically, with the graffiti literally spelling out the lessons ("Forgiveness isn’t earned..."). The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("The path to self-forgiveness wasn’t straight..."), which flattens the subtext and robs the ending of lingering resonance. The imagery supports the theme, but the text over-explains it.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.7)
    The themes of recursion, silence, and the cost of truth cohere well. The ending resonates with the established logic of the library, reinforcing the premise of unspoken words as a trap.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of provenance as healing is coherent and resonant, culminating in a strong final image. However, the execution is didactic, relying on explicit statements ("The empire? A gilded cage...") rather than allowing the meaning to emerge solely through subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "oblivion’s delay" and the transformation of death into active observation is handled with coherence and resonance. The ending successfully recontextualizes the protagonist's relationship to her work, landing a quiet but effective conceptual reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.0)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit moralizing and summary ("contentment wasn’t found—it was returned to," "beauty persists even in shadow"). The text explains its thesis directly to the reader in the final paragraphs, replacing organic subtext with sermonizing assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme is consistent but delivered with heavy-handed explicitness; phrases like "You are allowed to change" and the final dialogue line sermonize the message rather than letting the action resonate on its own. The story tells the reader exactly how to interpret the ending, reducing thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of "vanishing as emergence" is delivered through explicit dialogue ("Vanishing isn’t erasure—it’s preparation") rather than subtext or action. This didactic approach flattens the potential resonance of the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("You do not chase the path. You become the landmark") rather than emerging organically from action. This overt moralizing in the final beats acts as a "Thematic Echo" artifact, replacing earned resonance with instructional assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is coherent but suffers from a "Thematic Echo" penalty where the entity explicitly states the moral ("To find the sacred in the simple"). Subtext is lost when the thesis is delivered as dialogue in the climax, flattening the resonance of the bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is explicitly told rather than dramatized, particularly in the final paragraph where the narrator summarizes the lesson ("He knew now why..."). The repetition of the maxim "truth hides behind truth" feels instructional rather than emergent from the narrative struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "backwards prophecy" concept resonates well with the themes of entropy and choice. However, the thematic delivery leans on explicit statements ("We’re the distillate") rather than allowing the subtext to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of naming fear to tame it is resonant and consistently developed. However, the ending drifts into explicit moralizing ("no longer heartbroken, but heart-carrier"), which flattens the subtext into a stated lesson rather than letting the image serve as the answer.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of "brittle devotion" and restoring balance through gentle precision rather than force is cohesive and resonant. The ending, where a "soft glunk" rather than a thunderous crash restores the fish, perfectly underscores the premise that subtle correction is superior to raw power. The concept is executed with thematic integrity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of memory as persistence is effectively woven through the imagery. However, the dialogue near the end ("And humanity remembers") explicitly articulates the thesis, tripping the penalty for thematic echoing. This moralizing touch reduces the subtextual power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and summary rather than subtext or action. The narrative repeatedly tells the reader the meaning of the events ("wonder was not the opposite of wisdom"), and the final journal entry acts as a thematic summary that flattens the resonance. This heavy-handed approach violates the "show, don't tell" principle regarding thematic argument.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in the narration ("The Watcher’s burden was not in seeing, but in choosing what to show"), which flattens potential subtext. The story illustrates a stated thesis rather than allowing the moral complexity of "revising truth" to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is heavily explicated through direct authorial statement rather than subtext. The text frequently pauses to define the meaning of events ("not as trauma, but as release," "not of who he was, but of what he refused"), leaving little room for reader interpretation. The result is a didactic tone where the moral is lectured rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of innovation requiring patience is coherent and culminates in a resonant conceptual twist that recontextualizes the "failure" of the bloom. The closure successfully reprices the premise, though the resonance is somewhat dampened by the summary delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative explicitly decodes its own symbolism ("the leaf blower isn’t a machine... it’s a vessel"), which collapses subtext and leaves little room for reader interpretation. The theme is delivered via sermonizing assertions rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of repurposing a tool of control (the pendant) for connection is handled with sophistication. The subversion of the cultist's intent—loneliness rather than power—adds a resonant layer of meaning that elevates the closure beyond a simple magic trick.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of creative destruction is central but delivered with heavy-handed explication ("The core concept he clung to was..."). The relentless definition of what things "were not" turns the thematic development into a lecture rather than an organic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of finding genesis in endings is resonant and tightly linked to the narrative logic. However, the story explicitly explains its own subtext ("It was a mirror... crystallized a truth"), which diminishes the power of the realization by telling rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in summary ("permanence was never the goal—transience was the truth") rather than emerging organically from action. This reliance on "sermonizing" reduces the subtextual resonance, turning the ending into a thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is heavily explicated rather than dramatized, particularly in the closing paragraphs where the narrative directly answers its own question ("The answer wasn’t in objects... It was in texture"). This essayistic approach flattens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit monologue ("We are not relics") rather than emerging organically from action; the "teaching moment" structure renders the subtext overly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in both dialogue ("love doesn’t die—it just changes frequency") and narration ("quiet, incidental heroism"). This direct stating of the thesis reduces subtextual resonance, turning the ending into a lesson rather than an earned emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is resonant but delivered with a heavy hand, culminating in an explicit moral summary in the final paragraph ("The unremembered stood a little taller"). This tells the reader how to feel rather than letting the image of the ghosts speak for itself. The subtext is often converted into text, reducing the lingering power of the central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is articulated explicitly through dialogue and internal monologue ("Wisdom... wasn't in the correction of error, but in the honoring of its residue") rather than emerging from subtext. This didactic approach flattens the resonance, offering a stated moral instead of an earned experience.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of memory and resonance is beautifully articulated, with the final image of "echoing forward" providing a satisfying Conceptual Repricing of the setting's rules. The ending successfully recontextualizes the canyon from a preservative archive to a generative voice without heavy-handed moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is coherent but undermined by explicit moralizing in the final dialogue ("The joke is that bitterness was never yours..."). This explanatory speech dissolves subtext into a lecture, resolving the thematic tension verbally rather than through the resonant image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of molting and renewal is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, often through direct explanation ("Beauty hides in husks," "tarnished wonder... was molting"). Subtext is frequently surrendered to overt philosophical commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of "linking absences" is poignant but undermined by explicit telling. The ending falls into the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, where the narrative summarizes its own moral in the final paragraph ("broken promises... simply learned to fly"). This overt sentimentalizing flattens the subtext into a direct message.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme relies on explicit sermonizing ("beauty left incomplete is a wound") rather than subtext. The narrative dictates the moral significance of the events directly to the reader instead of allowing resonance to emerge from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of analog persistence versus digital decay is coherent and woven into the mechanics of the world. The resolution leans slightly didactic ("She understood then..."), articulating the theme explicitly rather than letting it emerge solely through the subtext of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of longing is poignant but is undercut by explicit moralizing in the final dialogue ("Longing is the only map that never lies"), which triggers a penalty for thematic echoing. The reliance on labeled emotions ("hope," "yearning," "surrender") rather than subtext flattens the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in a sermonizing passage ("love, when spoken without armor, could reweave broken worlds"), violating the subtext requirement. The ending relies on a generalized future abstraction rather than earned narrative resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic inversion—that the orchard feeds on rupture rather than memory itself—is a strong insight. However, the execution relies on explicit diagnostic statements ("She theorized it fed on memory...") rather than letting the subtext emerge purely through the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of resilience is resonant, but the explicit definition in dialogue ("Resilience... isn't forged in comfort") triggers a thematic echo deduction. The final image enacts the concept more powerfully than the spoken thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("Not metaphorical wonder... the actual hue") and sentimental assertion rather than subtext. The story dictates exactly how the reader should feel about "wonder" and "hope," leaving no room for interpretive ambiguity or resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of healing trauma through silence is coherent but resolves in a didactic manner. The final paragraph contains a direct Thematic Echo ("silence, properly tended, could heal even the deepest cuts"), explicitly stating the moral in a way that flattens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of memory and presence is coherent but delivered through explicit statements ("silence... was not void but vessel") rather than subtext. The final paragraph relies on a summary of the moral ("some truths are not uncovered but remembered"), triggering the penalty for explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is coherent but overly explicit; the climax relies on diagnostic label-speak ("Letting go isn’t collapse. It’s recalibration") that explains the subtext rather than letting the action carry the meaning. This didacticism flattens the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("I decoded love") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending relies on a didactic moral statement ("not to escape... but to invite") that flattens the narrative into a lesson rather than a resonant experience.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through direct aphorisms ("Joy is not the absence of sorrow") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The reliance on diary entries to explicitly state the moral reduces thematic resonance to a series of instructional maxims.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of "spooled wholeness" and memory in absence is powerfully developed through the cloud metaphor. The resonance is strong, though occasionally the text explicitly states the theme ("prove that empty spaces remember") where the imagery alone might have sufficed. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question without reducing it to a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    The thematic inversion of currency-as-cosmos is resonant. However, the ending leans into explicit moralizing ("The limit she had discovered was not of her blindness... they saw faces and called them whole"), which flattens the subtext into a stated thesis right before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of decoding the world's hidden languages is coherent and lands with a consistent emotional tone. However, the execution leans toward sentimental assertion ("whispered back," "story still being told") rather than subtextual resonance. The ending feels slightly pat, resolving the intellectual query without emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is articulated too explicitly in the narrative, with lines like "repair is not restoration, but reharmonization" acting as thesis statements. This overt moralizing flattens the subtext, leaving little room for the reader to infer meaning from the action itself.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of unity and trust is coherent but delivered didactically through explicit summary ("Not control, but catalysis"). The story tells the reader what the events mean rather than allowing the subtext to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing rather than subtext ("He had not saved the world. He had honored it."). The text tells the reader exactly how to interpret the events, reducing the potential for resonant ambiguity or deeper engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of duty as a form of "graceless beauty" resonates naturally through the action without becoming preachy. The final image of assembling a path for a future he resents offers a sophisticated, non-literal resolution to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme is coherent but delivered heavily through thesis statements ("Transformation required rupture," "Separation wasn't failure"). The subtext is often overtaken by these explicit declarations, leaving little room for the reader to infer meaning from the action itself.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of "quantifying absence" is intellectually engaging but delivered with heavy-handed exposition in dialogue ("I sell the method," "Choose your emptiness"). The story relies on explaining its thesis rather than letting it emerge organically from subtext or action. The ledger entry provides a nice specific grounding, but the overall delivery feels didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of processing grief is consistent, but the conclusion drifts into didacticism ("instrument of mercy," "soothe souls"), reducing the complexity of the "raw emotional residue" established earlier. The transformation of pain into "polished stones" is a beautiful image but feels slightly too tidy for the weight of the sorrow described.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly preached through dialogue ("construct bridges from silos") and narration ("Bridges, after all, require weight"), leaving little room for subtext. The story relies on moralizing statements rather than allowing meaning to emerge organically from action and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story explicitly explains its theme repeatedly ("Not to escape, but to excavate," "Not to mourn... to modify"). Subtext is suffocated because the narrative constantly diagnoses the character's intent and the meaning of the action for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of "seeding vigilance" is stated explicitly rather than emerging through subtext. The ending didacticism ("vigilance cannot be enforced... it must be seeded") flattens resonance by summarizing the moral instead of letting the imagery speak.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than emergent, violating the "show, don't tell" principle with lines like "Empathy in motion—that was the true sculpture." This explanatory moralizing in the final third flattens the subtext and resolves the narrative's questions with a lecture rather than resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story relies heavily on explicit moralizing and sermonizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("beauty blooms brightest in the soil of difficulty"). The theme is stated directly as a thesis rather than emerging from subtext or action, violating the show-don't-tell principle of thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the theme is integrated into the plot mechanics, the ending suffers significantly from explicit moralizing. The final paragraph functions as a sermon ("The path to empathy was never paved with speeches..."), summarizing the thesis rather than allowing the final image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.4)
    The story explicitly states its moral in the final paragraphs ("stillness is not absence of motion..."), violating the show-don't-tell principle and triggering the penalty for sermonizing. The theme is delivered as a lecture rather than emerging organically from the consequences of a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme is coherent but suffers from explicit moralizing near the end ("resilience is not grown — it is recalled"). This direct statement flattens the subtext, explaining the meaning to the reader rather than letting the dramatic action carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of human order versus adaptive chaos is coherent but articulated too explicitly in interior monologue ("Singular convergence... not coincidence"). The story relies on telling the reader the thematic significance rather than letting it emerge solely through subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("not as luxury, but as oxygen") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The narrative tells the reader exactly how to feel about "wonder," leaving no space for interpretation or resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of honoring failure is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed explicitness in the final paragraphs ("Let the failures be honored," "Some doors stay open..."). This triggers the Thematic Echo penalty, as the character articulates the story's thesis in a prompt-like summary that replaces dramatic resonance with instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.7)
    Themes are articulated explicitly through pamphlet titles ("The Arithmetic of Absence") and narration ("empathy without boundaries was erosion"), leaving little room for subtext. While the central concept is clear, the story explains its meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge organically from action and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, with the mentor's dialogue and the narrator's summary ("wonder isn't inherited, it's cultivated") spelling out the thesis. This didactic approach flattens subtext, leaving little room for the reader to infer meaning from action.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is heavily underscored by explicit statements ("This was a truthful lie," "Emotion is mass"), which flatten subtext into moralizing. The notebook entry acts as a diagnostic label that dictates meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of sacrifice for connection is coherent and resolves poignantly in the final image of the bead and the stars. The narrative commits fully to its premise, though the repeated thematic phrases occasionally render the subtext too explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is resonant but handled with a heavy hand; the narrative explicitly interprets the meaning for the reader ("meekness was not weakness," "turned rubble into rhythm"). This didacticism flattens the subtext, converting potential nuance into stated moral instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of sacrifice is poignant, but the ending serves up an explicit moral ("some truths don’t set you free—they make you responsible") that flattens the subtext. The use of the famous phrase "unbearable lightness" distracts from the story's own resonance, reading as a borrowed label rather than an earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of connection through silence is woven effectively through the letters, stones, and light. The final image resonates with the established motifs, though the "luminescent ache" is a slightly heavy-handed articulation of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is articulated through explicit assertions ("Not chaos, Catalyst") and heavy-handed binaries ("Not data, but destiny") rather than emerging organically. This didactic approach, particularly the thematic sermonizing in the final paragraphs, reduces subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story explicitly states its thesis in the final paragraph ("Some people magnetize stories not because..."), violating the rule against direct moralizing. This summary lecture replaces earned resonance with assertion, flattening the story’s complexity into a simple aphorism about "broken places."

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "witnessed sorrow" is consistent and resonant, culminating in a clear conceptual shift for the character. However, the delivery is somewhat didactic, relying on the narrator to explain the significance ("She wasn’t fixing anything anymore") rather than letting it emerge purely through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing to convey meaning, explaining its own symbols in the text ("true memory returns not through demand") and summarizing the lesson at the end rather than letting the subtext resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story concludes with explicit moralizing that summarizes the lesson ("She had unearthed the wisdom: that to stay while leaving is to transform..."). This sermonizing ending flattens the thematic resonance into a maxim, replacing subtext with a stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme is developed consistently through imagery but is undercut by explicit moralizing in the penultimate paragraph ("The sacred isn't in grand cathedrals... It's here"). This diagnostic summary explains the subtext to the reader, deflating the resonance of the final actions. The story leans on asserting its meaning rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is intelligible but delivered through explicit didactic statements ("forgiveness, it seemed, was the most durable frequency") rather than emerging organically from subtext. This on-the-nose articulation, particularly near the climax, flattens the potential for deeper resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of broken trust and silence is coherent and woven through the imagery. The "sound of trust breaking" is a compelling, if slightly over-articulated, conceptual frame that lands successfully in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    The themes of trauma-as-weather and ecological governance are interwoven well, offering a coherent worldview. The resolution ("questions are surrendered") lands a specific thematic point. However, the delivery leans slightly toward the didactic, with the narrative voice explicitly explaining the meaning of the storm and the election rather than letting it emerge solely from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is explicitly preached ("creativity isn’t a faucet") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The resolution—drawing wings to free the past—is a sentimental literalization of the metaphor that lacks ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central theme of truth as sustenance is powerful and well-executed through the magical realism elements. However, the final paragraph ("not with water, but with truth") explicitly explains the metaphor, reducing the resonant power of the ending image. A slight over-articulation of the thesis prevents a higher score here.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explication ("preservation—not of objects, but of perception") rather than emerging organically from subtext and action. The narrative explicitly states its thesis multiple times, violating the show-don't-tell principle and creating a sermonizing effect that flattens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of transforming fear into fuel is resonant, but the story relies on explicit explanation in the final third ("The caretaker understood... They were about transformation") rather than letting the action speak. This overt moralizing flattens the subtext into a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story explicitly states its theme ("trauma doesn't shout—it echoes") and explains its own subtext ("curated catharsis"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. This heavy-handed delivery robs the reader of the chance to interpret the meaning independently.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story explicitly tells its theme ("Liberate not by force...") and motivation, turning subtext into overt lecture. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("freedom that had always been theirs"), flattening the narrative's resonance into a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme is poignant but undercut by explicit summarization ("She knew what this meant. Memory wasn’t erased. It was displaced"). This diagnostic explanation preempts the reader's engagement with the subtext, converting a resonant realization into a stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed sermonizing ("For this was her calling...") and explicit moral summaries rather than dramatic enactment. The story relies on telling the reader the significance of the shift rather than allowing it to resonate through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of translation—deciphering both architecture and human reluctance—is seamlessly integrated into the plot mechanics. The "grammar in their gables" conceit pays off beautifully in the resolution, offering a resonant answer to the protagonist's yearning without becoming didactic. The subtext of the tea ritual enriches the central concept significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.6)
    The story relies on explicit aphorisms ("Fragility wasn’t weakness; it was the first draft of resilience") to deliver its message, violating the "show, don't tell" principle. The theme is presented as a solved thesis rather than an emergent question, leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of forgiveness through revision is coherent, but the story tends to explicitly state its thesis ("transmuting law into plea," "not to overthrow, but to absolve"). This didactic approach flattens the subtext, leaving little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of resonance and memory is coherent and poetic, but the narrative explicates its thesis directly ("Echoes were echoes because...") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. The emotional logic is sound, but the moral conclusion is delivered as a stated lesson rather than an earned experience.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of salvaging connection from tragedy is cohesive and resonant, anchored by the central metaphor, though the "ripples" ending leans slightly toward sentimental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is over-articulated through direct narrator statements (“She had learned long ago that beauty often lived beneath notice”) rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story relies on telling the reader what to feel ("demure audacity") rather than evoking the resonance through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is explicitly preached rather than subtextually developed ("Truth is not found. It is dug"). The ending suffers from a severe Thematic Echo penalty, restating the thesis as a moral tag ("Truth didn’t hide. It rooted") which flattens the resonance into a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies on explicit sermonizing to convey its theme ("The new dawn wouldn’t be shaped by prophets..."), replacing dramatic enactment with authorial assertion. This explicit moralizing in the final paragraph flattens the subtext and resolves the narrative with a lecture rather than an earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is delivered explicitly via the narrator's assertions ("he understood his true motivation") and the final poem, leaving little room for subtext. The resonance is somewhat didactic, telling the reader exactly how to interpret the poet's life.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of harmony over force is coherent but hammered home with explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("reminded the world that even violence..."). This "thematic echo" flattens the subtext into a lecture, violating the show-don't-tell principle at the most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.7)
    The theme is explicitly preached in nearly every paragraph ("not conquest... but a patient revolution"), leaving no room for subtext. The narrative tells the reader exactly how to interpret the events, reducing the story to a didactic fable.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of repressed memory manifesting as physical danger is compelling, but the resolution is muddled by the contradictory final action (is the burden left in the tunnel or carried with her?). Additionally, the closing lines rely on didactic aphorisms ("Ignorance is armor") rather than earning resonance through image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of grace as a cooperative act ("a duet, not a solo") is beautifully integrated into the mechanical action. The story avoids preachy moralizing by grounding the spiritual insight in the physical mechanism of the music box. The final image of the heart beating "faithfully" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Elias's guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of translating organic memory into mechanical resonance is coherent and centers the story. However, the execution leans into sentimentality ("longing doesn't speak in binaries"), explicitly telling the reader how to interpret the emotion rather than letting the subtext emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of digital persistence and the "ghost in the machine" is explored with nuance, moving beyond tropes to a specific thesis about rhythm and cadence as memory. The ending reweights the entire narrative, shifting the archive from a "mausoleum" to a living, humming ecosystem, offering a profound, non-literal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story relies on explicit sermonizing, directly stating its thesis ("peace... was the presence of choice") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action. The heavy-handed moralizing in the final paragraphs flattens potential nuance into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of endings as thresholds is developed coherently through the parasol imagery and the glacier's collapse. The resolution successfully recontextualizes the protagonist's obsession without resorting to a simple moral, offering a resonant conceptual repricing of death.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through dialogue ("Destined mismatches... aren’t tragedies") and narration, leaving little room for subtext. The story functions as a parable that states its moral clearly, violating the "show, don't tell" principle regarding thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of preservation through silence is coherent but delivered didactically, particularly via the prophet's quoted maxim ("Wisdom does not shout"). The narrative illustrates the theme literally rather than exploring it through narrative tension or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial sermonizing ("This was her devotion: collective healing... not as a slogan") rather than emerging from action. The final sentence functions as a moral summary, flattening potential resonance into a stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the final lines ("The pattern was not in the past. It was in the pause" and "that... is where growth begins"), collapsing subtext into a sermon. This didactic approach prevents the reader from participating in the meaning-making.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of ephemeral memory is strong, but the text tends to explicitly state its thesis ("The prophet’s curse was this...") rather than letting it emerge solely from action. Terms like "grief's echo" and "vector of nostalgia" abstract the emotion rather than grounding it.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered didactically, particularly through the mentor’s explicit thesis statement and the narrator’s final summary ("not caged... but honored"). The resonance relies more on these assertions than on the subtext of the action itself.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("She understood then: reunification was not about wholeness restored..."). The story tells the reader exactly what to feel and think, lacking subtext or ambiguity. It reads as an instructional moral rather than a dramatized experience.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of integrating absence ("shadows as partners") rather than erasing it is resonant and provides a satisfying intellectual resolution. The narrative successfully pivots from a breakage of physics to a restoration of balance, though the emotional resonance is dampened by the summary mode.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized through the narrator's commentary ("yearned not for vengeance... but for the quiet architecture of redemption") rather than emerging from subtext. This over-articulation explains the moral weight of every action, leaving no room for ambiguity or reader interpretation. The result is a didactic fable rather than an organic narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is hammered home via a repetitive "not X, but Y" rhetorical structure used over eight times (e.g., "not to curse... but to learn," "not conquest... but polishing"). This excessive repetition turns potential subtext into an overt sermon, flattening the narrative's complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=3.6)
    Subtext is replaced by explicit moralizing ("She was becoming," "Hold light even when you're breaking"), turning the story into a sermon rather than an experience.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is resonant but articulated too explicitly in the narrative ("she understood: to collect... was not an act of preservation, but of release"). This "thematic echo" flattens the subtext, explaining the epiphany to the reader rather than letting it emerge solely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through didactic comparisons (calendars vs. alignment) and explicit summary ("She had not resurrected the past..."), lacking the ambiguity and subtext required for high-level fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of "revelation over transformation"—valuing the discarded and the slow over the flash—is resonant and clearly developed. However, the text relies on exposition to articulate this theme ("This was alchemy not of transformation, but of revelation") rather than trusting the ritual's imagery to convey the subtext alone.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than dramatized, relying on thesis statements like "He believed wonder was a nutrient" to convey meaning. This over-articulation reduces subtext, turning the story into a parable that lectures the reader on the value of wonder instead of evoking it through action. The ending reinforces this didactic quality with a moralizing summary about "the thirsty, the lost."

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of crystallizing grief to make it bearable is consistently developed through the central metaphor. While the narrative occasionally drifts into explicit moralizing ("Calcify was the word... not destroy"), the final image of the locket resonates with the established premise.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit summation rather than subtext. Phrases like "That was the lesson: not to fear the fall, but to honor the arc" and "She wasn’t making a memorial. She was making a vessel" explain the story's meaning directly to the reader, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story commits a significant error by explicitly writing its theme on the note in the final beat ("You were never meant to fix the past — only to frame it"). This reduces subtext to text and turns the ending into a moral lesson, flattening the resonance of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than dramatized, culminating in a literal equation ("H = Σ...") that reduces subtext to arithmetic. The final paragraphs explain the story's meaning ("Hope wasn't a destination...") instead of allowing the imagery to resonate, triggering the penalty for moralizing endings.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transforming loss into a new form of peace is coherent and sustained. However, the ending overly articulates the thesis (&quot;Not because... But because...&quot;), explaining the meaning to the reader rather than letting the resonance of the final image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed "telling" ("realization settled: the lies weren't built to deceive..."). The insight feels like a sermon rather than an organic discovery arising from the drama of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but heavily articulated through explicit dialogue ("I'm collecting hands") rather than subtextual action. This "Thematic Echo" at the climax flattens resonance by stating the story's thesis directly in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is heavily explicated through narration ("To understand the geography of healing meant charting..."). The story interprets itself for the reader, leaving little room for subtext or ambiguity. The philosophical weight is asserted rather than emerging organically from action.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with didactic heaviness ("Beauty was not luxury. It was oxygen."). The story relies on explicit statements of meaning rather than allowing subtext to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("Scars can sing," "Not to fix... but to listen") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending relies on moralizing summary to synthesize the concept, reducing interpretative depth.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is delivered through didactic assertion rather than subtext ("Forgetting was not fate but failure"; "Liberation was not hers to claim; it was hers to enable"). The story tells the reader exactly how to interpret the events, flattening the nuance of the memory/trauma dynamic into a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but undermined by explicit sermonizing in the final paragraph ("You are seen... You do not need to burn to be bright"). This direct address dissolves subtext and reduces the ending to a moral statement rather than a resonant narrative image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is coherent but suffers from explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("grief was not a void..."), which deflates the subtextual tension. The ending explains the meaning of the story to the reader rather than allowing the resonance to emerge organically from the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through the wife's note ("Let the pendulum pause... to let grace enter"), which violates the show-don't-tell principle and flattens the subtext. This "Thematic Echo" reduces the ending's resonance to a stated moral rather than an emergent realization.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shift from "soothing" to "stirring" offers a strong thematic resolution. However, the story explicitly articulates its thesis ("Intentions were not destinations... but gestures") in a realization paragraph, a "Thematic Echo" that explains the subtext rather than letting the final image carry the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story relies heavily on explicit thesis statements (e.g., "The future, she learned, is not conquered but coaxed") to convey its theme. While the central idea is coherent, it is delivered through exposition rather than emerging organically from dramatic action or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of resurrection through memory and art is cohesive and poignant. The "dust remembering" concept resonates well, though the execution tilts toward sentimentality in the final beats ("thistled calm," "tears as catalyst").

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit narrator assertion ("Patrons call it haunting. She calls it honesty," "The world offers the mirage of safety... but she knows better") rather than emerging organically from action. This didactic approach flattens subtext and reduces the reader's role in interpreting the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but overly didactic, with the narrative explicitly stating the subtext ("One narrative said progress... the other..."). The ending juxtaposes the two philosophies clearly, but the lack of ambiguity or organic emergence makes it feel like a thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Hatred... thrived in cacophony; harmony required subtraction") rather than emerging organically from the drama. This didactic approach collapses subtext, treating the story as a vehicle for a thesis statement rather than an exploration of ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of "gentle rebellion" is coherent but heavily explicated through direct telling ("That was the point," "rebellion doesn't always shout"). The ending relies on summarizing the moral for the reader rather than letting the resonance emerge organically from the imagery, limiting the subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central theme of adaptation and wonder is resonant, and the "bees as capacitors" image embodies it well. However, the dialogue drifts into explicit sermonizing ("Wonder isn't meant to be explained..."), which functions as a Thematic Echo penalty, stating the subtext aloud rather than letting the image carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is delivered through didactic narration ("Not to preserve, but to honor") rather than emerging organically from the action. The text explains the meaning of the ritual to the reader instead of allowing it to resonate through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is delivered didactically through explicit thesis statements ("We chose fluidity over fortress") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story lectures the reader on nuance instead of allowing the ambiguity to breathe within the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of probability and the texture of "what if" resonates well. The ending avoids a tidy moral, instead offering a complex acceptance of the unlived path, fitting the "grim optimist" persona.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit assertions ("The kindness was the signature," "The brush remembered") rather than emerging organically from subtext or complex interaction. This heavy-handedness reduces the narrative to a sentimental fable where the moral is preached rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered explicitly in the final dialogue ("We are not preserving art. We are becoming it."), triggering the penalty for Thematic Echo in the final paragraph. This sermonizing undercuts the subtext, reducing the resonance of the otherwise strong "bread as archive" motif.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of defying entropy is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, culminating in the explicit declaration "This was rebellion." The resolution offers a simplistic fix to complex suffering (erasing droughts), lacking the moral complexity expected of a story tackling fate and time.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue multiple times ("Fear is not your enemy," "Fear’s weakness is being seen"), which eliminates subtext. This didactic "thematic echo" reduces the narrative to a fable with a stated moral rather than an explored experience.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of turning obstacles into instruments is coherent and resolves the conflict. However, it is stated explicitly in the narration ("His motivation was... to turn obstacles into instruments") rather than emerging solely through subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of communication as a weapon against indifference is resonant and well-developed through the "pattern language" motif. The distinction between a plea and a challenge adds depth to the ending. The subtext of the city's willful forgetting versus her need to remember is handled with sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing and internal lectures ("Noble lies... are the mortar of memory"). The ending dissolves into a direct rhetorical address to the reader ("What story are you preserving?"), violating the "show, don't preach" standard.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of "witnessed absence" is coherent and resonant, landing well at the closure. However, the text tends to explicate its themes ("not as loss, but as layered silence") rather than letting them emerge solely from action. The final image of the refilled inkwell successfully integrates the concept with the character's ongoing duty.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is over-articulated through aphoristic summary ("Truth, she knew, rarely roared—it seeped") rather than emerging organically from action. The narrative explicitly tells the reader the moral import of the indexer's actions, which flattens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of transforming grief is coherent, but the text frequently explicates its own meaning (e.g., "grief and grace share the same breath," "luminous torment") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. This didactic tendency softens the resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central concept of "unused potential" acting as a physical resource is executed with high conceptual integrity. The ending resonates deeply, reframing the grief not as a loss to be accepted but as a location to be visited.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("It was never out there... It was in the pull") and summary ("The belonging wasn't a signal..."), removing interpretative space. This overt moralizing creates a "Thematic Echo" effect that flattens resonance into a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme is coherent but heavily over-articulated, with the narrative explicitly explaining its own metaphors ("This was how the hush worked... not silence, but sieved hush"). The ending pivots to direct moralizing ("understanding... was the only compass that didn’t lie"), reducing the subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit aphorisms ("peace is never signed in ink," "recycle mistakes into wisdom") that act as moral summaries. This didactic approach replaces subtextual resonance with lecture, flattening the complexity of the reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("She wasn't broken anymore. She was becoming") and sentimental platitudes ("stars don't judge your mistakes"). Subtext is displaced by text that explains the lesson directly to the reader, flattening the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of choice and the persistence of the past is resonant, particularly in the final image of the fractal ripples. However, the thematic delivery is often didactic and heavy-handed, relying on explicit antitheses ("Redemption implied worth... It was simpler") rather than allowing the subtext to breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story suffers from heavy-handed thematic echoes, explicitly stating its meaning ("death was merely a dialect," "The end was never the point"). The final paragraphs sermonize rather than letting the subtext resonate through the imagery. Subtext is flattened by the narrator explaining the significance of every action.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme is articulated through explicit statements ("for to understand time’s theft was to court despair," "not to punish, but to transmute") rather than emerging organically. This sermonizing tendency creates distance and explains the subtext to the reader instead of letting it resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of integrating darkness to achieve wholeness is coherent and clearly developed. However, the explicit articulation of the lesson ("carry me like a wing") leans towards a moralizing summary, stating the subtext rather than letting the resonant image of the tear do the heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit narration and on-the-nose declarations ("fear was a luxury," "spelled nothing and everything: HERE. NOW. YOU.") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The reliance on explaining the magical mechanics diminishes the potential for genuine thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of "silent revolution" is coherent but delivered through didactic exposition ("referring not to fire, but to...") rather than emergent subtext. The concept is poetic but remains abstract, asserting resonance instead of earning it through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of swapping control for alignment ("harnessing wonder") is coherent and lands cleanly at the end. The "sacred math" and "geometry as scripture" motifs are functional but lean slightly toward generic mystic tropes without deeper subversion.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The themes of censorship and memory are strong, but the story tends to explicate them ("To rarefy was to refine pain...") rather than letting them emerge solely from action. The ending resonates, but the path there feels occasionally didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of intellectual harmony is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("Overture wasn't music for ears, but for minds") rather than subtext. The result is a fable-like clarity that feels slightly sermonizing rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("Burn a mind? That’s the real crime," "Bloom where they think nothing can") rather than subtext. The result is a coherent but moralizing narrative that lacks ambiguity or interpretive depth.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of art reshaping reality is legible but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("emotion conducted physics... more reliably than equations"). The tidy, happy ending flattens the potential for thematic complexity regarding grief or the dangers of altering time.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of memory preservation via "empirical whimsy" is tightly woven into the mechanics of the story. The final image of the seed becoming a "living library" offers a resonant answer to the central problem of fragility, balancing the loss of the seed with the gain of permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but heavily explicated through dialogue ("Apologies don't need voices") and narrative summary ("redistributed its weight"). This explicit moralizing near the end limits resonance by telling the reader what to feel.

    Theme emerges from the refusal to name magic, insisting instead on pattern and listening; the final parchment is a non-literal answer to how humans endure insignificance—by composing an unheard symphony of shared solitude.

    <question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person intimate voice sustains a stellar-navigation lexicon—”star-pierced twilight,” “low-frequency cello”—that feels native to Elira’s trained perception. Compression is purposeful: “She didn’t solve the tile’s mystery that night. She didn’t need to” teaches the reader to accept lyric ellipsis. Rhythm modulates from long, wave-like sentences to staccato fragments (“She understood then: the magic wasn’t in the object, but in the entanglement”) that accelerate the epiphany. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains anchored in her calloused palms and salt taste.

Subtext operates in gesture—the open notebook as silent treaty—allowing plausible counter-readings (some may view the act as surrender, others as liberation).

Ambiguity lingers: is she vessel or conduit?

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges without slogan: language as living organism that outgrows regulation. Recurring vegetative imagery (tendrils, dew-grammar) reconfigures meaning at end when the garden itself becomes an unreadable text the state cannot tax.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: diagonal movement, salt-scented cathedral, coins as variables. No moral is stated; the final image of remaining constellations reweights prior material without abstraction. Subtext lives in gestures—the untouched bishop, the whispered birth year—never explained.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through negative space: absence (gaps, silence, banned lullabies) births the cosmic verse. No moralizing; the final invitation—“you must first learn to fall into the gaps”—is offered as stance, not sermon. Resonance lingers because the body, not argument, carries the proof.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges entirely through image and action: the shift from mapping absence to becoming part of it. Subtext is carried in silence—the unreadable negative, the unburned diary pages—so meaning accrues by what refuses articulation.

No moralizing; the reader is left with the physical after-echo of stone breathing, not a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through the inversion of altar-offering: grain becomes ink, gods become witnesses, negotiator becomes priest.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges inductively from puppet inversion rather than thesis statement; final line “the story wasn’t over. It was just finally being told right” reweights earlier manuscripts-turned-marionette without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from the spiral’s deliberate entropy: memory is only honored once it is surrendered. The moth wing reweights from relic to sacrament; the monarch’s landing reweights migration as benediction.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without thesis: preservation is re-cast as surrender—only by relinquishing possession can memory survive. The helix’s future encounter with deer and children reframes the question from “who remembers?” to “whose throat will the bronze warm next?”—a conceptual repricing that lingers. No moral is stated; the aurora’s fading benediction is allowed to remain ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars: “encrypted devotion” is not named but enacted through etched numerals, chalk lattices, and the ledger entry “Confirmed.” The final image—rulers will sit atop a vibration they never hear—conceptually reweights ambition vs. attention without moralizing. No symbolic convenience; the magic square’s uselessness to merchants is shown earlier, so the ending reprise feels inevitable. Ambiguity lingers: is the frequency divine or statistical? The story lets the contradiction stand.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—resentment must be re-membered, not argued away—emerges through image of broken pin and final marrow-hum, never stated as thesis.

Avoids sermon; ambiguity (will it work for others?) lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Emergent theme: creation demands ingestion of the very thing one pursues—freedom traded for permanence. Subtext rests in the sextant’s brokenness (failed navigation) repurposed into a compass for liminal space, and in the orchard’s blossoms returning only where prismatic light touches, hinting that art’s beauty is collateral damage.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from action: absence is a thread to be rewoven, not a void to fear. Final ledger line “pauses waiting for hands” offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Image of door vanishing because no longer needed reweights prior fables into structural utility.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through motif cluster: tide cycles, cicada metamorphosis, starlight shards—each image of transition re-priced in final “tide turned.” No explicit thesis; meaning accrues via sensory particulars.

Final image answers thematic question non-literally: love survives not by solution but by shared threshold vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: engineered silence = control; wild silence = nourishment. Subtext is carried in gesture (lips brushing doll) and sensory reversal (sound → taste). Final image re-prices prior motifs—doll sprouting gold threads redefines “security” as organic, not welded. No moralizing sentence mars the exit. Complexity lingers: reader can’t tell if sky garden is utopia or afterlife, yet the child’s stance is final.

    Theme of ascent-as-memory, not conquest, emerges through concrete imagery (stair of frozen moments) rather than thesis. Final reconfiguration—“wisdom and adventure must walk hand in hand”—is implied by her relinquishment of relic and dominion; no moralizing paragraph. Subtext carries in objects: throne woven from “unsent letters” reframes power as archived regret. Ambiguity lingers: which timeline now holds her? Complexity preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges as the paradox of suffocation as genesis: only by stopping the fight for air does the throat remember its shape. Subtext resides in objects—the knocker’s fall is an unspoken absolution, the lanterns’ dormancy a latent future she will not light. No moralizing; the final line reframes the entire curriculum without stating it. The emotional aftereffect is concrete: the reader exhales involuntarily, lungs reminded of their own shape.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: silence as both oppressor and revealer. The Golden Silence policy is undone by the silence she cultivates in herself. Final image—woman walking toward the hollow heir—reweights every prior sepia tone into coronation gold. No moralizing; the cylinder’s cracked parchment voice is the only sermon needed.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges without dictation: possibility as living grammar versus fixed stars. Marionette program literalizes the critique of pre-written destinies; its blank final page Conceptually Reprices the entire war of whispering treaties. No moralizing; final laugh is sonic image of thaw, not lesson. Subtextual tension between control and surrender is played out in joint anatomy and root tendrils.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from the accumulating particulars—dust, button, handprints—not from thesis statements; final image of “light doing the explaining” is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (switching lights off) and silence (supervisor’s coffee offering). The tension between archival rigor and tender retrieval is never resolved into platitudes, leaving plausible ambiguity about how much kindness can offset systemic loss. No thematic echo or final-paragraph sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete reversal: lullabies of obedience become lullabies of rebellion; the image of children humming resistance is earned by the broadcast, not asserted. No final moral—just the Ace of Keys card—lets the reader reprice what “coded freedom” will cost the city.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges as “some silences must be composed, not merely kept.” The lullaby fragment, prism shards, and dew-drop lens form a sparse but coherent image-set that reweights meaning at the end. Subtext lives in gesture: saxophone lowered “like a sleeping child” equates music with mercy killing. No moralizing—insight is the empty arch where color used to hang.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges as “the past is perpetually unfolding, asking only to be seen.” No moralizing; the final image of humming towers of light reconfigures exile into communion. Subtext lives in silence: the hush where past meets prophecy is never labeled, only enacted. The baker’s burnt loaf and soldier’s apology carry irreducible specificity, resisting tidy universals.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from Elias’s tactile struggle with broken timepieces; the admiral’s journal reframes planning as anchor, wind as freedom. Final image of steering by not-yet-born stars reweights earlier clock-fixing obsession without moralizing. Subtext resides in object handling—watch sinking, compass warming—rather than exposition. Ambiguity lingers, inviting reread.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from the kintsugi metaphor made literal: fracture as sacred architecture, not flaw. The final image—golden seam on cold iron—offers a non-literal answer: redemption is not erasure but gilded breakage. No thematic statement is pronounced; the dust motes carry the concept. Ambiguity lingers: she is “truer,” not healed, honoring complexity without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges without thesis: laughter as sorrow’s sibling is never asserted, only demonstrated when a ghost-boy’s snort cracks the air like a dropped plate. Final image downstream (child’s giggle) offers non-literal answer to the thematic question—healing is sonic, not moral. Subtext in silence: ghosts never speak until the woman whispers “silly again,” making gratitude a hush. Resists tidy moral; complexity lingers in luminous ache.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the iterative inversion of torture-math into mercy-topology; no abstract thesis is stated until the final image reweights the concept. Subtext resides in gesture—strap coiled, strap released—rather than exposition. The forest’s shift from violet to indigo to blue is a silent, non-literal answer to the interrogator’s sneering question. Avoids sermon by keeping insight embedded in the sensory reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without slogan: erased histories survive as sensory residue (apron scent, driftwood dolls, tide-pattern sign language) rather than archival fact. The final image of the translator tucking a child’s crayon door beside the birds reweights her vocation from retrieval to hope-propagation—an answer articulated in gesture, not thesis. Subtext lives in silence: the historian’s quiet weep and the lens’s dimming do the moral work. No character verbalizes the moral; insight stays particular and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of custodial attention emerges through concrete ritual: noticing dust, archiving remnants, closing door. Child’s drawing + pearl button re-circulate as silent plea against erasure; final image of “C_R_U_” marquee half-dream reweights neglect into vigil. No moralizing—meaning stays implicit, earned by tactile choices.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges: chaos as midwife to meaning. No moralizing; final smile and shelved moment reweight prior equilibrium as sterile. Frost pattern, whisper, and glitched shelves form a small returning set that shifts from warning to invitation. Resonance lingers in the image of “beautifully broken” archive—ambiguity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from negative space itself: silence, erasure, and the refusal to reflect become the only viable utopia. The shard’s ghost-letters carry a pre-greed syntax, but the story resists nostalgia by making translation an act of mourning, not restoration. Final image reweights prior material—unfinished songs as wealth—without moralizing. Complexity holds: the revolution was neither wrong nor right; it was simply speaking the wrong language.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from concrete pattern: rust as revealer, not ruiner. The dancer’s re-formed arm of “condensed resonance” is the non-literal answer that reweights earlier images of wilt and bloom. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line leaves ambiguity—“another chance”—inviting reflection without sermon. Subtext resides in gesture (pressing chip to chest, closing lid gently) rather than assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through scent-as-memory rather than assertion; the closing eyelid image reweights “lost” as chosen burial without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is this transcendence or annihilation? The particulars invite both readings.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges via accreted image: nocturnal blooming as emblem of beauty choosing obscurity. Final postcard placement reconfigures the premise—she becomes one more hidden layer—without moralizing. The hymn older than cathedrals lands as Conceptual Repricing, felt not stated. Ambiguity lingers: surrender versus continuation, perfectly pitched.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges without sermon: archival practice itself becomes colonial when it refuses to feel. The diary’s “encrypted grief” reframes silence not as missing data but as ethical demand; the final oral tapestries replace report with reckoning, a resonant answer that reweights the concept of evidence. Magnolias burning, iron in the air—specific images carry the conceptual cost of a nation that archives bodies instead of justice.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without dictate: revival as reinvention rather than restoration is enacted through the literal growth of lanterns from cobblestones and the alchemist’s refusal to open the bottle. Subtext lives in gesture—the bottle passed, not opened—implying that memory must stay unfinished to remain generative. The final image of the bottle pulsing “in a child’s bedroom” re-weights the earlier “working memory made manifest” from private guilt to public engine. Only a whisper of moral creeps in the child-interview line; it is brief enough to escape heavy penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from pattern: archived emotion refuses containment; empathy must be re-infected, not stored. The orchard’s final exhale reweights the 1987 giggles from relic to live culture. No moralizing—just the image of a stranger’s smile charging the air. Subtext in Miko’s whispered doubt pays off as city-wide question answered by petal-mist.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from concrete reversal: entropy reversed not by force but by elegiac consent. Subtext lives in gesture—barefoot cracks equal “lips parting after decades of silence.” Final image offers non-literal answer: porous leaf = texture of borrowed time. No moralizing; complexity preserved in “harmony forged in the heart of unraveling.”

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from pattern, not assertion: listening > noise enacted in every beat—boot whispers, journal swell, bell sigh. The final toll reframes prior false dawn without moralizing. Subtext carries in rope’s dormant serpent imagery, ion alignments—never named as redemption yet felt. Minor docking for near-aphoristic “favor listening over noise” refrain, but it is embedded in sensor mechanics, not tacked summary.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of “flourishing stillness” emerges through the comet’s unwitnessed bloom and the janitor’s acceptance of erasure; no thesis is stated, only enacted. Subtext lives in gesture—lowering the glass, wiping tears with a patched tunic—showing vulnerability as strength. Final whispered gratitude reconfigures prior archive-rejection as sacred vocation, a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Resists moralizing; leaves reader in charged quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from concrete particularities: pollen dust, child’s charcoal sun, glass bees. No thesis statements; final glyphs speak a language “only silence could speak,” achieving Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers—gratitude equals continuation, not liberation—resisting moral tidy-up. Subtext carried in gesture: spectral fingers on honey-press neck.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—time accumulates, not passes—emerges through sensory images (dust, unread letters, balloon echo) rather than exposition. Final image of curated echoes offers non-literal answer with conceptual cost. Avoids preachiness; ambiguity lingers about whether restart is gift or burden.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: asymmetry > symmetry, loss as lift. The drake feather’s re-weighting (talisman → gift) performs the conceptual repricing without exposition. No moralizing; the final whispered line is an image, not a lesson. Subtext hums in the boy’s laugh “like a bell ringing over wet stone”—beauty discovered in the incomplete, heard but not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the copper’s patina and the diary’s weathering: legacy is a collaboration, not a monument. Subtext lives in silence—birds resume song, raccoons sniff the toolbox—showing respect reciprocated without anthropomorphism. The ending avoids sermon; the orchard’s hum is the only credo. Counter-readings (is this colonial manipulation of nature?) are plausible but enrich rather than dilute the moral texture.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—knowledge is emergent from convergence, not isolation—arises from the amber’s fate and the tower’s absorption, never preached. Final image reweights “chemistry” from molecular to metaphorical without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: misunderstanding is “the point.” No thematic echo penalty; no final-paragraph thesis. Subtext lives in the fly’s frozen transit mirroring her own.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges as the inverse of memorial: not stone but sprout, not permanence but persistent renewal. The text refuses to state this; instead, firethorn and weepwillow re-weight “peace” as something that must be renegotiated every dusk. Subtext lives in silence—between heron cry and Lydian reply, between locket rust and root reach—so the reader feels the ethical gamble: gardens can also be erased. The closing shawl of dusk offers no moral, only the conceptual repricing that memory’s job is never finished; that burden is the story’s austere mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory as renewable energy, resurrection via vibration rather than flesh. Subtext in gesture: the leaf’s glow is the only approval he still seeks. Final image reweights “wild hush” from wartime silence into communal listening silence, a non-literal answer to how the lost survive. No moral, only circuitry: grooves, leaf, lamplight, ear—an ethics of playback.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars: star-sketching as family ritual becomes a secular sacrament that redeems distortion into meaning. The final image reweights “true north” from ancestral moral to personal compass of curiosity. Subtext operates in silence—the echoed hush of the deck is the world’s paused heartbeat, and her quiet breathing answers it. No moral is stated; the sketchbook closing is the non-literal answer to “what anchors when time breaks?”

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the pattern of playful surrender: each swapped secret is a gift, not conquest, culminating in the sky invited “to play.” The blank sundial reweights earlier theft—knowledge is relinquished, not possessed. No moralizing line articulates the thesis; the gold dawn and whistled lullaby perform it. Ambiguity lingers: who will wrong the sky next?—a resonant aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the iterated absence of pawns and the archiving of gestures; no explicit thesis is stated. The final image of the board before the trembling sovereign reweights the premise: power is what the unnoticed have withheld. Subtext operates in silence—ring on wood, echo of dissolved chain. The luminous absence motif modulates from ghostly acoustics to political void without degenerating into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: home as resonance retrieved through synesthetic memory-work; the final image of the stone’s pulse quieting into lived language re-weights the entire motif chain, offering a non-literal answer that resists moralizing while leaving charged ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from pattern vs. silence: chess tactics = life traps; mending tapestry borders = mending marginalized lives. No explicit thesis; final image of rain “coaxing seeds” reweights the entire labyrinth as soil, not prison. Subtext in gesture—tracing fog instead of shattering glass—asserts acceptance over redemption. Avoids sermon; resonance lingers in “mistakes learned to breathe.”

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the refusal to feed coherence: “Truth lived in refraction.” No sermon—insight is earned through the child’s giggling echo and the spire’s grief-stricken face. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: dissolving mist carries smell of rain (renewal) and burnt sugar (sweet damage). Ambiguity lingers—was the spire god, prison, or monument?—inviting reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the kintsugi praxis itself—brokenness as revelation, not repair. No moralizing; the final image (golden aura pushing back acid) reweights prior wounds without statement. Subtext lives in gesture: fox charm silent at start, gleaming at end = question becomes answer. Complexity intact—wounds gilded, not erased.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of reflection vs. motion: cracked glass → painted wall → tide. Final re-pricing: “reflection wasn’t in glass, but in motion” crystallizes concept without moralizing. Shell left behind externalizes letting-go; no thematic echo sentences. Complexity preserved: beauty still ephemeral, but agency renewed.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: jasmine ghost, cork’s lightning scar, gull’s greeting—never abstract sermon. The final whispered thanks reconfigures the opening vow without stating a moral. Subtext lives in silence: captains stop mid-syllable, fists unclench; no dialogue spells out forgiveness. The only overt thematic articulation—“this was screaming tenderness”—is earned by sensory accrual and lands as image, not thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: navigation as artistry of absence, migration inverted from outward flight to inward seepage. Subtext lives in object gesture—censer foot remembers smoke—repurposing religious relics as cartographic instruments. The ending’s non-literal answer is the wind carrying coordinates to hollows, a conceptual repricing that loss itself can be mapped only by resonance, not recovery. No moralizing; the silence after the final line is the reader’s echo chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: safety is cultivated, not owned—truffles mute panic, relic blurs truth, but both must be released to let calm grow wild. The glass eye’s migration from pocket to tree hollow reweights its meaning from shield to seed, a conceptual repricing that answers the opening liability of truth. Subtext lives in gesture: the tremor of the seekers, the whisper “say it slant,” her silence becoming invitation. Final image of laughter that no longer triggers a sob is earned through the prior beats of softened neural edges.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of memory-as-inheritance emerges through concrete handling of objects rather than assertion; the Edelweiss shifts from clue to covenant without authorial comment.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: maps as exteriorized regret, doorway as self-reinvention. The sister vow reweights from guilt engine to redemption compass without overt thesis. Final image of glimmer-bearing ants reframes earlier solitude into legacy of guides—Conceptual Repricing with quiet social cost. Resists moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what new timeline costs others. No thematic echo penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges as the price of trading resonance for rule: starlight = memory, and the sky weeps what she buried. No moralizing—final image of fireflies clinging like living lace lets the reader feel the reparation without statement. Subtext in the weeping constellation and pawned crown carries the argument in objects.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from material metaphor: presence is a substance denser than gold, measurable in the moment of reciprocal touch. No moralizing; the final line’s “next equation” keeps question open while reweighting prior images (shell, ash, dew) into collaborative pigment. Subtext lives in shell warmth—guilt literally transferred without spoken absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: memory is not a refuge but a predator one must skin and tan into story. The scroll’s transformation from resistant bark to living skin reconfigures the very premise of nostalgia without a moralizing sentence. Final image—“it has a shape. And a name. Mine.”—offers conceptual repricing that reweights every prior apparition.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges: presence > perfume, witness > remedy. Screw’s redefinition from tool to fulcrum re-prices birth pain into grace; final bow to pregnant couple externalizes the shift without moralizing. Fog-thinning reprise echoes occluded clarity motif, giving non-literal resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges solely through image-pattern: spiral/crescent/eye/root/breathe—no explicit thesis. Final CR reweights scars from shame to narrative waypoints without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence: tea untouched until victory sip, wind held then freed. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers—scars remain, now readable.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—“imperfect miracles” emerge through shared art and loss—arises from concrete particulars (the sour notes stay in the restored score). No final moralizing; the last image of the orchard “waiting” re-prunes meaning without commentary. Subtext carries in silence: neither embrace nor cry, only the hush. The shifted value of flaw over perfection is earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thesis—“meaning is negotiated”—emerges through action, not lecture; final coherence is image, not maxim. Recurrent hush evolves from atmospheric descriptor to ontological state, reweighting all prior noise. No moral; ambiguity lingers: is dissolution failure or apotheosis? Subtext carried by gesture (laying palms, smile of recognition) and silence itself. Earned wisdom: specificity of “unfinished sentences ever uttered in the dark” avoids abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—time as erosive absence—emerges through tactile ritual rather than thesis: steam sighs, frost gravel, key friction. The final “time isn’t lost, it’s waiting to be wound the other way” reconfigures prior imagery without moralizing. Repetition of “razor edges” and “surrender” accrues resonance, but occasional near-aphorisms (“clocks measure surrender”) flirt with echo penalty, keeping score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of permeable grief emerges through fungal anchors and diode re-pricing, never sermonized. Final image—motes feeding mycelium—offers non-literal answer: letting go is expansion, not loss. Ambiguity lingers (will Aris still detect breaches?), yet complexity is honored. One cliché shard—“world still held its breath”—softens punch.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the equation “risk without purpose = entropy”; the story refuses to state a moral, instead letting the clover and the lantern reweight the terms. Subtext operates in silence: father removes marker but presses clover—acknowledgment without words. “Clover melancholy” motif shifts from ache for paths not taken to green resilience of overlooked things, culminating in the final pressed clover. No sermonizing; the green-inked “Begin again” is action, not thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges as the paradox that genuine renewal requires deliberate misdirection—accidents curated so carefully they cease being accidents. Motifs (wrong numbers, looping disc, hum of streetlamps) reappear with reweighted meaning: what began as whimsical sabotage ends as existential protocol. The final image refuses moral summary; the operator’s smile is neither vindicated nor condemned, inviting the reader to decide whether self-imposed estrangement is liberation or infinite postponement. Subtext resides in gesture—spinning disc with thumb, jacks clicked home—never in exposition about “connection” or “grief.”

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: locket photo, walnut ink, salt-slick planks. No abstract thesis is stated; the final image of lanterns “trembling like fireflies” reweights prior material by implying the covenant survives only through such fragile, repeated tending. Subtext lives in gesture—soft click of locket, refusal to weep lest ink blur—inviting reflection on how remembrance is an act of delicate defiance. Avoids sentimentality by keeping insight tied to sensory work; ambiguity lingers about whether the covenant can truly hold against asphalt and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: symbols rearrange hearts only when surrendered to shared risk. Subtext lives in gesture—hand steadiness, velvet unwrap—rather than thesis statements. The final image of warmth transferred without magic reweights every prior rumor, offering resonant ambiguity rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: grief and joy as harmonics of one note, revealed through the shift from absorbing languages to composing them.

No moralizing; resonance is imagistic and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges phraselessly: history is grammar we can dance with. The final image of wet-clay time reweights every prior metaphor without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the tension between silence as lack and silence as plenitude; no character sermonizes the thesis. The empty camera reweights from prop to philosophical pivot without authorial nudge. Subtext lives in gesture: the fisherman’s ribs “feel” the music, translating concept to visceral event. Final image—“remembered by no one tomorrow… forever be felt”—offers resonant ambiguity rather than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory demands destruction-as-creation; fire as archive, ash as ink. Subtext whispers in negative space—every missing half-portrait implies civilization self-censoring to survive. Final lullaby of ash reconfigures arson from vandalism to curation, offering ambiguous mercy that avoids moralizing. The face in the tapestry literalizes ancestral recursion, making the personal political without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—borrowed belonging vs. self-authorship—emerges through the drumming motif shifting from desperate tic to collaborative creation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges inductively: silence as asymmetric power. Subtext in gesture—hand-off to Ruiz’s measured tread—speaks louder than accusation. Final line reweights “echo” from metaphor to material truth in steel canyons, resonant without moralizing. No thesis statement; concept repriced when reader realizes keyhole is ear, not door.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges without statement: darkness as audience, not enemy, taught by iterative star-glyphs. The dental mirror’s re-weighting—from stolen toy to soul-lens—embodies the concept that salvaged refuse can redirect fate. Final image (one true star unswallowed) non-literally answers the thematic question—value taught, not by sermon, but by refraction. No moralizing; resonance lingers in after-image of ladder-of-light.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from the accretion of lit chessboards and whispered moves: knowledge as living photosynthesis rather than performance. Final soil metaphor re-prices the premise—rebellion is humus, not heroic. No declarative thesis; subtext carried by image alone. Resists moral binaries: town’s scientists “mutter” yet the glow persists, leaving complexity intact.</answer>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Lyric-accumulative voice taught early (“weeping condensation…vaulted hush”) and sustained without scaffold. Syntax flexes from elongation to fragment (“amplified quiet.”) under pressure. Filter verbs purged; perception stays embodied. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; internal idiom remains distinct and soil-humble.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from iterated hollowing: grief remade into tolerable artifact. Final image reweights “Permitted” as quiet indictment of sanctioned erasure. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Subtext in ash = amnesty, combustion = cooperation—never stated, shown.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: sacred geometry becomes supple when paraphrased by mortal motion. The lake’s cracked throat and lantern-moth wings reweight “commandments into questions” without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: value lies not in fiery spectacle but in the quiet, cracked aftermath where collaboration redefines worth. The reed’s return as communal tuning fork reweights “bartered awakenings” from quaint trade to shared covenant. No moralizing final sentence—just the courtyard’s hum—lets the concept resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges as an audible after-image: connection is not data but residue that clings like braille. The final “golden shadows” reprice silence as saturated with human grain, offering no moral, only an irreversible sensory re-calibration that lingers beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the reframing of artificiality as sacred—“the meaning? That was real as bone”—without ever moralizing. The network of empty lockets and paper animals argues that constructed tenderness can outperform organic closure, a conceptual repricing that lands in the last crane. Subtext operates in silence: she never signs, never stays, never knows. The reader carries the haunted sense that invisible infrastructures of care might already surround them.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: post-collapse meaning is re-composed, not discovered. The phoenix-QR and chalk-meal equations particularize the idea; the visitor’s “remembering forward” offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No moral is stated; ambiguity lingers about whether the map changes anything. Subtext lives in the slow measuring of graffiti migrations—gesture as grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—memory as both wound and lifeline—emerges through the pagoda’s reversal of purpose: from preservation chamber to release valve. Subtext resides in the daughter’s silence, never explained, only juxtaposed with the civilization’s chosen muteness. The final image of embers drifting “like freed fireflies” reweights the opening metaphor: what was trapped becomes gift, not erasure. No moralizing line tells us forgetting is evil; the cost of holding on is dramatized in torn skin and extinguished light.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from pattern: hope survives by shape-shifting, not resistance. Subtext lives in gesture—stone against data-core housing is wordless argument against curated euphoria. Final image reweights earlier motif: “smoke from a hearth long thought cold” revalues the shadow as companion, not glitch. No moralizing; resonance is imagistic, bittersweet.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organistically: chameleon autotomy → institutional self-amputation → personal regrowth. No final-paragraph moral; instead, the glowing tail-tip silently answers the central question. Ambiguity remains—new sanctuary could still fail—but the image reweights “fragile convictions” without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from seed’s refusal to resurrect—continuation over closure—shown through vegetal memory and rewritten scar, never declared. Subtext in coffee rings and hourglass silence accumulates meaning without overt statement. Final spiral reweights prior motifs without moralizing, achieving CR. Ambiguity lingers: new power may cost further displacement, embracing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: unused love as material archive that demands witness, not ownership. Subtext lives in gesture—the trembling fingers, the whispered “Thank you”—never in exposition. The final marquee glitch literalizes the conceptual re-pricing without sermonizing. The moral ambiguity is preserved: release may wound descendants or glorify strangers; the gazer accepts that uncertainty as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the concrete—meteor paths, brass dials, frozen tears—never from abstraction. The final image reweights “stardust” from private nostalgia to public liberation without moralizing. Subtext hums in the silence after the songs are released: whose voices now fill the void she emptied? Ambiguity lingers, inviting reflection beyond the page. No thematic echo articulates the thesis; the story trusts its images.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of seeded possibility emerges implicitly through spheres of unlived worlds and the trembling clock-hand repricing stillness into potential. Subtext avoids moral statement, offering resonant ambiguity: silence broken into harmony without speech. Lullaby motif threads from movement rhythm to final "fractured lullaby," reweighted when petals pulse to clock-tick. Abstraction stays tethered to concrete objects, though emotional aftereffect is more cerebral than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from inversion: cognition as cartography, wilderness as internal. Final “frontier of his own becoming” reweights earlier metallic map imagery without moralizing. Subtextual tension between listener and witness positions is subtle but present. The conceptual repricing lands cleanly, satisfying the 9- gate for non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—courage as dormant reserve—emerges through found objects and star-punches, never sermonized. Subtext operates in silence: the absence of shouting townsfolk, the absent child, the unblown whistle. Final image reweights “unused” from shame to promise. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about whose courage is restored, creating honest resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the bolt itself: safety purchased by self-silencing becomes its own mausoleum. The final note re-prices the premise—sound now includes mortal risk, yet silence is “unpardonable.” Subtext lives in gesture: the bench sighs as it regains its bolt, wordlessly confessing years of theft. No moral is stated; the lingering resonance is the space between notes where safety and sacrifice coexist, fulfilling the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges as the inverse of power: sovereignty resides in refusal, not possession. The final line reweights every prior crown-reference without moralizing. Subtext of complicity—“they wept… for the years they bowed to a shadow”—is carried in collective gesture, not exposition. No thematic echo violations.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the percussion of loss and persistence: metamorphosis instead of extinction. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues through recurrent tapping that shifts from superstition to communion. Final image—“depth, rhythm, patience”—re-weights the fossil-fuel-ban era’s moral math: salvation through listening, not legislation. Ambiguity remains: humanity must slow to a 17-second metabolism, a price left resonant, not resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: remembrance as rebellion’s next form. Subtext lives in gesture—glasses lowered, palms flat, aria whispered—never explained. Final reconfiguration reweights rebellion from gunfire to shared listening; moral ambiguity intact. No thematic echo; resonance grows from stones’ silver script and communal exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme—destiny unchosen is no destiny—emerges through the dissolve-and-seed image rather than assertion. The embryo’s repricing from sacred relic to ambient potential reconfigures “implanted” into “invited,” a conceptual cost that lingers. No final-paragraph moralizing; the smile and creaking joints carry the aftereffect. Specificity of plant-script and obsidian keeps the insight anchored in lived particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the material act of stitching loss into new form; no explicit thesis is stated. The final image—crestRISEN self with parchment wings—reweights “fracture” as portal rather than wound. Rhetorical questions remain unanswered, letting silence pool as thematic residue. Complexity is honored: grief is neither cured nor transcended, reconfigured.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and rhythmically controlled: “shelves leaned like drunkards,” “salt-crusted windows admitted only slivers of bruised twilight.” Syntax mirrors perceptual distortion—long cadences stretch, then fracture into fragments. The POV never leaks; perceptual signature is consistent (“light bent around absence”). Elision (“she didn’t flinch”) is taught early and paid off when pain becomes resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges from vanishing ink = vanishing self; no moral stated, only the final reweighting. “Language written in absence” becomes the literal exit strategy, returning image reconfiguring meaning. Serene anger modulates into cosmic acceptance without sentimental uplift. Ambiguity lingers: mockery or mercy—both readings stay live.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges purely through image and event: archives as kindling, confession as contagion, love leveraged into leverage. No explicit thesis; the final “heartbeat” line is image, not moral. Subtext pulses in silence—citizens wake to “raw feeling,” not slogans. The reweighting is conceptual: vulnerability itself becomes the irreversible weapon, repricing truth from volume to resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: ballast sand as memory, roses as absorbers of grief, knife turned florist’s tool. No character articulates a thesis; even “continuity” is offered as answer to a question, not sermon. The conceptual repricing at the end—ashes into root space—reweights prior images without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence offered to refugees: tea brewed from hips, judgment withheld, lullabies at dawn. Ambiguity is preserved: pacifism is chosen daily, not sanctified, allowing counter-readings about privilege inside a dome.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges from sonic particulars: grief as tide that drowns logic, transliteration as survival, echoes as pilgrim light. No thematic statement—meaning accrues through spike’s migration from lure to shrine and the vowel “Aaaaah” that releases ownership. Final image offers non-literal answer: orbit of once-sleepwalkers around cracked iron reconfigures grief into caretaking. Avoids sentimentality; emotional aftereffect is awe, not comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without sermon: “orbits of regret” and “ellipses in official statements” rewire astronomical language into civic critique. Final image—smoke as dark thread—reprises the earlier “elliptical, inevitable” orbit but now re-priced as path rather than prison. Subtext carries in the journalist’s trembling silence and the unsigned ledger equation; no character states the moral. Ambiguity lingers: the city still sleeps, unaware, so the moral cost is felt, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges as the translation of sorrow rather than its erasure: grief must be legible to be endurable. The amber insect—once a frozen relic—reconfigures into living glyph, repricing silence from denial to witness. No explicit moralizing; the final lullaby is sung, not explained. The emotional aftereffect is the reader’s recognition that bearing another’s static is love’s real geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: meaning is not imposed but listened from patterns we create. Final rain-window image reprises mandala motif, re-pricing silence as generative. Ambiguity lingers—she smiles at off-key violin—inviting reader resonance beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the shifting valence of “mercy” rather than sermon. Subtext lives in gesture: handing over the shard = surrender of old jurisprudence. Final image reweights the concept without moralizing. The avoidance of tidy aphorism and the retention of moral ambiguity (aberrant mercy can still wound) give the piece lingering charge.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the motif of echo-as-seed: art’s afterlife is not performance but contagion of courage. The final sapling is a non-literal answer—nostalgia repurposed into forward growth—avoiding moralizing. Subtext resides in sensory cross-talk (scent of wet pavement + cinnamon) rather than thesis statements; the reader leaves with the after-image of ringing petals, not a slogan.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of translation versus possession emerges through fossil’s journey from relic to relay; ending reweights earlier solitude into communal resonance without moralizing. Subtext in thermal question—“Who remembers us?”—lingers unanswered, inviting reader to feel the cost of becoming medium.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without sermon: wisdom as communal mending, prophecy as unfinished cloth. Subtext lives in gesture—button spirals, jars at crossroads—avoiding abstract thesis statements. Final line reframes lightning-vs-stitching, re-weighting prior motifs with poetic compression. Ambiguity is purposeful; complexity holds, no tidy moral extracted.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of reclamation through surrender emerges organically from concrete beats; no statement of thesis. Final image—pillbox rusting into bluff bones—re-prices prior spy tropes into ecological time, a resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing, only implication. Micro-recurrence of “tilt of the earth” reweights from season to moral axis.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the accretion of sensory particulars: the impossibility of erasure versus the necessity of layering. The yarn needle literalizes ‘unpicking memory’ without sloganizing; the final nod reconfigures the promise as invitation, not fix. Ambiguity lingers—will she unstitch or reseal?—inviting reflection beyond the scene. No moralizing sentence mars the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through concrete recurrence of “softness versus stasis”: wax pooled but never sealed, clay coiled but never fired. The final image—light curling upward again—offers a Conceptual Repricing that redefines resistance as surrender, not fight. Subtext stays implicit; no character articulates the thesis, avoiding sermon. The notion that kindness is the only force that coheres time is earned through the bee-drinking beat and lantern glow, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: light as measured hope, barriers gauged not forced. The final rainbow-streaked alley reweights the lockmaster’s cryptic note without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence—she never names her brother’s death, only lets the smoke in her lungs speak. The refusal to heal the world, only to offer moments, sidesteps sentimentality and invites the reader to calibrate their own millimeters of hope.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
    <comment>Voice is lyric yet restrained: compressed syntax (“moonlight fractured into a dozen trembling beams”) mirrors the precise work of light-measurement. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices rust, petal-drift, and ridge-counts, never tourist vistas. No dialogue, so no register clash. Minor over-patterning of participle openers (“kneeling… feeling… pressing”) but the cadence teaches the oar-rhythm and pays off in the rowing simile.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges entirely through imagistic reconfiguration: echoes → loom, salt → ozone, coordinates of loss → coordinates of genesis. No character ever utters a thesis; instead, the sundial’s shifted shadow wordlessly reprices the moral calculus. Subtext lives in silence—she never mourns aloud—and in touch, as brass absorbs her whispered future like a vow. The final metallic tang offers a non-literal answer: extinction is not denied, it is repurposed into creation, leaving plausible ambiguity about what “might yet be” will demand of her.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges without statement: the sanctity of anonymous connection outweighs individual identity—a concept repriced when Aris becomes “the pause between heartbeats.” Subtext operates in gesture (visitors touching the spiral feel understood) rather than exposition. The final image offers a non-literal answer: belonging is not reunion with a person but diffusion into communal circuitry, a wisdom earned through specific particulars (folded names, paper birds) rather than platitude. No moralizing line intrudes; the only near-echo (“sacredly essential”) is voiced by setting, not narrator, preserving resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: salvation-as-weapon versus science-as-lullaby. Never stated—only enacted through waveform metaphors and the image of students weeping while hugging. The ethical calculus sharpens when calming the mob also alerts the predators, implicating her in future retaliation. Final whisper to static offers resonant, non-moral answer: vigilance is love’s price.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: space’s “right to bend” is dramatized first in the squeezing tunnel, last in the widened exit. The organ’s mournful chord progression becomes a sonic motif that reweights the idea of rebellion from chaos to compassion. Final image—Elara humming the organ tune while dawn breaks—offers a wistful, non-moralizing answer: liberation is gentle, not destructive. No thesis line, no tidy moral; resonance comes from the spatial reversal she embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the inverse of sight: only by surrendering the face can the women be truly seen. Subtext lives in tremor, salt-stiff cloth, and sealed glass—beauty preserved as wound. Final image of a faceless keeper and a faceless portrait offers non-literal answer: memory is the sole justice, and it hurts. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: erased histories (sailors, grandfather) demand cartographic resurrection; maps are memory, storms are grief. The copper nail’s quiet hum and the fresh journal’s first line enact the theme without stating it. No final-paragraph moralizing. The re-weighting is the golden sky-dawn being “rewound,” a conceptual repricing that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the accumulative motif of fragmented pardon: pixelated amnesty is never defined but enacted via the splintering glass and fluttering ribbons. The final image—shards carried upward—offers a non-literal answer: forgiveness is not whole but refracted, and “never” becomes a dawn-lit space rather than a verdict. No moral is stated; the insight is earned through sensory particulars. The concept’s resistance to tidy resolution gives the piece honest after-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: failure as performance art, collapse as curriculum. The foreign bills—once maps of escape—become tuition fees for new students; the circus train once a monument to entropy becomes a mobile academy. Final image of pocketing stray bills while smiling at “routes still unfolding” reweights prior heists into lesson plans, achieving Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing, only charged particulars that invite multiple readings of legacy, recursion, and redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges as the inversion of archive into redistribution; no moral is stated, only enacted. The daylily’s reprise embodies the conceptual shift—from ephemeral capture to perpetual re-gifting—rendering the final image a non-literal answer: grief becomes meteor showers of mercy. Subtext resides in silence after the song; the reader feels the open-ended communal contract rather than being told it.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges from pattern: vows buried by bureaucracy sprout again through vegetal nervous system. Subtext in “dreams are private” lie vs. scar-threads that make dreams communal property. Final cobalt helix visually answers the thematic question—privacy disintegrates into shared rootwork. No moralizing; resonance lingers in afterimage of collective dreaming.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the tension between carving and weaving destinies; the final image of intertwined roots offers a non-literal answer that reweights both positions without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: the wrist-touch anchors, not soothes. No thematic echo; the orchard’s collaboration is shown, not asserted. Complexity remains: neither stance is fully vindicated, yet both are changed.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the inverse relation between measurement and meaning: the more data he amasses, the less he hears. Final image (“What’s broken still carries song”) is a CR that reweights every prior appraisal sheet without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—pocketing cloth near heart—never in assertion. Echo valley becomes metaphor yet stays geological; double resonance feels inevitable, not grafted.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges entirely through image and syntax—cuneiform becomes living circuitry, silence becomes script—never named. The final bow reweights all prior knowledge quests as acts of reverence, not mastery, achieving Conceptual Repricing without a moral. Subtext is carved into gesture: letting the seed write its own sign is the anti-colonial argument. No platitudes, no final-paragraph thesis; resonance is pure after-image.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: wonder is not hoarded but molted, migrated, re-found. The creel’s transformation from fish-holder to glyph-cage is the concrete particular that reweights “preservation” as metamorphosis. Contradictions (joy/grief, loss/archiving) are not moralized but enacted in the baptismal pool. Final image—atrium sighing as cathedral of salt and starlight—offers resonant, non-literal answer: the keeper must become the tide.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges without abstraction: isolation as the true apocalypse is enacted, not declared. The final image—glowing caves and glowing self—offers a non-literal answer: connection is not harvested but reflected back at the cost of privacy. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling, crowning) and object state change (empty shell). No closing moral; resonance arises from the sensory reprise of light in stone and skin, re-weighting earlier “latent radiance” as lived burden rather than metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from ivy-as-archive and bellows-as-regret: pain must be read, not solved. Final reconfiguration (no train, no note) rejects redemption narrative—self-forgiveness is ongoing flow, not arrival. Subtext in ivy indexing screams and echo-duration as guilt half-life avoids moral statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers in “dirge only she could hear.”

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: the unsaid is not hidden but recursively generative, each seeker becoming the medium that preserves what they sought to release. The mirror-identity image reweights the premise—ownership of silence is indistinguishable from being consumed by it. No moralizing; the final silence-shaped glyph is resonance, not lesson. Complexity is honored: the library is both sanctuary and trap, and the story refuses to pronounce which is “right.”

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of provenance: artifacts return to living matter, history germinates rather than testifies. No explicit moral—final image of bluebell sprouting from Chancellor knee carries the reweighting. Subtext of “perforated destiny” is paid off when holes become seed pockets, not abstract slogan. Slight overstatement: “mulberry ache” and “gilded cage” flirt with lyric cliché, but the specificity of ice-coated seeds rescues freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: consciousness at the vanishing point is worth eternal drift. Subtext lives in gesture—brush-stroke as secular absolution, chip as reliquary of awe. The final lantern image conceptually re-prices death from ending to perpetual witness, avoiding sermon. Ambiguity is purposeful; reader must decide whether this is transcendence or denial. No thematic echo; resonance arises from concrete particulars (moonpetal oil, sky-glass cradle).

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges as the daily, invisible cycle of rebirth through forgiveness; no moral is stated—final image of ember-glow contentment reweights all prior grief. Subtext lives in gesture: hairpin moved from velvet to hair = betrayal metabolized into service. Ambiguity remains—she may still ache—but the reconfiguration is undeniable. One soft echo: “vineyard hush” is repeated instead of evolved.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the shifting mirror reflection: polished negotiator → hollow ghost → trembling woman. No moral stated; the seashell’s iridescence is the non-literal answer—beauty born from abrasion. “Protected vulnerability” is enacted, not named. Final question to clients (“What if the right choice leaves room for doubt?”) reweights prior contracts with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from withheld physics: absence as fullest presence. Subtext in silence: Elira’s unsaid “I will never re-age with you” hurts more than confession. Final image of static star-filled pond reconfigures prior stone-throw without moralizing. Resists binaries: neither escape nor arrival is pure; complexity earned through pattern rather than assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: guidance is mirrored stillness, not chased motion. Motif of listening versus running recurs through marrow, dust, wingbeats; final image of surrender-as-direction reweights all prior flight patterns without stating a moral. Ambiguity is purposeful—readers must decide whether stasis is transcendence or eternal prison—yielding concrete after-effect of hush and awe.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges without statement: automation sterilizes wonder, and wonder survives only in handmade, flawed offerings. The keystone-tree sequence reconfigures “sacred” from spectacle to off-key lullaby, a non-literal answer embedded in the final image of windowsill charms. No moralizing—just the re-pricing of magic itself.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—vows outlive flesh and shape perception—emerges through concrete ledger entries and final color-sound fusion; never stated as thesis. Subtext operates in key misrecognition (hotel vs. vow-room) and his leaving the book: knowledge as communal lantern. Ambiguity lingers: is color-sound synesthesia or transcendence? No final-paragraph moralizing; last image is action (walking unlit pier). Woman’s golden-edge sorrow hints at love vowed yet unfulfilled—readers free to imagine stakes. Insight earned through sensory ordeal, not abstraction. Resonance amplified by mirrored sky lanterns / submerged ink light. Avoids tidy binaries: keeper vs. seeker roles blur.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges as resonance > randomness, distilled through tactile relics rather than stated. Final line’s “echo that outlasts the song” reweights every prior surrender without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: child-laughter in vacuum stays unexplained, inviting counter-readings. One near-theme-echo (“You’re not waiting for meaning. You’re distilling it.”) is earned by vision-shock.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement:命名剥夺匿名性，从而削弱恐怖—naming defangs terror by making it specific and shared. Subtext operates in the act of renaming "Whirlpool-Eyed Horror" into "Mira, who swallowed screams so others might sleep," turning predator into protector. Final image answers the thematic question—how to live with unending grief—by reframing service to others as the only viable stasis. No moral is declared; resonance is purely imagistic and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: devotion measured in droplets, not decibels; balance bought by surrender, not conquest. The bell’s silence-turned-echo reconfigures meaning—what was broken becomes conduit, not symbol. No moralizing; the fish’s question-mark arc is the only answer offered. Subtext resides in the mage’s barefoot retreat: having touched the ledger, he now treads lighter, forever accountable.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of “expunge” into communal archive; no character states “memory is resistance”—it is performed. Subtext lives in silence: no one cries, no one shouts, authority retreats wordlessly. The final non-literal answer is that a bureaucrat becomes the town’s new wind chime—quiet but present. Emotional after-effect is hush of awe, not sentimental tearjerking; complexity preserved because state power is checked, not defeated.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars: the starlings’ murmuration literalizes the alchemical spiral, letting image carry thesis. Subtext resides in the blot-tear beside the formula—no need to name the theme. Final image recharges earlier motifs without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: wonder is neither victorious nor defeated but metabolized into method.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges entirely through image pattern: silence shifts from absence to medium, revision from moral compromise to communal mercy. The parachute buckle migrates from memory anchor to musical instrument to vow—its final click is the non-literal answer to “how do you carry responsibility?” No explicit thesis, yet the reader re-weights silence itself as communal glue. Resonance lingers in the after-echo of the chime; no sentimental assertion, only reconfigured perception.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the duplicate’s question “I do not want to inherit your pain” and Kael’s answer: identity as question, not possession. No thematic statement is imposed; the concept of complementary opposites is lived through the harmonized contradictions. Final image reweights prior motifs: the jar that once imprisoned now births, and numbness shatters into “aliveness,” not “life.” Ambiguity lingers—ownership is refused yet connection remains—without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges obliquely: beauty-through-rot, innovation-as-patience. No character sermonizes; the journal’s final line is a crystallized stance, not a moral. The seed’s “never meant to flower” re-prices the entire escapist enterprise, leaving the reader with an after-image of dedication to unborn potential. Ambiguity lingers—was the obsession wisdom or delusion—without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: grief transmuted into resonance rather than closure; no moral is preached. The reprise of “after the final grain slips” reframes hourglass from terminus to echo-generator, a conceptual repricing that reweights time itself. Subtext lives in gesture—pull cord as rosary, blower as vessel—never explained aloud. Final permission to miss without drowning lands through image, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through image, not statement: “shelves built of shared silence” replaces literal library. Subtext is embedded in gesture—licking frozen cheeks apologizes for interiorizing their cathedrals. Final image of mist curling into “almost like a smile” non-literally answers the thematic question: uncertainty becomes livable when co-held. No moralizing; the sole articulation (“make friends with uncertainty”) is spoken by a re-iced statue, not the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the pattern of “failed fires” transmuted into portable twilight—no explicit thesis stated. The crozier’s re-birth as a void-eyed serpent reweights “creative destruction” from slogan to lived paradox. Subtext operates in gesture: the refusal to claim mastery (“He did not gasp. He exhaled.”) crystallizes the renunciation. Final image—“frost trailing from his boots like lace”—offers a non-literal answer: becoming the road is the only antidote to destiny.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from the reversal of failure into genesis: Hollywood’s failed eternity becomes the seed of cosmic rebirth. Subtext in gesture—raising empty hands—speaks louder than any thesis. Final image of “quietly broadcasting genesis” reweights the whole concept of silence as creative potential. No moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from particular stitched moments—bridge kiss, salt rain—rather than thesis: connection is the friction of longing against loss. Final image reweights premise: gallery exhales, corridor of unsent letters opens, answering “what holds us when memory unravels?” with texture, not objects. Subtext resides in gesture—she hums a lullaby never sung, implying inherited absence. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “something between sorrow and satisfaction.”

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—adaptability as survival—emerges through anchor-to-constellation reconfiguration, never sermonized; the somber marvel tone lets awe coexist with loss, inviting reflection without moralizing; only a hairline slip of overt thesis in “we are not weights meant to stay put” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges obliquely: love as frequency shift rather than immortal presence. The photograph’s final calm reweights the premise—memory is not archive but tuning fork. Subtext lives in gesture: girl’s palm over tracer’s hand is silent assent to changed frequency. No moralizing, only the resonant image of two silhouettes exiting under bruised twilight.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from pattern, not sermon: fracture (porcelain, data, death cert) → arrangement (ink mandala) → honored residue. “Failure is the seam where truth leaks” is spoken by a ghost through ink, not authorial thesis. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing: the shard tucked in coat = quiet promise to carry seam forward. Minor deduction for “wisdom from failure” echoing prompt language, but its reprise in ink earns its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the inverse ratio: the more sound is devoured, the more meaning is released, offering a non-moral answer—voice is not preserved but continuously paid for. Subtext lives in gesture: the diamond’s hunger = colonial silence; her copper veins = conductive memory. No final-paragraph moralizing; the forward-echo is the statement. Complexity is honored—language returns but only at the price of eternal echo, not ownership.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges: grief transmuted into cosmic play; no moral stated. The joke lands subtextually as Moira’s teacup settles and Elara laughs—bitterness spat back as confetti. Recurring “frostbitten hope” accrues through vine-glow, thyme sprig, and final warmer pulse. Ambiguity lingers: the missing hikers remain missing, now constellations—reader must decide if this is mercy or erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from husk-to-sapling progression; no explicit thesis stated. Final image—“tarnished wonder…molting”—reweights premise: beauty was never broken, only husked. Subtext in statues’ slow spear-lower carries more force than any declaration. One faint echo risk: “beauty hides in husks” nears proverb, but it’s grandmother-voiced and immediately materialized in shell use.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of postal logic: absences are the parcels, silence the postage, nature the courier. The final reconfiguration—thunder that doesn’t frighten but signals love—reweights earlier motifs (rusted trike, skipped-heartbeat wheels) into an alphabet of reunion. No moralizing; the meaning is delivered by the sky itself. Subtext lives in gesture: Marla’s fingers drumming on pinball glass translate the nervous rhythm of every missing person.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from action, not aphorism: silence as generative medium, finished beauty as secular sacrament. The final image of the halo crown spinning above wooden beasts reconfigures “salvation” from religious to artisanal. No tidy moral—readers may read triumph or tragic exile. Subtext lives in gesture: the single smile is the only overt emotional signal, making it resonate like a bell after wordless pages.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges without statement: analog memory as sanctuary versus digital collapse, love as differential inscription, curvature as infinite holding. Subtext lives in gesture—thumb tracing equations, scarf knitting symbols—never explicated. Final image (patrons feeling pages “warmer, heavier”) reweights the entire opening catalogue as resuscitated flesh. No moralizing; the emotional after-effect is tenderness touched by loss.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges as the paradox that longing is the only accurate map because it never arrives—once the dream returns, the map must be relinquished. No character moralizes; the final line reweights the entire archive of captured light as something now to be savored, not used. Subtext resides in gesture: palette closing “not to store” silently argues that living memory trumps embalming it. The coral hue of childhood candles is reprised and re-valued at closure, turning a sensory detail into thematic verdict without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: love unarmored as re-weaving force, never stated but embodied in the fragile bird-like idea cupped in torn palms. Subtext operates via object transfer—blue ribbon (other’s fear) → red ribbon (self-risk) —charging the final image without moralizing. The ending’s image of a future child speaking love unsilenced offers resonant, non-literal answer. No thematic echo or final-paragraph sermon appears.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through pattern: teaching fracture without false repair. Final annotation “draw the line that holds it — not to cage, but to compass” reweights earlier siege spiral into delta of possibility—Conceptual Repricing on the page. No moralizing; resonance lives in the empty swing still moving. Stubborn tenderness as ethos, not thesis, lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the accretion of specific memories into a collective chromatic resource; no character sermonizes. Final image re-prices wonder as something that must be bodily carried, not merely observed. Ambiguity lingers: whose memories will color the next child’s first snow?

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges inductively: silence as palpable residue that must be gently unknotted, not condemned. Final image of “lucid unrest” reweights the premise without moralizing, inviting reflection on communal grief stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges as negative-space preservation: what is removed continues to shape terrain. The torn map, erased chapel, and evaporated pigment are particulars that generalize into meditation on cultural erasure without sermon. Subtext operates in light gradients—shadow lengthening is the only “speech” the chapel can utter. Final image (yarrow on stone) offers non-literal answer: testimony is an offering, not a structure; resonance lingers because the particulars never dissolve into maxim.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges as inverse physics: surrender is not entropy’s defeat but its fulfillment. Every image (upward snow, unknotted gravity, thread snapping) reconfigures loss as energy transfer without moral tag. Subtext resides in gesture—open palms, warm wind—never exposition. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: the globe unselves, death smiles, narrator waves back—complex, un-moralized acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges as inverse imperialism: instead of colonizing the machine with human meaning, she lets the machine colonize her lullabies—mutual elegy. Subtext lives in chromatic grammar—cerulean arcs = vernacular of loss; silver drips = elegy in metallic bleed. Final image (“messages…in rust…in rain-slick brick”) offers resonant non-literal answer: loneliness is a protocol error that can be patched by shared obsolescence. No sermonizing; the ghost’s “I decoded love” is spoken by the affected party, not the authorial chorus.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the diary’s refrain: joy folded inside sorrow. No explicit moralizing; the final image of frostbloom in her coat pocket reweights the idea into living proof. Ambiguity remains—she descends unchanged in outward role but re-visioned inwardly—creating lingering counter-readings. The captain’s voice stays textual, not authorial lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges solely through image and act: the ledger’s salt rings and the scent of pine in the dissolving cloud argue that memory resides in what vanishes. No explicit thesis; final smile is an image, not a moral. The concept of “spooled wholeness” is repriced when the spool is shown to be the sky itself, not her book. Resonant ambiguity lingers: did the cloud remember, or did she forgive?

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from reversal: deficit → lens; no explicit thesis, only embodied translation of metal stars to wood cosmos. Subtext in silence—radios crackling, hydraulic whine—speaks louder than any moral. Final smile reconfigures solitude from failure to sovereignty. Conceptual repricing: sky once stamped for trade now reclaimed for private awe; commerce-to-wonder shift is non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—knowledge as collaborative conversation with the world—emerges via hopscotch, starlings, and blank page rather than thesis. Subtext in Captain Veyra’s eyebrow and “Explain” carries respect-won-from-skepticism. Final image reweights earlier lullaby whispers into active dialogue without moralizing. Complexity lingers: beam invites both wonder and threat, unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges as repair ≈ reharmonization, not restoration—an elegant Conceptual Repricing. Yet the insight is delivered in abstractions (“every broken thing holds a song…”) rather than a single re-framed image. Mirrors and gears carry it, but the emotional after-effect is diffuse because no specific personal loss is revisited with new weight.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of “trust as ecological catalyst” emerges through pattern, not thesis: chalk messages root, bell memory coaxes dew, unity summons nebula. Final image of the orchard “sighing in pride” reweights loss as continuity. No moralizing line articulates the theme; it remains legible yet porous. Ambiguity between migration and abandonment invites counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of apocalypse: annihilation reframed as mercy, articulated through the recurring lullaby image that moves from fetal heartbeat to stellar exhalation. Subtext resides in the cracked puppet—beauty in breakage—returning as witness, not symbol. No moral is stated; the final after-glow of warmth in_void reweights the premise without sermon. The reader is left to feel that tenderness itself is the last physics, an earned complexity rare at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges as the economics of invisible labor: caretaking measured not in glory but in withheld ghosts, paid in forfeited memory-tools. Subtext resides in the silence—no thanked heroics, no tearful farewell—only the girl’s shiver and the orchard’s indifferent sigh. The nut’s migration from cipher to gift re-weights the moral ledger: knowledge hoarded vs. knowledge spent. Final image reconfigures value without moralizing: frost on branches = undeniable conceptual cost for the caretaker’s chosen arithmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: impermanence as architecture for love. Subtext lives in gesture—scooping foam, letting it vanish—rather than exposition. Final image (watermark of tiny handprint) offers non-literal answer: love persists as trace, not structure. No moralizing; complexity intact. River/braid motif accretes meaning without forcing symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—absence as currency—emerges from the ledger’s dissolving numbers and the prismatic birds overhead, never stated. Subtext lives in gesture: the patron clutching the bottle “like a confession” implies his unquantified shame. Final image of the open ledger offers resonant non-literal answer: stories begin in the space left behind. No moralizing; the silence between chapters reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges without statement: sorrow is mineral, can be ground to bearable dust but never erased. The coral-to-dew transformation reprises the desert rain, reframing grief as irrigation for “something softer.” Final image—barefoot chef, fortress humming release—offers resonant non-literal answer: healing is not forgetting but weathering. Ambiguity lingers: whose soul will she soothe next, now that her own is porous?

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from image pattern—mirror as palimpsest—rather than assertion. The final constellation re-prices “modification” from technical fix to existential commitment: she becomes living museum of unlived lives. Subtext resides in the silence after her laugh—pebbles-in-wash sound signals acceptance of unquantifiable wonder. No sermon, just the owl-hoot binary fading into sage-scented wind, leaving reader to feel the cost of never traveling light again.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges implicitly: vigilance lives in margins, doodles, negative space—echoed by margin-doodle key and final “spaces between breaths.” No explicit thesis; final image reweights prior marginalia without moralizing. Subtext operates through motif return (spiral, seven eyes, Seed layers). Ambiguity preserved; complexity acknowledged rather than tidied.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through material metaphor: fracture → frequency, isolation → resonance. No capital-T thesis; the final image of the grove “humming with memory” reweights earlier silence without moralizing. Subtext in gesture—tears as recognition, not triumph—keeps complexity: empathy is reciprocal sculpture.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—beauty through estrangement—emerges from iterative images (dent, twilight, silence) rather than thesis. Final image of man carrying resonance reframes exile as circuitry, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext in magnetic hum = unheard music of outcasts; silence translation = epistemic humility. Ambiguity lingers: covenant’s awakening may yet fail, keeping complexity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from braid of silence-as-language and empathy-as-archivism; no character sermonizes the concept. Final image of her smiling at “symphony within” reconfigures silence from absence to plenitude without moral tag. Subtext of pacifist discipline is encoded in tactile refusal to break clasp; reader decodes ethic rather than hears dictate. Only hairline slip: “first language of empathy” flirts with abstraction early, quickly redeemed by embodied tuning acts.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from olfactory metaphor: decay as fertilizer, fear as root-depth, wisdom as undercurrent. No explicit moral; final image of replanting in recycled paper reweights prior motif of “stillness within motion.” Subtext operates in gesture—her tears while others gag—rather than statement. The wrapping-paper archive returns as both literal and symbolic compost, integrating theme with object without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory as agricultural technology, resilience as collective recall. Subtext lives in gesture—her gloved fingers hesitate before touching warm iron, acknowledging ancestral guilt. The echo motif accumulates force: from atmospheric metaphor to literal bio-acoustic archive, reweighting the premise in the final chord. Avoids moralizing; the closing “echo with them” is invitation, not sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely: prediction is never neutral—every measurement trains the phenomenon it seeks to tame. Subtext crystallizes in the final image of man stepping into the gust to “let it learn me”; the moral is felt, not stated. No thematic echo lines, no final-paragraph sermon. The patch’s return as compass-needle re-prices memory from souvenir to targeting device, reweighting the premise with cold conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through synesthetic translation of silence into living color; no moral is declared. The child’s laughter thawed by resonance reweights earlier ice-entombed memories without commentary. Final image—“every snowflake hummed”—offers a CR that re-prices wonder as atmospheric necessity, not luxury.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars: three precise modes of collapse, three lessons the keeper inscribes rather than preaches. Subtext operates in gesture—the unanswered driftwood arrows, the unplayed flute becoming monument. The final maxim is earned through catalogued failures, not imposed; ambiguity remains (should anyone ever weave again?). Resonance lingers as an ethical negative space: the silence after avalanche is the only honest choir left.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through accreted pamphlet titles and the halo’s collapsing empathy-space: measurement of feeling annihilates the measurer. Subtext resides in the un-signed glyph that means both beginning and ending—ambiguity as the only honest answer. No moral is stated; the final image of her walking into dark reweights all prior equations as unsolved. The concept stays complex, resisting tidy profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: wonder as pollen-thick residue of generous attention; the final image of empty hands dissolving into wind reconfigures the mentor’s axiom without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the recurring image of frozen water transmuting into liquid release; no character states the thesis aloud. The final rainbow on her kitchen table is a non-literal answer that reweights the earlier “truthful lie” paradox. Subtext in gestures—notebook sketches instead of press releases—implies ethical stance without sermon. Complexity is preserved: surrender is both suicide and liberation, yet neither is moralized.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges as the price of transmission across entropy: love demands material sacrifice from the messenger. The amber bead’s ghost-firefly and the upward blossoms reprice the ordinary into the uncanny without authorial comment. No moral is stated; the closing warmth in the glass city lets the reader reweight the earlier loss. Ambiguity lingers—was erasure the only path?—inviting reflection rather than verdict.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without statement: resilience is a communally forged currency, not an individual power-up. Subtext sits in silence—villagers never thank Arlo aloud, yet return stronger. Final hinge wrapped in remnant silk offers non-literal answer: magic is the act of giving away what you hoped would save you. No moralizing, only image.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the concrete particular of a daughter discovering she is the living debt her mother paid; no authorial statement required. Subtext operates in the shard’s glowing pulse and the bay’s alternating ruin/restoration—images reweight meaning at closure. Final image reconfigures the premise: “some truths don’t set you free—they make you responsible.” No moralizing sentence; the weep is the non-literal answer. Emotional aftereffect lingers as unbearable lightness rather than sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: unnamed grief converted into nameless kindness. Subtext operates in silence, stone angles, and the final hum—no reader needs ‘grief is love with nowhere to go’ spelled out. Final image reweights the sea-glass from private talisman to public beacon without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will anyone read the stones? The refusal to answer keeps complexity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges refractively: magnetism is structural, not pigment—authentic cracks bend light. The morpho wing, donor heart, and scarred hummer are particulars that refuse moralization; the final image of flickering cloth offers a conceptual repricing rather than a maxim. Subtext lives in silences, trembling hands, and the angle of gaze; no late thesis statement mars the resonance. Ambiguity is purposeful, inviting re-reading without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: grief as communal biomass, trees as living archives, mapping as act of mercy not measurement. Subtext operates in silence—her smile, not tears, at oak’s offering; soldier/flower/lock speak louder than eulogy. Final image of notebook sketching rings “no axe would ever split” offers Conceptual Repricing that reweights mapping from colonial extraction to vow of non-violence. Avoids sermon; resonance arises from concrete particulars (birch cradling mute girl’s star paintings).

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges obliquely: collective memory is not archived but sung, and a people is swaddled not by cloth but by resonance. The lullaby ghost-melody and cracked mica reweight the premise—light is no longer scarce currency but shared obligation—without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture: the keeper’s bare feet on glowing moss externalize vulnerability, while flower crowns pressed onto her hair by children silently invert power from guardian to gift. The final image of mirrors reflecting “what was reclaimed” offers Conceptual Repricing that lingers beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars: the biography of a man who died before he is born = Elira’s suspended identity. Final image—reading aloud to empty chairs—offers non-literal answer: belonging is a performance for absence, not approval. No explicit moral; wisdom is repriced by conceptual cost (the library re-shelves itself). The refrain “to unearth wisdom in a mistake” is spoken once, early, and is earned by the shelf-reordering payoff, avoiding thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the concrete particular of vanishing bakeries and dark lanterns rather than thesis statements. The bread’s uneaten offering and the star she refuses to name reweight “the sacred” as an unspoken, ongoing practice rather than a creed. Subtextual tension between remembrance and erasure is carried in silence and seed rather than explanation. No moralizing line intrudes; the final image invites multiple readings (hope, futility, cyclical return) without forcing one.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges entirely through refracted light: vows as frequencies, forgiveness as the steadiest waveform, memory as a consumable resource. No explicit thesis is stated; instead the final image of a now-silent slide reweights every prior color into a meditation on durability vs transience. The refusal to moralize lets the concept resonate beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Trust-as-sound motif emerges through acoustic images (ghost-tick, silence after exhale, boot click) rather than exposition; theme crystalizes when recognition, not violence, shatters the truce. Final image of girl swallowed by market dark offers Charged Poise—no moral stated, but cost of generational betrayal is undeniable. Avoids pat lighthouse-redemption tropes by keeping grandfather’s guilt a hush.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)

Subtext lives in the lock’s hollow chamber and the single charcoal bone.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particular paper slips, not assertion: a mother’s toy apology, soldier’s brother-note. Final image reweights “ oasis” from water to truth—Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. No thesis statement; silence of pooled conversations becomes ethical demand. Ambiguity lingers: toxic sky still there, archive unpaid for.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: wonder is neither commodity nor memory but a frequency one can submit to. The child’s gasp and the iceberg’s fierce refracted longing embody the concept without moralizing. Final image of mute echo tuning silence reconfigures meaning—preservation succeeds by relinquishing control—achieving Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost (world below has traded wonder for warranty).

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Transformation emerges through recurring images of containment (box, dome, rib-cage farm) that invert their function—what was sealed becomes seedbed. No explicit moral is stated; the final “song” is a resonant reconfiguration of static into harmony, felt in the petals that take root where they fall.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from recursive images: dice once rolled for death now roll for liberation; water that drowned becomes veil. No moral spoken—final capsule is dance notation only. Subtext in silence: she chooses inscription over survival, making collapse a generative act. Familiar freedom “had always been theirs” reframes the entire story as pre-written music she merely transposed.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: listening as creative act, silence as medium for cosmic repair. Subtext lives in gesture—cradling the coded cry like a fledgling—never sermonized. Final image of stars re-weaving sorrow into lullaby-light offers resonant non-literal answer. A whisper more ambiguity about what “remembering dawn” entails would deepen complexity, but the current balance is elegant.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without pronouncement: language as mutual habitation—scholar learns to be colonized by the text she once解剖. The serpent-swallowing-tail seal silently re-prices the premise: translation is not mastery but digestion. Final image of “rooftop garden sighing recognition” answers the core question—can buildings speak?—with an audible exhalation that feels earned because every brick-groan was seeded early.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the iterative act: fragility as first draft of resilience is never stated outright but demonstrated through the shell’s offer and her refusal to seek healing. Subtext resides in the shell’s warmth—an unspoken plea she answers with autonomy. Final image reprices the concept: archive is not burial but compass, a conceptual reweighting paid for by relinquishment. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers on who next will kneel.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)

Ambiguity lingers: kingdom will never know her name, yet crops stir—complex rather than tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: salvage as tender stewardship, not extraction, reframed when the globe becomes a window for others’ repair.

Subtext lives in gesture (globe cradled, then released). No moral is declared; resonance lingers in borrowed starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—dawn must be earned in mud, not chrome—emerges through lyric recurrence of “shadows” and “static,” never sermonized.

Misses 9.0 because the prophet’s counter-argument is only sketched, blunting dialectic charge.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)

Resonance sticks: reader left listening for silence in their own world—conceptual cost acknowledged without moral sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: cities that warehouse pain become fatal infrastructure. The lantern’s reprise—cold iron to pulse-synced glow—reweights “progress” as haunted circuitry.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the particular: a grieving tinker-priest learns that absolution, like escapement, is a rhythm maintained, not a puzzle solved. Subtext operates through mechanical silence vs. promised song—every non-beat is a theological accusation. Final image re-weights “second opinions” from human advice to optical revelation, showing that insight can come from outside the human forum. No moralizing, only the audible tick that now accompanies his collar; ambiguity (will he keep winding?) is purposeful and haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the fusion of mechanized longing and organic memory; no thesis is stated. The arrow’s reweighting—from weapon to tuning fork—offers a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from iterated particulars: mirrors shift from nostalgia to moral challenge, crystal from wound to lens.

Ambiguity lingers—world may still harden—but the reconfiguration is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: endings are not events but acoustic thresholds one can learn to inhabit. The parasol’s transformation—sunshade → tuning fork → pulse-against-throat—reweights “lace unraveling” into lullaby, not despair. Final image answers the central question non-literally: hum of patience folded into windborne solace. No moralizing or thematic echo in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges via shifting vine metaphors rather than assertion; the burned edge reweights from relic to map without authorial commentary. Final image of “vineyard row—fertile, intentional, alive” offers resonant non-literal answer: love’s value lies in the cultivated gap. Avoids sermon; only hairline slip is Elias’s “invitations” line, a touch didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from silence-as-wisdom: not the prophet’s words but the hollows that absorb them. The half-mask literalizes the duality without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the iterative act: healing is non-linear, arced, communal yet solitary. Subtext lives in gesture—the kite string, the puddle-mural birds—rather than exposition. Final image answers the thematic question without moralizing: the latch-click and darting swifts visualize “mending the world” as ongoing motion, not completion. Ambiguity lingers—will the archive ever be enough?—provoking reflection without thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—growth is not retrieval but unknowing—emerges entirely through acoustic imagery and her final spoken uncertainty; no editorial thesis is stated.

No platitudes, only patterned hush→voice inversion that lands as emotional aftereffect.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Third-person lyric remains tight to scholar’s perceptual filter: synesthetic “sound pooled like liquid mercury,” fern-unfurling simile marks her botanist instinct. Syntax lengthens then fractures in tandem with echo distortion; diction stays archaic-leaning without counterfeit dumbing. No dialogue, so voice purity is uncontested. Read-aloud rhythm controlled through comma-stitched clauses that mimic held breath—pattern taught early and paid off in final short sentence “I don’t know.”

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme—memory as externalized echo that outlives the rememberer—emerges from pattern, not statement: prophet who forgets futures becomes the living proof that artifacts (driftwood, chalk, fog shapes) remember for him. Subtext operates in silence: unwatched videotapes hoard afternoons the prophet will never replay, mirroring his own unwatched life. Final image reweights premise: chalk humming alone in grass re-prices every prior screech as self-erasing prophecy, moral never spoken. Resonance is concrete—reader left hearing that half-audible hum long after story ends.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the inversion: absence is not loss but exile awaiting reconciliation. The closing-loop motif reweights “silence stole” into “silence shared,” avoiding any thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: replacement grief can be transmuted into shared constellation-myth if someone first kneels in dirt and risks being wrong. The tooth’s reappearance as underground heartbeat is a conceptual re-pricing that reweights every prior “stolen” object. No moralizing—final line offers quiet invitation, not dictate. Counter-readings linger: is this merely beautiful denial? The ambiguity is purposeful and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges from particulate matter: salt, silica, mist, scar. “Pearl of stillness” shifts from grandmother’s aphorism to communal lens, reweighting trauma into window, not weapon. No moralizing—final image is a child cupping sky, the watcher’s smile the only commentary. Ambiguity preserved: stillness is neither forgiveness nor forgetting, but a surface through which light passes without burning.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.4)

No moralizing; resonance carried by salt-ink rain and unpunctuated tide.

    Theme emerges obliquely: refuse becomes compass, silence becomes signal, heartbeats become geography—no moral stated. The final image reweights all prior debris as collaborative cartographers. Subtext lives in gesture (blood signature = love letter to the lost). Ambiguity is purposeful: the map is felt, not seen—reader must imagine who will follow it. No thematic echo; resonance is purely imagistic.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: wonder as nutrient, light as scribe, periphery as epistemology. The final image—travelers feeling “a melody just beyond hearing”—reweights the whole enterprise without moralizing. Minor deduction for the explicit thesis line “wonder was a nutrient, not a luxury,” but the resonance survives it.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without slogans: grief can be geometrically compressed but never deleted; survival is the art of carrying polished stones. Subtext lives in gesture—folded letter stiffens into seashell whorls, a tactile metaphor for memory’s fossil trace. The final image of the weaver calcifying her own silence reweights all prior salvations as recursive self-application, avoiding moral sermon. Ambiguity lingers: is she heroine or self-imposed caretaker of endless sorrow? Complexity is honored, not tidied.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme—grief as rhythm, not enemy—emerges through concrete returns of “here and gone” in wood-curls, rain droplets, kettle clicks; no final moralizing.

    Theme emerges from pattern, not sermon: “hope = redirected flows.” Final image of golden triangles on cracked wall reweights earlier light readings without moralizing.

Resonance lingers in reader’s body as warmth + flicker + footstep spark.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: silence not as absence but as pregnant medium in which music can exist unplayed. The final image—hum curling between pendulums—answers the thematic question (can an artist live without audience?) by redefining “composition” as witness. No moralizing; the crystal’s refracted light is the conceptual repricing. Counter-readings linger: is this peace or permanent retreat? Ambiguity is purposeful and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through concrete reframing: lies as architecture of mercy, not malice. The locket’s scratched face and inscription instantiate this without sermon. Final image—“quiet ruins from which legends rise”—reweights earlier chases as voyeurism of pain, not glory. Ambiguity persists: we never learn the lie itself, only its shelter purpose, inviting reflection rather than verdict.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges: transmission of embodied knowledge versus archival preservation. Subtext lives in gesture—offering lightning-glass for silence, not explanation.

Final line “every step stitches sky to sea” offers non-literal, imagistic answer that reweights prior mapping obsession into continuous becoming. No final-paragraph moralizing; avoids sentimentality by keeping Elira’s fate open. Complexity: writing both preserves and relinquishes, a paradox left unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges solely through particulars: fire as both destroyer and savior, scars as singers. The closing harmonic ripple is the non-literal answer—no moral stated, only a new tonal register installed in her body. Subtext operates in gesture: coin lowered, wrist bound, silence sung. “Scars can sing” is seeded by father, tested by her lifesaving, and re-priced by the lagoon’s chord; no echo feels contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory as public commons that can be scientifically freed yet poetically received. Motif of “unstick” recurs as brass key, box click, and final drop—each a literal unsticking that reweights meaning. Final image (single drop into dry basin) offers non-literal answer: forgetting is not fate but failure that can be reversed one drop at a time. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers—will the city maintain the flow?—without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the gear’s transformation: illumination without incineration. No character sermonizes; the final lighthouse whisper is image, not moral.

    Theme emerges without statement: intentions are unfinished gestures, not destinations. The tapestry’s smoke-shapes and the meteor streak reprice this concept visually at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)

Subtext lives in the nib’s hollow shaft carrying “intention,” a lovely metaphor for probabilistic ethics without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges obliquely: memory needs mourning to resurrect, and art is clandestine communion across silence. The dust-mote theater literalizes this without thesis statement; the final unsung “thistled calm” trusts the reader to feel the conceptual repricing. No moralizing line mars the close.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)

    <question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is a sustained perceptual signature—star-drowned, tide-scored lexicon, rhythmic inward argument. Syntax swells and contracts with fungal light, never defaults to template; abrasive calm modulates into whispered coordinates without distance slip.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without aphorism: harmony as consent rather than control is demonstrated when Elara offers vibration instead of instruction. The vanishing-arts motif shifts from lament to blueprint—the rosette’s silent grain becomes architecture for rebuilding. Final image answers the thematic question: silence is not absence but resonance waiting for permission. No sermonizing; the closest to statement (“harmony was never lost. Only waiting”) is earned by 700 words of concrete choral memory and tactile table-touch.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)

    Theme emerges without dictation: perpetual motion as regret engine, mathematics as both scalpel and sustenance. The final image—climbing now “carrying the captured texture”—reweights every prior equation and roll into a non-literal answer: regret becomes propellant rather than weight.

Subtext thrives in thermal dialogue (“Who remembers us?”) and the cost of answered pleas: solitude lost, purpose expanded.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: buttons as “archaeology of choice,” echoes as half-truth coils. The ending offers non-literal answer—prophecy is “stitched in silence, buttoned to the soul”—repricing “prediction” as participatory potential. Subtext thrives in gesture (leaving jars at crossroads) and image (sand as preserved possibility). Avoids moralizing; wisdom is handed as a question (“What did you choose not to fasten?”), embracing ambiguity without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: justice as cultivation, not confrontation. The central question—“Where does unused courage wait?”—is answered non-literally: buried in frozen earth, entrusted to seasons. Final image reweights all prior material—ash becomes compost, spy becomes gardener—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, snow, and rust; the pillbox’s runes of release echo mentor’s warning, transforming “rust on the blade” into fertile decay. No false equivalence; the director’s betrayal is unambiguous, yet Elira rejects vengeance for generative truth.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the palimpsest metaphor—layered grief, overwritten vows, the needle as tool for revelation, not repair. The ending reweights prior material: the promise isn’t to heal but to clarify, and the river’s approval affirms that truth resides in distilled presence. No moralizing; resonance lives in the needle’s transfer and the horses shaking mist onto solid ground. Ambiguity lingers (will she unstitch?), but the thematic stance is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation as resonance, not stasis. The final image—unfired pot cradling glowing glass, bees returning at dawn—offers a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting “resistance” as gentle transformation. No moralizing; subtext operates through gesture (water offering) and object (porous vessel). Epiphany is earned via concrete struggle: tracing cracked kilns, syncing breath to thrum. Ambiguity lingers (Will bees rebuild? Will pot endure?), but meaning is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: light-refraction as antidote to urban despair, measured not forced change as healing. The prisms reprice darkness—not by erasing it but by revealing color within it—answering the central question (“How do you mend what’s broken?”) without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars—the bent gnomon, refracted skin, humming stone—not abstract moralizing. The final image reweights prior loss: the library becomes a loom, solitude becomes sovereignty, ghosts become collaborators. Subtext thrives in silence (Veyra does not mourn aloud) and gesture (palms pressed to brass). The resonant answer to “how to live with extinction?” is non-literal: realign, don’t resurrect; make space for what might yet be. No tidy binaries—extinction and genesis coexist in charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from Aris’s profession and ritual: secrets transform into shared grace when released into communal space. The ending offers a non-literal answer to “Will I ever be found?”—paper birds alight on shoulders, lilies ripple at whispered names—reweighting earlier longing as participatory belonging. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (origami cranes, thrush’s spiral) that accrue meaning without allegory. Complexity endures: connection requires sacrifice, yet the cost feels sacred, not tragic.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: cosmic tricksters weaponize hope, but Elira repurposes it as resistance via frequency, not force.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: spatial mutiny isn’t abstract but lived through shifting rooms and swallowed footsteps. The ending offers a non-literal answer—liberation through embodiment, not extraction—repricing the entire quest without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the unseen organist), gesture (lowering the compass), and image (key dissolving into her).

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges through tactile particulars: silk decay, charcoal pressure, salt-stiff collars. The final answer to “How do we remember the forgotten?” isn’t stated but shown—faceless sketches given breath by flame, names restored in the killer’s handwriting. Avoids moralizing; instead, it reweights memory as collective duty. The closing sketch of the killer—also faceless—implies that even perpetrators deserve witness when grief, not malice, drives erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: true mapping requires honoring silenced histories, not bureaucratic control. The storm-as-memory motif avoids allegory by grounding abstraction in concrete particulars—the nail, Riel’s stanza, refugee flotilla. Final lines reject moralizing for resonant implication: maps are “sung by storms,” “forged in nails,” remembered by the “nervously confident.” No tidy resolution; the guild still lies, but Elara’s pilgrimage redefines power. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid—the cost of institutional cowardice, the ethics of remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: scaffold flutters as coordinates of suspended moments, the glass flake’s evolving image, pixelated amnesty rendered in luminous fragments. The ending offers a non-literal answer—forgiveness isn’t erasure but recomposition—and reweights “never” as sculptable space.

The ending offers a non-literal answer—“dance in the loop”—that reweights failure as learning, legacy as territory, not burden.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.7)

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the irreconcilability of bureaucratic denial and dream-truth, crystallized in the Chancellor’s lie vs. the scars’ glow. The final image—helix of cobalt light spiraling from moss—reprices dreams as binding precisely because they’re uncorrupted by waking masks. No moralizing; resonance arises from the clipping’s transformation from key to catalyst. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid: the covenant isn’t restored, merely awakened—its survival still uncertain.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars: tarot fragments in marrow-hollows, moss in eye sockets—not abstract claims. The ending reweights “bartered destinies” non-literally: roots weaving Kael and Elira’s paths shows collaboration supersedes carving or softening. Subtext thrives in silence (orchard sighing), gesture (resin tears), and image (burned card pulsing verdant light). Avoids moralizing; the resonant answer—“patch holes so light gets through”—arises from concrete action, not thesis-statement.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from fragments: broken sound artifacts reframe failure as resonance. Subtext operates in silence, gesture (holding cloth to ear), and Ruiz’s trombonist past. The ending offers a non-literal answer—meaning isn’t in applause but in listening to absence—without moralizing. “What’s broken still carries song” reweights all prior cataloging as misguided reverence; the tuning fork metaphor crystallizes thematic reframing without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: transition as reconfiguration, not rupture. Subtext lives in gesture—the seedling reaching not skyward but toward her hand—and in invented cuneiform.

No moralizing; resonance accrues through particulars like “solidified memory” and “ambition softened.”

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the creel’s transformation: preservation requires surrender, not control.

No pseudo-profundity; insight arises solely from concrete ritual and lunar constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges implicitly: true apocalypse is disconnection, not collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through particulars: rivers forgiving eroded banks, graffiti as wisdom, patched bellows exhaling truth.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme—truth as both gift and wound, the impossibility of retrieving unspoken words—emerges through concrete particulars: glyphs as scars, the watch’s behavior, swallowed apologies releasing only scent. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the archive is a self-consuming loop, reweighting the quest as eternal recurrence rather than resolution. No moralizing; subtext lives in image (mirror cracking from “completion,” not force). Ambiguity lingers (Is liberation possible?), but complexity is earned through the dreamer’s irreversible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the perforated violin, melting into seeds that propagate truth through silence and witness—not decree. The final image reweights the entire premise: stolen relics don’t return through restitution but through ecological reclamation. No moralizing; the bluebell pushing through the Chancellor’s trousers speaks louder than any thesis. Complexity abides—empire cracks from within, not by overthrow—and the cost (“mulberry ache”) lingers as both sorrow and hope.

Final image—a baker unfolding vellum at dawn—offers non-literal answer: change blooms in mundane hands, not battlefields. Avoids moralizing; resonance arises from the sentinel’s trust in collective decoding, not declared ideals.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically: wonder isn’t chased but arranged for. The grandmother’s whisper—“Patterns hold what promises cannot”—is tested, not preached. Final realization reframes the entire premise: the curse reveals not time but syntax. No moralizing; resonance lives in the concentric rock and dissolving eels, inviting reflection on how we court revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: censorship as erasure, silence as sacred resistance. The final image—poet as “unredacted sky”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (Can silenced truth survive?), reweighting scars from wounds to coordinates. No moralizing; subtext thrives in gestures (envelope sealed with a tear-shaped glyph). Ambiguity lingers (will she open it?), but resonance is undeniable: survival maps a sovereign self beyond state control.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically: philosophical inquiry as collaborative navigation rather than conquest, with silence and geometry as conduits for truth. The final image—performing the overture “everywhere it’s been forgotten”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (can logic lead to destinations?), reweighting prior duels as necessary preludes to partnership. No moralizing; resonance arises from the needle card left behind and shoulders nearly touching during transcription. Complexity is embraced—the overture is both score and map, music for minds, resisting binary resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: resistance as quiet cultivation (“They call us broken. We call us seeds”) reframes destruction as fertile ground. The ending offers non-literal resolution—wildflowers in floorboards, candlelight on charcoal verse—reweighting “anarchy” as generative chaos. No moralizing; subtext thrives in gesture (bent nail as pin, whiskey toast to banned authors). Central question—can beauty sprout in ruin?—is answered through action, not assertion, with lingering ambiguity (Will seeds grow? Will poem be found?).

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme—art as defiance against deterministic loss—emerges through particulars: the broken clock vs. the impossible chord, static disappearance vs. summoned dawn. Subtext thrives in silence (her refusal to turn) and image (compasses snapping toward her). The ending offers a non-literal answer: fate isn’t defeated but harmonized, with conceptual cost (burnt film = lost past) and emotional honesty (grief and triumph fused in one smile). No moralizing; resonance arises from the piano’s final, nonexistent chord shattering the horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: fragile memory requires both dream and doubt to endure. The fractal ridge—a self-correcting archive—offers a non-literal answer to how culture survives erasure. Subtext thrives in glyphs (heron-as-lost-son), scent-triggered recall, and Aris’s mentor’s voice. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars like salt-bread taste or lullabies, avoiding binaries between truth and longing.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of silence, color, and negative space—not stated but embodied in the lace’s coded gestures and the compass’s remorse-driven needle. The ending offers a non-literal answer: apologies need no voice to be heard if their weight is redistributed through ritual attention. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld—the mother’s unsaid “I’m sorry,” the train that never arrived—making regret a shared atmospheric condition rather than personal failure. No moralizing; resonance arises from the juniper’s dawn-colored leaves trembling “from recognition.”
