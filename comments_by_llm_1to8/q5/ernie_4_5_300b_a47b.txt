  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—gradual change as entropic language—emerges organically from Elara's spectrometry work and the fern/chrysalis observations. The final line "evolved her" and the botanist's tree-ring analogy attempt a non-literal answer, but the piece leans toward thesis articulation ("Gradual change is the universe's only constant") rather than letting the dust spiral image speak alone. No overt moralizing in the final paragraph, yet the resolution feels conceptually tidy rather than resonant with ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of "purpose in the pauses" emerges consistently through the frost patterns, the shard's phrase, and Lirael's realization about her art, avoiding overt moralizing. The ledger-frost-shard sequence builds resonance through particulars, and the final image of glass panels etched with frost patterns reweights prior material thematically. However, the ending articulates the theme too directly ("not to create objects but to mark time"), reducing subtext, and the promised teaching feels additive rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—silence as presence rather than absence—emerges through concrete action (heat-mapping, vibration experiments) and the recurring winterglass/tuning fork imagery. The closing line "unshaken, unbroken, and utterly alive" synthesizes the conceptual stakes without overt moralizing. However, the piece edges toward affirming platitudes ("not broken, just speaking a different language") and the mother's lullaby functions as emotional shorthand. The final image of the conservatory as sanctuary offers resonance, though the leap to global recognition undercuts the quiet integrity of the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—rest as beginning, belonging vs. permanence—emerges from Elias's arc and the lens-as-bridge motif. The goldfish memory and "occupy impossible spaces" thread through the narrative, and the final image reweights prior material without overt moralizing. Yet key insights are told: "rest wasn't an end. It was a beginning" states the theme rather than letting the image carry it. The lens's new message—"not just of survival, but of belonging"—edges toward explanation. Thematic coherence is strong, but the ending leans on articulation where silence would sharpen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the bell's journey: silence to voice, anonymity to named solidarity. The final image—"It's not the sound that matters… It's who rings it" and "who listens"—reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the intergenerational question. The "amplified quiet" as a language the community speaks fluently is a strong conceptual repricing. Minor slip: "starved the sanctions of fear" edges toward thematic echo, and the widow's whisper ("You knew… But I needed you to know the receiver") risks over-articulation, yet both remain grounded in specific action and do not flatten the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.6)
    The central question "where is unused love stored?" is posed clearly and the answer—"spaces between breaths"—attempts thematic resonance. However, the ending states the insight as a platitude rather than earning it through specific conflict and image. The pilgrim-of-sparks motif and camera obscura work remain decorative metaphors without forcing a moral calculus. Subtext is thin; the pool scene tells us the revelation rather than letting gesture and image imply meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of photographs, memory, and time's fabric, avoiding overt statement until the final reflection. The recurring motifs (photographs, fragment, Clara's life) accumulate meaning, and the closing insight—"time wasn't a texture...but a story"—reweights the premise. However, this reweighting is asserted in narration rather than demonstrated through a non-literal final image. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces ambiguity (the fragment's purpose, Clara's fate), but the ending paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("she'd design one to remember") rather than letting the images speak.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of resilience vs. dry soil emerges through the seed vault conceit and the title "chained liberator," but the final beat states the theme overtly: "resilience had been planted." The arrow's symbolic fletching and the keys' moon/sun/spiral shapes gesture toward pattern without earning a non-literal reweighting at closure. The scavengers remain one-note greed figures without complexity. The vial's explosive use offers a visual payoff but the thematic question—what cost to plant hope—is answered by convenience (instant vines) rather than ambiguous particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (memory, absence, betrayal, trust) emerges through the recurring images of the forge, absences-as-vials, and the modified trees. Yet the ending offers no non-literal answer or reweighting—she succeeds in her quest and the final line ("the absence where love should be") restates the premise rather than repricing it. The piece avoids overt moralizing but also sidesteps thematic friction or cost, leaving the conceptual stakes static.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (reinterpreting destiny, trading moments) is stated rather than embodied: "destiny's door wasn't locked. It was a garden" is direct authorial summary. The photograph's illumination is a clever image, but the thematic payoff—"left something better in its place"—is told in the penultimate paragraph. The jar-as-dialogue concept has potential, yet the piece leans on prompt language ("illuminated moments," "quietly savvy") without transforming it through earned particulars. The ending offers symbolic closure but lacks the weight of dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (imperfection as entry point for light/meaning) emerges through the bookmark's crack and recurs in the final image, but the piece leans heavily on direct thematic statements: "Even broken things can catch the light." The closing paragraph borders on moralizing, telling the reader what Kael has learned rather than allowing the schematics or bookmark to charge the ending through implication. The connection between glassblowing (shaping tension into art) and the thaw/cracks is serviceable but not deeply integrated into his on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme ("vulnerability is power") is stated three times in dialogue and narration rather than emerging from action. The whispering shell functions as a symbolic convenience rather than a motif that constrains choice, and the final café exchange moralizes instead of landing a resonant image. The "trembling certainty" phrase recurs as a label without shifting meaning across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as layered presence, mapping absence rather than light, the interplay of voice and void. The final image—gold flakes clinging like "stolen starlight"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. The "silence would wait, patient and infinite, for the next oracle" gesture risks abstraction, yet the booklet's physical decay and Mara's bodily engagement (aching fingers, trembling smile) anchor the conceptual work in particulars. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the piece earns its thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of thought-origin emerges organically from the robot's quest and crystallizes in the "mundane mysticism" phrasing at closure. The looped-timeline conceit and amalgamation metaphor support the thematic question without overt moralizing. The final exchange with the scientist ("Here. In the mundane. In the mysticism of the everyday") edges toward direct statement but is framed as discovery rather than sermon. The piece resists tidy resolution—Unit-17 finds peace but continues seeking—though the emotional arc flattens because the robot's composure never cracks under pressure, reducing thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (honesty beyond words, silence as language) emerges organically from the lens/doodle mechanics and the crystals' hum. The final image—Elias doodling a lens instead of writing—offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Yet the piece edges toward stating its theme directly: "words were overrated," "honesty was enough to set everything free," and the closing summary flatten what the images had begun to earn, tipping toward thematic echo in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: marbles as resilience ledgers, cracks as story-maps, the garden-remembers premise. The final image about blooming through wounds attempts resonance. However, "Luck is just another word for preparation meeting opportunity" and the "gardens know their gardeners" refrain veer toward aphorism. The ending's shift to seasonal permanence ("as the seasons changed, the maze bloomed") feels detached from Elara's immediate choices, moving into abstract vindication rather than scene-grounded consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "subdued awakenings" concept and time-sideways theme are asserted rather than dramatized through particular choices with cost. The alien flora and creatures serve as proof-objects but do not create moral friction or thematic complication. The final image (Veyra reaching for the lever, smiling) offers no resonant answer to the central question—it merely restates her curiosity without reweighting prior material. The "icy warmth" and "hush of beating wings" recur as ornamental motifs rather than thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of in-between spaces (pause between movements, liminal space between life and death, unfinished work) is woven through particulars: the flooded pit, floating instruments, water as medium for revelation. The symbols-as-musical-code and the drowned composer's unfinished symphony integrate concept and conflict without overt statement. The final promise "I'll finish it" offers a resonant answer to the central question (completing the unfinished) through image and action, avoiding moralizing. However, phrases like "in-between spaces where ghosts and musicians speak the same language" edge toward thematic summary rather than purely emergent resonance, and the treatment of the ghost as tragic prodigy leans on familiar tropes without fully transforming them.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: oracles quantify vs. feeling the world; margins as survival space; truth's weight as anchor rather than crushing force. The bearberry's roots "where the world shows its cracks" encapsulates without stating a moral. Lirael's final smile and the herbalist's nod offer a resonant answer to whether she can endure uncertainty. The smudged illustration charges the ending without becoming a symbol checklist, and the "auroral sorrow" modulates from external storm to internal reckoning without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—human failure amplified by greed versus supernatural lore—emerges organically from the hologram's confession and Elias's final realization. The valve wheel recurs with shifting weight (trophy → talisman → sentinel), and the phrase "weight of a swallowed truth" reappears at closure. However, the final paragraph edge toward moralizing: "Some truths, he thought, were too heavy to carry" states rather than dramatizes the cost. The piece resists easy binaries (ghost versus machine, accident versus cover-up) but doesn't fully trust the image to carry thematic resonance without commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—letting go of judgment to witness change—emerges organically from the keeper's journey and choice, not assertion. The origami swan, black water, and river's backward flow all accumulate meaning without overt symbolism. The final image (stone wall, lightened heart, knowledge as "bridge not chain") offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution; the keeper's transformation is complete yet ambiguous, the silence internalized rather than possessed. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (ordinary magic, nurturing wonder) emerges from the curl and eclipse framing, but the final image ("To remind each other") states the moral rather than dramatizing it through scene particulars. The curl's glow reads as symbolic convenience—introduced late, it harvests thematic credit without prior constraint. Elara's closing line ("But mostly, it's here. In the quiet. In the ordinary.") crosses into sermonizing, reducing subtext to assertion. The ending offers a tidy resolution that avoids complexity or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—stories require listeners to live—emerges organically through Clara's ritual, the embroidered symbols, and the final chorus. The displaced axis metaphor deepens across beats without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: recognition restores the axis. Clara's line "To restore it, we must first acknowledge" risks thematic echo but stays character-voiced. The final image reweights prior material (walls as repository, dragons as symbol) with undeniable conceptual pressure, though emotional cost remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of open secrets and inherited purpose runs through the microdot specs, the fortunes, and the father's double-agent work. The lighthouse itself functions as a symbol of guiding and manipulating flow. However, the final fortune—"The key turns in the lock you forged"—skirts thematic echo; it states rather than dramatizes. The piece invites reflection on manipulation and legacy, but the ending opts for clean confidence ("The game was afoot") rather than ambiguity or moral friction. Subtext in the father's letter is present, yet the thematic answer feels asserted rather than earned through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges through image: stillness as cage/mirror/canvas, silence as space. The indigo paint—single-color focus—recurs with purpose. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "To decorate with silence…is to leave room for the unexpected." The priest's arc lacks genuine friction; he illuminates hidden assumptions without conflict or ambiguity. "Hidden assumptions" and "unraveled stillness" remain abstract prompt labels rather than earned insight from concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme of chronological homesickness and memory-as-music emerges through specific imagery (mirrored horizon, nautilus, childhood lullabies). Yet the final paragraph lapses into direct thematic statement: "architect of memories, a conductor of ghosts," "her legacy, her love letter to the mirrored horizon," and "it was enough"—moralizing summaries that replace scene pressure. The ending does not offer a resonant, non-literal answer; it tells the reader the theme succeeded.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—finding peace by embracing all versions of self—emerges clearly through the timeline structure and the final image of grounded walking. The tablet-as-map and "darkening brightness" motif attempt resonance, but the closing line ("somewhere between the drop and the ripple, Mara finally found peace") edges toward stating the moral rather than letting the image carry it. The piece resists overt sermonizing elsewhere, yet the line "not a gravity defier…but a woman made of choices" comes close to diagnostic articulation of theme. The fractured-timeline concept supports the question of identity, though the answer arrives through reflection rather than a non-literal scene action.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of silence as presence rather than void emerges organically from the phonograph work and cavern setting. The final image—"silence isn't the absence of sound. It was the space where emotion could breathe"—reconfigures prior material, though it edges close to direct statement. The backwards-music mechanism and the broken needle carry thematic weight without becoming allegorical placeholders. Minor slip: the "filament of hush" phrase verges on prompt-echo rather than growing from scene particulars, and the ending's explicit articulation ("she realized") slightly undercuts earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of integrity versus silence emerges from the quarantine plot, but the closure moralizes: "some truths are meant to be shared, not preserved" and "the quietest places often held the loudest truths" state rather than dramatize meaning. The storm-recorder motif recurs but doesn't accumulate pressure—it's mentioned at opening and ending without reweighting prior material. Elias's shift from "purity of data" to "defender of integrity" is declared in the final paragraphs rather than earned through specific contradictions. The engineered-flu reveal and the woman's plea lack complexity; the piece settles into a transparent thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges through the rope's knots and the spiral pattern rather than direct statement, and the grotto's transformation mirrors Kael's internal search without overt allegory. The being's line "impossible choices are the loom of existence" echoes the prompt's "impossible choices" too closely (Thematic Echo: −0.5), and the final image—"the patterns they leave"—verges on platitude without a concrete, non-obvious synthesis. The piece resists tidy moralizing, yet the insight remains abstract rather than rooted in a specific human complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (beauty in the unfinished, sound in silence) emerges organically from the bowl's discovery and the music's effect without stated morals. The final image—objects placed into the vibrating bowl, music weaving through offerings—offers a non-literal answer to the central question with resonance. Subtext operates in the crowd's hesitant murmuring and the bowl's warmth. The piece resists tidy resolution; the ending is a threshold, not closure of all grief. One minor slip: "magnificent simplicity of the moment" in the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of half-truths and emotional counterfeit emerges through setup and explanation ("half truths wrapped in the scent of sincerity") but is never dramatized through conflicting choices or visible moral cost. The final paragraph delivers theme summary ("crafting half truths that would linger") rather than letting the image resonate without authorial gloss. The concept of fusing insight with empathy is told rather than tested—Elias never faces a tension between the two. The ending resets rather than reweighting prior material, and the "professionally thorough to the end" tag feels like a thematic echo rather than earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "cycles of compassion" concept threads through music, the redirected letter, and Lila's later teaching, but the final paragraph moralizes overtly ("to uplift one was to uplift all") rather than trusting image and action. The locket photo and origami boats recur with reweighted meaning, which elevates thematic work, yet the conductor's letter—a forgery Clara commits without visible internal debate—undermines moral complexity by presenting deception as unambiguous good. The "Profit, Unseen" ledger label is on-the-nose symbolic convenience. Thematic resonance arises from particulars (seashells, library hum, symphony) but the ending's summary diminishes earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of kinship and connection emerges organically from Kael's search and the imagery of threads, tags, and the arbor. The final image—two figures beneath the obsidian arbor, ache shared—attempts a non-literal answer to the loneliness premise. However, the resolution leans toward asserted unity ("a thread connecting two hearts to the world") rather than a conceptual cost or ambiguity that resists tidy closure. The piece avoids overt moralizing but stops short of the earned, resonant reweighting required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: time as loom, echoes born from pauses, the giant as weary guardian of borrowed moments. The tunnel's visual of threads reweights prior material without overt statement. However, the final paragraph's "some stories weren't meant to be told in a single breath" edges toward thematic echo, summarizing rather than letting the image alone carry resonance. The piece invites reflection on time and interruption, yet the closing mood softens the conceptual cost established in the tunnel, diluting the non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (loss as fractal, preservation as flow) emerges through concrete images—chipped glass eyes, mosaic cracks, dripping water. However, the brother's quoted wisdom ("Emotion isn't a straight line, Elara. It's a mosaic") and Elara's final realization ("The mathematics of emotion...wasn't about solving equations but about embracing the chaos") veer toward direct thematic statement. The glass eyes and mosaic recur with reweighted meaning, but the ending offers a tidy answer rather than productive ambiguity. Subtext operates in the ritual's symbolism, yet the prose occasionally over-explains.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.9)
    A theme of invisibility versus visibility emerges through Mara's crawl-space existence and her final realization. However, the ending states the theme overtly ("for the first time, she felt seen") rather than earning it through a non-literal final image or action. The tape functions as a message of solidarity, but its thematic weight is told rather than charged by a concrete choice or cost. The decoder remains a device rather than a motif that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of transformation through release emerges organically from the hellebore's metamorphosis and the linden leaf motif. The piece resists overt moralizing until the penultimate exchange ("They're not trying to survive. They're trying to *transform*. And to do that, they have to let go"), which edges toward thematic echo by articulating the story's thesis in near-prompt language. The final image of vines climbing the trellis offers a resonant visual answer, but the preceding dialogue over-explains the conceptual work the image should carry alone. The phrase "circuitously sincere" recurs as a label without dramatic grounding, weakening specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through Marin's artistic struggle and the island's debris-laden history, avoiding overt moralizing until the stranger's note ("Meaning isn't threshed. It's grown"). The final image—the painting as bridge between past and future—resonates thematically, and the brooch functions as a catalyst rather than mere symbol. However, the note itself edges toward thematic echo, and Marin's realization ("not a puzzle to solve… a conversation") abstracts the earned experience into a tidy epiphany that risks flattening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of balance between control and chaos, brightness and darkness, emerges from the cave's unpredictability and the pilgrim's philosophy. The final image (the cave's changed song with an "unpredictable hum beneath") offers a non-literal answer. However, the pilgrim's late-paragraph moralizing ("brightness and darkness are twins. You cannot have one without the other") is an overt thematic statement that undercuts resonance, triggering a −0.6 deduction for sermonizing at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—fractured histories mended through patience—emerges organically from the valve's journey and the staggered-interval method. The mosaic metaphor and symphony image in the final paragraph, however, tip into overt statement rather than letting the restored trumpet resonate without commentary. The piece invites reflection on absence and memory, but the ending explains rather than trusts the reader to infer, lowering thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (unspoken truths, the divide between habit and new starts) emerges through image (arrows, the blank "Begin" ticket, the updated map) and avoids overt moralizing until the woman's line "to speak the truths you've buried." That moment edges toward thesis-statement rather than scene pressure, but the final image—Elias holding the updated map—offers a resonant if quiet answer. The piece resists false complexity, though the veiled woman and the "mysteries aren't unraveling; they're waiting" final line flirt with abstraction rather than grounded particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of resilience across time and the embrace of mystery over pure logic emerges organically through the tile's memories and Clara's shift. The whales function as a recurring motif that underscores "unheard symphony"—truths felt, not explained—and the final image reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the ending leans on a stated thesis ("some truths are best felt, not explained") rather than letting the image alone carry the conceptual answer, and the connection between Clara and Aelia borders on convenient kinship rather than dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—choosing the unknown over stagnant immortality—emerges through Kael's progression from tracing the fragment to pressing it against Lira's, and the mirror image of his hollow future self provides a concrete counter-image. "To discover what happens after goodbye" threads through the action. However, the final paragraph edges toward stating the theme: "it was alive, a symphony of possibilities" and "it beat the silence" veer close to thematic summary rather than letting the leap into the void speak for itself. The amulets as "anchors...keeping him and Lira in a loop of eternal near-misses" is told rather than dramatized across multiple encounters.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of systemic fairness versus corruption emerges through the "mathematics of equity" premise. The final image ("find the mathematics of a fair trade") restates theme rather than answering it through particulars. Elara's insight that "you're scared" tells rather than shows power dynamics. The ending's promise to "make sure no one ever has to fake their death again" reads as explicit moralizing rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme is asserted rather than emerged: "bridges, connecting the past, present, and future" and "guardian of memories" are stated directly in narration. The invented-histories concept could generate rich subtext, but it remains decorative—no moral calculus, earned insight, or non-obvious complexity appears. The final image (notepad growing thicker) is literal rather than resonant, and the phrase "incandescent restraint" in the last line reads as prompt echo rather than earned conclusion. Pseudo-profundity in "tapestry of light and shadow" lowers the score further.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of erased histories and reconstructed identity emerges through the container labyrinth, fragmented stories, and the death certificate, avoiding overt statement. The poison label's inscription—"For the rats. Not for the remembering"—offers subtext, and the final image of Kael claiming his name resonates. However, thematic development relies on abstract accumulation ("layering fragments") rather than concrete choices that test competing values. The ending gestures toward pursuit without offering a non-literal answer to the cost of reclaiming an erased past.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—mystery as something felt rather than decoded—emerges from the accumulation of sensory images and the astronomer's scribbled phrase, but the final paragraph states the thesis overtly ("wasn't meant to be decoded...meant to be felt"), replacing scene pressure with authorial summary. The shell and cello as bridging "life and death, logic and wonder" reads symbolic rather than dramatized through Lira's internal struggle. "Gloomy cheerfulness" is coined but not embodied in her choices or in the story's emotional texture; the observatory's "lingering energy" and the "universal riddle" remain abstract concepts rather than particulars that charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (chaos needs structure to survive; rebellion vs. efficiency) emerges from the graffiti reorganization and the stone chip as historical anchor. The drowning-clown mural with dollar-sign eyes carries clear subtext without over-explaining. However, the final exchange—"You can't privatize rebellion"—edges toward thematic declaration, and the last paragraph's "chaos tempered by purpose, its future unwritten but possible" summarizes the question rather than leaving it resonant in image. The stone chip's return to Lira's pocket offers a quiet reprise, but the conceptual repricing lacks bite; no counter-reading complicates the hopeful close.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of human marks outlasting indifference emerges from the hourglass grain and archive photo, and the grandfather's maxim ("Some truths outlast the hands that write them") seeds the closure resonance. However, the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than embodying it: "dawnlit melancholy lingered—a quiet, persistent truth" is overt moralizing that replaces image with label. The archivist's smile and Lira's own retrospective contentment resolve ambiguity too neatly, flattening the complexity the piece reaches for.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the water-light method as a metaphor for perception and repair—"magnetic calm that turned chaos into clarity" and "mending the invisible." The final image of another awaiting drone and the lesson that "listening's a kind of seeing" resonates without stating a moral. However, the thematic echo in Marlow's closing line ("You've got a gift...for seeing what's broken") treads close to articulating the premise directly. The piece avoids sentimentality and earns its quiet ending through established particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from Clara's assertion that "maps are lies" and her recognition that truth exceeds cartography. The light-beneath-ice revelation offers a concrete image rather than abstract philosophizing. However, the final paragraph veers toward gentle moralizing—"Some truths were meant to be chased, not caught"—that states the theme rather than letting it resonate through particulars. The phrasebook's blank page is a strong non-literal closure image that invites reflection without sermoning.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through the contrast between "machine" (lockstep) and "chorus" (each voice contributing), and the motif of balance recurs across the piece. The tuning fork and bell as instruments of connection avoid overt symbolism and remain grounded in Kael's work. However, the final paragraph delivers a thematic summary ("some things, once broken, can only be mended by listening" and "Balance, once restored, demands nothing less") that states the theme rather than allowing the final image to answer the question implicitly. The insight feels asserted rather than discovered through cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—some things are meant to be released rather than trapped—emerges from the priests' backstory and Mara's final choice, avoiding overt moralizing. The vial and hush function as concrete anchors for the ephemeral/permanence tension. However, the ending's thematic statement ("some things are meant to be unsnarled, not held") edges toward on-the-nose articulation, and the priests' terror/regret montage is summary rather than earned through prior scene pressure. The final image (empty but radiant vial, dawn rays) offers lyric resonance but the conceptual cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges from the lattice/pen metaphor and the contrast between the father's lies and Elias's truth-writing, avoiding overt moralizing. The copperlight repose and the scuffs-as-map recur purposefully. However, the final image offers symbolic resonance ("hovering…letting copperlight repose wash over him") without a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with conceptual cost; Elias's self-discovery is asserted rather than earned through specific experience that contradicts or complicates the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—debt across lifetimes, love and venom coexisting, awakening as end and beginning—emerges from the premise and imagery (funereal gown, pomegranate seeds, bead worn smooth). The final paragraph, however, articulates the theme explicitly ("some debts transcended time, that love and venom could coexist") in summary rather than letting the image speak. The ghost's "mournful elation" and the blooming fields offer a resonant final image, but the on-page epiphany is told rather than earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of restoration and resilience emerges through image (ruin to reverence, broken to whole) and the plates' merging. The final line—"even broken precedents could be mended"—states the theme a touch overtly but is grounded in prior action. The overlapping sleepwalking paths and thread as connective tissue carry subtext. The piece avoids heavy moralizing, yet the arc from empty tide pools to filled ones feels too tidy; a sharper ambiguity or cost would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (faith as choice, diaspora memory, restoration) emerges through image and action rather than statement. The sundial's alignment and the roots' reverent response carry subtext. The final line "It's not finished, but it's enough" offers a resonant reconfiguration of completion versus process, but it borders on thematic summary rather than image-driven answer. No overt moralizing; the ending invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (futuristic nostalgia as resistance, encoding truth in margins) emerges organically from the chalk codes and surface mail. The final task ("Teach the children to code in chalk") reweights prior material, but it arrives as a clipboard prompt rather than Lira's earned insight, blunting the resonance. The grandmother's line "We encoded our truth in what endures" is an explicit thematic statement that replaces dramatization in the closure beat. The phoenix seal recurs but remains symbolic decoration—it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—truth hidden in seams, observation versus action, wisdom disguised—emerges through the embroidery motif and the candle-flame synchronization without overt moralizing. The spiral-to-line transformation and "adjacent possibilities" offer conceptual resonance, and the "truth is never a straight line" pays off the opening stitching image. However, the thematic answer remains declarative rather than embodied: the ending tells us "the truth is hidden in the spaces between" without a concrete choice or renunciation that charges that insight with felt cost. The piece invites reflection but does not fully earn its conceptual repricing through dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—unspoken regrets, the beauty in brokenness, fierce tenderness—emerges from image and event rather than direct statement. The condensation letters and smoothed shard edges work as concrete particulars. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "some wounds never fully close—and that was okay" and the spirits' command "Go. Live. Speak." The ending offers a resonant answer but edges toward thesis statement, diluting the non-literal charge. The gargoyle shard shifts meaning (sharp to smooth) but the transformation feels convenient rather than inevitably earned from prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—translation as alchemy, wounds as blueprints for regrowth—emerges through concrete particulars (coral fragment, cast scribbles, "ocean heals in whispers") rather than thesis statements. The final coral gesture and cast-as-flag image offer a non-literal answer to "can meaning regrow from ruin?" without overt moralizing. However, the closing paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("even broken things could hold the blueprint for something whole") and the ocean's whisper-back feels like authorial confirmation rather than ambiguous resonance. The widow's eulogy flashback and ecosystems-aquarium memory add texture but also dilute present-tense pressure with reflective drift. Subtext operates in the translated lines and coral symbolism, but the ending's optimism ("seed waiting to sprout") resolves tension tidily instead of leaving a charged question.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the exposed-film metaphor: history waiting in darkness until developed by the display's light. "Painted with light, yes, but she'd also painted with hope, and the two were inseparable" integrates concept and emotion without didacticism. The fresco fragment functions as both literal object and thematic carrier, its laughter "echoing through the orchard as if amplified by the fog itself." The ending's image of the district moving from lost to found answers the central question of whether joy can be resurrected without stating a moral. Minor slip: "pensive mirth" as a phrase sometimes feels asserted rather than fully embodied in the texture, though the juxtaposition of Marla dancing while Lira trembles captures it well.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of nested awakenings and curiosity over certainty emerges through the nickel, mural, and lullaby pattern. "Curiosity begets curiosity. Certainty is a cage" and the final assertion that "awakening was not a destination, but a rhythm" tip into direct statement. The flapper woman holding an identical nickel offers a resonant mirror, but the ending paragraph moralizes rather than trusting the image to carry thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.6)
    The premise (secret communication via plant patterns in a surveillance state) is conceptually rich, but the story defaults to telling theme rather than earning it. "After thoughts become taxable" recurs as a slogan without on-page dramatization of surveillance pressure or the cost of defiance. The club's work and Elias's garden remain abstractions—no consequences, no counter-pressure. The bioluminescent "RESIST" reads as spectacle, not a resonant answer to the central question of how defiance survives when thought is policed.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.7)
    The blossom armistice as truce between sorrow and dawn emerges from the postcard and recurs at closure when pain and beauty "coexist without silence or surrender." The tree as physical embodiment of centuries of longing anchors theme in image rather than statement. However, "photosynthesize pain into beauty" is stated twice without being fully dramatized through conflicting wants, and the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("she realized") instead of letting the singing image stand alone. The resonance is present but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation as evolution, memory as collaboration, and the cost of letting the past transform. The cracked tube becomes a resonant particularity, its fissure enabling new harmony. The final image—"deserted marvels…waiting…to be remade"—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the director's line "You've preserved the act of remembering" edges toward thematic echo, and "foxglove regret" is named once without anchoring in action or choice. The piece resists easy binaries and invites reflection, though the emotional stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—languages as trust, silence as blockage—emerges clearly through the love letter translation and the sisters' manuscript. The "symphonies of truth" and "interconnected promises" concepts thread through the research beats. However, the final passage directly states the theme ("Even when we're silent, our hearts speak in the language of belonging"), and Elara's phone explanation to Mira ("It's about… promises. And trust. And how even silence can be a kind of language") functions as overt thesis delivery. The ending smile and "river finally unblocked" resolve the question tidily rather than offering resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (compassion hidden in precision, order meeting chaos) emerges from concrete images: adhesive patterns, chain links, floodgate balance. The final message—"I trust you to hold them... to mend it"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, "harmonize conflicting values" is stated more than dramatized; Lira experiences no friction between machinery and emotion. The ending's thematic charge is present but muted by the protagonist's untroubled competence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of legacy, reinvention, and echo emerges through particulars: faked data, the song, dust as language. The final departure offers a non-literal answer to the central question of preservation versus delivery. However, the dream's wisdom ("the echo...is in the space between") edges toward explicit statement, and the closing line—"blooming and withering all at once"—feels ornamental rather than earned from prior image work. Strong thematic grounding with minor lapses in subtlety at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of necessary distances and sacred thresholds emerges through the terrace, maze, and logbook codes rather than direct statement. The final image—Lira writing her own codes at the field's edge—offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, late-paragraph philosophizing ("Distance is a kind of prayer," "Some thresholds...are sacred because they remind us how far we've come") edges toward moralizing. The butterfly-effect concept remains abstract and label-driven rather than embodied in on-page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of belonging emerges through Mara's work, the alignment ritual, and the burnt feather as a bridge between surface and depth. "Even here, where the sun never directly touches, there's a rhythm" offers thematic resonance tied to concrete image. The phrase "rhythm of belonging" recurs but edges toward abstraction. The ending ties the alignment to connection without overt moralizing, though "shadowseam wonder" in the final paragraphs feels like prompt echo rather than earned image. Subtext operates in the researchers' silent participation and Mara's quiet satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme—memory, loss, and the necessity of letting go—emerges from the crater glass, scattered seeds, and vanishing paths. The final realization ("released," not "forgotten") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the insight is delivered as summary ("Because holding onto them hurts too much") rather than through image or renunciation with cost. The piece invites reflection but does not offer a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question via concrete particulars at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (order within chaos, serendipity as art) emerges from events and the bishop's-piece motif. The mechanized clown and fountain-glow weave subtext without overt statement. However, the ending leans toward validation rather than a non-literal answer with cost—the crowd erupts, the vendor joins, the drunk sings, all affirming Lira's method without friction or counter-reading. The final exchange ("Always. Between acts.") is warm but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (the tension between abandonment and rootedness, cosmos and earth) is declared through exposition ("to fledge and anchor") rather than emerging from dramatized choices. The nostalgia ban and elective exile remain abstract backdrops; no concrete action tests their cost. The final image ("her heart full of obsidian grace") restates the premise without reweighting it. Thematic statements replace scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of finding value in the mundane emerges through Elara's craft lens and the prism imagery, avoiding direct statement in most beats. The final notebook line ("even the smallest things can hold the light of the world") trends toward thematic summary but remains tied to the concrete prism. However, the ending offers affirmation rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material; the ritual succeeds as planned, with no tension between want and cost or resonant complication.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—transformation through acceptance of scars, fire as renewal—emerges from the hourglass, the ridge, and the forest's resilience without overt moralizing. The porcelain box's cracks as "map of fractures" and sand as "liquid silver" function as non-literal answers to Elias's quest. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("pain could be a kind of fertilizer," "he'd found a language") rather than letting the image alone carry resonance, and "enlightened" in the penultimate line flirts with prompt-label territory.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (hope as tactile equation, bridges between fractured realities) emerges from the trial balloon work and the recurring motif of parallel timelines. The silver thread glowing and the final image of the balloon rising frame hope as embodied craft rather than abstraction. However, the piece edges toward stating its theme: "equations for hope weren't abstract; they were tactile, woven from light and intention" is close to a thesis sentence. The ending image (grotto's mouth "like a mouth about to speak") offers resonance but doesn't fully reweight prior material with new pressure. Elara's insight arrives without ambiguity or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the passage's "living architecture," the diaries' legacy burden, and the film negative's ghost-of-what-was. The final image—"You are the map"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the opening question and Lira's inheritance. Subtext operates in gesture (burning the negative, the locket's warmth) and the passage's voice ("a throat, and we are the food"). Minor penalty for one moment of near-thematic echo: "The legacy's burden is not in the keeping, but in the sharing" reads slightly prompt-declarative, though it is embedded in the found diary and does not occur in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of reflection versus reality, memory versus presence, emerges through the mirrors and borrowed heartbeat without overt statement. The "possibilities beyond edges" motif recurs purposefully and the final meadow image of a woman with Lirael's eyes offers resonance. Yet the ending pivots to assertion ("she knew") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material—the "unchanged" mirrors could charge irony but the text immediately retreats into comfort ("quiet comfort," "secrets"). The piece earns thematic coherence but stops short of the earned wisdom or conceptual repricing that would elevate it into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of redemption's price emerges through the treaty work and statue imagery, and the flawed-beauty concept is woven into the "rough edges" and "ambiguous language" of the treaty. However, the final paragraphs risk over-articulation: "the price of redemption would never be fully paid" and "the act of trying...was worth the cost" state the theme rather than letting the image carry it. The clipboard's scars offer resonance, but thematic weight is told more than earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the iridescent egg, the map of cracks, the vial of final river water, the looped bird recording. The piece explores grace within amorality without stating a moral, allowing the protagonist's twisted sentimentality to resonate without redemption or condemnation. The final image of the yellowed map admired for "abstract beauty" while visitors remain unaware offers a resonant answer to the central question—preservation of echo over substance. However, "Some truths were better left cracked" and "that, he decided, was enough" edge toward thematic statement rather than letting the image alone speak. Recurrence (egg, map, recording, bird's call) reweights prior material without forced symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (defiance of conformity, voice as resistance) emerges clearly from the premise and is reinforced by motifs (lullaby, echoes, threads). However, the final image—"the world had shifted, just slightly, toward the light"—tells its meaning rather than embodying it through particulars. The "harvest of echoes" and "symphony of resistance" drift into abstraction; the ending summarizes theme rather than reweighting it through a charged image. The whispered "Thank you" to unhearing echoes gestures toward complexity but retreats from confronting it.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (ethical storytelling as coexistence of dark and light) emerges through the puppet show's mechanics and the campfire metaphor. The closing image—"a campfire, flickering in the dark, inviting you to lean in"—offers resonance without stating a moral. However, Elias's final realization ("The ethical story...wasn't a tidy package") edges toward explicit thesis. The "half-truths are the only kind worth telling" line risks thematic echo, though it's delivered in dialogue rather than narration.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—bearing witness to the unseen—emerges from image and action rather than statement until the final paragraphs, which over-explain ("her purpose: to bear witness, to remember, to honor"). The moth wing and monarch juxtaposition carries symbolic weight, but the lattice's dissolution is told, not shown, blunting the transiency motif. The ending offers philosophizing ("transiently rooted beauty of existence") instead of a non-literal answer rooted in scene particulars. Complexity is gestured toward but resolved into tidy affirmation without counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—memory as "a braid of light and shadow," the sound of forgotten names—emerges organically from the rope ritual and the mosaic of names without overt moralizing. The punched card and rope reconfigure memory through specific, non-obvious means (threading pattern, perforations as melody). The final image (names burning brighter, a chorus of wind and chimes) offers resonant reconfiguration without stating a moral. However, the ending leans toward symbolic convenience: the rope simply works, and Lira's voice becomes "a chorus" without conceptual friction or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (integration, paths choosing walkers, decay as renewal) emerges from recurring images but is over-articulated in the hologram's exposition and the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("a directive in motion, a hymn to the walkers who dare to listen"). The ending offers a stated moral rather than a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in early sensory work (vines clawing concrete, bergamot and iron scent) is strong, but the closure beat abandons implication for explanation. Thematic Echo penalty: the hologram and final paragraphs articulate the thesis in prompt-like language ("transcend," "integrate," "precisely playful force"), especially egregious in the final paragraph (−0.7).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (devotion encoded in math, curiosity as covenant) emerges from image and action, not sermon. The tile-as-mirror conceit offers fresh inflection. Yet the ending articulates theme overtly: "some truths were too vast for telescopes" and the translated word *"Asharu"* function as thesis statements rather than resonant particulars. The mentor's scoffing and Elara's smile feel hedged against real renunciation. No plausible counter-reading lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (grace through release, imperfection as strength) emerges through the broken pin's transformation and recurs across visitor beats. However, the final paragraph ("grace had shifted. And that was enough") states the theme rather than letting the image resonate. The pin's scars "gleaming like stars" is a strong particular, but Kael's articulation ("I think… I understand") and Lirael's summary reduce thematic complexity to a tidy resolution. The piece gestures toward ambiguity ("the lesson wouldn't stick forever") yet undercuts it with sentimental reassurance.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—navigating rather than erasing boundaries—emerges through the sextant's reversal and the mirror-making craft. The final image (needle pointing inward) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the piece leans toward abstract philosophizing ("space between breaths") and the dream-as-metaphor remains underdeveloped. Subtext operates in the synchronized breathing ritual, but the thematic payoff is more stated ("he smiled, understanding") than earned through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of persistence and using forgotten things emerges from events, but the ending summarizes ("She'd mended more than quartz. She'd mended a promise, a legacy, a way forward") rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. The deciduous-vow concept is mentioned twice but remains a label without dramatized friction between adaptation and cost. No counter-reading is invited; the piece affirms its premise without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—legacy as choice rather than blood or time—emerges through image: the blank transforming, the fractal shell, the carved tree. The voice's assertion "You inherit what you choose to see" verges on direct statement, but the grotto's infinite-library vision and the final fusion ground the concept in scene. The ending reweights prior bewilderment into acceptance without moralizing, and "brightened disquiet" modulates the closure tone. Subtext operates in the whispering blossoms and the missing-but-waiting name. The piece resists tidy answers, though the board's "forbidden knowledge" motif is invoked without dramatized friction. One subtle overstatement: "some truths were meant to be lived, not exhibited" borders on thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of ignorance versus mastery emerges through the diary's gaps and the Door's inscription, but the orchid and "Symphony of Forgetting" feel like symbolic convenience introduced late rather than earned from prior particulars. The final line ("ready to listen") gestures toward thematic resonance but doesn't reweight earlier material with undeniable cost. The "renegotiate" motif recurs but remains more plot mechanic than thematic depth. No overt moralizing, yet the epiphany ("gaps mirrored her own blind spots") trends toward thesis statement rather than felt discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of reclaiming lost identity through memory is coherent, and "unkindled solace" recurs as a charged phrase. However, the ending over-articulates the thesis: "The garden isn't a place—it's a choice. To remember what we've lost" is direct thematic statement replacing scene pressure. The name-flowers and twin-petaled bloom offer visual resonance, but the final image does not reweight prior material with ambiguity; instead it resolves into tidy wholeness. The seamstress's memory infusion is graceful subtext, yet the closure defaults to explained epiphany rather than earned, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "fables of absence" concept and "merging timelines" motif are seeded early and return at closure, but theme leans heavily on direct exposition: the scroll's title *On the Merging of Absences* and Elara's realization that she's "a weaver of timelines" state rather than embody the theme. The final beam of light offers a striking image, yet without friction or ambiguity the ending reads as a tidy answer rather than a resonant question that reweights prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of balance (sound/silence, hush/hum) emerges organically through the caves' ecosystem and the mapkeeper's role. The bloom of hush functions as a concrete image rather than a label, and the final line "a duet of hush and hum" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the energy beings' transformation from storm to "wind through leaves." The piece resists tidy closure while landing thematic weight cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—meaning woven into chaos, fragments worth rekindling—emerges organically from Elara's retrocognitive visions and the prism's history. The final image of the pavilion's song drawing survivors offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. Yet the piece leans on direct thematic statements in the final paragraphs ("coincidences are not random—they are the universe's way of whispering") and the epilogue summarizes rather than dramatizes the theme's spread, reducing subtextual charge.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (memory as shaping force vs. clinging) emerges from concrete actions—measuring shadows, listening to crystal vibrations—and the fog's solidity supplies a purposeful anchor. The final image (crystal humming louder, Lirael walking lighter) offers a non-literal answer without overt moralizing. Yet the penultimate paragraph's direct articulation ("To sculpt identity from experience wasn't about holding onto the past—it was about letting it shape you") functions as thematic summary that partially undercuts the image's work, preventing full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—unlit potential within oneself, defying gravity through fire—emerges from the blooming lilies and the mentor's lessons. The kerosene knot and fire-lilies function as recurring images that reweight at closure. Yet the final realization ("shadows weren't darkness, but unlit potential") is stated rather than discovered through a non-literal image, and the mentor's map metaphor leans toward direct thesis. The piece invites reflection but the ending articulates the theme rather than letting the image resonate without comment.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (transition as fertile pause, metamorphosis) emerges through cicada imagery and tidal rhythm, with the final exchange offering a non-literal answer. However, the articulation risks becoming too tidy: Elara's closing line about fermentation and breathing edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image do the work. The cicada recurs with shifted meaning, but "some truths could only be grasped indirectly" is borderline meta-commentary. Subtext in the dialogue is present but the piece occasionally tells its theme rather than fully trusting the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of containment versus expansion emerges through concrete images (bunker/trellis, metallic/honey silence, doll/sprout), avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph's "stretching contracted fears into something like hope" leans slightly didactic. The doll-to-sprout transformation offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Lila's claustrophobia question. Subtext operates in the father's steady hands/tremor voice contradiction and Lila's mouth-opening gesture to "swallow" silence. The penultimate paragraph ("learned that by limiting her exposure") edges toward articulating the premise rather than letting the sprout image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (the presence of silence versus absence of noise) emerges through the storm glass as prism metaphor and Elara's shift from teaching silence to noticing it. The final image reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the conceptual answer arrives through a told epiphany ("she'd always thought silence needed to be taught, but perhaps it only needed to be noticed") rather than a non-literal image that lets the reader construct meaning. The train whistle as "bridge between worlds" reads close to abstract thematic statement rather than earned from scene particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.6)
    The throne-as-mirror theme is signaled through the murals and lands in the final revelation, offering a non-literal answer to self-realization. However, the closing paragraph ("The future wasn't a place to fear—it was a story to write") delivers an explicit thematic summary that replaces scene pressure, triggering a −0.6 penalty. The concept of "unclaimed throne" functions more as symbol than lived particulars that constrain Lira's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—connection as survival, bridges rebuilt—emerges from the doorknocker ritual and Kael's return. Yet the closing paragraph edges toward explanation: "some bridges were meant to be rebuilt" and "even in the emptiness, there was still a chance to breathe" state the lesson rather than letting the handgrip and dawn image resonate without commentary. The final moves risk Thematic Echo, dampening the non-literal answer the piece otherwise builds.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of resilience under pressure emerges through Mara's arc and the "pressure into diamonds" metaphor, but the final text—"Diamonds are a metaphor"—states rather than enacts this insight. The porthole bolt and quantum device recur but their symbolic freight (key to resilience) is spelled out. The ending smile and harvesting scene offer closure warmth without ambiguity or cost, trending toward tidy resolution. No counter-reading pressure or moral complexity complicates the "survival and beauty" thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of legacy-as-sacrifice emerges through the letters and the tomb-to-cradle transformation. "Sound is memory made flesh" and the dynasty-ender frame cohere with the closure concept. Yet the final paragraph edges into direct statement ("not a tragedy but a rebirth") rather than letting the image alone reweight prior material. The gramophone crank recurs purposefully, but its thematic weight is partially undercut by the expository letter dump that tells the dynasty's choice instead of dramatizing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—patterns as lived dance versus captured essence—emerges through the alchemists' hubris, the marionette's strings, and Cedric's realization. The final line ("The strings were never meant to hold you") lands as thematic summary rather than resonant non-literal image, lowering the score. The orbs and stage serve as concrete anchors, and the shift from capture to participation is clear. However, the wheat field and glowing skin veer toward symbolic convenience, and "shivering bliss" is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—intergenerational erasure, the archive as witness, small acts of recovery—emerges through the button's layered history and Elias's method. The final image ("Unknown Histories: The Button") offers a non-literal answer: cataloging absence is itself a form of care. However, the last two sentences tip into direct thematic statement ("he knew enough to magnify the small kindnesses") rather than letting the scene image carry resonance. Subtext operates in the dust patterns and the button's date, but the ending articulates rather than enacts the theme, lowering the score from high-7 range.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of resistance against erasure and indifference emerges from the "revised histories" files and Mara's inherited mission. The phone booth key as symbol of defunct rebellion nodes is efficient setup. However, thematic resonance remains shallow: the final image ("The line had held") declares triumph without interrogating cost, ambiguity, or moral friction. No counter-pull (e.g., what holding the line demands of Mara personally, what dissent costs the 23rd District now) complicates the premise. The starlight "winking like secrets" and the warm key feel like poetic punctuation rather than a non-literal answer to a thematic question the story has earned.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of silencing dangerous truths through art emerges clearly from the premise and is reinforced by the "negative space" method and the final reflection on "secrets safe in the negative space between notes." However, the ending tilts toward restating the theme rather than letting the image do the work: "some truths were meant to stay hidden, at least for now" and "The code remained unbroken, the veil intact" feel like theme summaries. The prism atrium and dewdrops offer resonant bookends, but the articulated moral ("For today, that was enough") weakens the non-literal answer that 7+ requires. The piece asks a clear question but answers it partly through assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—folklore as lived language, the bridge between past and prophecy—emerges through the moonstone dust's transformation and the monument-building practice. The arbor "leaning closer, as if listening" and the dust "emerging transformed always" offer layered imagery. Yet the ending resolves into summary ("the world, for now, made sense") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer; the plea to "seek out Lirael" opens a question the text does not reweight.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of control vs. uncertainty emerges through the compass-as-mirror motif and the recurring "uncertainly certain" phrase. The subterranean waterfall as motion beneath failure is a strong particular, and "let the leaves swirl" ties the greenhouse to the thematic question. However, the final journal entry ("To befriend uncertainty in planning, is to let the leaves swirl") edges toward explicit thesis statement, and the clockwork-flower idea feels more symbolic gesture than earned answer rooted in prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—names as anchors, kintsugi mending, balance through acceptance—emerges through image (coin, bowl, cracks filled with gold) and Lira's dialogue. However, Lira's lines ("balance isn't about equal parts"; "by exploring your limits") veer into direct thematic statement rather than leaving resonance implicit. The kintsugi bowl and coin reprise function well, but the final exchange edges toward sermon ("some questions don't have answers") rather than a non-literal answer arising from scene particulars. The foundry-as-cathedral pivot is evocative but slightly on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme—laughter as healing, truth as necessary pain—is stated explicitly by the spectral figure and then summarized in the final paragraph ("healing was not a destination—it was a pursuit"). The crocodile's tooth as symbol of "resilience, of enduring pain to find light" is articulated by Lira's reflection rather than demonstrated through a choice that costs her something. The ending offers a moral rather than a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in scene particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—mercy as question rather than solution—emerges through image (strap, spores, fractals) and avoids overt moralizing until the woman's line "Mercy isn't an equation" borders on thesis statement. The final paragraph ("not as a solution, but as a question") edges toward abstract wrap-up but is partly redeemed by the concrete image of clasping the strap and walking. Spores as "halo of forgiveness" and "ultraviolet penance" risk symbolic convenience; the UV motif recurs but is seeded late rather than established as a constraint from the opening. Resonance is present but relies on prompt-adjacent language.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—honoring overlooked histories, translation as connection—is articulated directly in the final paragraph rather than earned through scene particulars. The lighthouse and fragment recur but do not constrain choice or charge closure with undeniable cost. The weaver's line "Anchors of intuition aren't just for holding on. Sometimes, they're for letting go" reads as a thematic placeholder. The ending offers a stated moral instead of a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (grief hidden in cracks, stories trapped until acknowledged) emerges organically from the circus fire backstory and the stuck elevator as metaphor. The photograph with the smudged child's face and the clown's "cracked features" reprise character and image without overt statement. However, the final paragraph risks mild sermonizing ("he'd repair the stories hidden in the cracks") and the clown's whispered "Thank you" leans toward tidy closure that resolves ambiguity rather than deepening it. The core concept integrates with theme through specific events, lifting the score into the 6-band, but the ending's neatness and label-like interiority ("weightless burden of understanding") prevent higher resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges from the premise: perfect order as cage, rupture as awakening, compression of eternity into a moment. The frost patterns and bottled whisper carry symbolic weight, but the final paragraphs over-explain the theme ("The library's perfect order had been a cage, and the whisper had been the key"). The patrons' transformation—"remembered things they had forgotten"—is summarized rather than embodied in a specific action or image. The ending gestures toward resonance ("a new spiral formed, waiting") but the moral calculus (what was lost to gain this awakening?) remains abstract, not earned through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme—truth buried by power, mirrors as distorted reflections—is stated overtly: "By obscuring the Council's distorted reflections, he'd forced them to confront the raw, unpolished truth." The final paragraph moralizes: "Civilizations...were built on the courage to see what mirrors hide." The vase shard and fungi are symbolic convenience rather than particulars that earn insight. The piece tells its theme instead of letting it emerge from Kael's choices and their cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through the covenant's creed, the philosopher's stone as mirror rather than cure, and the motif of "midnight stealing light by convincing us to hide our shadows." The final image—the box playing true as a "tether between past and present, loss and hope"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. The stone chip's flare when Lira speaks truth embodies the core question (Can honesty restore what deception corrupted?) in a concrete, non-abstract moment. Subtext operates in Elias's calibrated pressure on the widow and the covenant's euphemisms. The piece avoids overt sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—mysteries that resist explanation, the edge of the unknowable—emerges through concrete particulars: the spinning compass, psychometry flashes, the lagoon's indifferent presence. "Hinged awakenings" and "place where explanations fail" are somewhat prompt-literal but integrated into action. The final image of labeled jars and the silent compass offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor deduction: "curiosity outlived certainty" in the closing beats edges toward thematic statement rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of complexity-as-tapestry and simplicity-as-thread emerges from the premise, but the final paragraph states it overtly: "The island's complexity wasn't a burden; it was a tapestry, and simplicity was the thread that held it together." The sculptures' reinterpretation (kelp hair as timeline, clockwork heart as mechanism) reads as symbolic convenience introduced late rather than particulars that earned the insight. "Timewoven alliances" and "scaffold complexity with simplicity" are prompt labels repeated without dramatized cost. The ending smile and continued sculpting offer no non-literal answer or resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of light/dark communion and "reckoning with the hush" emerges through repeated images (night-blooming jasmine, bioluminescent murals, the moon's pull). However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly—"Flowers bloom at night not in defiance, but in communion"—rather than letting the ending image answer the question non-literally. The window as "a promise of mysteries yet to unfold" offers conceptual possibility but no resonant reconfiguration with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme of erasure vs. truth is announced repeatedly ("They'll erase us all," "history's written by victors") rather than emerging from image and action. The final line—"Let them find it"—reads as a thesis statement, not a resonant image that reweights prior material. Mara's arc from "trapped in loops" to holder of blank diary offers no non-literal answer to the central question; the codex destruction and her survival feel like plot mechanics rather than thematic reckoning with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (memory as restorative force, civilization rebuilt from will rather than stone) emerges from images and events rather than explicit statement. The amber bottle's shift from "barrier" to "lens" offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the ending risks abstraction: "a civilization rebuilt not from stone and mortar, but from memory and will" edges toward meta-commentary. The ghosts' transformation from spectral to "fleeting images of their former selves" resonates but lacks the grounded cost that would anchor theme in Elias's own sacrifice or limit.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges through the motif of roots versus leaves (memory versus present awareness) and the prophecy as "awakening" rather than disaster. The wax cylinder reprise reweights the field-trip memory with new harmonic data, creating a lyric pattern. However, the final image—stars as "silent counterpoint"—feels decorative rather than resonant; the closing line "The roots remembered, and so would he" restates the theme without adding conceptual or emotional cost. The piece invites reflection but stops short of a non-literal answer that transforms prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.6)
    The central question—what is the texture of borrowed time—receives an answer ("gritty like sand, smooth like water") but it arrives as abstract summary rather than emerging from concrete scene particulars. The paradox of decreasing entropy by introducing disorder is stated twice but never tested through a micro-choice that reveals thematic friction. The oak sapling and melting ice offer a non-literal closing image, but the connection to prior material (heirloom seeds, generational inheritance) is ornamental rather than reweighted by the ending. The "furiously tranquil" motif is declared, not embodied or charged at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the bell's dual notes and Lira's shift from noise-making to listening. "Favoring listening over noise" is dramatized through action rather than stated until Veyra names it—borderline thematic echo but tied to embodied practice. The final image of quiet power and alliance with winds offers resonance. Yet the closing paragraph's reflective summary ("knowing that zero hour had passed") states the thematic answer rather than letting the bell's silence and settled clouds speak for themselves, reducing non-literal charge.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of vulnerability-as-strength and the metaphor of falling stars are coherent throughout. The final image (stardust in the lantern) offers a non-literal emblem, and the closing "act of letting go" ties back to the opening premise. However, the theme is stated more than dramatized: "In its death, she found a mirror of her own journey" is direct philosophizing rather than earned insight from specific struggle. The piece resists moralizing in the final beat, but the earlier on-page articulations ("courage to let go," "acceptance of motion") blunt the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of unspoken words and tangled covenants emerges organically through the box, ghosts, and Elias's silence. The final image—shards scattering like stars—offers a resonant visual answer without stating a moral. However, "the weight of unspoken words" is repeated almost verbatim, and the line "some words were too heavy to carry alone" skirts platitude. The theme is coherent but lacks the non-obvious inflection required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—time as memory embedded in objects—emerges through the urn fragment, capsule relics, and garage-sale conceit. The final image ("mosaic of moments, each one fragile and infinite") reweights prior material, and the architect's entropy obsession provides thematic counterpoint. However, the piece leans toward overt philosophizing: "timelessness wasn't an absence of time—it was a layering" and "the texture of time passing wasn't in clocks or calendars—it was in the way objects held memories." These articulations border on thesis statements rather than resonant particulars. The urn fragment's return—carrying his wife's laughter—offers emotional specificity, but the closing paragraph ("He'd rediscovered time's true shape") edges into moralizing summary.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—transience, beauty in the incomplete, harmonizing discord—emerges through imagery (frayed kite string, woven kelp, drake's feather) and the act of tending. However, the final paragraphs over-articulate: "beauty was not a fixed state but a process," "the act of creation mattered more than its permanence." These statements replace scene pressure with exposition. The feather's resonance and the lagoon's rhythms provide some non-literal charge, lifting the score above mid-range despite the moralizing drift.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the copper-oak lattice as a "bridge" between stone and wood, spirits and humans. The spirit's question "Why?" and Lira's answer—"pain can be a language"—risk overt statement but are grounded in prior tactile work. The diary and copper recur with shifting weight, and the final image (orchard holding her breath) offers resonant CR. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces complexity, though "brazen calm" as character label borders on prompt echo. No final-paragraph moralizing; the seed-crack/wire-tighten coda reweights prior material without explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of artificial versus authentic homecoming emerges through the Enclave's chemistry claim and Kael's insistence on collision. The final image—mirrors, convergence, seeing oneself—gestures at insight but remains abstract; "you finally saw yourself" is a stated moral rather than a resonant image that reweights prior particulars. The bronze quiet recurs but does not shift meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the seed pods, fertilizer from the reef's "final gasp," and the coachman's shift from soldier to gardener. "Submerged concord" and the dead-language term *Khalis* ("the space between breaths") enrich rather than announce the thematic question of harmony beneath chaos. The final whisper—"The earth remembers"—and the image of flowers "flickering like tiny flames" offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the piece trends meditative rather than dramatically earned; the thematic weight rests on stated belief ("he believed the garden… could stitch them back together") more than on-page struggle that transforms understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (connection forged from fragments) emerges through the wax leaf and phonograph grooves as binding images. The closing "hum of connection" reweights distance into closeness with lyric resonance. However, the final riddle's answer—"love"—is stated rather than embodied, and the "tinted revelations" remain abstract. The story resists overt moralizing until the penultimate beat ("You've turned tinted revelations into something real"), which slightly flattens subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme (confusion as compass, exploration vs. stasis) emerges organically from the deck's dilation mechanics and Elio's ritual. The compass-north metaphor accumulates purposefully and the final image reweights it without stating a moral. However, the grandmother's line "Confusion is just exploration's first draft" edges toward thematic statement rather than subtext. The piece resists neat resolution and invites reflection, with the golden-light threshold offering a resonant non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme is overtly stated in the final paragraph: "the courage to swap the familiar for the mysterious" and "guardian of wonder, sacredly playful." These declarations replace earned resonance from prior particulars. The chess pieces and sundial are labeled as metaphors ("secrets hidden in plain sight") rather than allowed to accrue meaning through specific choice and friction. No plausible counter-reading or complexity complicates the triumphant resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme emerges around small, unnamed actors and the liminal space between crisis and performance. The chessboard metaphor (pawns removed, leaving only high pieces) illustrates the concept, and the final realization attempts resonance. However, the ending states its thesis directly: "history wasn't written by kings or queens, but by the pawns who dared to move"—a clear thematic summary rather than an image that invites inference. The "nomadic penumbra" and "luminous absence" feel like prompt labels inserted without dramatized exploration, reducing thematic subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—home as memory and the weight of others' truths—emerges from the stone and feather motifs. The final statement "It's in the act of remembering" is direct thematic summary rather than image-based resonance. Subtext operates in the mother's recorded voice and Lirael's hesitation, but the climax resolves into abstraction ("seed the world with truth") without a non-literal answer rooted in particulars. The piece invites reflection but the ending moralizes rather than reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (forgiveness requires weaving failure into something new rather than erasing it) emerges from the tapestry metaphor and Alaric's chess lesson callback. The prince's "every choice has consequences" line gains irony when Alaric realizes his mistake was woven into systemic corruption. However, the final insight—"some threads couldn't be untangled—only woven into something new"—is stated rather than shown through a non-literal image or action. The "new pupil to find" ending offers mild resonance but lacks the charged ambiguity or conceptual cost that would reweight prior material without a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—truth as kaleidoscope, rituals as rewritable poems, forgiveness as weapon—emerges from Kael's actions and the spire's transformation rather than direct moralizing. The final image (light painting the world, canyon sighing into new rhythm) offers a resonant answer to the premise without stating a moral. However, the piece leans heavily on prompt-adjacent phrasing: "refract a single truth into many," "rituals are just poems we've forgotten how to rewrite." The old woman's curiosity is asserted, not shown through a micro-choice or perceptual shift, weakening the thematic payoff. No motif earns recurrence credit; the spire is described but does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning beyond visual shimmer.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kintsugi as "honoring cracks" emerges organically from the charm-statue interaction and memory fragments. The final image—"kintsugi isn't about perfection, it's about surviving"—reweights the opening uncertainty and the repeated motif of "between breaths." However, "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" and "quilts memories together" veer toward thematic echo; the protagonist articulates the thesis rather than enacting it through a non-literal final choice. The line "tell the story of the cracks, tell it loud" borders on moralizing, though it's embedded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme ("temporary eternity," beauty in fractures) emerges from recurring images—cracked mirror, painted shell, pool reflection—without overt statement. The final drawing-beside-the-pool image reweights prior material, but the line "to hold onto the temporary as if it were eternal" edges into thematic echo. The cavern functions as a non-literal answer to the question of how to live with fracture, though the epiphany lacks concrete cost or counter-reading on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara's humming ritual and the contrast between shout and whisper, embodied in the vial cork's glow and the garden's teaching. The final line—"The proof was in the silence"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Thalos's "intent isn't loud. It's a current, not a wave" deepens the premise without becoming a thesis statement. The story resists easy binaries, leaving the fisherman/wife response ambiguous (warmth, pressure, but no spoken consequence). Minor thematic echo in Thalos's "flowers know things we don't" trends toward abstraction but stays grounded in jasmine's scent.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—memory, loss, and the act of retrieval—emerges organically from the censer foot, the phone calls, and the reverse migration concept. The recurring motif of the foot gains weight across beats, and the grandmother's voice charges the closure with emotional specificity. However, the final lines edge toward direct thematic statement ("The geography of loss was vast, but...she felt certain she could map it") rather than leaving the resonance implicit. The "lost were waiting" image risks sentimentality; the piece would benefit from a more oblique closing gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of truth-as-weapon emerges through the glass eye and ledger, but the final line—"The truth... could be a weapon—but only if you wielded it with care"—states the thesis rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The orchard and truffles recur but function as setting more than charged motifs. Mara's insight ("We occlude... with truth") is asserted, not earned through specific prior struggle. No purposeful ambiguity or counter-reading complicates the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme—isolation as carrying what isn't yours—emerges from Elias's line and the woman's loss, threading borrowed memories, guilt, and redemption. The Edelweiss shifts from confession token to "symbol… of hope," a purposeful reprise, though "hope" is told rather than shown through a charged image. The piece resists a tidy moral by keeping the captain's guilt unresolved (he's dead, his act irreversible), but the ending pivot to "a child's laughter waited to be reclaimed" veers toward soft sentimentality, diluting the complexity. Thematic statements ("redemption… had to be earned," "isolation isn't just about being alone") are direct rather than implicit, lowering subtext density at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of confronting buried choices emerges through the map, spiral, and vision particulars, avoiding overt thesis. The chip functions as a resonant object, and the father's line ("You're just following the ants") reweights the journey motif without moralizing. However, the final paragraph summary ("The lingering promise had been kept: not in the cavern, but in the journey") edges into theme-statement territory, and the vision sequence risks abstraction ("a mirror, reflecting the courage to choose"). The piece invites reflection through image more than through earned contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of self-confrontation and the cost of emotional avoidance emerges clearly, and the bleeding starlight functions as effective metaphor. However, the figure's final speech ("The starlight bleeds because you bleed") borders on thematic summary, and the queen's realization lacks a non-literal final image that reweights prior material—she simply turns and climbs down. The ending gestures toward resonance but stops short of delivering a charged, particular image that embodies the theme without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme—transformation through perspective shift, "revalue by returning differently"—emerges from the shell and engine motifs. However, the final paragraph moralizes: "The palette of resolve wasn't a tool—it was a philosophy." The ledger's phrase "palette of resolve" is echoed verbatim in Elara's epiphany, creating thematic echo rather than resonant particulars. The columella curl's "density of presence" and "scientifically romantic" idiom gesture toward a fusion of precision and awe, but these remain label-level rather than enacted through contradictory choices or images that reweight prior material without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—reconciling past and present, nostalgia as compass rather than trap—emerges from the grave, scroll, and jealousy of past selves. The birch bark and the blank scroll form a purposeful motif arc. However, the final insight is stated rather than imaged: "I wasn't trapped in the past; I was building it" reads as thesis summary, not a resonant reconfiguration arising from concrete particulars. The piece avoids overt moralizing but the closure leans explanatory, lowering thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (ordinary miracles, resilience through objects) emerges from the screw's history and Lira's interpretive lens. The final image (water clock chimes, river reflection, tapestry of resilience) reaches for resonance but the last paragraph's thesis statement ("unveiled an ordinary miracle… quiet art of reading between lines") names the theme overtly, undercutting earned emergence. The screw as talisman and the fog as metaphor for fractured perception work well. Lira's loss of smell anchors the thematic question in lived particulars, though her arc skips internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (scars as stories, fear into power, breath between storms) emerges from imagery and action, not assertion. The recurring crow quill and crystallized ink motifs support resonance, and the mentor's aphorisms frame the transformation. Yet the final paragraph edges into overt summary: "scars were not wounds but witnesses," "to transform pain into power, one must first shed the lies that cage the heart." These lines tell the theme rather than letting the image speak, softening the non-literal charge. The middle beats earn thematic credit, but the ending moralizes rather than trusting the rune-and-path image to carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of imperfect completion emerges through Clara's refrain ("Imperfect miracles require imperfect methods") and the final instruction to play "imperfectly, like all miracles." The perfume bottle as conduit for memory and the music as resonance create a coherent metaphor system. Yet the thematic statement is articulated rather than discovered, and the final paragraph's "Imperfectly. Like all miracles" risks moralizing the earned scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme is overtly stated ("truth was not a destination but a continuous process of unification") rather than earned through particulars. The dictionary's shifting definitions and the mural's awakening gesture toward cosmic paradox, but no specific event dramatizes the clash between illusion and truth. The final image—dictionary pages blank, Witness stepping into the unknown—offers a quiet conceptual reprise, but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the hydraulic clock mechanics, counting ritual, and razor-edged key rather than assertion. The final insight—clocks measure longing, "the ache to hold onto moments, the fear of letting them go"—reweights prior material without moralizing, though it edges toward statement rather than pure image. The grandfather's aphorisms and razor-edge metaphor ("truths are too sharp for words") integrate purposefully. Subtext operates effectively in the station's oblivious humming versus Lorn's transformed understanding, creating resonance that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of contradictions-as-mirrors emerges through image (mica pane warping light, subway scrawls, the chalk outline) and Ms. Greer's closing line crystallizes it, but the thematic statement is delivered rather than earned through Clara's choices. The scrawls and lantern motifs recur but their meaning doesn't deepen—they illustrate rather than test the premise. The final moment—tears mixing with rain, deciding to visit her father—gestures toward integration but the specific cost or insight Clara gains remains abstract; we're told she sees contradictions differently but not shown what she has renounced or accepted to reach that view.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.7)
    The "cultivated estrangement → connection" motif recurs but remains abstract; the glass disc as mirror and "melodically haunted" souls are stated rather than discovered through specific events. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "even wrong numbers could lead somewhere right" replaces scene pressure with thematic summary. The piece gestures toward transformation of loneliness but never earns a non-literal answer through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme—that covenants survive through attention to small moments rather than grand gestures—emerges clearly from particulars (the baker's bread, the child's shell, Elara's ink-stained hands). The locket photo provides human specificity, and the final image ("the act of preservation itself") reweights the premise without overt moralizing. However, the great-grandmother's story is told rather than integrated causally, and the covenant's mechanics remain abstract—"a chain of small, deliberate acts" is asserted more than demonstrated through friction or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of loneliness-as-language emerges through the conductor's speech, but this is direct statement rather than dramatized particulars. The moon rock's "reciprocity" is told rather than shown through constrained choices. The final image (station "lighter," chest "didn't ache as much") gestures toward resonance, yet the repricing lacks the on-page cost or specific earned insight that would elevate it beyond a gentle assertion. "Polite anarchy" remains a label without thematic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the motif of translation (ring absorbing languages, emotional map, "feeling becomes seeing") and the tension between blindness and deeper sight. The final image offers a resonant answer to the question of navigating emotional depths, but it skirts earned particulars—"memory made flesh" reads as abstract wish fulfillment rather than a thematic repricing grounded in prior cost. The story resists overt moralizing, yet the ending leans toward tidy resolution ("You found it") instead of ambiguity that lingers. Subtext operates in the ring's mechanics and forest harmonics, but closure wisdom feels declared rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—history as web, not line; collaboration over control—emerges from the anomaly, the projection, and Elias's final choice to witness rather than write. The seed metaphor recurs with purpose ("wrong seeds" → "turning mistakes into seeds") and the pen's hum charges the ending. Yet the final paragraph ("editing history wasn't about erasing mistakes. It was about turning them into seeds") states the theme rather than letting the image resonate alone. The web of contingent relationships is shown concretely but also over-articulated by Lira.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—silence as language, loneliness transformed—emerges from concrete imagery (the filmless camera, signing to water, violin weeping and laughing). The final paragraph drifts toward overt thematic summary: "silence wasn't emptiness—it was a canvas" and "The silence had spoken, and the world had listened" declare the theme rather than letting the ending image hold it. Thetwinge of sadness gestures toward complexity but does not reweight prior material with undeniable cost. Subtext operates effectively in Kael's gestures and Lira's hesitant bow before the final explanatory drift.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.4)
    The garden-versus-tomb metaphor and "vandalism as rescue" frame are stated early but resolved through explanation rather than image. The final paragraph moralizes: "the archive was not a place to be preserved but *revisited*." The tear that heals the portrait gestures toward emotional resonance but the thematic question (how to tend living knowledge) is answered in assertion, not through specific choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—memory as connection rather than curse—is stated outright: "The entanglement wasn't a curse; it was a gift." The final paragraph moralizes: "a promise... I had finally found my rhythm." The lagoon's memories remain abstract (joy, grief, longing) without grounding in specific, irreplaceable detail. One strength: the drumming motif recurs and shifts from solitary defiance to shared ritual, though the thematic echo in "breathe life into a shared dream" undercuts earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—silence over noise, observation over force—emerges from Elias's choices and the labyrinth's surveillance motif (maps labeled with "a date, a name, a walk"). The zodiac coin and recurring maps accumulate meaning across beats. Yet the final line "the labyrinth didn't need maps. It needed whispers" states the theme rather than letting the image resonate without summary. The discovered chamber of labeled maps hints at conceptual repricing (surveillance vs. autonomy) but does not impose a moral cost or ambiguity; Elias's theory is simply confirmed. The ending offers a clear answer rather than a resonant, non-literal one that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("silent empathy," teaching darkness the value of stars) is stated overtly in exposition rather than emerging from concrete action and image. The dental mirror's symbolic function (refracting light as metaphor) is explained by the narrator rather than felt through dramatized choice. The final image—Lira walking away with "its darkness a little less heavy"—asserts meaning instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is minimal; the piece tells its thesis directly, and "some truths were too deep for words" arrives as moralizing summary.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of "planting forests of second thoughts" as humble rebellion emerges through Clara's window displays and mentoring, and the chess-as-life metaphor integrates organically with the father's legacy. The final exchange where Lila recognizes Clara's work ("You're planting forests") and commits to continuation offers thematic resonance without overt moralizing. However, the phrase "humble rebellion" and "planting forests" are articulated by characters in near-prompt language, functioning as Thematic Echo that explains rather than dramatizes the premise. The grotto as a space "where past meets prophecy" remains more atmospheric gesture than a non-literal answer to a central question.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme of detachment and embracing true nature is stated overtly ("the island hadn't been a prison but a mirror," "freedom wasn't found in staying but in detaching") rather than emerging from scene particulars. The scrimshaw's single word "Detach" functions as a thematic label. The final image—Lira swimming toward the horizon, needing no talisman—offers a lyric answer, but the resolution into unambiguous freedom lacks the complexity or cost that would make it resonate beyond the declared moral. "Combative tenderness" is mentioned in summary but not enacted in scene tension.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (grief as transformation, imperfection as human, defiance through mundane ritual) emerges organically from the whittling beats and the dried flowers. The final image—spoon beside bouquet, vow to continue—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moral. However, explicit thematic statements proliferate: "Grief is like these flowers," "Lightness is not the absence of darkness," "Polishing is an act of defiance." These meta-commentaries replace scene pressure at peak moments, lowering the score. The piece invites reflection but leans on articulated thesis rather than letting the carved spoon and withered petals carry full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of boundary dissolution and the sacred/profane blur emerges through imagery (stone/air, solid/fluid, poet/poem) and recurs in the final image. However, the piece leans toward direct thematic statement ("boundaries began to dissolve," "she was shaping it," "the world is ours to reshape") rather than allowing the image to answer the question obliquely. The ending delivers conceptual resolution without ambiguity or felt tension; Lirael's certainty is untroubled, and no cost complicates her insight. The particulars—quartz, ice, atrium—are vivid but serve illustration more than they constrain or reweight the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—beauty in imperfection, cracks as fuel—emerges through glass-bird shards and the phoenix premise. "Beauty isn't in perfection... It's in the cracks" is direct thematic statement but somewhat earned by prior action (shattered bird, withered rose, fractals). Final image (phoenix from glass-bird/ivy/thorns) attempts non-literal answer, yet the moth's on-the-nose "You've awakened" / "I've just started to see" exchange functions as Thematic Echo, restating the premise in prompt-like language. Subtext operates in Marla's trades and the plants' rustling "language," but the ending over-articulates rather than trusting image alone. Resonance is present but diluted by summary.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (connection as presence rather than construction) emerges organically from the cave revelation and lens grooves. The final image ("We keep questioning") gestures toward open inquiry but stops short of a resonant, non-literal answer—it states the theme rather than embodying it through charged particulars. "Powerfully gentle" appears three times as a label without dramatized friction. The ending avoids moralizing yet also avoids embedding conceptual cost in a concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—grief as light that can be refracted, the art of mending what cannot be unbroken—emerges through the curtains ritual, the stencil motif, and the coordinates tucked into origami. The final image (pendant with vellum sliver, inscription "Light the way") reweights prior material without stating a moral. However, the piece leans toward thematic assertion: "The curtains of intention were not a cure for grief, but a language for it" reads as authorial summary rather than inference from particulars. The rock-bottom-as-foundation conclusion borders on platitude, preventing entry into the 7.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of rebuilding from chaos emerges through image (cards, tape, rain as lens) rather than statement. The final line "the loft, as always, listened" offers quiet resonance tied to prior material. However, thematic weight rests on abstract claims ("Understanding," "inherited mystery") more than earned particulars. The "scars could be maps" metaphor in the penultimate beat borders on platitude. Subtext operates in silence and gesture (Mara's tattoo, jaw-clenching), though the teaching sequence over-explains rather than letting implication carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—innocence versus curiosity, the archive as seed not tomb—emerges from image and action rather than explicit moralizing. The final image (walking deeper, saffron veil fluttering) offers a non-literal answer to the central question without a stated moral. "Atoms of nostalgia" recurs with shifting weight, though the metaphor remains abstract. The ending avoids the explain-everything trap, but the thematic resonance is muted by the lack of visible cost; Lirael's "purpose" is asserted rather than earned through prior sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.7)
    Hope as a shapeless, fraying thing is a strong conceptual anchor, and the closing image of books rearranging into new titles offers a non-literal answer. However, the resolution leans on prompt language ("preserve the shape of hope," "room to grow") that echoes the setup without surprise. The shadow's hunger "not for destruction, but for definition" provides thematic specificity, but Lirael's final realization ("We did it. The past and present.") states the theme rather than letting the particulars resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—fragility as resilience, compassion as survival—emerges from the chameleon metaphor and Lira's reconstructive acts. The tail's spiral of colors and the act of shedding layers avoid overt thesis statements and work through image. Yet the final paragraph edges toward summary moralizing ("compassion wasn't a liability. It was the reason to keep going"), reducing the quiet resonance the preceding beats had built. The thematic question is answered, but with more assertion than the earned particulars warrant, preventing the piece from fully trusting its own imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (scars as stories, honoring the past without being chained) emerges from concrete image work and the coffee-ring structure. The hourglass-as-miracle motif recurs with shifting weight. However, the final paragraph's "to honor the past without being chained to it" borders on summary moralizing, and "The displaced miracle had finally found its place" is a near-explicit thematic claim that replaces scene pressure. The piece invites reflection but edges toward stating rather than earning its insight.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (unused love as latent potential, grief as containment) emerges clearly from the Elise/Thomas backstory and the motif of hidden letters. The ending gestures toward resonance: "unused love wasn't lost; it was just waiting," reweighting the grandmother's whispers and the film canisters. However, the insight is stated rather than embodied in a final image or action that surprises the reader; Mara's smile and descent illustrate the theme without complicating it. The lilac scent and the building's approving creak risk symbolic convenience. The piece avoids overt moralizing but does not offer a non-literal answer or ambiguity that lingers beyond the immediate plot.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of trapped creativity waiting to be unlocked emerges through the stardust jars and the aurora's "breath of imprisoned gods," but the final image—Kael standing, brushing dust, smiling—offers no non-literal answer or reweighting of prior material; it simply restates the premise. The line "The unspoken words had been here all along" is an explicit theme statement rather than earned resonance. The stardust's specificity (labeled jars, static electricity) adds texture, yet the resolution into easy fulfillment flattens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—imagination and renewal after catastrophic loss—emerges from the burnt forest and fading sparks, and the chess clock's midnight metaphor (decision-point) charges the midpoint. The final dream of star-tangled forests offers a resonant image rather than a stated moral. However, the woman's direct exposition ("the archive is a wave function," "you must choose to cultivate") borders on thematic over-articulation. The coat-of-light bequest and the sparks-growing reprise provide quiet closure without sermonizing, but the conceptual scaffolding occasionally intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.1)
    The machinery-as-brain metaphor and wild-versus-mechanical tension cohere across the piece. The gear shifts from key to seed, a purposeful reweighting. "Probable miracles" as frame supports the fantastical transformation. However, the father's line "you must let go" borders on thesis statement, and the final paragraph's "probable miracles weren't rare here—they were inevitable" tells theme rather than letting the image resonate. The piece invites reflection but over-articulates its answer.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—courage as shared river, the journey as repeated choice—emerges from the punch-and-ticket pattern and Lira's teaching. Subtext operates in Lira's shoreline-lullaby voice and the ridgeway's alive responsiveness. The final image (standing vigil, punch left behind, "we wait for the next leash to break") offers a quiet answer but leans into platitude: the lesson is stated ("courage isn't a place—it was a choice") rather than reweighted through a non-literal image. The piece resists easy morals yet the ending feels more like affirmation than a resonant reconfiguration with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—safety as contract versus courage to listen—emerges through Elric's arc and the fortress's pact structure. The piano bench bolt, spiral staircase stain, and final piano scene function as recurring motifs that reweight meaning. The closing line "Safety, Elric realized, was not a cage but a garden" borders on explicit thematic statement but is grounded in the child's piano playing, providing a non-literal answer. The piece avoids heavy moralizing in the final paragraph, instead using the child's clumsy notes and the fortress's "hum of approval" to embody hope. Minor slip: "some costs were worth paying" in the final paragraph edges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of truth versus illusion is declared rather than explored through choice. The ink pellet "sunders" deceit in a single stroke without ambiguity or moral cost, collapsing to a simple binary. The "graceful collapse" and "realm's true path reclaimed" read as stated victory rather than resonant reconfiguration. Veyra's smile at the end signals triumph without lingering tension or counter-reading, and the constellations resuming their journey offers symbolic closure that the scene work has not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of cyclical reality and oceanic memory emerges through the atlas, flickering islands, and coral imagery. The fossil-fuel-ban backdrop and "periodically eternal" concept are present but remain abstractly stated ("it was awakening something older") rather than arising from concrete particulars. The ending attempts resonance ("one tap at a time") but the final paragraph resorts to thematic summary ("The ocean was healing, but it was also changing") instead of letting the image speak. No non-literal answer; the moral is stated outright.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—meaning in chaos, rhythm in the mess—emerges through the hum, the symbols, and Lira's assertion that "chaos has a rhythm." The opera glasses and stones serve as recurring motifs that reweight at closure when the crowd's voices embody the pattern. Yet the final paragraph edges toward moralizing: "The rebellion wasn't dead. It was a storm, gathering. Lira lowered her arms, smiling. The mess had meaning. It always had." The last two sentences summarize theme rather than letting the roar and shadows do the work. The conceptual cost (what was sacrificed for this revelation?) remains oblique, weakening the non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme—tradition evolving rather than dying, future as seed to nurture—emerges from the embryo's symbolic weight and Nana's stated intent. The final image (embryo glowing in the springs, plants singing) gestures at resonance but leans on the plants' hiss ("Choose wisely") and Nana's own thematic summary ("tradition would evolve, not die") rather than letting the image speak. The conceptual repricing is present but not undeniable; the reader is told rather than shown the cost of planting a destiny-seed. The piece avoids overt moralizing until the final paragraph, where "she'd unsealed a new beginning" states the thesis aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—grounding trauma in present reality—emerges through particulars (stone, salt, lavender) and the pearl-of-stillness motif. The final image of Lila walking home "light" with "the pearl of stillness cradled in her chest like a promise" attempts non-literal resonance. However, "anchor optimism in realism" is stated meta-thematically in dialogue, and Mrs. Voss's "you've already found your pearl" is an on-the-nose declaration. The thematic answer is told rather than shown in the final action; the photograph reprise shifts meaning but the insight is summarized ("love wasn't erased") rather than earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—fragmentation, weaving, redemption through art—emerges from images rather than statement. The final line ("Maybe we're all just waiting to be rewoven") edges toward platitude but remains rooted in the portrait and threads. The piece resists simplistic morals and invites reflection. However, the thematic question is never tested against on-page cost; the resolution is asserted in arrangement rather than earned through struggle, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of time fragmenting in crisis and the use of disappearing ink as ephemeral truth offer conceptual coherence, and the child's line "like breath" seeds a resonant image. However, the piece leans toward thematic declaration ("Time didn't slow in crisis; it *fragmented*") rather than letting the final image do non-literal work. The ending door moment does not reweight prior material or pose a non-obvious question; it gestures toward mystery without repricing what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of truth versus censorship emerges organically from Lirael's conflict and the contraband letter. The final exchange—"Because the truth matters"—states theme directly, bordering on thematic echo, though it's brief and rooted in her action. The "revolution began" framing offers a resonant answer to whether one person can challenge institutional silence, but the ending leans toward summary ("spread the word," "ignite a fire") rather than a concrete image that reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "unspoken conversation" motif, though it's somewhat over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of transforming chaos through focus emerges from concrete images (ballast engraved "quiet," roses thriving under the dome). However, the final paragraph moralizes ("even in ruin, life persists. Even in silence, there is voice") and then delivers the theme statement ("The farm, once a refuge, had become a revolution") that replaces earned resonance with declaration. The piece gestures toward complexity but does not embrace ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges around impermanence, translation of emotion, and cosmic order, but the final image ("The garden had spoken. And this time, he'd listened.") edges toward thesis statement rather than resonant particularity. The goddess as fractured light and the soil shimmer offer symbolic texture, but the piece does not pose a question sharp enough to be reweighted non-literally at closure. Subtext operates in the goddess's gesture and Kael's steadiness, yet the ending summarizes insight rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme (truth vs. complicity, the weight of legacy) emerges through Clara's actions and the recurring orbit/black hole imagery rather than direct statement. The nib shifts meaning from relic to weapon to tool across the story, and the grandfather's "see beyond the horizon" line reweights at closure when Clara chooses exposure. "Orbits of regret still spun, but she'd learned to dance in their gravity" skirts moralizing but stays grounded in her ongoing testimony and op-eds. The final image (dome opening to pink sky, nib cold against fingertips, truth as compass) offers resonance without stating a thesis. Minor deduction for "Truth, she realized, wasn't a destination—it was a compass" threading close to explicit theme articulation, though the action context partially earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of unspoken goodbyes and maternal guilt emerges through the letters and Althea's name-drop, but the resolution—"guilt dissolving into understanding"—is stated rather than earned through image or paradox. The final paragraph tells the outcome instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. The amber and letters recur but function as convenient unlocks rather than accumulating pressure that reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—"Unlearning isn't the same as forgetting," collective silence as emergent message—emerges from concrete images (sand mandala, tile mosaic, grotto acoustics). However, the ending leans toward direct statement: "The unlearning… wasn't about shedding knowledge. It was about making space for new truths to emerge." This thematic echo in the final paragraph replaces resonant implication with assertion. The holographic vortex and bell risk symbolic convenience, introduced late to harvest thematic points.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (transformation through memory, mercy amid ruin) emerges from image and action rather than direct statement, meeting baseline expectations. The tessera's return with reweighted meaning provides one layer of resonance. However, "aberrant mercy" and "warm coldness" are stated repeatedly as mantras without dramatic friction; the ending offers a mood rather than a non-literal answer to a central question. The artisan flashback enriches texture but does not complicate Elias's stance or impose a thematic trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—possibility as dance, not fixed point—emerges from the Wheel of Fortune reversal and the collaborative mending. The final image (blank coin, faint applause) offers a resonant reconfiguration without stating a moral. However, the piece leans toward abstraction ("negotiation between what was and what could be") rather than rooting insight in a concrete, costly particular. The flapper's "Again" and Elias's laugh function as gestures toward earned wisdom, but the reader is told the timeline knits whole rather than shown a specific human consequence of that repair.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme—engineered shortcuts versus organic self-discovery—emerges through Elias's critique of the pills and his geode work. The piece avoids overt moralizing until the final beats, where "fractally, somatically, undeniably real" edges toward thesis statement. The contrast between "fractally precise" (geode) and "fractally imprecise" (pills) is repeated rather than deepened through dramatic irony or subtext. The ending offers a clear answer (natural pathways work) but the cost or ambiguity that would charge it as a non-literal reconfiguration is absent—success arrives without visible sacrifice or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of transitional objects and voice-of-the-unknown emerges through the fossil's arc, but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "The unknown had found its voice. And she would carry it." This thematic echo replaces scene pressure with summary. The fossil as palimpsest offers some conceptual richness, yet the ending asserts rather than dramatizes its resonance. The phrase "floating—not through water or air, but through time itself" reads as clever annotation rather than an image that reweights prior material. Subtext is weak; the piece explicates its own meaning instead of trusting implication.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges from particulars (hourglass sand, buttons as memory anchors, canyon voices as shared wisdom) and avoids overt moralizing. The final image—"The future isn't a line to be followed but a field to be planted"—offers a resonant answer but leans close to articulated thesis. Subtext operates in the jar's swirl and the warehouse's "unearthed silence," yet no irony or counter-reading complicates the resolution. The thematic question is posed and answered cleanly, without ambiguity or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (courage as rekindled flame rather than unearthed relic) emerges from concrete ritual and memory without overt moralizing. The pillbox's spiral motif recurs with shifted meaning. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic summary—"not the truth, but the courage to seek it"—edges toward stating rather than dramatizing the answer. Strong thematic particulars (father's pipe tobacco, off-key lullabies) anchor universals, lifting the score despite the summary tendency.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is asserted through abstract labels ("palimpsest promise," "distill complexity into essence," "spindrift serenity") rather than emergent from concrete events. The final paragraph moralizes ("the palimpsest promise was safe here") and restates theme without scene pressure, violating the anti-sermon rule (−0.6). The yarn needle and river function as symbolic ornaments without constraining choice or charging the closure. No thematic question is tested or reweighted by the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—care and kindness anchor timelines against decay—emerges organically from the phototropic sunflowers, the lantern glass, and Mara's past well-digging. The final image of Mara setting up her wheel at a new settlement offers a resonant, non-literal answer: to shape time, tend the light. The piece avoids overt moralizing, though "to shape time, one must first tend to the light within it" in the penultimate paragraph skirts explicit statement. The sunflowers' recurrence charges the ending without forced symbolism, and the fractured-timelines concept integrates thematically rather than mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of persistence and beauty in decay emerges organically from Elias's gardening and the rosebush frame. The bitting gauge as a tool "for measuring light" carries subtext, and the line "after the final petal drops, you still have to water the stem" offers a resonant image without heavy-handed moralizing. However, the final window-opening moment edges toward overt symbolism—"let the light in" articulates the thesis a bit too directly. The piece avoids outright sermonizing but the thematic machinery is visible, limiting the sense of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—surviving the past by letting it flow through rather than fighting it—emerges from the sundial's images and the library's tidal rhythm. The line "atomically reflective meant to see oneself in the fragments of the past without being shattered by them" borders on explicit statement, lowering thematic resonance. The final image of writing and placing the book offers a non-literal answer, but the conceptual cost is not made undeniable; the spiral symbol and the shelf's appearance feel convenient rather than earned from prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme—secrets as coils that must be shared to rejoin what is fragmented—emerges from the spiral motif, the orbs, and Elara's guidance. The twig spiral and grandmother's memory function as purposeful recurrence that shifts meaning at closure. Yet the final paragraph edges toward thematic statement ("The thread that connects all things isn't a secret. It's the courage to share it") rather than trusting the orbs' dissolution to carry the insight. Elara's line "Secrets aren't meant to be locked away. They're meant to be shared, transformed" borders on sermonizing, though it stops short of a full thesis dump. The resonance is present but leans heavier on articulation than embodied image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of power plays and cosmic gamesmanship emerges through the trickster dynamic and Lila's counter-move. The final image—"The cosmos was a chessboard, and she'd just made her first move"—offers a metaphor but states the thesis rather than letting particulars resonate. The shift from chaos to truce is asserted ("arguments softened," "funding restored") rather than shown through specific, embodied change. The tricksters' "*Well played*" note risks thematic echo by articulating the story's game logic directly, reducing subtext to declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.4)
    "Wistful rebellion" is declared in the final line without prior embodiment in choices or images. The organ and starlight recur but function as atmospheric set-dressing rather than images that accumulate pressure or reweight at closure. The theme of "prison to gateway" is stated rather than earned through particulars; the ending offers a label ("It was a gateway") instead of a resonant final image that answers the central question without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme (empathy vs. numbness, presence vs. absence) emerges through the ribbon fragment and the act of sketching memory into stone. "Opposites unified" recurs in image and dialogue, but the final beat states the thesis overtly: "Empathy's never truly dormant. It just needs the right key" is a thematic summary rather than a resonant, non-literal image. The framed ribbon becomes a symbol asserted rather than one that reweights prior material through earned particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of exile, reversal, and inherited shame emerges through particulars—the nail, journals, shipwreck. However, the final line explicitly states the theme ("some truths were worth the risk") rather than letting the image resonate. The copper nail warming and Clara's declaration feel more like symbolic convenience than earned wisdom from concrete experience. The piece invites reflection but the ending tilts toward assertion over resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") is stated twice in nearly identical phrasing by narrator and character, a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure. The final paragraph's "It's not just a map—it's a choice" is overt meta-commentary. No resonant non-literal image reweights prior material; the ending asserts a fresh start without embedding cost or ambiguity in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme—paths circle back through choices (greed, ambition, fear) rather than fate—emerges from Elias's reflection and the symbolic use of the foreign bills. The Cuba and Zimbabwe notes carry subtext (revolution/betrayal, hyperinflation collapse), and the father's burning of money is a vivid particular. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "some paths, if walked with wisdom, need never circle back" reads as thesis statement rather than image-driven resonance. The startup collapse functions as allegory (transparent stand-in for Elias's own cycle-breaking) without narrative friction. The ending reconfigures meaning but states rather than shows the answer to the central question, lowering thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "shared burdens" theme is articulated clearly through Veyra's exposition and the thousand overlapping voices. Lirael's arc from "avoiding others' pain" to "letting the words wash over her" offers a coherent thematic trajectory, and the final image—a map "not of space, but of empathy"—reconfigures the temple's function. However, the piece leans on direct thematic statements ("healing begins with listening," "a mirror to hold") rather than allowing particulars to generate meaning. The daylily recurs but does not reweight the premise; it decorates the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—hidden truths and self-acceptance—emerges through image (mirrors, frozen confession, buried memory) rather than thesis. The final realization "not just the darkness within her, but the strength to carry it" avoids moralizing and the faded seed's quiet retention offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, "what mirrors don't show" repeats as prompt language in both opening and close, weakening organic discovery. The "warlike serenity" paradox and "trees groaned…clawing at the sky" suggest textural ambition but remain ornamental; they don't constrain choice or accumulate into a pattern that reweights the ending. Subtext is present in the seed's "hunger mirroring her own," yet the emotional payoff feels asserted ("heart lighter") rather than embodied in a specific gesture or micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of accepting wounds/fear emerges through scars and the golden-eyed figure's counsel ("Chasing isn't heeding"). The final line "The intersection of dreams wasn't a place—it was a choice" attempts thematic crystallization but arrives as assertion rather than earned through specific action. The two-moons image offers a conceptual repricing of reality, yet the story does not invite reflection beyond the stated moral—"she'd learned to heed its warnings" closes with thesis rather than resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges clearly: recklessness transformed into measured action, regret into understanding. The burned Fool card and black fruit function as recurring images that shift meaning. However, the ending risks thematic echo when Lirael internalizes "fiercely gentle wisdom"—the phrase lands close to prompt language rather than arising organically from scene particulars. The vision sequence tells rather than dramatizes the conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme—what remains after applause—emerges through the cloth, blasts replacing applause, and the final realization. The phoenix motif and *Echo Valley*'s failure parallel Lenny's trajectory without overt statement. However, the final line ("After the applause, there was still music") restates the premise as a tidy moral rather than letting the image resonate. The bassist's tales are told, not dramatized, and the epiphany is articulated ("resurrecting forgotten stories") instead of enacted through a non-literal answer. Thematic echo in the closing sentence lowers the score by 0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the seed-as-translator metaphor and the notion that "transition is reassembly." The final paragraph offers a resonant image—"touching distance between knowing and becoming"—that reweights prior material. However, the closing lines veer toward overt thematic statement ("the physics of transition were not cold equations, but stories") and the phrase "haunted ambitions could be redirected toward growth" reads as thesis rather than dramatized insight, lowering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of embracing contradiction emerges clearly but is stated rather than earned: "By accepting contradictions, you'll preserve the wonder in routine" is authorial thesis, not dramatic insight. The creel as smelting pot is a functional metaphor but shifts meaning only through declaration. The final image (starfish dissolving, fish takes flight) recurs as poetic closure but does not reweigh prior material with new cost—it restates the premise. The piece edges into thematic echo rather than resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of connection versus isolation is stated overtly in the epilogue ("capacity for connection," "dissolve the walls between hearts") rather than earned through scene pressure. The pearl and confessions gesture toward latent hope, but recurrence is ornamental—the pearl simply vanishes to trigger the deus ex machina lattice. The final paragraph moralizes: "just a man, a pearl, and a shell...all working together" explains rather than deepens. No counter-reading or ambiguity; the cathedral metaphor arrives as decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—healing through surrender, mapping emotional terrain—emerges organically from the graffiti fragments and Mara's shifting understanding. The metaphor of rivers versus stagnant pools is sustained without over-articulation, and the final "Begin" reweights the station's archive as a collective guide. The piece avoids moralizing; the accordion's "raw solace" and the ivy's lean create resonance. However, the final realization ("a language to articulate her pain") edges close to thesis statement, and the climactic drawing of her heart-map is summary rather than dramatized choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of unspoken truths and hidden knowledge emerges from the premise, but the ending offers discovery-as-reward rather than a resonant reweighting with cost. The confidence man's watch and cyclical cipher are mentioned but not integrated into a non-literal thematic answer. No epiphany is earned through sacrifice or renunciation; Lira simply finds what she sought, and the final image ("words began to appear") asserts revelation without ambiguity or felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—weighing personal desire against imperial ambition, the cost of dreams—emerges from the violin, coffee stains, and the two futures without direct statement. The final image (violin shattered, child's laugh, mulberry ache) reweights prior material with resonance. However, "propagate" repeated three times edges toward thematic echo, and "to weigh a dream against an empire was to stand on a knife's edge, blindfolded" abstracts the question rather than letting the particulars speak. The ache as permanent stain is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—beauty enduring against oblivion—emerges from particulars (the emerald's transformation, the grotto's fragility) without overt moralizing. The final image of stillness as canvas offers resonance. However, "lucidly watchful" and "radiant hush" echo prompt language, and the closing reflection ("stillness was never truly still") edges toward statement rather than letting the image speak. The theme is coherent but not deeply transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of rebirth and forgiveness emerges organically through the hairpin's return and the scallop shell motif. The ending offers a non-literal answer: contentment as practice, not destination. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis summary ("a choice to climb, to forgive, to seek understanding") rather than letting the image alone carry weight. The verb "scalloping their edges until they fit together again" forces the symbol into service. Subtext in Elara's tentative smile and downcast eyes works well.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (doubt as filter, not enemy) emerges organically from the cloak and chime mechanics rather than authorial assertion. The final image—Elias carrying the cloak and "ghost of laughter"—reweights the opening's "conscience for hire" frame with nuance. However, "Doubt isn't the enemy… it's the filter. Without it, certainty becomes a prison" edges toward thesis statement in dialogue. The chimes function thematically but their resolution lacks ambiguity; Mira's choice feels validated rather than open to counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.9)
    The vanishing/appearing theme emerges through the stone-ripple motif and recurs at closure, offering modest resonance. However, the final insight "It's not about disappearing. It's about… becoming" veers toward thematic echo and restates the premise without reweighting prior material with cost. The delayed-revelation concept is present but functions as a told attribute rather than a dramatized friction. No counter-reading or moral ambiguity; the lesson lands cleanly without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the pulse/stillness paradox and the figure-eight motif. The final insight—alignment over capture—avoids overt moralizing. However, the piece leans on abstract phrasing ("harmony with the world," "trust in the pulse") rather than a concrete, non-literal image that reweights prior material. The arrowhead's mosaic and the birds' return are present but do not carry fresh ambiguity or felt consequence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—the sacred resides in the simple, not grand gestures—emerges organically from the plot and is anchored in concrete particulars (mother's garden, roses, lavender). The keystone and lingering luminance function as motifs that shift meaning from impossibility to memory. Weakness: the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("the sacred wasn't hidden in impossibilities...") rather than trusting the image to carry weight. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration, but the lack of on-page cost (no renunciation, no visible trade-off) limits the thematic charge; Kael's epiphany feels granted rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (grief as luminous vow, sound as memory's color) emerges through concrete images: the key tag, the library desk inscription, the humming book's color-shifting light. The final image—Elias lighting his lantern and walking home with "the color of sound humming in his veins"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution by leaving the vow's content ambiguous, yet the phrase "he'd just needed the right key to open it" edges toward stated moral. Subtext in gesture (placing the key tag, the water parting) supports thematic weight without full transformation of prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of alignment and purpose emerges through the backwards prophecy and the metaphor of wavelength calibration. The final image—Kael raising his hands as "the wavelength surged through him"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, the thematic pivot hinges on abstract concepts ("shed the noise," "focus on the signal") rather than earned particulars. The coins and tower/moon circuit are symbolic conveniences introduced late without constraining earlier choices. The piece avoids sermonizing but leans on cosmic generalities ("the universe's desire to harmonize") instead of grounding its insight in Kael's specific lived tension.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of naming the shapeless emerges organically from the ritual and Lira's memory. The line *"The echo of sacrifice… was about giving shape to the shapeless, voice to the voiceless"* verges on direct thematic statement but remains tied to Elias's action. The prism and atlas motifs recur purposefully. However, the final image—stars "ancient and indifferent," monsters returning as "all fears do"—reaches for resonance without a non-literal answer rooted in prior particulars; it tells us the cycle continues rather than reweighting the premise through a final specific image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of brittle devotion and earnest faith emerges organically from Elias's flawed persistence without overt statement. The bell's imperfect repair mirrors his own fractured powers and naive hope. "Madness is just devotion without a roadmap" risks thesis-speak but remains character-voiced and ironic. The final image (bell as metronome, fragile faith at dawn) reweights prior material without resolving into tidy moral, offering resonance through earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly through image and action: memory as private burden versus shared inheritance, the tension between preservation and expungement, the town resurfacing in both water and story. The sapphire liqueur as both toast and poison is a strong particular. The final image—photographs lighting the way down the ridgeway—offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The line "precisely humane act of remembering" in the final paragraph edges toward thematic statement but is saved by being tied to concrete action (walking, placing photos) rather than standing alone as thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.9)
    The logic/intuition theme is established through concrete images (father's calculus, mother's verse, starlings' dance) rather than abstract claim, and the blended formula at the end attempts integration. However, the final beat tells rather than shows: "to harmonize...was not to choose between them, but to let them collide" is meta-commentary replacing scene pressure. The starling footprint in the closing image gestures toward earned sentiment but does not reweight the central question with non-literal resonance. The piece avoids overt moralizing but drifts toward thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of legacy, trust, and perpetual vigilance emerges through Kael's interaction with the buckle and his mother's last word. The covenant/prison dichotomy and "trust wasn't a burden—it was a language" offer thematic weight. However, the final paragraph edges toward statement: "his mother's trust wasn't a burden—it was a language" and "the watcher's work was never done" lean declarative rather than letting the image resonate without summary. The buckle and forest nodes anchor theme in particulars, preventing full abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of self versus shadow-self emerges through the clone confrontation, and the brain as "choice" offers a potentially resonant final image. However, the piece leans on prompt labels ("ego death," "pretense," "vivify") rather than letting theme arise from particulars. The clone's claim "I'm you" and Kael's rebuttal "you're what I could've been if I'd given in to fear" state the theme rather than dramatizing it through conflicting choices. The final murmur "You're not a duplicate, you're a choice" reads as a thematic echo that tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of loss, memory, and restoration emerges through concrete particulars (children's giggles swallowed by dust, echoes as rubber balls), and the concept of "tending to the unspoken" integrates with Marlowe's method. The ending avoids overt moralizing, yet the final declaration ("his symphony… had been worth every note") edges toward thematic summary rather than allowing the image to resonate without commentary. The piece invites reflection on neglect and joy, but the resolution is emotionally tidy—Marlowe succeeds fully without ambiguity or counter-reading, limiting thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of boundaries as thresholds ("boundaries of light weren't walls—they were doors") and uncertainty as home emerges through Mara's interiorizing practice, the mist's liminal quality, and the final library reunion. The pendant's symbols mirroring her childhood home deepen mystery without over-explaining. However, the final paragraph edge-states the theme ("uncertainty? That was just another word for home") where the moss path and mentor's lantern already carried the work. The cultist's line "make friends with uncertainty" and Mara's echo risk thematic flagging. The fog/mist motif recurs purposefully, but "trust the fog" from the mentor's note tilts instructional. Subtext operates well in gesture (pendant toss, stepping onto path) until the ending over-articulates.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of creative destruction emerges through the crozier's break-and-rebirth and Kael's self-sacrifice, supported by Veyra's "Order is a cage, but chaos is a knife." The final image—nexus blooming, destiny cracked—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "To interrupt destiny, he had to become the interruption" tilt toward thesis statement rather than letting image carry meaning, and "creative destruction" as an explicit book-theory reference edges into prompt-label territory rather than full organic emergence from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme—endings as doorways, silence as potential—emerges clearly from the hush concept and the fragment's dual nature. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "It had served its purpose: to show him that endings were merely doorways, and silence was the key" is explicit theme-statement rather than resonant image. The Hollywood fragment shifts meaning (fame relic → mirror of final act) but the insight is told, not discovered through specific struggle. Subtext in gesture and implication is minimal; most meaning is declared.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of transience and completion emerges from the ferry's dissolution and the passengers' merged timelines, but the final paragraph's "temporary guardian of a permanent transient moment" is abstraction replacing image. The hourglass motif shifts meaning (empty → filled with stories → shattered) but the new constellation and Kael's deeper walk assert resonance rather than earning it through concrete cost. The widow, child, and lover receive symmetric satisfaction without narrative hierarchy, flattening thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of "rational enchantment" and "texture of connection" is stated repeatedly ("realistically imaginary," "balance of rational enchantment") rather than emerging from concrete choice. The ending moralizes directly: "connection was not a destination, but a journey" and "in that balance, she'd found her truth." No counter-reading is invited; the resolution is tidy and declarative. The sinew thread recurs but does not shift meaning—it glows softly as a reminder, an ornamental reprise rather than a thematic reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges from the "unfolded horizons" and edge-geometry motifs, and the chain link's reprise attempts to ground heaviness within vastness. Yet the final paragraph delivers overt thematic summary ("teaching her students to embrace the unknown") that replaces scene pressure. The piece gestures toward complexity ("somber marvel," smallness within vastness) but the ending articulates the thesis rather than letting the image resonate without statement.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of incidental heroism and bridging life/death emerges through the atrium setting and Lila's role, but the final paragraph states the thesis overtly ("incidental heroism... wasn't about grand gestures"). The hearing aid's synchronized pulse and the photograph's return carry symbolic weight, though the devices feel ornamental rather than causally indispensable. The woman's single tear and Lila's smile offer tidy emotional resolution without ambiguity or cost that reweights prior material. Resonance is present but softened by explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of making the invisible visible emerges organically from the brother's bubble, the gold's tracking ability, and the undersea cables as memorials. The final realization—"cables weren't just for communication—they were memorials, etching the unremembered into the ocean's skin"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing, though "stood by them" in the last line edges toward stating rather than embodying the stance. Phase transitions as metaphor (unseen becomes seen) integrates well with the literal flooding/draining cycle. The codex's cryptic formula and the holographic map allow discovery through action rather than exposition, avoiding thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—wisdom fetched from failure, the digital ghost as compass—emerges from the ink patterns and the woman's "I'm not ready" refrain, avoiding overt thesis statements until the final exchange. The porcelain shard and heartbeat count recur with shifting associations (fragility, proof of life, rebellion), and the closing line ("it's messy. But it's mine") offers a non-literal answer to the stake. However, thematic resonance is weakened by abstraction: "digital ghost," "bridge," "compass" function as metaphors without concrete particulars that reweight prior material. The ending reiterates the premise rather than repricing it through a surprising image or realization rooted in scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—languages lost, texture-as-sound, fear of oblivion—emerges through the diamond's curse and echo mechanics. The final image ("some languages are meant to be felt, not spoken") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the "I am the extinction!" line edges toward thematic echo, and the "mirror" insight is told rather than enacted. The diamond's black vein recurs across beats but its final split into tones is ornamental rather than reweighting prior material with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—harmony untamed versus civilization's grip—emerges through image (vines, bark, spiral arrowhead) and the herbalist's stance. The mentor's aphorism "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" recurs with shifted weight, charging the ending. However, the final paragraph edges toward statement: "relevance felt trivial" and "not as a researcher. Not anymore" summarize rather than show the thematic reweighting. The spiral symbol offers a resonant non-literal answer, but the journey from bitterness to lightness bypasses on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—order vs. chaos, mechanized beauty vs. wild magic—emerges through concrete images (metallic peaches, grass obeying schedules, liquid starlight). The locust shell's hollow chambers and the statue's empty heart-sockets provide purposeful motifs that shift meaning across beats. However, the penultimate paragraph states the theme outright: "breaking free wasn't about destruction… trusting the chaos to hold its own kind of order"—thematic echo that replaces image pressure. The final line ("The orchard listened. This time, it answered.") offers resonance, but the "understanding" Lira reaches is delivered as epiphany rather than earned through a specific failed attempt or renunciation. The tarnished-wonder tone charges many images (peaches like tears, sap that smelled of honey and memory) but the ending tips into thesis rather than implication.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges from particulars: borders as gaps, healing through small rebellious acts. The storm-in-bottle as question/challenge is concrete, and the arcade's revival offers a non-literal answer. However, the final paragraph edges toward summary ("healing wasn't in grand gestures..."; "room to grow") rather than letting the image alone carry weight. The old woman's tune and child's laughter are specific and avoid overt symbolism, and the brittle hush → promise shift reweights prior material. No explicit moralizing in dialogue, but the penultimate paragraph's thesis statement ("healing wasn't...") slightly dilutes the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.5)
    Theme—silence as potential—emerges through images (carousel, wind bells, fountain code) but is explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("silence wasn't an end. It was a beginning"), replacing earned resonance with a moral summary. The halo fragment and singing offer a pattern but do not reweight prior material with felt cost. The courtyard transformation reads as wish-fulfillment rather than a non-literal answer to a contested question.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of stories as living, tangible forces emerges through the scarf, hyperbolic geometry metaphors, and the poet's claim to "fold time like origami." The midnight sequence attempts a non-literal answer ("the space where light bends"), but the final insight—"analog memories… transform"—arrives as an articulated thesis rather than an image that reweights prior material. The patron's conversion and the library's "new vitality" feel asserted rather than dramatized, and the closing "Continue" whisper edges toward direct thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme (longing as internal, not external) is stated overtly in the penultimate paragraph: "it was not a thing to capture, but a force to embrace." The dream's line "You've been chasing me, but I've been chasing you" verbalizes the cipher rather than letting image or action reveal it. The palette and sunrise photography recur but do not reweight meaning at closure—they vanish without consequence. The final smile and declarative summary ("she had found not a dream, but herself") deliver a tidy moral instead of resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—secrets as burdens, silence versus revelation—emerges from the premise and the woman's whispers, but the final insight ("some secrets, once spoken, could heal rather than harm") is stated rather than embodied in a non-literal image or action. The lock-and-key metaphor is overt and lacks layered subtext. The mist and ribbon unraveling gesture toward lyric resonance, but the ending declares the thematic payoff ("the idea he had freed was not just hers, but his own") instead of trusting the reader to infer it from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—memory as bridge, curiosity as eternal—emerges from the premise but is stated overtly in the final paragraphs: "not as a tomb, but as a bridge," "curiosity? That was eternal." The fairy ring as mirror and broken constellations as keys offer symbolic resonance, but the locket's silver light and Clara's echo feel like thematic markers rather than earned particulars. The ending attempts a non-literal answer (memories were "misplaced") yet the wording hovers close to platitude. Elias's arc—from skeptical to understanding—tracks the theme but doesn't challenge it with ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.6)
    The reversible-exile concept and light-shadow imagery cohere thematically, but the ending articulates the theme overtly ("the shadow caught in glass will shift, and the light will find a new path") rather than letting the final image reweight prior material without statement. The "walk backwards" advice functions as explicit metaphor. Mentoring resilience and the archivist's preservation role are told rather than tested under pressure, and the visitor's emotional arc (breathless hesitation → hardened resolve) follows a linear template without contradictory impulses or visible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of renewal and wonder's perpetuation emerges through image (iridescent blossom, liquid rainbows). The final paragraph, however, lapses into explicit moralizing: "wonder was not a finite thing… a thread, woven endlessly" and "magic waits to be reborn" articulate the thesis rather than letting the image speak. The closure trades scene pressure for thematic summary, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—silence as prison versus release—emerges from the net's unraveling and the sanctuary's accumulated hush. However, Elias's line "silence isn't always kindness" states the moral directly rather than letting the final image prove it. The silver key "to a door that was never locked" risks forced symbolism. The ending offers a non-literal answer (the hum of freed conversations) but the transition from hush to hum is told rather than charged through Mara's final embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—silence as language, empathy in the unsaid—emerges through particulars: the vowel-less hymn, carvings that shift, hum resolving to chant, frescoes waiting. The altar's etched tear and the map's tear form a tight reprise. The final image ("frame this map differently—not with borders, but with questions") reweights the opening without stating a moral. No thematic echo or diagnostic label intrudes. The chapel-as-bridge lands as a resonant answer to the central question. Slight dock: "find empathy in the unsaid" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward statement, though embedded in scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme—grief as a phase transition, memory as transmission rather than erasure—emerges organically from Elara's investigation and the snow globe motif. The final image of "learning to shake the globe not to watch the storm, but to feel the resonance" offers a non-literal answer to the physics of letting go without moralizing. Subtext operates in the snow globe's return with reweighted meaning and in Elara's choice to prioritize private work over public closure. The quantum-communication premise integrates with theme through the specific discovery of encoded signals. Minor slip: "the quiet, analytic ache of holding on too tight" edges toward summary statement rather than letting resonance arise purely from image and action. Theme resists tidy resolution; the ending remains open yet charged.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—communication with the lost, the bridge between spoken and unspoken—emerges from the premise but remains largely asserted rather than earned through friction. The messages to Lira and the brother carry emotional content ("Do you remember?" "I forgive you") but are delivered as exposition rather than tested in scene. The final image (bluebell pressed, ghost smiling) gestures toward resonance but does not reweight prior material; the "unspoken needs" remain abstract. No counter-reading or complexity challenges the protagonist's certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—joy and anguish as twins, the flame that cannot be smothered—emerges from the diary's symbols, the widow's grief, and the captain's choice. The goggles and phoenix symbol recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Mara's final hand-to-chest gesture ("the flame still burns—here") risks on-the-nose thematic statement but is saved by the embodied action and the widow's laugh, which complicate the sentiment. The ending's image of a flickering flame above the clouds offers resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—memory in emptiness, "spooled wholeness"—emerges through the cloud catalog and the void's pulse rather than direct moralizing. The telescope and mother's hair lock function as charged objects that tie personal grief to cosmic pattern. However, the ending leans toward thematic echo: "the sky remembers" and "wholeness of the world" risk summary rather than letting the image alone carry weight. The cirrus spes ("threads of possibility") offers a resonant non-literal answer, though the final paragraph's exposition weakens the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—limits and the act of preservation—emerges through the guild's "sky inside walls" and Lira's shift from portraiture to custodianship. The journal's final entry ("let the stars remain") reweights prior material without stating a moral. The face-blind artist who "sees more than wood and shelves" and "crafted something beyond sight" risks thematic echo but stays grounded in her perceptual signature. The ending avoids sermonizing, offering a quiet image (coin warm in her pocket, "map to secrets yet undiscovered") that resonates without overstatement. One line—"a legacy etched in light and wood"—tilts slightly declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of curiosity as compass and the search for hidden truths emerges organically from Lira's puzzle-solving and the "light trapped between worlds" motif. The hopscotch board and phrasebook anchor specificity, and the starlings as guides add layered meaning. However, the final beat tips into summary: "She'd charted the next great discovery—not just a place, but a truth" states the theme rather than letting the images (glowing orb, ancient cities, harmony of light and darkness) reweight prior material without narration. The visions flood her mind but remain abstract catalogs, not particular images that complicate or deepen the premise with a non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme—repair as harmony and connection—emerges from recurring images (gears, clocks, the father's workshop) but the final paragraph ("The rhythm of repair...wasn't just about fixing gears") states the moral explicitly rather than leaving it implicit. "Driftwood nostalgia" and the tide-like clicking of gears offer resonant particulars, but the ending's "time, like memory, could always be mended" resolves into reassuring platitude without ambiguity or non-literal resonance. The piece invites reflection but delivers a tidy answer that undercuts complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of collective effort and hope emerges from the premise but relies on summary and assertion ("hope was not a solitary pursuit—it was a garden") rather than particular images that reweight prior material. The nebula as "promise" is stated twice without specific dramatization that charges the concept. The final paragraph moralizes ("tended by many hands, watered by trust") instead of landing a resonant image, and the climax offers no ambiguity or counter-reading—stakes resolve into tidy affirmation without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (perfection is a lie; cracks let light in; the end is a lullaby, beautifully flawed) emerges from concrete particulars: the cracked puppet, nested fractal patterns, Mara's rough voice. The final image—puppet shattering with golden light, clocks softening worldwide—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the grandfather's aphorism "Perfection is a lie...It's the cracks that let the light in" and Mara's closing realization "the end wasn't an ending. It was a lullaby, beautifully flawed, sung across a thousand lifetimes" edge toward thematic echo, restating the premise rather than trusting the image alone. Still, the nested patterns and shattered puppet do most of the thematic work on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of cyclical obligation and imperfect rescue emerges through concrete particulars (the nut's cracked shell, the labyrinth's reset, the orchard's pulsing roots). The "graceless beauty" motif—tilted stones, snapped branches—anchors the notion of flawed but necessary intervention. The final image (nut cracked but intact, paths shifting like sand) resonates without stating a moral. However, the phrase "The curse was satisfied—for now" edges toward explicit summary rather than letting the image carry the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of separation-as-connection emerges through river imagery, foam patterns, and chrysalis, but the final paragraph states the insight overtly ("separation isn't an end") rather than letting the image resonate. The chrysalis and ravine function as overt symbols rather than objects with irreducible particulars. Elara's polymer work shift and Mara's composition title *Chrysalis* read as thematic checklist payoffs. The studio harmony is genuinely specific ("notes clashed at first, then melded"), and the phrase "Maybe the song isn't over. Maybe it's just… changing" carries earned subtext, preventing full collapse into platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (stories arise from absence, the space before creation) is woven through imagery (jars of silence, bottled moonlight, golden residue) rather than stated outright, which is strong. The final realization ("stories didn't begin in grand gestures...") veers toward direct statement and risks thematic echo, though it stops short of moralizing. The floating note as a "fragment of melody, unattached to any song" offers a concrete image that reweights the premise, supporting Conceptual Repricing. However, the piece leans on conceptual vocabulary ("glimmering parole," "void," "absence") that abstracts rather than grounds; subtext in the man's exchange is minimal. The ending invites reflection but the resonance rests more on assertion than on earned discovery through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—carrying intergenerational guilt, tempering memory—emerges from the pavilion's architecture, Nessar's ritual, and the closing cooking metaphor. The final image (chopping onions mellowed by laughter, broth softened by forgiveness) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. Subtext operates in the guard's avoidance, the pool's "living ink," and the meal as nourishment of the present. One slip: "At the close of an unspoken dream" is a prompt echo that dilutes precision. The thematic question is coherent, the answer earned, but the ornamentation keeps it shy of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    The bridge-from-silos theme is stated repeatedly ("construct bridges from silos," "stories must flow freely") rather than emerging from concrete struggle. The final image—villagers offering help, the blacksmith stepping forward—illustrates the theme but does not reweight prior material through ambiguity or cost. Elara's work with the weight never generates thematic friction; she sings, it glows, the tower responds. The ending's mosaic of offers (mend hinges, write verse, draw the tower) reads as a list of resolutions rather than a resonant answer to a question the story has pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of entangling personal failure with others' abandoned dreams emerges from Kael's backstory (collapsed project) and the mirror work. The final image—"a mosaic of entangled memories"—attempts to answer the premise without overt moralizing. However, the piece leans on prompt-label language: "archeologist of abandoned dreams," "synaptic plasticity," "rewiring reality itself." The metaphor of fractures-as-pathways is stated ("The fractures weren't flaws, he realized—they were pathways") rather than discovered through specific image or action. The ending offers a conceptual answer but without the cost-laden particulars that would make it resonate beyond the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges around thresholds, margins, and hidden knowledge, supported by recurring serpent-and-key imagery. The final line attempts resonance ("the world was full of doors"), but it restates the premise rather than reweighting it through a non-literal image tied to prior particulars. "Seeds of vigilance" and "latent blaze" remain abstract labels; the story gestures at depth but does not anchor the conceptual question in a specific, dramatized cost. The closing insight is asserted, not earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of sound persisting in silence emerges organically from image and action—the stress cracks as melody, the grove learning to strum itself. The porcelain insulator as "bridge between silence and sound" functions concretely before accruing symbolic weight. However, the final paragraphs drift into thematic summary ("a reminder that even in silence, music endures") and the phrase "symphonically minded soul weaving empathy into the very soil" reads as prompt-echo rather than earned subtext. The concept of "empathy in motion" is declared more than dramatized; the story tells us the sculpture's pain is translated into vibration without showing the character grappling with or discovering that empathy through conflicted choices.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—beauty in constraints, honoring forgotten promises through quiet correlation—emerges from Alaric's chess teaching and the covenant's riddle. The queen's diagonal movement, the stone's crescent, and the eclipse's path form a coherent symbolic lattice that avoids label-speak. However, the star-mage's line "You've translated the silence" and "beauty in the difficult" echo the prompt's thematic instruction too directly, verging on Thematic Echo. The sapling with mirror-leaves offers a resonant final image, but the mage's validation softens the ambiguity and edges toward sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    "Silence as language" emerges from concrete diary entries and the humming mechanism, grounding the theme in action. The closing lines, however, tip into moralizing: "The path to empathy...was not paved with words but with the willingness to tune into the frequencies of others." This thematic echo in the final paragraph (−0.6) replaces scene pressure with a stated thesis. The diary entries offer specificity, but the ending asserts meaning rather than letting the image resonate non-literally.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—patience, the undercurrent of wisdom, serenity within motion—emerges from Lira's journey but is over-articulated. The grandmother's line "Wisdom grows in the hush, not the roar" and the elders' "Chaos and serenity are not enemies but kin" are direct thematic statements rather than implications arising from image and action. The corpse flower functions symbolically, but its meaning is declared ("a beacon of harmony") instead of resonating through particulars. The final image has potential but is undercut by explanatory closure ("illustrating the wisdom she'd gained").

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of resilience through adaptive symbiosis emerges from the vines' growth response and the "gathering of echoes" conceit. The arrow tip's growth acceleration and the planet's storage capacity are specific rather than generic. However, the final paragraph moralizes openly: "resilience came from its willingness to bend, to store, to echo" and "she'd finally learned to listen" are thesis statements rather than resonant images. The "symphony" metaphor in the closing line is a restatement, not a fresh reprise that reweights prior material with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of convergence—architectural, meteorological, human—emerges through concrete imagery (containers amplifying wind, the patch's vibrations syncing with heartbeat). The phrase "some machines, once awakened, never truly sleep" risks overt thematic summary in the final paragraph, but it's somewhat earned by the prior sensory accumulation. The patch's transformation from salvaged emblem to live feedback device provides a non-literal thematic arc, though the engineer's sudden glazed state borders on convenient metaphor without grounded causation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme—wonder as essential—emerges from the premise but is stated rather than discovered ("…is essential"). The sculpted hush and synesthetic palette offer rich imagery, yet the piece treats them as symbolic décor rather than particulars that complicate Lira's choice. The ending's triumphant harmony (ice, stone, light all singing together) resolves into tidy affirmation without ambiguity or counter-pressure. The final line's "forever" and "inevitable" read as thematic summary rather than earned resonance from specific events.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of failure-as-teacher emerges from events (mentor's death, prior theft, shadow-selves) and the "avalanchingly quiet" note motif recurs with shifted meaning. The final image—rune for surrender, fragments in pack, "song now a quiet hum"—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the specter's instruction "to weave…you must first unravel your own" borders on thematic statement, and "To harvest insights from failure was to stop fighting the current" in the penultimate paragraph edges into articulated thesis rather than pure resonance from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—emotion as lived rhythm versus solvable equation—emerges cleanly from Elias's arc and the fragment's behavior. The final image of fogged goggles and "not needing to borrow anyone's personality" offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, the piece leans on the prompt's explicit conceptual framing ("emotions were just variables") rather than letting particulars accumulate that pressure. The ending nods toward earned wisdom but the transformation feels asserted by the fragment's magic rather than built from Elias's micro-choices and their costs.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of germination—turning fleeting encounters into rooted meaning—emerges concretely through the pendant, Veyra's lessons, and the literal seed that becomes a sapling. The final image (pendant stilled at the tree's base, Kail understanding he was "the soil") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Veyra's cryptic phrases and the woman's knowing smile. Minor slip: "Because you extend brief encounters. You make them linger" edges toward thematic echo, though it's attributed to the woman rather than narration.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—projection versus absorption, the mirror of yearning—emerges through the prism and arbor imagery. The final realization attempts resonance: "The arbor's hush wasn't a mystery to solve, but a mirror to her own yearning." However, this lands as explicit meta-statement rather than arising from particulars, and the lesson is articulated rather than shown. The prism's shift from "tool for discovery" to "lens for distortion" has potential but is told, not dramatized. "Truthful lies" as tone feels imposed rather than organic to events.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the motif of weaving/unraveling and the silence-to-song transformation; the final image of Mara spinning silence itself into cloth offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of restoration through renunciation. The amber beads' merger and release avoid overt moralizing. However, the closing narration ("a pattern stitched through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry, stoically sparkling in the dark") edges toward thematic echo, restating the premise in prompt-like phrasing. The line "The message wasn't for her. It was for them" flirts with explanation but stops short of full sermonizing. The sacrifice motif charges the ending without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of resilience-through-endurance emerges from Jorin's actions and the orb-fusion image. However, the line "Resilience isn't born from safety, but from enduring the unendurable" is an explicit thematic summary mid-climax, lowering subtlety. The bartered-awakening concept and "coax resilience from rubble" remain largely metaphorical labels rather than dramatized tensions. The ending offers a visual answer (blooming orchards) but no resonant, non-literal reconfiguration of prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through image and action: doors, keys, weights, threads weaving through choices. The shard as both key and burden crystallizes the cost of pursuit versus release. The final image—"the murmur of half-remembered dreams faded, replaced by the quiet hum of possibility"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The woman's line "some doors need to stay closed" risks thematic echo but is delivered in dialogue and immediately tested by Kael's choice. Subtext operates in the woman's smile that "didn't reach her eyes" and Kael's bodily recognition. Minor slip: "cyclically spontaneous" in the closing beat reads as authorial summary rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—endurance and connection in the face of darkness—emerges through the recurring motifs of light/dark, sea glass, and stacked stones without overt thesis statements. The final image offers a resonant answer: "even when the lamp flickers out, the sea's children find ways to endure." The phrase "luminescent ache" in the penultimate paragraph borders on thematic echo but is embodied enough in the "roar" of the sea and the warmth of the glass to avoid full sermonizing. Subtext operates in the cryptic notes and Elias's silent shifts. One weakness: "bottle it in gestures and words" is slightly abstract for a peak thematic beat; the insight could press harder into concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—light/dark as choice, the power of ancient tools to shape the future—emerges from images (lantern, shadows, dawn) rather than statement, which is a strength. The final paragraph lapses into direct thematic summary ("the dawn wasn't just a time of day. It was a choice") and the Herald's self-congratulation ("she'd always known her role was small, but tonight, it felt enough") replaces earned resonance with assertion. The shadows-as-living-secrets motif recurs but does not constrain a choice or reweight prior material at closure. No non-literal answer to the central question lands; the ending states the theme rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: story-magnetism, iridescent caution, quiet explosions in everyday moments. The blue morpho wing shifts from talisman to beacon to vanished lesson, charging the final image without overt moralizing. The donor heart as "new lens" ties interiority to thematic question. The ending offers a resonant answer—some hearts are built to hold stories—without a stated moral, and the travelers' shared connection dramatizes the concept. Minor slip: "iridescent caution" and "quietly explosive" appear as direct thematic labels in the final paragraph, edging toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme—that sorrow can be measured and transformed into light—emerges through images (bent light, healing wounds, glowing roots) rather than direct statement. However, the final paragraph over-articulates the theme ("even in decay, there was beauty") in a way that replaces scene pressure with authorial summary. The sextant's dream-map and the trees' memories are compelling particulars, but the closure does not reweight them through a non-literal final image; instead, it restates the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of restoration through forgotten memory emerges clearly through image and action. The phrase "woven dawns" recurs with purpose, shifting from metaphor to visible light by the ending. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary: "through forgotten songs, we remember how to live" states the moral directly. The piece resists full abstraction by grounding theme in the child's lullaby and the grandmother's memory, but the closing image (mica windows burning like tiny suns, voice never wavering) declares triumph rather than letting particulars resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of hiding as selective revelation emerges through Eleanor's arc and the society's secrecy, and the mother's letters ("admit you're lost") supply earned wisdom. The final image—Eleanor staying, wrapped in "enlarged tranquility"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, the phrase "hiding wasn't about retreat—it was about choosing when to reveal herself" tells the theme rather than letting the scene demonstrate it. The invitation's map and the letters anchor theme in particulars, but the climactic insight leans on assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.4)
    "Creeping normality" and "sacred in the ordinary" are repeated as labels rather than dramatized through image reweighting. The bread-to-seed substitution gestures at transformation, but its meaning is explicated ("understanding," "tenuous absolution") instead of left to resonate. The woman's dialogue—"The cracks. The places where light seeps through"—veers into Thematic Echo territory, restating the thesis in prompt-like language. The final paragraph moralizes: "The sacred wasn't hidden; it was waiting… for someone to notice." This direct statement replaces scene pressure and undercuts the accumulative work. Theme is coherent but over-articulated, preventing reflection beyond the immediate assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of meaning conjured from oblivion emerges through Elara's struggle with fading vows, not stated overtly. The lantern slides and light frequencies form a coherent motif. However, the ending offers a declarative success ("She had done it") rather than a resonant, non-literal image that reweights prior material. The dawn's arrival feels more literal rescue than thematic reprise, and no moral ambiguity or counter-reading lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core concept—"a truce of hush," silence as currency—emerges through her father's maxim and the market's whisper economy. Trust and betrayal accumulate in the father's disappearance, the misleading dockhand, the lisp-man's favor, and the recording's revelation. The smashed device and the line "Trust breaks so beautifully, doesn't it?" charge the thematic question. The closing image (cracked fob, hands still moving, "comforting unease") offers a non-literal answer: continuity persists amid damage. However, "comforting unease" as a phrase arrives late without sufficient embodied grounding earlier, reading slightly imposed. The father's pleading voice on the recording could have been seeded more subtly to deepen the trust-breaking motif organically.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically: the world's pain and the trees' vote to absorb or release it ground the "terrestrially cosmic" concept in concrete action. The compass as "sensing moments" rather than people reweights prior material. However, the final paragraph risks thematic echo—"dismissing the unexplainable, yet here it was"—articulating the lesson rather than trusting the image. The lavender-and-regret taste offers a lyric note but lacks the ambiguity that would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—confronting buried creative self—emerges from the cave setting, broken lock, and painting ritual rather than explicit moralizing. The final image (shadow-door opening, Elias sketching) offers resonance but leans toward comfort rather than complication; "for the first time in years, he felt truly seen" is an emotional summation that trends toward tidy closure. Subtext operates in the lock's "jagged teeth," the crystals "leaning in," and the cobalt streak, but "auroral sorrow" and "ghost of his younger self" tip into abstraction. The piece resists full platitude but does not charge ambiguity with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through the quill (truth as compass), the Archive (words crystallized/repurposed), and the final seed image (memory as presence rather than transcript). "Candor in small moments" surfaces in the keeper's line but doesn't feel organically dramatized—it arrives as a statement rather than arising from Elara's micro-choices. The orb's shift from "empty" to "seed" offers a resonant non-literal answer to whether lost words matter, and the keeper's grief adds complexity. The final image ("plant the seed where the oasis once was") reweights hope without a stated moral, though it leans slightly abstract. Subtext operates in the keeper's hesitation and the quill's physical response, but the explain-everything exchange in Room 12 undercuts ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme is overtly stated in the final two paragraphs: "remind," "color of wonder," "symphonies of truth." The piece tells rather than showing through image. "Silence and sound danced in perfect harmony" and "words had ceased to matter" are abstract declarations. The iceberg could have been a charged particular, but it dissolves without thematic friction. The ending moralizes ("testament to the symphonies of truth") instead of offering a resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme (chaos contained, fragmented wholeness) emerges organically from the controlled burn and the box, avoiding overt statement until the final reflective beat. The desert roses' brighter bloom and Clara-7's shift from burden to song provide a resonant non-literal answer. However, the closing line—"The static was still there, but now it felt like a song"—verges on thesis restatement, and the musing about "letting go and holding on all at once" edges toward platitude. The farm-as-box conceit and the controlled-burn-as-purification motif integrate well, though the piece occasionally foregrounds its thematic architecture rather than trusting the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of listening and love's endurance emerges through particulars (the letters, neighborhood lore). The locket's inscription "leads through following" functions as a clue but also gestures toward process. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit statement: "she'd solved the mystery, not by force, but by listening" and "a testament to love's endurance" tell rather than let the image resonate. The name coincidence ("My Dearest Clara") feels manufactured for thematic echo rather than earned irony.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of vulnerability as strength emerges through the scientist's encrypted legacy and Kael's mirroring dance. The final image ("some puzzles were meant to be unsolved, their answers lived, not read") offers a conceptual close, but it arrives as authorial statement rather than earned particular. The spider-web motif recurs but shifts meaning only through assertion. The drones freezing "as if humbled" replaces scene pressure with convenient moral victory, flattening the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme—preservation versus oblivion, memory as relational artifact—emerges organically from the salt-crystal archive and the rose's vibrant aliveness. The pressed wildflowers seed a motif that returns with reweighted meaning at the pedestal. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary: "gleaming silence" is invoked twice as a phrase rather than earned through image, and "to help them reclaim what was lost" tells the new purpose rather than showing its cost. The ending offers a conceptual answer but leans on assertion over resonant particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme—silence as language, fragility versus chaos—is stated rather than dramatized through choice and cost. The prophecy "code" is claimed to unravel but the mechanics remain opaque; no earned insight arises from struggle. The final image (wing crumbling, brook resuming) gestures at tranquility restored but offers no non-literal reweighting or conceptual cost. Prompt labels ("smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") replace concrete action that would let theme emerge from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of agreed-upon lies and truth's fleeting nature emerges through dialogue and the seal's mechanics, but the final moment offers a stated moral ("we lie to the building") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The line "Like truth" and the closing voice-answer summarize rather than charge the ending with felt ambiguity. The particulars (sugar-borrowing sessions, architect's journal) enrich texture but do not converge into a resonant final answer.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete images—quarantined memories, shells as keys, constellations of light—and the garden-as-archive conceit integrates with the premise. The final image of Lirael walking "halfway down the path" offers a non-literal answer to her abandonment question, yet the piece edges toward stating its thesis ("tragically radiant," "repurposing," "translate isolation") rather than letting particulars speak. The closing line "I'll come back... to the person I'd become" verges on moralizing summary. Emotional honesty is present in the willow-tree memory, but the resolution feels abstractly achieved rather than earned through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of forgiveness and reconciliation emerges from Lirael's stated purpose and the queen's backstory, but it is asserted rather than earned through specific on-page friction. The final image—vanishing, leaving "only the echo of her purpose"—gestures toward resonance but remains abstract; it does not reweight prior material through a non-literal answer. The "key with no apparent lock" is introduced as metaphor but never tested or transformed by event, limiting thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges through the recurring image of echoes as trapped stories and the seashell as listener, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image—canyon singing back "not in echo, but in answer"—offers a resonant non-literal close. However, the hooded figure's dialogue ("They are proof that even in silence, something remains") edges toward thematic summary. The seashell's symbolic recurrence charges the ending without the piece over-relying on it mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of connection between living and dead emerges from the snow globe motif and dream structure, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image attempts resonance via "windows of connection" open and truth flowing, but leans toward thesis statement rather than earned particulars. The three dream vignettes (child's laughter, son's guilt, widow's lost daughter) provide concrete anchors, yet they are told rather than dramatized, limiting thematic weight. No false balance or forced allegory, but the ending borders on thematic echo by articulating "fragile, enduring threads" in near-prompt language.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: hidden effort, silence beneath song, the demure audacity of the world's quiet labor. The bamboo tea whisk, fireflies, and moon paths recur with shifting weight, and the final image ("the bamboo tea whisk trembled in his hand") offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. The story avoids sermonizing, though phrases like "the demure audacity of it all" edge toward articulating theme rather than embodying it. The grandfather's aphorism ("by following moon paths, you learn to see the hidden") risks thematic echo but is dramatized through Kael's physical journey, limiting the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—dangerous secrets and the cost of truth—emerges through the stillpoint's leakage and Crane's vanishing, avoiding overt statement until the final line's "too dangerous to stay buried" edges toward summary. The flawed/flawless diamond pair offers a non-literal frame (decoy versus true anchor), but the resolution into "hope" and "keep digging" softens the ambiguity the dual diamonds introduced. The orchard's survival provides closure without forcing Mara to renounce a competing value, limiting thematic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—embracing fragility, storm as blueprint—emerges from imagery and Kael's stance, avoiding overt moralizing until the final beat. "You are the prism. You are the storm" hovers near thematic echo but is embedded in radio transmission rather than naked narrator declaration, preserving some indirection. The hourglass and variant allegiance remain abstract; the ending offers atmospheric validation rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Recurrence of the portico and frequencies builds pattern but does not constrain a choice or complicate the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—memory, redemption through recurrence—emerges from the music box and jar mechanics. The three attempted verses show craft-consciousness but read as on-the-nose thematic rehearsal rather than earned insight. The village woman's "Where did you find this?" / "In the silence, where all stories wait to be sweetened" borders on sermonizing. The final paragraph ("not to be remembered, but to remember") states the moral rather than letting the image carry it. Theme is coherent but relies on assertion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of harmony between physical and spectral emerges through the resonator's function and the key's purpose as "bridge." The final image of Elias standing vigil with the lighthouse beam sweeping overhead offers a resonant closure tied to his role. However, the ghost's line "The key's not a weapon. It's a bridge" states the theme too directly, and Elias's realization ("sonic absolution") arrives as a sudden label rather than being built from prior particulars. The "logically emotional" phrase recurs without deepening meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of patience versus impatience emerges through Kael's methodical work and the elders' "patient revolution" mantra. The concept of unyoking power "not by force, but by tracking moon paths" is integrated into the plot but borders on thesis statement ("To unyoke the world, one must first unyoke oneself"). The final image of the thawed lake and persistent hum offers a resonant answer to the central question without overt moralizing, yet the acolyte exchange ("When the impatience stops screaming") edges toward articulating the theme rather than embodying it. Subtext operates in the filings' coiling debate and the viaduct's "restless hum," but the didactic framing in the coda lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of memory as weapon versus chain emerges through the lantern's dual function. The piece attempts complexity (Mara sees herself "not as a victim, but as a survivor"), but the final paragraph lapses into near-thesis statement: "she'd use the lantern... not to entangle herself in the past, but to sever the threads... through empirical observation—the cold, hard facts he couldn't refute." This thematic echo restates the premise in prompt-like language rather than letting the final image resonate. The Eliza vision (courage, defiance) is gestural rather than causally integrated into Mara's present choice. Subtext is limited; most conflict is internalized and explained.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of redemption through craft emerges organically from the clockwork heart's symbolic function and the inmates' work. Subtext operates in Mrs. Elms's gesture ("fingers lingering") and Marcus's unbidden poetic fragment. The final image (heart under arm, rain falling) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. However, "light breaks through storm clouds" and "apology in metal" verge on overt thematic statement, and the ending's profundity is asserted more than earned by prior complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    The yearning-algorithm-as-dance and "seen, not solved" idea threads through action, avoiding overt thesis statements. The final hum rather than ring offers a non-literal answer that reweights the quest. Weakness: Old Thrum's ghost chuckling in the closing line edges toward nudge-wink commentary that slightly deflates the resonance, and the algorithm's conceptual cost (what Lira gave up to achieve this) remains unspoken, limiting thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of erasure and institutional memory emerges from the premise but is stated rather than embodied. Elara's video delivers the thematic thesis directly ("they're using it to delete people"). The recurring numbers function as mystery mechanics rather than charged motif—their meaning is decoded but they don't reweight prior material or force moral calculus. The final paragraph asserts resolve ("she would make sure the world remembered") in place of a resonant image. The patch appears three times but remains static; its spiral galaxy symbol is never integrated into the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the weaving of broken empathy threads and the fragment's reconstitution, avoiding overt moralizing until the final line's statement: "courage wasn't in the absence of fear, but in the choice to act anyway." This thesis-echo dilutes the thematic resonance that the mirror sequence and aurora approval had built. The sailor/mother/lover glimpses offer concrete particulars, but the ending toggles toward assertion rather than letting the glowing fragment speak for itself. The core question—can empathy quiet collective fear—receives a visible answer (yes, via light and warmth) yet without ambiguity or lingering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of finding purpose through unexpected action emerges organically from the rescue sequence, and the "fold in patience" concept recurs with shifting emphasis (waiting vs. acting). The parasol tip's return in the final beat offers a purposeful reprise that reweights sentimentality as rootedness. However, the thematic question—whether Lila will choose life—receives only the vague answer "flicker of something like peace," avoiding a resonant, non-literal final image that would reconfigure prior material. The scientist's whispered "I was looking for something" / "We all are" exchange skirts platitude, though it stops short of overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of "destined mismatches" and beauty arising from imbalance emerges organically through Elias's sun-moon metaphor, the vineyard's thriving on adversity, and the burned letter's surviving meaning. The piece resists a tidy moral; Lila's insight is earned through concrete exchange rather than assertion. The final image—two mismatched souls in an imperfect dance, rain falling—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the sun-moon line *"You were the sun to my moon"* and Elias's explicit gloss ("harmony isn't silence. It's the tension between notes") edge toward thematic echo, though they remain embedded in dialogue and tied to the letter.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme of preservation and wisdom-as-living-archive is stated rather than emerged from conflict. "Strangely honest" appears as label without dramatized tradeoff. The final paragraph moralizes: "balance was restored," "the line would endure"—abstract summation replacing scene pressure. No fresh inflection; the "echo of wisdom" recurs as decorative motif without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to a central question.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of resilience and healing through reclamation emerges organically from the factory/lavender juxtaposition and is anchored in specific images (arcs, vines, dove). The final sketch and word "enough" attempt a non-literal answer but lean on the prompt's own language ("transmute," "collective healing") rather than discovering a fresh resonance. The piece resists overt moralizing yet the grandmother's lesson is told rather than discovered through dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the fractured-sequences motif: growth as non-linear, mosaic-like, revealed through ivy, rumors, flowers, and the crystal's facets. The final image—Elias moving differently through the city, seeing patterns everywhere—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. "Weathered innocence" and the library's suspended hush charge the ending. The piece avoids explicit thesis statements, though "courage to speak" edges toward soft summary. Subtext operates in gesture and image, and the theme resists tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—memory, impermanence, clinging to echoes of time—emerges organically from the precognitive forgetfulness, the chalk talisman, the driftwood markers, and the search for the "sound of growing older." The final image (the bolder chalk line and "I was here. I heard it. I remembered.") offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, "the sound of growing older" as central metaphor risks abstraction; it's evocative but not anchored in a concrete particular that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. The "hush of old videotapes left unwatched" recurs as atmosphere but doesn't constrain or charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of impermanence and escape velocity emerges through the clock's rebellion and Elias's craft. The recurring "ephemeral" and "leaf falling" motifs accumulate meaning. The final image of leaping into the portal offers a non-literal answer to the central question of whether time can be tamed. However, the ending flirts with abstraction ("luminous ache," "fear and wonder") rather than grounding the thematic payoff in concrete particulars, and the hand's silence feels too tidy—a symbolic convenience that arrives to mark closure rather than charging it with lived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of music as bridge to acceptance emerges through concrete particulars (vinyl shard, hymn lyrics, shared breath). The vinyl's transfer to Clara and the "pulsing stillness" motif attempt resonance, but the final paragraph over-articulates the thematic question ("the joy of witnessing reunification") rather than letting the image speak. The phrase "hymning the mundane" and "scent of hope" are prompt-label echoes that assert theme rather than earn it through action. The ending gestures toward a non-literal answer (continuation of work, humming under breath) but lacks the charge needed to reweight prior material without a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the imagery of loops, sealed awakenings, and hidden shadows rather than direct statement. The final image—shadows pooling beneath the isle as a backward-flowing time gateway—offers a resonant answer to "where shadows go at noon" without moralizing. However, the automaton key and celestial alignment function more as plot mechanics than thematic particulars that accumulate pressure. The conceptual repricing is legible but the piece leans toward puzzle-solving over lived complexity. No epiphany is cheaply handed; the discovery feels earned by observation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of confronting versus avoiding reflections emerges through image (the garden as mirror) and the two teeth bridging past and present. The final line—"the garden itself had decided to forgive them"—externalizes agency and edges toward a tidy moral rather than letting particulars resonate. The phrase "mistakes are just constellations waiting to be mapped" is elegant but arrives as assertion rather than emerging from the scene's pressure. Bone-setting as metaphor (realigning what has been disjointed) is purposeful, though the healer's tools appear late and their symbolic freight is told.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—stillness as the space between, light as loan not gift—emerges organically through the polishing ritual and mother's maxims. The final image (pearl dissolving, star winking) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. However, the mother's cryptic notes and Elara's epiphanies lean toward abstraction rather than earned struggle. The sea glass shard in her pocket seeds continuity, but thematic weight rests on the inherited lesson rather than a non-obvious synthesis discovered through on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (healing through integration rather than erasure) emerges organically from the grafting metaphor, drip-pattern stones, and pendant transformation without overt statement until "healing wasn't about erasing the past but letting it breathe"—which edges toward summary but follows enacted choices. The ending offers a resonant image: sapling, moss-threaded pendant, hands in soil together. Subtext operates in Elias's quiet approach and Lila's hesitation before unclasping. The final "conversation" line risks restating theme but stays anchored in the planting action and mild ambiguity about impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme—embracing unfinished, living story—emerges through concrete images (seashell spiral, mist-shapes, whisper of closing pages) rather than bald statement. However, the woman's line "Let them breathe. Let them change" and the final manuscript line "trusting the journey" edge into thematic echo, asserting the premise rather than dramatizing its cost. The seashell's warm promise and Clara's smile at the end resolve the question too cleanly; no counter-pressure or ambiguity lingers. The nexus particulars (child's laughter, soldier, poet) are ephemeral set-dressing without causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges organically from grandmother's words and the need for communal tending, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraphs ("magic, like life, required constant tending"). The vine-tendril and sapling recur with shifting meaning, but the ending retreats into abstract summary ("the true remedy lay in the hands of those who dared to remember") rather than letting the image speak. The penultimate line "Everything aligned, just as it should" borders on thematic echo, reducing earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of stillness versus restlessness, patience as mastery, and the inner map as guide emerges through the orchard imagery and Elias's process. The final insight—"not just where to go, but how to feel"—borders on stating the theme rather than letting the particulars resonate. The moving stillness motif recurs, but the ending image (wrapping the plate, walking back) does not reweight prior material with fresh cost or ambiguity; instead it offers a soft, declarative summary that flattens thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of capturing wonder versus imprisoning it emerges through concrete images: bottled echoes, the "cellar of reason," and Elias's question whether preservation is enough. The timer's surface—"cold, yet humming with latent energy"—and the final descent to the waiting keepers offer resonance without overt moralizing. Yet the ending does not reweight prior material; it confirms the premise rather than repricing it. The reflection "some doors open only when you stop looking directly at them" leans toward stated insight rather than earned image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme (the ethics of processing grief: what to carry, what to leave buried) emerges through the specific work of melting hush into fractals and culminates in the locket refusal—a non-literal answer to the question of whether all burdens should be lifted. The recurring motif of "weights, not wounds" and the shingled hush as solidified grief are concretely embodied rather than abstract. The final dream of the grotto as lullaby resonates without moralizing. Minor slip: "Some truths were too heavy to share, even when woven into fractals" edges toward thematic summary in place of image.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—loss as transformation, carrying the dead forward—emerges organically from the carving action and the ash wood's particularity. The final image (lion on sill, candlelight through rain) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph states the thesis explicitly ("Loss wasn't an ending, but a transformation"), and the final line ("This is how we survive") edges toward summary. The carving as vessel for memory is a strong particular, but the scaffolding around it dilutes resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (forgiveness, release from eroded ambitions) emerges from Veyra's actions and the lagoon's imagery rather than statement, and the final image of her wading away offers resonance without overt moralizing. The camera wheel and rose recur with shifted meaning, and the ghost's "Because you haven't forgiven yourself" is specific enough to avoid pure platitude. However, the fishermen coda and "The lagoon, however, knew the truth" veer toward thematic assertion that undercuts the earned ambiguity of the wade-into-horizon moment.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—repurposing broken systems, functional resurrection—emerges from the terminal's transformation and Lila's engineering metaphor, avoiding overt sermonizing until the final paragraphs. However, the closing lines tip into thematic echo: "a future built not on nostalgia, but on the courage to repurpose the old into the new" and "a single equation in a universe of possibilities" articulate the story's thesis in prompt-like language. The equation projected on the wall gestures toward resonance but lacks the specificity to reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. Conceptual cost is asserted ("raw, untested") rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—listening beyond routine, reclaiming paused dreams—emerges through quartz hum, bear as wildness-messenger, and the "silence between beats" image. No overt moralizing; the ending resonates without stating a thesis. Petrichor and the forecourt's song are concrete anchors. One friction: "The keep was not a prison. It was a compass" borders on epiphany-statement; the prior image work (bear's glance, quartz warmth) carries more weight and nearly rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme ("truth lies where light dares not tread," "architecture of lies") emerges through image and the sundial motif, avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's blueprint description ("controlling the narrative"). The final image (dawn over canal, "clarity to see the world as it truly was") reweights prior material but edges toward thesis statement rather than dramatized tension. Subtext operates in gesture (captain's wariness, door creaking) and the sundial's shifting shadow. The piece invites reflection on perception versus reality, yet the thematic answer feels awarded by arrival rather than wrestled from contradictory evidence or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—preservation as patient refusal to let wisdom die—emerges from the fulgurite glass, knots, and Elias's reflection. The final image ("the act of preservation itself") offers a resonant reconfiguration, but the woman's dialogue borders on thematic echo ("In the silence between heartbeats… In the way a seed remembers its purpose"), explicitly articulating what the scene pressure should dramatize. The glass-as-promise metaphor is apt yet slightly overstated in the penultimate beat.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of healing-as-geography and explained absences emerges from the obituary premise and the thread motif. The vanished woman's story offers one specific enactment. However, the final three paragraphs drift into explicit theme statements ("explained absences were not endings but beginnings," "geography of healing," "lonesome splendor") that replace scene pressure with summary. The phrase "After the last ship sailed" recurs but does not shift meaning; it functions as atmosphere rather than a charged return. No earned epiphany arises from concrete struggle—Elara simply receives confirmation of her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—beauty cannot be engineered but must be nurtured—emerges from the premise and images (egg, palace, mechanical vs. organic). The orb's "flawed, imperfect" nature and "bitterly sweet struggle" are stated rather than dramatized at closure. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "in that imperfection...lay the truest beauty of all" and "We'll remember," reducing earned resonance. Subtext operates in the palace's sighing and the stalactites' hum, but the ending explains rather than invites reflection. The piece resists full complexity by framing the Mechanists as purely wrong without dramatizing their perspective or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of scars singing is seeded early (arsonist's daughter, grafting new roots) and returned at closure via the sand grain and final line. The bird's wing as scar-metaphor is apt. However, the final paragraph tells the theme ("Compassion…wasn't about erasing the past") rather than letting the image carry it. The specificity of volcanic sand and coin anchor the concept, but the ending shifts into abstract philosophizing ("all were scars. And all of them sang") instead of letting particulars resonate without gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges through the image pattern of forgotten histories and the tension between skepticism and imagination, avoiding overt thesis statements until the final paragraph's "some truths are worth waiting for" veers toward platitude. The stained glass box and breadcrumbs function thematically but feel ornamental—they don't constrain Lira's choices or create moral friction. "Sidereal patience" and "defiant hush" are repeated as labels without dramatized cost. The ending offers a lyric resonance (box now empty, city alive) that reweights the premise, but the thematic question—what does it cost to trust the unseen?—is never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of generational patterns as bridges rather than chains emerges clearly through the fire/light dichotomy. However, the final insight is stated directly ("generational patterns weren't about repeating the past, but about refining it") rather than embodied in a non-literal image. The ghost's monologue ("Fire is a language... we forgot how to speak it gently") delivers the thematic answer through explicit articulation. The ending carries earnest emotional weight but lacks the resonant ambiguity that would lift it beyond teachable morals.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the greenhouse as living repository, the ribbon's color shifts, and the family's poem-trading custom as grief bridge. The ending poem ("grief is not a hole, but a door") reweights the premise without heavy-handed moralizing, and the butterflies' flight "lingering in his bones" offers a resonant physical answer to the central question. However, the spectral voice occasionally edges into direct thematic statement ("your family's grief is not a burden, but a bridge"), and the final paragraph's shift from present action to future intention ("Tomorrow, he would carve...") softens the immediacy of the thematic landing, making the resonance more told than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of incremental absolution emerges organically through the inscription, the grandfather's teaching, and Lirael's patient correction. The final image—cracks sealing, tide surging in relief—offers a resonant answer to the question of balance without stating a moral. The rake inscription and rune glow accumulate meaning across beats. A minor slip: "tiny, persistent acts that held the world together" in the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary, though it remains rooted in Lirael's embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.5)
    Theme ("the dead speak in echoes, intentions across time") emerges through concrete images—tapestry threads, chess pieces, constellation patterns—but the final paragraph explicates rather than dramatizes: "The dead were not silent; they spoke in the language of echoes." The story resists a tidy moral yet the closure tells us Elara is "a gardener not just of the earth, but of time itself" instead of showing the cost or friction of that role. Subtext operates in the woven symbols but dissolves into direct thematic statement at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of possibility within constraint emerges through Lira's modeling and the repeated claim "innovation thrives in constraint, not in freedom." The kingfisher's dive and the quill's splintering offer symbolic recurrence, but the piece leans on abstract statements ("The future is not written, but it can be sketched") rather than letting the final image speak. The thaw serves as literal validation rather than a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Burning the journals gestures toward release but does not reweight prior material with ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—the persistence of narrative and the quiet labor of memory—emerges through particulars (dust, fragments, static) without overt moralizing. The final image of teaching dust to sing offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, and the father's "ghost bards" motif seeds early and returns with reweighted meaning. However, the thematic charge is diluted by exposition ("This was why she did it—not for glory, but for the quiet joy") that states rather than dramatizes the insight. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces complexity in the post-famine world, yet the ending affirms rather than reconfigures.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—art as both anchor and illusion, the impossibility of preserving fleeting experience—emerges from the gallery's transient works and Lira's ash medium. The mask and incomplete portrait function as motifs that recur with slight shifts in meaning. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("safety is an illusion, and art is the only truth worth chasing") rather than letting the image resonate without commentary. The ending image (ash glittering like stardust, footsteps swallowed) offers some non-literal charge, but the preceding exposition dilutes its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from Elias's actions and the layered sediment as a metaphor for "unmediated truth" and "competing narratives." The cog's alignment with the needle offers a concrete image rather than a stated moral. However, the final exchange leans on meta-commentary ("It's the sound of a thousand narratives, all competing. All *true*") that edges toward thematic echo, and Elias's epiphany ("he finally felt… understood") arrives as summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (harmony as holding conflict gently) emerges through image and motif without overt statement, and the zither rosette functions as a recurring anchor. The line "hatred, she knew, was a kind of noise—a cacophony that drowned out the quieter truths" edges toward thesis but is brief. The final image (rosette spinning, "something new could take root") offers resonance, yet it restates the premise rather than reweighting it through a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of gentle rebellion and beauty from ruins is stated multiple times ("gentle rebellion against a world that had forgotten beauty," quoting graffiti, final paragraph moralizing). The synaptic plasticity metaphor is imposed rather than emergent from scene particulars. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "All it took was a little pruning, a little patience, and a willingness to rebel—gently—against the darkness." This replaces scene pressure with summary and undercuts thematic resonance. The vision of future gardens is told rather than earned through present cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of wonder versus routine emerges organically from the tower's mechanics and Clara's role. The metaphor of drones pollinating doubt is specific and fresh. However, the ending tips into thematic statement—"A riddle. And the answer is *you*"—rather than letting the image resonate. The lacquer box riddle feels imposed rather than discovered, and Voss's explanation ("The tower runs on your curiosity") verges on moralizing. The final image of nectar dusk carries some resonance but doesn't fully reweight prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of "hush as potential" and objects as anchors emerges through the orris root experiment and displaced-object motif, but the piece tells us the insight ("The hush wasn't emptiness; it was potential") rather than letting the ending image carry it non-literally. "Inadvertently profound" is named but not dramatized with cost. The final glow and sanctification lean toward overt symbolism without ambiguity or counter-reading. The thematic question is posed but answered too neatly, without the friction or complexity that would make it resonate beyond the immediate plot.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of nuance versus certainty emerges through the three revelations (grandmother transformed not dead, blight artificial, Lumen as bridge). The phrase "to welcome nuance into a certainty" is explicitly stated by Lumen, bordering on thematic echo (−0.3). The ampoule's reframing as catalyst rather than cure offers conceptual resonance, and the ending image of forgotten-but-alive garden supports the theme. However, the grandmother's sacrifice is told rather than earned through earlier specifics, and the final paragraph edges toward summarizing the moral ("even in decay, there is room for growth") rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (holding loss without possessing it) emerges from the dice orbit and Kael's final whisper, avoiding overt moralizing. The chipped die as "flaw gleaming like a star" and the space-between-dice image resist easy reduction. However, "the texture of his missed opportunity" and "the confinement was still boundless" lean toward prompt-echo abstraction rather than fully earning resonance through scene pressure. The final image offers a non-literal answer but edges close to thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—kindness as a language that outlives its speakers—emerges organically from the brush, extinct dialects, and the portrait. The final lesson "To love is to translate" risks overt statement but is dramatized through Mr. Voss's offer to teach. The vermilion eyes as "saffron quiet" and the chamomile scent provide sensory resonance. However, the ending leans toward platitude ("remembered warmth") rather than a non-literal answer with undeniable cost. The conceptual repricing is legible but not charged by prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—art as survival, tradition as defiance of displacement—emerges organically from Lila's actions and the grotto's history. The emerald lens filtering grief to beauty offers a resonant image, and the bread-as-names custom grounds abstraction in ritual. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("Art, like bread, required patience, care, and a willingness to rise again") rather than letting the scene do thematic work. The ending reweights prior material but leans on metaphor rather than a non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of defying fate through reverse-engineering time emerges from concrete action (backward clocks, counter-clockwise gears). The hunger stone as a symbol of latent power feeds the thematic question. However, the final paragraph delivers a thesis statement: "Fate's design had been a lock; he'd just picked it." This meta-commentary replaces earned resonance with assertion. The phrase "neatly inventive to the end" is self-congratulatory thematic echo. The piece gestures toward complexity (triumph and terror) but resolves into tidy vindication without ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges around fear-as-illusion and the power of paradox, shown through Mara's refusal to flee and her spoken inversion. The cloak's lingering luminance recurs with shifting weight (inherited glow → resuscitation hum → final golden pulse) and the funhouse-as-devouring-mouth metaphor ties to the climax. However, Vey's final line—"Because fear, like beauty, is a lie. And lies unravel when exposed to the truth"—states the theme overtly, reducing resonance. The ending image (golden clasp, Vey's cold smile, "the truth that survives") gestures toward ambiguity but doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central theme—obstacles as instruments, chaos as raw material for harmony—emerges organically from Leeward's ritual and the orchard's transformation. The mallet's "sketched resonance" and the cloud scrolls function as recurring images that shift meaning by the end. Subtext operates in gesture and image (the driftwood circle's groaning, the ghost hum in the air). However, the thematic payoff leans toward overt declaration ("obstacles are just instruments waiting to be tuned") rather than fully trusting implication. The final image (mosaic of planks, kelp, fruit) offers a resonant answer without a stated moral, but the emotional cost feels muted, limiting the depth of the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme—knowledge pursued at catastrophic cost, warnings mistaken for riddles—emerges organically from the pattern language, the mother's vanished expedition, and the climactic inversion (gate as trap, not protection). The final line "They'd been screaming all along" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The reed whistle and journal motifs recur with reweighted meaning at closure. One weakness: the phrase "quietly driven" in paragraph three feels like a thematic label inserted for the prompt rather than dramatized through specific contradictory impulses, slightly diluting the organic emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of noble lies versus truth emerges through the manifesto, tunnel symbols, and the final seed inscription. The story resists a simplistic moral by showing the lie as survival bridge rather than pure deception. However, the final paragraph over-articulates theme: "lies, even noble ones, erode unless balanced by courage" and "gardeners of memory" state the lesson rather than letting the image carry it. Conceptual cost is implied but not felt in a concrete choice or omission.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    "Interlaced absence" emerges through concrete particulars—the pavilion's half-drowned arches, the preserved specimens, the lovers' desk—without overt thesis statements. The final image (Elara signing her note, the inkwell "lighter") reweights the opening ritual as inherited practice rather than solo invention, a non-literal answer to whether absence is "a kind of presence." The grandmother's phrase avoids sentimentality by anchoring in objects and actions. A slight penalty for one throat-clearing moment: "Was absence a kind of presence? A ghostly architecture?" articulates the theme too directly mid-story, though the ending recovers by showing rather than telling.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (truth vs. denial, honest origins) emerges through concrete particulars: the hidden journal, the vault's engineering, Elara's confession. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the swim home and "Some darknesses, once faced, become light." However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("not as a warning, but as a reclaimed stillness") that replaces scene pressure with assertion. The owl-crest motif recurs but its thematic weight is more decorative than causally charged at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of grief-as-transformation emerges organically through the polishing/folding motif and the basilica's paradox. "To transform was to carry the old into the new, to let grief and hope intertwine like vines" is direct, but the surrounding imagery (origami cranes catching lantern-glow, spires shedding ascending stars) embodies the concept without sermonizing. The final image—polishing the next gem—offers a resonant answer: survival through perpetual transmutation. The piece resists tidy resolution; the shadow will return, and she'll fold that too.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—trauma as fuel, grief transmuted into agency—emerges through the geode-as-key and the vortex's "unused potential" image. The final crystal and her walk toward new nodes offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question (how to survive catastrophe). Yet the piece leans on prompt-adjacent phrasing: "unfiltered awakening," "perturbation," "intangibly tangible" are invoked as labels rather than discovered through particulars. The closing assertion "She was no longer a survivor. She was a seer. A disrupter" risks Thematic Echo, stopping just short of overt moralizing but still articulating the thesis rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (belonging as resonance, not place) emerges from the frequency metaphor and the pilgrim's declaration, but the final image—"a melody without words, a language older than language itself"—tilts toward abstraction rather than a non-literal, particular answer. The prism recurs (splits light, spins at the end) but does not reweight prior material with new cost. The pilgrim's "Now we listen" substitutes for dramatized stance crystallization. Thematic statements cluster in the final third ("It's not a place. It's a resonance"), risking the Thematic Echo penalty but stopping short of full sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of silence and erasure emerges through the driftwood particulars and the "sieved hush" motif. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("some truths were too heavy to carry alone," "The sieved hush had to be broken, even if it meant drowning in the sound") rather than letting the image of Elias ascending the steps carry the weight without gloss. The question of whether revelation is mercy or betrayal is posed but not answered through concrete action or a resonant final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the drawer pull's evolution: "some mistakes are meant to be let go" versus "some are meant to be carried." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the thematic pivot relies heavily on Clara's articulated insight ("Because some mistakes…") rather than purely dramatized action, and Elias's echo ("synchronizing through moon phases") borders on thematic redundancy. The piece invites reflection but the dual-pull symmetry feels slightly arranged.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—aligning heart and action, the weight of regrets versus self-navigation—emerges from the compass, the grandfather's aphorism, and the lighthouse climb. The final image (leaving the compass, paddling by her own weight) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the piece edges toward over-articulation: "regret wasn't a compass; it was a tide" and "the backlash of regrets… was just the ocean's way of reminding her she was alive" are near-thematic echo moments that risk stating what the image already conveys. The compass's scratches as regretted choices is a strong particular, but the phrase "flickering faith" and "merrily melancholic" recur as thematic labels rather than earned textures.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme—choice, empathy, and the weight of unchosen paths—emerges from the lake's reflections and the baseball's recurrence. Yet key moments lean on direct statement: "You're a mosaic of every path you didn't take" and "That's what empathy is" articulate the thesis rather than letting image and action carry it. The final image (baseball glowing in Mara's coat, city indifferent) offers a resonant note, but the closing paragraph's summary ("not to erase, but to understand") edges toward moralizing. The story invites reflection but does not resist tidy explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of transformation as rebirth rather than loss emerges through the phoenix's cycle and Lira's shift from whisperer to bridge. The fortune cookie's line ("The greatest metamorphosis begins with a step you fear") initially reads as prompt echo, but the story reweights it by embodying fear in Lira's throat-tightening and cracked voice. Subtext operates in the creatures' silent offerings and the phoenix's wordless understanding at the end. However, the final paragraph veers into overt thematic statement—"metamorphosis is not an ending, but a rebirth"—which replaces scene pressure with direct assertion. The orchard's magic and scent-language offer fresh texture, but the reluctance/acceptance arc resolves too tidily into wisdom without lingering ambiguity or cost that complicates the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—grief, time, and the search for lost connection—emerges through the cards, saucer, and handprint motif rather than direct statement. The mother's closing line ("repentance isn't a place. It's a choice") verges on thematic echo but is brief enough to avoid heavy penalty. The final image (new handprint in onyx ink, mist parting to show a path home) offers a resonant answer: lost time accumulates in "the spaces between breaths, in the cracks we willingly perplex." However, the piece leans toward poetic assertion ("choking and bright," "The clock's always ticking, even when it's broken") rather than earning insight strictly through prior dramatic particulars. The saucer and cloth do recur with shifted meaning, and the emotional truth of unresolved grief reads specific, lifting the score into the 6.5–7.2 range.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—peace as courage, engagement vs. avoidance, grief/love as twins—emerges from particulars (mother's erased face, crew's uploaded minds, long-dried tears on photographs). The AI's question ("what if engagement is the only way to prevent monstrosity?") verges on thematic statement but is offset by the meditation sequence and garden payoff. The final image (bioluminescent trees, laughter echoing as "ghostly resolve") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "to hold it together long enough for others to see its beauty" edges toward moralizing summary in the penultimate paragraph. The faint shimmer motif charges the closure but "via" in the prompt element reads more method than integrated symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    The transformation theme is stated directly rather than emerging from specific events: "Transformation wasn't about grand gestures…" is pure tell. The hush as "the language of transformation" and "texture" remain poetic abstractions without grounded particulars. The bugs-as-prophecy-verses conceit introduces symbolic machinery late without prior setup. The final image of constellation footprints attempts resonance but the thematic answer—transformation is "the quiet moment between breaths"—reads as platitude rather than earned wisdom from concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of quiet revolution through knowledge emerges from the sundial cipher and hidden network, avoiding overt moralizing. The astronomer's quill holder and "cradle of sparks" concept carry symbolic weight, but the ending declares hope and future change rather than offering a resonant, non-literal image that reweights prior material. "And they'll know the spark can't be extinguished" is thematic summary, not earned subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—understanding sacred patterns as witnessing rather than control—emerges organically from Lira's attempts and vision-fragments. The final image (eels forming a living sigil, star dust pulsing steadily) offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. Yet the epiphany leans slightly abstract ("a language to honor") and lacks a sharper conceptual cost or counter-reading; the ending feels affirming rather than complicating prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—rarefying poetry by exposing scars, the tension between censorship and truth—emerges organically from the cartographer's fragment and Kael's evolving stance. The final image ("let the storm kiss his wonder, raw and unfiltered") reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the mask imagery (Ministry's porcelain vs. Kael's patchwork) and the notion of "furiously tranquil." Minor slip: "When masks slip, the sky weeps" verges on thematic echo, though it's woven into the poem-within-story rather than direct narration.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (questions as journeys, chaos as honesty, collaborative refinement) emerges clearly from the duel structure and tin-card decoding. The sundial and needle holes accumulate symbolic weight without overt moralizing. However, the final exchange ("Next time, we'll make one together") borders on thematic summary rather than image-driven resonance, and the penultimate line ("better questions") edges toward platitude. The concept of "hidden overture" is invoked but not dramatized with specific cost or friction that would deepen the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.6)
    The "blooming resistance" motif recurs across the tin's lid, Cedar's writing, and the final garden metaphor, earning thematic coherence. The piece resists overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's "map" metaphor, which edges toward thesis statement. The closing image—"something bloomed"—offers a non-literal answer to the rebuild-versus-growth question, but the resonance is diluted by the explanatory framing ("it was enough") rather than trusting the image alone. Theme emerges from concrete particulars (tin, poems, floorboard) yet the final articulation leans slightly didactic, preventing higher-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—strategic planning dissolving, refuge from fate's chaos—emerges through the broken clock, flickering compasses, and Clara's descent. The final image (open piano, vibrating strings, spinning compasses) attempts a non-literal answer but stops short of reweighting prior material with cost; Clara's stance shift is declared ("she'd surprise it back") rather than earned through prior friction. The "strategically creative" phrase and the clock stuck at 11:59 risk overt symbolism but stay anchored in Clara's present perception. The piece resists easy moralizing, yet the thematic question—can refuge escape fate?—receives only a gestural answer without visible consequence, preventing entry into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme—memory as compass versus cage—emerges from particulars (the fraying tapestry, the mirrors) and resists overt moralizing until the final paragraph's "choice...between fear and courage" nudges toward thesis. The storm-woman's dialogue ("to remember is to choose") operates as direct thematic statement rather than implication. The seed functions as symbolic recurrence without earning deeper resonance through constraint, and the ending offers a neat binary (safe memory, resolved doubt) that lacks the ambiguity the piece gestures toward.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of wounds growing stronger when nurtured emerges from the bonsai frame and the lace-as-emotional-map conceit. The final image—lace on the wall, tides of hearts at peace—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The piece resists easy binaries (severance as door, not wall; patience as rhythm, not stillness) and the ghost's translucency avoids full reification. Minor deduction: "tides of remembrance… are the pull of what's left unsaid" is close to a thematic echo, and the final sentence ("hearts finally at peace") leans slightly toward summary rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Themes of patience and forgiveness emerge through concrete events and images, not statement; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, such as the lace embodying emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of gradual, untidy change and humility before complex systems are strongly woven through repeated imagery (dust, decay, chrysalis, neutron stars). The parallel between stellar death and greenhouse recovery generates organic resonance rather than feeling grafted on. However, several lines state the thesis quite directly (“Gradual change…is the universe’s only constant”; “Decay isn’t an event, it’s a language”), nudging the piece toward mild sermonizing. The final exchange with the botanist nicely reweights the theme via suggestion of tree rings and climate data, hinting at larger implications without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres around ephemerality, hidden maps, and “pauses” where truth and purpose reside, with strong image systems (frost, scorched ledger, glass) supporting it. The mirrored methods of Elias and Lirael nicely imply kinship in how they see what others miss. Yet the story undercuts some subtlety by explicitly stating the thesis (“Her purpose wasn’t… but to mark time…”, “The world, she’d learned, was full of hidden maps. You just had to know where to look”), sliding toward moralizing. The resonance is genuine but could trust its images a bit more and say less outright.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of silence as presence, nonverbal communication, and art born from trauma emerge organically from particulars: the wreck, the tuning forks, Lirael’s notes to Elias, and the plants moving to unheard music. The idea that “noise became impossible” for her and that she instead finds a “silent language of feeling” is dramatized rather than merely asserted, especially in the lullaby scene. Some lines edge toward explicit thesis (“She’d rectified her silence, not by reclaiming her voice, but by redefining what music could be”), which slightly dulls the subtextual power built by images. Nonetheless, the final reconfiguration—gratitude toward the capsize, silence as a learned language—lingers with conceptual and emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of grief, rest, and belonging are organically seeded through the coffin/lens parallels and the idea of distress signals becoming noise. There is a genuine attempt to reframe “rest” from a static end to an inhabited space, and the recurring lens image supports that. Yet key insights are over-articulated—lines like “Rest wasn’t an end. It was a beginning” and the explicit “Here lies knowledge. Here lies hope.” feel like thesis statements rather than emergent realizations, blunting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of intergenerational solidarity, the politics of anonymity, and transforming imposed scarcity into communal strength are strong and organically tied to events. The bell’s evolving meaning (from relic to summons to celebration) works well as a thematic vehicle. That said, the narration sometimes slips into explicit statement—“Mira’s motivation had been simple…” and “The sanctions had tried to starve them of hope…”—which edges toward essayistic moralizing rather than trusting image and scene. The final lines still leave a resonant aftereffect around who speaks and who listens in oppressed communities.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of compassion, latent love, and revelation in liminal spaces are clear and integrated with the imagery of light, breath, and the pool. The conceptual answer—that unused love lives in “the spaces between breaths” and similar in-betweens—does reweight earlier details. However, the text leans into explicit statement (“She understood now… She had found where unused love was stored”) in a way that flattens subtext and edges toward sermonizing. The insight feels more like a well-articulated thesis than surprising, earned wisdom arising from dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of time, memory, preservation, and the ethics of manipulating history emerge naturally from the photographs, visions, and the garden’s living architecture. The final realization—that time is more “story” than tactile texture—organizes what came before and reframes her professional identity (designing mazes “to remember” rather than to confuse). That insight is emotionally plausible but somewhat stated rather than fully embodied, veering close to thesis language. Subtext around control vs. acceptance and the costs of clarity is present but could tolerate more ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of resilience, generational foresight, and liberation are well embedded in the seed vault, chains, and collapsing wall imagery. The idea of “planting resilience in dry soil” is literal and metaphorical in a satisfying way, and the ending image of seeds restraining greed while waking the earth has genuine resonance. That said, the story leans a bit close to an uplift narrative—hope triumphs, bad guys ensnared, world begins healing—without much moral ambiguity or visible lingering cost, which keeps the thematic field relatively straightforward. Still, the motifs (arrow, keys, seeds, wall) cohere organically rather than as decorative symbols.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    Memory, absence, betrayal, and sensory transmutation are tightly woven: vials of “absence,” trees storing memories, and a device that lets her hear what’s missing all reinforce a coherent thematic web. The choice to make the final reward the ability to hear “the absence where love should be” is a strong, non-literal answer to the story’s questions about loss and trust. The piece mostly avoids explicit moralizing, relying instead on image and action to carry meaning. It could edge higher if there were a sharper tension between her desire to know and the potential harm of fully hearing that betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of theft versus gift, hidden versus revealed light, and destiny as something to be reinterpreted rather than obeyed emerge naturally from events and recurring images (the lily’s meaning, the jar, the rejuvenated photograph). The jar’s behavior enacts the idea that illuminating a moment can transform it without consuming it, which reweights Elara’s profession in a satisfying way. The final notion of destiny’s door as a garden she can seed is conceptually resonant, though it edges close to spelled-out thesis language. Overall the piece invites reflection on what it means to “steal” time or memories without collapsing into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of abandonment, fracture, and the idea that “even broken things can catch the light” are well-seeded through the bookmark, the control room, and Kael’s history with his mentor. The thaw operates as a quiet metaphor for a “thawing heart,” and the final choice to embrace cracks instead of perfect answers reweights prior images. Some lines edge toward aphoristic (“Perhaps this fracture is not a failure, but a map,” “Even broken things...can catch the light”), slightly flattening subtext into thesis. Strong resonance, but the thematic insight is delivered a bit directly and rides on relatively low on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of generational betrayal, inherited fear, and rewriting one’s “script” are well-embedded in the seashell, the film-library setting, and Lila’s past as a stunt double. Her reframing of phobias as a “map of her mother’s betrayals” is particularly strong. But the piece undercuts itself by stating its thesis outright—“You think vulnerability is weakness? It’s not. It’s a language. And I’ve learned to speak it.” and “I proved vulnerability is power.”—rather than trusting subtext. This explicit moralizing makes the ending feel more like a lesson than a resonant, ambiguous reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of silence as presence, palimpsest, and an alternate way of mapping reality emerge organically from action and image. The final idea—that she’s “drawn the endless night” by summarizing absence—offers a satisfying conceptual repricing of what a map or oracle can be. Some lines explain the thesis a bit too explicitly (“silence was not empty but layered, a palimpsest of echoes”), blunting subtlety. Nonetheless, the emotional and conceptual aftertaste is coherent and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of consciousness as emergent from time, memory, and emotion, and of the sacredness of the mundane, are organically present in the imagery and premise. However, several lines simply state the thesis—“To amalgamate is to understand,” “In the mundane. In the mysticism of the everyday.”—rather than letting it fully emerge from subtext. The second-chance program and janitor role do good thematic work around redemption and overlooked labor. Overall resonance is real but slightly over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme—truth and communication beyond words—is coherent and integrated via tickets, lens, and humming crystals. Subtext exists in the idea of unfinished conversations and silence as a canvas, but the story repeatedly states its thesis outright (“After words become unnecessary, honesty is the only currency left”; “Words, he realized, were overrated”), which blunts subtlety. The final move to doodling a lens as “a silent invitation” is an effective concrete thematic image. Overall resonance is solid, but the moral is a bit over-articulated for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of resilience, memory, and “beauty in the cracks” are strongly seeded in the marbles and the maze, and the final bloom-from-wounds image has resonance. However, the story repeatedly states its theses—“Luck is just another word for preparation meeting opportunity” and “In the end, it was not the algorithms that defined success…”—in overtly didactic ways. This explicit moralizing blunts subtext and leaves less room for reader inference.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of scientific curiosity, controlled transgression, and the malleability of time are present, especially in the director’s line “Time moves sideways here, Veyra. We just need to prove it.” The “subdued awakenings” of alien flora parallel Veyra’s own awakening curiosity, but that echo is gestured at more than deeply developed. The piece avoids overt moralizing, yet it also sidesteps any deeper ethical or existential implications of bending time and disturbing alien life. As a result the ending is resonant enough to feel complete, but not reweighting prior material in a particularly surprising or complex way.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of liminality, unfinished art, and communication between the living and the dead emerge organically through Clara’s fixation on “in-between spaces” and the ghost’s coded music. Recurring images—water, silence, unstruck chords, submerged instruments—quietly reinforce the idea that art bridges worlds. The final promise aligns with a thematic stance: that listening harder and inhabiting thresholds is a kind of vocation, not just superstition. Some thematic moves are stated a bit on-the-nose (“where ghosts and musicians speak the same language”), which slightly blunts the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of truth as weight, resilience in margins/cracks, and the limits of quantification are richly developed through concrete motifs—the bearberry roots, frayed margins, structural fatigue, auroral sorrow. The final realization that the truth has “anchored her” reweights prior images without feeling like a tacked-on moral. A couple of lines (“The station was a lie. And she… she was the lie’s keeper.”) verge on explicit thesis-statement but are supported enough by scene work to avoid sermonizing. Overall, the thematic weave is coherent, layered, and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around human failure and greed being more terrifying than ghosts, embodied by the “ghost shift” being mechanical and the cover-up that “drowned” the truth. The valve as key to shutting the machine down, and later as a burden Elias chooses to leave behind, nicely ties theme to concrete action. The final thought—“Some truths… were too heavy to carry”—edges toward explicitness but still arises plausibly from what he’s seen rather than feeling like a bolted-on moral. More ambiguity about what he’ll do with this awareness (expose vs. collude with silence) could deepen the resonance further.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—surrendering judgment, the burden of history, and the paradox of seeking change through erasure of self—is integrated through recurring images (crumbling library, origami swan, backward-flowing river). The regenerative silence concept is dramatized rather than merely stated, and the ending reweights the library as a “bridge” instead of a prison. A few thematic sentences (“To witness change without judgment—that was the regenerative silence they craved”) verge on direct statement but don’t tip into moralizing. The ambiguity around whether this loss of reality is enlightenment or self-annihilation gives the piece healthy complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of ordinary magic and sustaining wonder is clear and aligned with every major element—the curl, the eclipse, the music, and Mara’s arc. However, it’s heavily articulated in thesis-like lines (“That’s the magic. It’s not in the curl. It’s in us. In how we choose to see the world.”), which undercuts subtext and ambiguity. The piece tips toward a tidy moral rather than letting the images and choices do more of the work. Emotional aftereffect is pleasant but not deeply complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of listening versus ignoring, the persistence of stories, and the idea that reality shifts with perception are strong and cohesive, especially in Clara’s line “We stopped seeing the dragons because we stopped believing in them” and the reframing of the “displaced axis” as attention. The tapestry, walls, ash, and dragons all work as concrete carriers of these ideas, with the ending chorus reweighting them effectively. That said, some thematic material becomes a bit on-the-nose in diary quotations (e.g., “The axis isn’t physical. It’s the line between hearing and ignoring”), edging toward thesis statement rather than pure subtext. The emotional resonance is real but skewed more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of open secrets, inherited systems of influence, and the ethics of subtle manipulation are woven coherently through fortunes, microdots, and tides without overt moralizing. The father’s warning about floods versus flow gestures toward moral ambiguity, and the final image of a dockworker hurrying home quietly enacts the power of a small nudge. Still, the story stops short of deeply engaging the costs or darker implications of this manipulation; the revolution remains almost entirely positive or neutral in tone. The resonance is solid but could be sharper with more friction between human freedom and orchestration.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—exposing hidden assumptions, stillness as canvas rather than cage, “decorating with silence”—is coherent and tightly woven to events and images. However, it is often delivered as explicit thesis statements (“Hidden assumptions…are the roots of all control”; “Stillness is not emptiness, but a canvas”), edging into sermonizing. The final image does reprice the premise by reconfiguring stillness as “dynamic equilibrium,” but it reads more like articulated philosophy than emergent insight. Subtext and ambiguity are present but somewhat overrun by stated aphorisms.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme around time as loop vs line, art as a way to resurrect or reconfigure the past, and fortunes as maps rather than predictions is coherent and emerges from particulars (the shell, the lake, her work). The mirrored horizon motif reweights nicely at the end, tying childhood, present craft, and customer interaction. Some lines edge toward explicitness or near-platitude (“They’d be her legacy, her love letter to the mirrored horizon”), softening the ambiguity and reducing lingering tension. Still, the emotional aftereffect is clear and earns its quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of multiplicity, choice, and self-acceptance are coherently woven through the tablets, timelines, and the gravity motif, and the final image of walking grounds the abstract idea in a concrete act. However, the piece leans on explicit thematic phrasing (“labyrinth of self,” “not a hero or a villain, but a woman made of choices”) that reduces ambiguity and tips toward mild moralizing. The story invites some reflection on identity and consequence, but it doesn’t quite move beyond familiar “embrace all your selves” wisdom into something more surprising or specific.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of silence as container rather than void, of alternative modalities of “hearing,” and of art as a way through numbness emerge organically from events and recurring images (vibration, hush, broken needle, drums). However, some thematic statements are voiced a bit baldly—“Silence isn’t empty. It’s a container.” and “The broken needle… had been a gift.”—tilting toward explicit moralizing rather than letting images fully carry the insight. The emotional aftereffect is warm and contemplative, grounded more in specific lived textures than in abstraction. Complexity remains modest but present: silence holds both refuge and risk, and feeling again carries pain alongside aliveness.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of integrity, bearing witness, and the dissonance between tranquil surfaces and buried truths emerge organically from Elias’s shift from apolitical recorder to engaged whistleblower. Recurring images of storms, ash-rain, and quiet spaces holding “loud truths” build a clear conceptual spine. Yet lines like “Some truths… were meant to be shared, not preserved” and “He’d always been a recorder of storms. Now, he was something more” verge on thesis statements, slightly dulling subtext. The piece invites reflection but leans a bit too close to moralizing in its final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece has a coherent thematic core about grief, memory, and inherited sorrow, tied effectively to scent and extinction imagery. The idea of perfume as “a vessel for memory, a bridge between past and present” is particularly strong and earned by the vision sequence. However, the story undercuts its own subtlety with explicit moralizing—“grief wasn’t something to be feared; it was a testament to love”—that states the thesis instead of letting it resonate through image and action. The ending leans toward neat uplift rather than a more ambiguous, lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of time as tapestry, impossible choices, and the beauty of imperfection are coherently woven through objects (rope, grotto walls, constellations) and Kael’s history of “maybes.” The final image of the spiral with a single unbroken thread nicely reweights the earlier material. However, the story leans into explicit statement (“The texture of time… is not in the choices you make, but in the patterns they leave”) that edges toward thesis, blunting some subtext. There is resonance, but it’s partially delivered via voiced theme rather than entirely earned through implication.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The themes of grief, silence, and the search for “beauty in the unfinished” emerge organically from the ritual, the bowl’s function, and the final communal act of placing objects inside it. There is a pleasing conceptual shift from silence-as-emptiness to silence-as-potential, which reweights prior material. However, the text leans on explicit thematic declaration—“a tune meant to ‘mend the cracks in the world’” and “The bowl doesn’t hold silence. It holds potential.”—that borders on thesis-stating rather than trusting subtext. The result is moving but a touch didactic, trimming the complexity that might linger longer.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of curated emotion, the ethics of half-truths, and the ambivalence of relief-through-erasure are coherent and grounded in particulars like the warning that sorrow and joy will both be “subsumed.” The idea that half truths are “interpretations” rather than lies is interesting and ties to his goal of fusing insight with empathy. However, some thematic material is stated a bit baldly (“His motivation was not mere profit…”) rather than allowed to emerge purely from scene, and Lira’s experience of the tradeoff is only lightly touched. The ending offers a quiet, resonant restatement rather than a reweighting that significantly deepens the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of “cycles of compassion” is coherent and well-integrated through particulars: the missed chance with Lila, the locket, the invisible crew metaphor, and the final “Profit, Unseen” ledger. However, the story leans into explicit statement—“Compassion, like the sea, demanded patience” and “to uplift one was to uplift all”—which edges into mild sermonizing instead of letting the images fully carry the weight. The final beats with Lila’s postcard and Clara’s changed language to clients do offer a resonant answer to the opening restlessness. Thematic complexity is present but somewhat smoothed into a comforting moral rather than a knotty question.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme around connection, refracted light, and “webs of kinship” is coherent and organically echoed in objects (arbor, murals, liquid light). The final image of a shared ache nicely embodies the idea that connection doesn’t erase pain but redistributes it. However, some thematic material edges toward being stated rather than purely dramatized (“Only someone who believes in webs of kinship would seek them out”), which slightly flattens subtext. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t push into deeper ambiguity or harder questions about the cost of belonging.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of time as a loom, borrowed moments, and echoes arising from pauses in cadence are coherent and recur through the pendant, the giant’s nap, and the canal’s behavior. The conceptual repricing at the end—re-seeing the giant as guardian and the city as built on borrowed time—nicely reweights earlier images. However, some thematic material is delivered quite explicitly via quoted wisdom and the disembodied voice, edging toward statement rather than pure emergence from scene. The resonance is real but could be more subtextual and conflict-rooted to reach a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of ambiguous loss, preservation vs. flow, and emotion as mosaic/fractal are coherently woven through glass eyes, orchard, and stone. However, the story frequently states its theses directly—“Emotion isn’t a straight line,” “The loss wasn’t a void but a fractal,” “The mathematics of emotion… wasn’t about solving equations but about embracing the chaos”—which flattens some potential subtext. The final realization does reweight earlier images (orchard, sap, fractures) in a satisfying way, but leans into essayistic explanation rather than trusting implication. As a result, resonance is solid but not as haunting or ambiguous as the imagery could support.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme centers on visibility/invisibility, custodianship of hidden resources, and messages from the past sustaining the marginalized. The tape and the library’s understructure nicely embody the idea that unseen systems support vulnerable people. However, the text undercuts some subtlety with explicit thematic labeling (“She was no longer invisible. She was a guardian…”), tipping toward told moral rather than purely emergent resonance. The final image of her returning to the crawl space with new self-understanding still leaves a gentle, coherent aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic coherence around transformation vs. control is strong, with storms, retraction, linden leaf, and vines all echoing the same question. However, the theme is often stated outright rather than allowed to fully emerge from subtext (“They’re not trying to survive. They’re trying to transform.”; “transformation wasn’t something to resist. It was something to sustain.”). These lines edge into moralizing and slightly flatten complexity. The emotional aftereffect is warm and reflective, but less haunting than it might be with more restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—how meaning emerges organically rather than being violently extracted, and how the post-war world might be reimagined as a bridge—is coherently woven through the war-torn setting, the brooch as “convergence,” and Marin’s artistic process. However, the note (“Meaning isn’t threshed. It’s grown.”) and the final realization about the world being a “conversation” state the thesis quite directly, reducing subtext and ambiguity. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere, with some resonance in the island-as-bridge image. More reliance on image and implication over aphorism would lift this markedly.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of brightness/darkness as twins and the value of embracing unpredictability arise organically from the cave’s dissonance and the pearl’s effect. However, the pilgrim’s lines (“true power lies in accepting the parts you can’t control,” “brightness and darkness are twins”) state the thesis quite baldly, reducing subtext and nuance. The final hum of unseen forces under the melody offers a strong, concrete thematic image that does some subtle work. Overall the piece is thematically coherent and resonant but leans more on articulated wisdom than on implication.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of history as mosaic, the value of patience over force, and “navigating absences” emerge coherently from the archivist’s method and the exile’s lingering voids. The recurrent reassembly of stories around the valve supports a conceptual argument about fragmented narratives and communal memory. However, the final paragraphs slide into explicit thesis statements (“history wasn’t a line, but a mosaic…”) that flatten complexity and feel like moralizing rather than letting images do the work. There’s limited tension or counter-pressure to complicate the comforting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of transition (habits vs new starts) and truth-telling versus secrecy are coherent and woven through images like the clocktower, train ticket, and “fortress of unspoken truths.” The closing realization that “the mysteries weren’t unraveling; they were waiting” offers a gentle conceptual reweighting. However, the veiled woman’s line—“The fortress isn’t a destination. It’s a choice.”—states the thesis quite directly, reducing subtext. The resonance is pleasant and clear but leans on articulation more than implication.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    The themes of intergenerational connection, resilience in the pursuit of truth, and the tension between reason and wonder emerge organically from the tile-Aelia-Clara constellation and the whales’ “unheard symphony.” The recurring motifs (whale song, stars, patterns on the tile) accrue meaning toward a resonant final image. However, several lines verge on explicit moralizing—“The world was full of mysteries, and maybe, just maybe, some were worth embracing” states the thesis a bit baldly instead of leaving it fully in image. Thematically rich but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of loneliness as self-inflicted prison, the cost of refusal to say goodbye, and the necessity of risking fear to escape existential boredom are well tied to the concrete situation. The mirror image of the hollow, staying-self and the final embrace of the living void give some resonance beyond the literal plot. However, some thematic material is stated rather baldly (“They feed on our loneliness, our refusal to say goodbye”), reducing subtext. The piece lands more in clear, satisfying articulation than in lingering, layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of fairness, systems vs. individuals, and “trust the math” versus belief are intriguing and conceptually coherent. The ink pot as a device to “think like them” offers real thematic potential around empathy, manipulation, and rationality. However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements (“My father’s math proves your system’s broken”; “we find the mathematics of a fair trade”) that read more like taglines than emergent insight. The ending moralizes instead of allowing the particulars of the scene to carry the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of time, memory, and the value of invention emerge organically from Althea’s practice and the interplay of old technology with bonsai and handmade paper. The notion that invented histories can function as “bridges” between times is interesting, but the story leans into explicit statement (“a testament to the power of invention, the beauty of restraint, and the enduring magic of time”) rather than letting images and consequences carry that weight. There’s little complexity or friction—no sense that this vocation might be questioned, limited, or double-edged. The ending resonates gently but feels more like a thesis restatement than a reweighted insight.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of erased histories, memory as bricolage, and the ethics of “remembering” versus “poisoning rats” recur through specific images (label, letters, locket, tide). The idea that other people’s discarded stories become the scaffolding for a stolen self is strong and mostly implicit. The final configuration—that his own life was deliberately buried—reweights earlier fragments effectively. The late move toward a named “conspiracy” and revenge tilts slightly toward genre setup over a fully explored moral or existential reckoning, which blunts some potential complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The interplay of stars, music, and the shell builds a coherent thematic thread about harmony between logic and wonder, and the final shift from explanation to felt experience is conceptually strong. The recurring images (observatory, instruments, hum) reinforce this without feeling arbitrary. However, the explicit moralizing lines (“The universal riddle, she realized, wasn’t meant to be decoded. It was meant to be felt.”) flatten nuance and state the theme instead of fully trusting the images. More subtext and less direct thesis would raise the piece to a higher literary register.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of gentrification as a battle between efficiency and living chaos is coherent and well-integrated via the chip, graffiti, and the contrast between barge and carnival. Lira’s solution—that chaos contains its own order—is dramatized rather than only stated, especially through the transformed mural. Some lines slip into thesis-like declaration (“You can’t privatize that.”), edging toward on-the-nose messaging. The ending’s hope-without-resolution stance offers reasonable resonance but could deepen the moral ambiguity or cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of human care versus cosmic/technological indifference, and of messages outlasting their makers, are woven consistently through the hourglass grain, the drones, and the archivist’s later recognition. The final archivist beat nicely enacts the idea that “some truths outlast the hands that write them” without contradicting the melancholy. However, the story undercuts its own subtext at times with explicit moralizing lines (“Some truths, she thought, didn’t need an audience. They just needed to exist.”), making the thematic work feel slightly over-declared rather than fully earned by implication. Strong resonance, but a bit too on-the-nose for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coheres around alternative forms of “seeing,” listening as perception, and the idea that calm, attentive craft can turn chaos into clarity. The water’s light, the blind artisan, and the drones’ feedback converge into a satisfying conceptual mesh, and the final return to “the work would never end, but neither would the light’s lessons” offers a genuine, if gentle, resonance. Some thematic points are carried in slightly declarative lines (“Listening’s a kind of seeing,” “truths no machine could hide”) that edge toward thesis statements. Overall, the piece invites reflection, but the moral complexity and cost are relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of representation vs reality (“maps are lies”), beginnings vs reasons, and the ethics of seeking knowledge over possessing it are well woven through maps, rivers, convergence, and the falcon. The final image—Clara drawing on a blank page, chasing truths rather than pinning them—reweights earlier material in a resonant, non-tidy way. Some thematic lines lean toward explicit statement, especially the “maps are lies”/“what’s the point?” exchange, which edges into thesis articulation rather than pure subtext. Still, the symbolic system (light, condensation, phrasebook, convergence) mostly earns its weight through scene rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thematic throughline—restoration via listening, patience, and shared rhythm instead of force—is coherent and emerges organically from the tuning fork and the town’s transformation. The shift from “machine” to “chorus” is a strong image that reweights the premise. Yet the final sentences lean toward explicit thesis (“Balance, once restored, demands nothing less”), edging into mild moralizing rather than fully trusting the images. The resonance is real but a bit over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, control, and the ethics of preservation versus release are well-embedded in the vial, the hush, and the priests’ failed strategy. The final shift—Mara “harnesses” the ephemeral by letting it go—offers a resonant reweighting of the premise. However, the closing moralizing sentence (“some things are meant to be unsnarled, not held”) states the thesis outright and slightly flattens the subtext. The piece still invites reflection, but it leans into clarity over layered ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of inherited lies, confession, authorship, and the power to “write” one’s own narrative are well-woven through the lattice, labyrinth, and ghostly father. The hush/body motif suggests that truth and consequence lag behind action, and the final repricing—before they find the bodies, he finds himself—lands as a satisfying conceptual turn. Some moments skirt explicit thesis (“You can’t outrun the story.” / “I’m not running. I’m writing.”), but they are still dramatized enough to avoid sermonizing. The thematic complexity is solid, if not searing: ambiguity exists but feels curated rather than deeply unsettling.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of debt across lifetimes, the coexistence of love and venom, and awakening as both ending and beginning emerge organically from the ghost’s history and the orchard’s transformation. Recurring images (bead, fruit, endless night/dawn) nicely reweight themselves in the final scene. However, the closing paragraph explicitly states the story’s takeaways (“some debts transcended time… awakening… was both a beginning and an end”), tipping into mild moralizing and reducing subtext. A lighter, image-led ending would let the resonance linger more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of repair, devotion, and transforming “broken precedents” into renewed reverence are woven consistently through objects, setting, and Lira’s craft. The final image of tide pools refilling and empty plates effectively reframes loss as remaking. Some lines verge on direct thesis (“not as a monument to what was lost, but as a promise of what could be remade”), edging toward mild moralizing rather than letting the imagery fully carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story weaves a coherent theme of faith as a chosen, communal practice rather than an unquestioned inheritance, tied to diaspora, memory, and ritual space. The final beat (“not finished… but it’s enough” and her decision to follow the “thread”) offers a resonant, non-didactic answer about imperfect restoration and ongoing labor. Bones, roots, and solstice/shrine imagery recur in a way that deepens this rather than feeling token. The main limit is that the insight, while honest and grounded, is relatively straightforward and low on ambiguity or counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, resistance, and how to reinvent the past are strongly woven through concrete motifs: surface mail vs. cloud, chalk as code, the arcade as archive, and the generational link between Lira and her grandmother. The final task—“Teach the children to code in chalk”—nicely reframes nostalgia as a living, forward-facing practice. That said, the line “Futuristic nostalgia wasn’t about clinging to the past—it was about reinventing it” states the thesis a bit too directly, veering into mild moralizing rather than trusting the images. The piece still leaves a resonant conceptual aftertaste, but with less subtlety than top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of truth’s nonlinearity, hidden messages in “decoration,” and wisdom masked as foolishness are well woven through image systems (stitching, knots, seams, static of the cosmos). The recurring idea that “the truth is never a straight line” culminates nicely in the galaxy literally unraveling into one under the flame, a concrete thematic gesture. At times the text edges toward saying the thesis outright rather than fully trusting subtext (“every decoration hides a message”), which slightly blunts subtlety. Still, the final image of revelation in silence offers genuine resonance rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece thoughtfully explores how unspoken words and regret can be reconfigured into reminders that support ongoing life rather than paralysis, with motifs like the shard smoothing and the unsent letters reprised effectively. However, the thematic articulation edges into explicitness, especially with the spirits’ final message, “Go. Live. Speak,” which borders on a stated moral. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but somewhat cushioned, avoiding messier ambiguity about what she cannot fix. Strong, but not yet at the most subtle or layered level.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of repair, translation as alchemy, and grafting new meaning onto wounded ecosystems and psyches are tightly woven through coral, reef, aquarium, and the child’s cast. The final gestures—the coral at the table, the rephrased messages, the cast as a “flag of fragile hope”—provide a clear thematic throughline. However, key lines make the thesis overt (“turning shared anxieties into shared hope,” “The war ends when we choose to listen”), tipping into didacticism and reducing subtextual richness. The piece invites reflection but does not fully resist tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, art as developer, and the resurrection of joy from decay are well seeded and coherently developed through the fresco, fog, and carnival past. The exposed film metaphor, while somewhat explicit, is well integrated with Lira’s practice and the district’s history. The ending reweights the premise—moving from requiem to resurrection and framing the district as “found”—in a resonant way. Some lines (“She’d painted with hope, and the two were inseparable”) tilt toward overt statement rather than leaving the insight fully in the images.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of curiosity vs certainty, nested awakenings, and art/science as ways of listening rather than looking are well seeded and coherently developed through the coin, mural, and garden. The final reframing—that awakening is “a rhythm” and the garden “a state of mind”—does reweight prior events and offers a resonant conceptual answer. However, the theme is undercut by explicit thesis lines (“Curiosity begets curiosity. Certainty is a cage.”) and overt meta-framing from Dr. Lysander, which feel a bit like annotated morals rather than fully earned subtext. Slightly more restraint and reliance on image over statement would elevate this considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of surveillance, resistance, and encoding truth in living systems are coherent and organically tied to the plot and images (Fibonacci plantings, luminescent “RESIST,” “after thoughts become taxable”). However, the thematic statement is sometimes voiced a bit too directly, edging toward thesis (“we plant our truths where they can’t be erased”). Subtext does exist—in the way science and rebellion intertwine—but the piece stops short of deeper moral complication or ambiguity. The final image resonates conceptually but doesn’t reweight earlier material with a surprising emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of pain coexisting with beauty, art as bridge vs shield, and armistice rather than erasure are woven effectively through objects and images (postcard, moss bloom, tree, wind-carried songs). The final state—poems as offerings rather than weapons, and insomnia yielding to a “blossom armistice”—reweights her entire centuries-long project. Subtext is generally earned through the particulars of the world, though the line explicitly defining the blossom armistice as “a beginning” flirts with spelling out the thesis. Overall, the emotional aftereffect is tender and lingering rather than didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story’s thematic core—preservation as evolution rather than stasis, and memory as an active collaboration with the past—emerges organically from the repair attempt and the re-tuned chime. Recurring images (light refracted, cracked bamboo, extinct feelings as mist) acquire new meaning in the ending where the crack becomes a conduit and a nameless new emotion rises. Some lines tilt toward explicit statement (“You’ve preserved the act of remembering,” “The deserted marvels of the past were not lost, she realized”), slightly softening the subtlety. Nonetheless, the final images and Lirael’s shifted stance leave a resonant, non-didactic aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of language as trust, silence as a form of speech, and promises as connective tissue are coherent and well-motivated by the events and objects (letters, vows, archive). However, the story often states its themes explicitly—“Context is a promise,” “It’s about… promises. And trust.”—rather than letting them fully emerge through subtext and image, edging toward gentle sermonizing. The repetition of “before paths diverge” and the sister manuscript about rebuilding trust provides a satisfying echo with some resonance. More restraint and reliance on implication rather than direct thematic labeling would lift this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of trust, fear, and the attempt to harmonize safety with vulnerability run coherently through the chain, the adhesive, and the breathing volcano. “Encrypted compassion” is a strong conceptual spine, and the final message neatly echoes the floodgate dilemma in emotional terms. At times the piece edges toward on-the-nose phrasing (“turning encrypted fear into open-hearted truth”), softening ambiguity and subtlety. Still, the story leaves a satisfying emotional aftertaste grounded in its particulars rather than in abstract sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of legacy, falsified histories, and the fragility of “paper trails” are well woven through specific objects (journals, ledgers, cassette, chip) and repeated images (dust, echoes, songs). The notion of “preserve the echo” is recontextualized from mysterious instruction to a broader meditation on what survives—stone, song, dust patterns, family myth. The final move—Elias choosing to act “not as a courier, but as a son”—offers a clear thematic answer about accepting a complicated inheritance rather than hiding behind reinvention. At times the language edges close to overt thesis (“paper trails… were fragile things”), but it stays just on the right side of earned reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—about thresholds, distance, choice, and the re-writing of inherited codes—emerges coherently from the events and imagery, especially the move from her father’s weather codes to her own (“Distance is a kind of prayer”). The prism/maze/grain motifs support the idea that sacred spaces are gaps and choices, not fixed locations. However, several lines verge on aphoristic exposition (“Sacred spaces are not places but gaps”; “Some thresholds…remind us how far we’ve come”), telling the thematic thesis rather than letting it fully arise from implication. The result is resonant but a bit over-explained for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of belonging, place-rhythm, light-in-forgotten-places, and sea/sky permeability emerge naturally from setting and action. However, the story leans on explicit statement—“belonging was not about fitting into a preconceived mold…” and “That…was a rhythm worth dancing to”—which drifts toward moralizing rather than leaving the insight fully in image and implication. The feather and luminous respite build a strong thematic pattern, but the ending trims away some ambiguity and complexity. Emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere, if somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and the pain/mercy of forgetting are coherent and organically tied to the imagery of paths, shards, and seeds. The shift from “forgotten” to “released” offers a thoughtful reframing that could linger. Yet the story frequently states its thematic conclusions directly (“Because some paths are meant to be forgotten,” “Holding onto them hurts too much,” “because they were released”), edging toward authorial paraphrase of what the images already convey. This explicitness blunts subtext and keeps the piece from fully earning a deeper, more oblique resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of order vs. randomness, art disrupting monotony, and agency within chaos are coherently woven through images of the arcade, the clown, the bishop, and the guided crowd. However, some thematic material is stated too directly—“Randomness needs a conductor” and “She’d orchestrated serendipity by ordering randomness” border on thesis statements instead of staying subtextual. The final image of her commitment to "always" playing between acts offers a quiet, resonant answer about ongoing, small-scale intervention in chaos. It’s strong, but would benefit from trusting implication more.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between yearning for the cosmic “Before” and the enforced present of the nostalgia ban, refracted through fledge vs. anchor and elective exile. Images like obsidian grace, fading constellations, and the verse that will itself fade by dawn build a coherent meditation on transience, memory, and self-chosen liminality. The ending avoids moralizing, instead offering a charged poise: she accepts a life in-between, neither overthrowing the ban nor surrendering her need. The main ceiling is that the Council/ban remains abstract, so social or relational stakes of that thematic conflict stay largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of finding value in the mundane and seeing “clear complexity” emerge naturally from the glasswork, light, and ritual. However, the story often states its thesis directly (“The value in the mundane was not in its ordinariness, but in its potential to transform”), tipping into didacticism. The final notebook line underlines rather than reconfigures prior images, reducing room for subtext or ambiguity. The thematic arc is coherent but too plainly articulated for high-end literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of time, transformation, and listening—to land, to pain, to inherited wisdom—emerge clearly through the hourglass, the forest’s regrowth, and his mother’s note. The final images (moving sand, forest’s sigh, his belonging to the celestial rhythm) reweight earlier details effectively. However, some thematic phrasing leans toward explicit statement and near-moralizing (“His pain, too, could be a kind of fertilizer”; “not as a man haunted, but as one enlightened”), reducing ambiguity and subtext. The piece invites reflection but could trust implication more and declarative insight less.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of intentional design, hope as a constructed/experimental process, and bridging fractured realities arise naturally from Elara’s methods and the grotto’s responsiveness. The idea that “equations for hope weren’t abstract; they were tactile, woven from light and intention” is a bit on-the-nose but still grounded in specific actions. The ending image of her listening to the grotto after recognizing it as a crossroads offers a resonant, non-literal answer: hope as attentive, iterative engagement with unstable realities. A slightly sharper sense of cost or ambiguity (how far can this hope go, what might it fail to fix?) would deepen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Legacy, memory, and the reciprocity between human record-keeping and “living” architecture are woven consistently through diaries, cartographers, and the film negative. The line “The legacy’s burden is not in the keeping, but in the sharing” skates close to thematic on-the-nose but is anchored as a found diary sentence, so it still feels organic. The final “You are the map” reweights the entire narrative, tying climate grief, familial inheritance, and embodied memory into a coherent thematic answer. Complexity is present, though the resolution leans a bit neat rather than leaving a more jagged ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of grief, persistence, and art as a way to create alternate possibilities rather than resurrect the dead are well-embedded in images—the borrowed heartbeat, refracted light, resistant mirrors. The ending’s conceptual move (“somewhere… possibilities… taking root”) reweights prior details without stating a moral, and the sister’s image in the meadow carries real, if quiet, resonance. The piece avoids sermonizing, but it also avoids deeper complicating angles (ethical cost of borrowed heartbeat, darker doubts), keeping the thematic field somewhat safe. Still, the emotional aftereffect is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    The themes of the price of redemption, imperfect peace, and the “flawed beauty” of compromise are strong and coherent, reinforced by motifs like the weathered gods, scarred clipboard, and celestial cycles. However, the story leans heavily on explicit thematic articulation (“The price of redemption, she mused…,” “acceptance of flawed beauty in compromise”) rather than letting subtext emerge purely from dramatized conflict. The final image of Elara continuing on with the clipboard to “the next battlefield of words” does offer a resonant, non-literal answer: peace is a continuous, costly process. The lack of a sharply dramatized moral trade-off on the page keeps this from fully transcendent territory.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of man-made catastrophe, performative philanthropy, and the longing for a skewed form of grace are woven effectively through recurring images (egg, map, water, recordings). The ending’s idea that “echo” is all that survives is thematically potent and reconfigures his earlier actions. Some lines edge toward on-the-nose thesis (“meaning was what you manufactured when nature failed you,” “What mattered was the act of release”), slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, complexity is maintained: he is not redeemed, but his craving for grace is neither excused nor flattened.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of resisting conformist silencing is coherent and supported by recurring images of threads, echoes, and lullabies, culminating in the “symphony of resistance” she carries out. Some lines tip into explicit thesis (“her dance a middle finger to the world’s expectations”), which flattens subtext that the imagery could have carried alone. Still, the echoes-as-fragments and snowflakes-as-testaments create a resonant metaphor for collective, partial defiance, giving the ending a reflective aftertaste. The complexity is moderate rather than deep, but it avoids outright moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of truth, half-truths, and the ethics of narrative are woven consistently through motifs of shadows, mirrors, crowns, and campfires, and the king/pauper reversal concretizes those ideas. However, the story leans heavily on explicit thesis statements (“Stories are thieves,” “Half-truths are the only kind worth telling,” “Ethical storytelling isn’t about hiding the dark…”) that do some of the work subtext could have carried. The closing campfire image is resonant but again explicitly labeled as “ethical story,” edging into essayistic moralization. The piece invites reflection but could trust its images more and its aphorisms less.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—reverence for transient, unnoticed existences versus grand narratives—is coherently developed through the moth/monarch contrast, spider-silk lattices, and the idea of “temporary structures as signals.” The final beats clearly reweight earlier images: the moth wing becomes a “key,” and her work a prayer, tying purpose to humble, ephemeral acts. However, the closing paragraphs lean into explicit statement (“She had honored…”, “she had found her purpose: to bear witness, to remember, to honor”) rather than letting the images fully carry the resonance, flirting with mild sermonizing. The piece still elicits a gentle emotional aftereffect, but with less ambiguity and complexity than the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from objects and action: memory as braid/light, erasure by plague and bureaucracy, and the transformation of destructive fire (workshop blaze) into preservative light. The Mother/Names/Rope/Card constellation offers a coherent meditation on how the forgotten can be partially re-embodied without simple consolation. The final image of the names burning brighter as a song “that refused to die” is resonant without outright moralizing. The piece leans toward a tidy redemptive note; more tension about the limits or dangers of reanimation could deepen its complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of decay vs renewal, integration vs escape, and destiny as co-created rather than imposed are coherent and consistently threaded through bunker/forest imagery, the directive, and Mara’s arc. Recurring motifs (paths choosing walkers, the directive as seed, decay as prelude to growth) are effective and reweighted at the end. However, several lines state the theme quite explicitly (“to transcend was not to escape, but to integrate”; “paths choose walkers who dare to redefine the journey”), edging into thesis-like declaration. This slight moralizing flattens some of the potential subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of curiosity versus security, faith in numbers versus metaphysics, and the recasting of “the unknown” as reciprocal rather than hostile are coherent and well integrated with the imagery of tiles and constellations. The final realization—that the covenant is essentially with herself, via a lens that refracts intention—is thematically apt. Some lines drift toward explicit thesis statements (“The covenant isn’t sealed with gold or blood,” “The unknown wasn’t a void to fear—it was a dialogue”), which slightly undercut subtext in favor of overt articulation. The resonance is there, but a bit more reliance on image and less on spelled-out insight would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of releasing resentment and the idea that brokenness can become a strength are coherent and well-linked to the pin. However, they are often delivered in overt thesis statements (“true peace came not from avoidance, but from understanding the roots of conflict”; “Grace isn’t perfect. It’s messy, like life.”) rather than left to emerge from implication. Subtext exists in the image of the scarred, reforming pin, but dialogue frequently explains what the symbol already shows. The ending offers a resonant image (Kael with the pin) but the preceding moralizing keeps the piece at the edge of sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of boundaries (seen/unseen, real/dream), navigation vs erasure, and the moral stance toward fugitive dreams are well seeded through the sextant, mirrors, and fog motifs. The final realization—that boundaries are to be navigated, not erased—and Elias beginning a mirror “for the space between breaths” provide a resonant conceptual answer without overt moralizing. That said, the piece stops short of a more complex emotional or ethical tension (e.g., why this dream matters, what its capture costs others), so the thematic field remains elegant but somewhat cool and abstract. The resonance is real but not yet searing.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of generational wisdom, persistence, and finding strength in “forgotten” things are coherent and organically tied to objects like the ribbon, wire, and quartz eye. However, the story leans into explicit statements of its thesis (“wisdom wasn’t found in grand contracts…”), approaching moralizing in the final third. Subtext and ambiguity are relatively light; the piece tells the reader what its wisdom is instead of fully trusting image and action. The closing resonance is pleasant but somewhat tidy and programmatic.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of legacy-by-choice, perception shaping inheritance, and the tension between curation and lived experience are woven through the pistachio shells, orchard, and library of lives. The nonlinear inheritance idea is conceptually strong and reweighted at the end when she chooses to fuse the cameo and accept a legacy outside institutional approval. That said, the text sometimes tips into explicit thesis statements (“You inherit what you choose to see,” “Some truths were meant to be lived, not exhibited”), which flattens subtext into commentary. More reliance on image-driven implication and less direct aphorism would deepen the lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story thematically explores knowledge, erasure, and the necessity of embracing ignorance; the mirrored gaps in the diary and in Elara’s understanding are a strong concrete expression of this. The motif of “unlearned lessons” and the requirement to admit what she does not know give the final lines some conceptual resonance. However, several statements tilt toward explicit thesis (“The Door... opens only to those who acknowledge their ignorance”; “it was her willingness to embrace the unknown that would keep her alive”), edging into on-the-nose moralization. The theme is coherent and earned but could trust subtext more to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of memory, erasure, naming, and reclaiming stolen narratives are strong and are reinforced through concrete images: stitching pages into walls, a garden of names, and the act of sewing their joint name into the soil. The seamstress’s story and the ship’s decay elegantly mirror Lira and Veyra’s own search for self-definition. However, the line “The garden isn’t a place—it’s a choice. To remember what we’ve lost.” edges into thesis statement, flattening some subtext. The ending resonates, but with a hint of didactic neatness rather than ambivalence or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of absence, preservation, and the transformation of chaos into ordered knowledge are well-integrated through the fables, the seal, the rope, and Elara’s profession. The idea that “fables of absence” are actually operational instructions for safeguarding knowledge at the edges of reality is an elegant conceptual turn. Some thematic articulation is a bit on-the-nose (“She wasn’t just an archivist; she was a weaver of timelines, a translator of chaos”), leaning toward thesis-statement rather than letting the images fully carry it. Still, the final redefinition of her role offers a resonant, if not deeply unsettling, afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of balance, the value of silence, and transforming rather than annihilating disruptive forces are clearly woven through the caves’ logic and the beings’ final state (“wind through leaves, rain on stone”). The closing idea that she has “found the quiet within it” effectively reframes noise as something to be integrated, not erased. Some thematic lines verge on explicit statement, but they still grow organically from the particulars of sound, ice, and ritual. The resonance is genuine, though not especially surprising or layered beyond the central metaphor of hush vs. hum.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of hope after collapse, meaning in coincidence, and memory as a technology are strong and organically linked to the prism and retrocognition. The recurrent images of shards, constellations, and song build a coherent pattern that reweights the ending. However, the text leans into explicit thesis statements (“to prove that coincidences have meaning,” “they are the universe’s way of whispering, *Keep going*”), which edges toward moralizing and slightly blunts subtext. The final paragraphs still resonate, but they spell out the insight rather than trusting the images to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—memory as a living field one participates in rather than hoards—is coherently developed through fog, crystal vibrations, and the archivist vocation. The ending’s insight about identity being shaped “like wind carving stone” arises credibly from what she has just witnessed. However, some thematic lines verge on didactic summary (“To sculpt identity from experience wasn’t about holding onto the past”) instead of trusting image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Fire as resilience and “shadows” as unlit potential make for a coherent, appealing thematic spine that the story returns to through the knot, the lilies, and the starless sky image. The conceptual repricing at the end—her realization about shadows and her mentor’s intent—does reweight what came before. However, some lines tilt toward aphorism (“Hopelessness is a gravity, but fire spins upward”; “shadows weren’t darkness, but the unlit potential within everything”), edging into stated thesis rather than fully emergent theme. The emotional aftertaste is genuine but a bit too neatly articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of liminality, metamorphosis, and the value of pauses are coherently woven through tides, cicada, and Elara’s vocation; the ending reweights those motifs so the pause feels charged rather than empty. However, some thematic articulation edges into explicit thesis—“Some transitions aren’t meant to be rushed”—which flattens potential ambiguity. The piece invites reflection, but its moral feels relatively tidy and comfortingly framed. Strong integration of motif, but not yet complex or surprising enough for higher literary tiers.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of loss becoming generative, constraint as a condition for growth, and silence as a nutritive, complex presence are woven through the doll, the trellis, and the sprout. The final revaluation—silences as “seeds” that grow inside her—has genuine resonance and reweights earlier images. However, some thematic language is too on-the-nose (“by limiting her exposure… she could sprout new ways of being”), tipping into thesis statement rather than pure emergence from scene. The ambiguity around whether the sprout is literal or symbolic is pleasantly suggestive, not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The thematic throughline about silence as presence rather than absence is coherent and integrated with motif (storm glass, whistle, canals). The pivot—realizing silence doesn’t need to be taught so much as noticed—offers a gentle conceptual repricing of the premise. However, the last paragraphs slip into near-thesis statements (“not to silence the world, but to show it how to rest”), edging toward moralizing rather than letting images and subtext carry the weight. The resonance is pleasant but somewhat didactic and risk-averse.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of legacy, self-recognition, and the non-fearful future are coherent and well-seeded via the throne, crown shard, and Lira’s role as lore keeper. The final realization—that the journey is about seeing oneself in the lineage—is conceptually strong. That said, the story undercuts some of its resonance by stating its meanings outright (“The stairway of ascension had been a metaphor,” “The future wasn’t a place to fear—it was a story to write”), drifting into didactic summary rather than trusting images. More implication and less explicit moralizing would lift this significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of isolation, connection through shared wounds, and the necessity of rebuilding some burned bridges arise organically from Elara’s choices and the “linking through scars” motif. The doorknocker and threshold recur as concrete carriers of those ideas, especially in the final image of a chance to breathe in the loaded emptiness. A few lines edge toward overt thesis (“some bridges were meant to be rebuilt,” “I need to teach suffocating to breathe”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the story leaves room for reflection on cost and necessity rather than dictating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of pressure, resilience, and reinterpreting exploitation (pyramid schemes, “financial freedom” cults) into genuine agency are coherent and organically embedded in the premise. The story’s final understanding—that diamonds are metaphorical, and the true transformation is Mara’s relationship to pressure—is apt and resonant. However, several lines (“Pressure translated. Diamonds are a metaphor.” / “I took the pressure off.”) state the thematic move a bit too baldly, undercutting subtext. The aftertaste is thoughtful but a touch tidy and didactic rather than fully open-ended.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of legacy, the ethics of power, and silence as an act of love emerge organically from the juxtaposition of the dynasty’s whispered rule, the erased history, and Lirael’s new commitment to transparency. The gramophone and standing waves nicely embody “sound as memory made flesh,” linking form and idea. That said, the thematic statements grow explicit and somewhat moralizing in the last third (“The dynasty’s end was not a tragedy but a rebirth,” “Her family’s silence had been eloquent, a final act of love”), which flattens ambiguity. Subtext is present but partially overridden by direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme around control vs. possibility, patterns vs. freedom, and art/theater as world-shaping emerges coherently from recurring motifs (strings, patterns, preserved moments, changing program text). The final realization that “The shape of possibility was not a thing to be captured” effectively reprices earlier aims. Some lines edge toward articulated thesis (“The strings were never meant to hold you”) rather than purely emergent resonance. The piece still invites reflection beyond itself, but trims close to aphorism at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of erasure, institutional neglect, and the dignity of “unknown histories” are woven concretely through objects (the button, the dusty folders) and Elias’s choices rather than through overt philosophizing. The final act of creating a file titled “Unknown Histories: The Button” offers a clear, non-didactic answer: small acts of archival care can be a moral stance against historical erasure. There is some neatness—the labeling gesture risks feeling a touch on-the-nose—but the story mostly resists moralizing and lets images carry weight. The piece leaves a lingering sense of quiet, ethical resolve rather than a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory versus erasure, inherited resistance, and indifference as a moral danger arise organically from the revised histories and the father’s salvaged key. The final image of the key and the altered color of the lagoon offers a modest conceptual repricing of “holding the line” against forgetting. However, lines like “Indifference kills faster than bullets. We hold the line.” edge into slogan, stating the thesis rather than letting subtext carry it. The piece invites some reflection but stops short of real moral or emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of silence as power, negative space as action, and the ethics of suppressing dangerous truths emerge organically from his method and the grotto’s function. The final sense that “some truths were meant to stay hidden, at least for now” is thematically apt but edges toward explicit moralizing rather than letting the images do all the work. Recurring motifs (mist, dewdrops, prism light, negative space) support a meditation on liminality and deferred revelation. The piece invites some reflection but could lean more on implication and less on paraphrasing the takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of folklore as living language, bridges between seen/unseen, and memory preserved in humble acts (seed sorting, monuments) are well woven into concrete images. The moonstone dust fulfilling its folkloric promise and the arbor “listening” at the end offer a resonant answer: belief opens access to meaning and responsibility. That said, lines like “She had always known the folklore was more than tales; it was a language, waiting to be decoded” tilt toward explicit thesis, and the moral terrain feels relatively tidy. The piece lingers pleasantly but not hauntingly after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—befriending uncertainty versus controlling time—is coherent and nicely embodied in recurring motifs (broken clocks, ash, swirling leaves, the spinning needle). Yet the story undercuts itself with explicit thesis statements like “Uncertainly certain, he realized, wasn’t a contradiction—it was a compass of its own” and “To befriend uncertainty in planning… is to let the leaves swirl,” which edge into moralizing. The emotional aftereffect is pleasant and thoughtful but a bit pre-chewed. A more image-driven, less declarative ending would let the thematic resonance breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of names as anchors, balance between logic and magic, and kintsugi-style acceptance of cracks recur coherently via coin, foundry, and family memories. The final exchange about questions without answers offers a recognizable, if not surprising, thematic stance. Several lines state theme directly (“Names have weight”; “By exploring your limits…”) in prompt-like language, which flattens subtext into thesis. The piece still generates a gentle afterglow of grief and partial acceptance, but it edges toward didactic rather than letting images carry more of the load.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of truth-as-pain, resilience, and the necessity of joy within grief are woven through images of the crocodile’s tooth, misaligned music, and echoes. However, several lines lapse into explicit moralizing (“Healing, she realized, was not a destination—it was a pursuit”) that flatten what the imagery has already earned. The final notion of “luminous ache of hope” resonates but is also directly named, reducing subtext. Overall, the piece is thematically coherent but not as oblique or layered as elite venues typically demand.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—mercy versus “purification,” endurance versus reprogramming—is woven through recurring images (UV, strap, spores, mathematics) and his evolving interpretation of them. The reframing of “mathematics of mercy” from a literal formula into a way to endure is a solid thematic turn. However, some lines verge on explicit thesis (“Mercy isn’t a equation. It’s a choice.”), flattening subtext into statement. The ending leaves a resonant question rather than a moral, but the piece occasionally tells its ideas instead of fully trusting the images.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of honoring overlooked histories, intuition as a bridge between worlds, and translation as pattern-recognition emerge organically from the concrete work of reading runes and murals. The lighthouse and fragment recur as motifs that subtly reweight meaning by the end. However, the closing paragraphs lean into explicit moralizing (“Anchors of intuition aren’t just for holding on…”, “the lesson lingered: to honor the overlooked…”) rather than fully trusting image and implication. That explicitness slightly blunts what is otherwise thoughtfully embedded thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of unspoken grief, trapped histories, and the need to be witnessed are coherent and supported by the ghosts, the hidden papers, and the repeated “cracks in the façade” motif. However, the text sometimes states its ideas too directly (“The cracks in the façade weren’t just physical—they were emotional, historical”), undercutting subtext. The final realization that he will “repair the stories” is emotionally honest but borders on tidy sentimental closure. There is resonance, but limited complexity or counter-pressure to deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of order vs. wildness, memory and identity, and the cost of genuine awakening are woven coherently through the press, frost, whisper, and spirals. Recurring images do gain meaning by the end (frost patterns shifting from vulnerabilities map to rebuilding blueprint), and the patrons’ transition from “seekers” to “architects” aligns neatly with the conceptual arc. Yet the line “The rupture was not destruction but transformation” foregrounds thesis a bit too explicitly, undercutting subtext in a key spot. The piece invites thought but could lean more on image-driven implication and less on overt labeling of its own meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and the politics of narrative emerge organically from the Luminari’s history-hoarding, fungal archives, and the mirror metaphor. Recurring images (mirrors vs. buried fungi, spires vs. roots, time as visible haze) reweight themselves by the end, especially in the closing assertion that civilizations depend on “the courage to see what mirrors hide.” The revolution-as-fungus metaphor nicely complicates neat heroic narratives, suggesting slow, parasitic, and collective change. A few lines edge toward explicit moralizing, but overall the piece maintains resonance without collapsing into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic through-line—decay as preservation, truth as the true “repair,” and midnight as the seduction of concealment—is coherent and grounded in recurring images (rust, cracks, stone, lullaby). The philosopher’s stone as a mirror for moral state is a strong metaphor that ties character, plot, and theme together. That said, the story repeatedly states its thesis in near-aphoristic lines (“The box wasn’t broken. It was distracted.” “Midnight steals light by convincing us to hide our shadows.”), edging into didacticism. More trust in implication and subtext would elevate it for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of environmental memory, industrial erasure, and epistemic humility are well-integrated, especially via jars as “memory of land” and the untouched lagoon versus the shuttered factory. The idea of seeking “the place where explanations fail” resonates with the ending’s acceptance of unanswered questions. However, a few lines (“not answers, but the absence of them”) border on spelled-out thesis rather than leaving more work to subtext. Overall, the story invites reflection and lingers, but could trust implication a bit more.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of turning chaos into legible pattern, art as scaffolding, and intergenerational “timewoven alliances” are coherent and resonate with the objects and images. The sculptures becoming maps and mechanisms is a nice concrete expression of the theme. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit statements (“Her motivation was simple: to scaffold complexity with simplicity,” “The island’s complexity wasn’t a burden; it was a tapestry”), which borders on thesis exposition rather than letting theme fully emerge from action. The final realization is conceptually sound but a touch tidy and didactic for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematically, the piece weaves light/dark, revelation/secrecy, and communion vs defiance into a coherent argument via nocturnal flowers, stained glass, and Mara’s murals. The “map to the hush” and the window’s shifting appearance across the day embody the idea that some truths require darkness and liminality. The explicit articulation—“Flowers bloom at night not in defiance, but in communion”—edges toward thesis statement but arises credibly from accumulated experience. The final image of an unbroken final layer promises further reckoning and prevents the theme from closing into a pat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—memory vs erasure, who controls history, and the cost of safeguarding truth—is clearly woven through the diary, the lagoon, and Elara’s fate. The line “History’s written by the victors” and Elara’s warning about descendants erasing the past tilt close to explicit thesis-stating rather than letting scene work and image fully carry the load. The ending’s notion of buying time and leaving the truth dispersed “out there” offers a resonant if familiar answer. With a touch less direct exposition about regimes and more reliance on implication, the thematic resonance could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—memory and will as the true engines of revival rather than spells or brute resurrection—is well integrated through the working-memory method, the ghosts of the forgotten, and the bottle’s role as lens. The town’s “reimagining” rather than literal resurrection is a strong conceptual repricing of what revival means. Occasional declarative lines (“His method would be through working memory—the alchemy of recall”) edge toward essayistic, but they are still grounded in concrete action. The final image of the unopened bottle as testament is resonant, though the piece slightly over-explains its insight instead of letting image alone carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory, emotional residue, and the tension between roots and leaves (past and surface, archive and eruption) are woven naturally through images and Voss’s vocation, not just stated. The repeated maxim “The roots remember…” and its evolution into “and the leaves will scream” reweight earlier details effectively. The line “The accidental prophecy was not about disaster, but awakening” edges toward explicitness but doesn’t wholly collapse into moralizing. The final poised readiness “not to stop the storm, but to listen” gives a resonant, open-ended thematic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of preservation vs. decay, borrowed time, and generational stewardship arise organically from the seed-saving lineage, entropy ritual, and final image of the sapling. The vortex journey’s textural details (“gritty, like sand…smooth, like water over stone”) nicely literalize the abstract “texture of borrowed time.” Some thematic moves are a bit on-the-nose (“The vortex inheritance was a dance of decay and rebirth”), edging toward explanation over implication. Still, the ending reweights prior images without a stated moral, leaving a resonant sense of cyclical cost and renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of listening vs noise, harmony with larger systems, and the evolution from technician to artist emerge organically from the bell-work and the solstice hush. The image of the sanctuary as “conductor” and Lira as “maestro” offers a satisfying conceptual reframing of her role. That said, Veyra’s lines—“You’re favoring listening over noise” and “The sanctuary isn’t just a shelter—it’s a conductor”—state the thematic thesis fairly on-the-nose. The ending is resonant but a bit too neat to fully embrace complexity or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of vulnerability, letting go, and the value of “flourishing stillness” emerge clearly from Zara’s choices and the star’s death, with the lantern and stardust giving a strong concrete anchor. The contrast between scientific measurement and listening to silence is effective thematic groundwork. That said, the story often states its ideas directly (“The flourishing stillness she sought was not in the absence of motion but in the acceptance of it”), crossing into mild didacticism instead of trusting images. The resonance is genuine but somewhat over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of unspoken words, memory, and the covenant between living and dead are coherent and well-woven through the bees, ghosts, and stained glass box. The final shattering and dispersal of shards offers a resonant image of release and diffusion of once-contained burdens. However, the explicit command “Speak” and the explanatory passage (“The unspoken words were not lost…”) nudge toward didactic clarity rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. Ambiguity around what is gained and lost by releasing these words could be deepened to avoid a slightly tidy moral arc.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of time, entropy, memory, and how objects hold layered moments emerge organically from the capsule mechanics and Elias’s relationship to the urn fragment. The architect’s “decay of moments,” the garage-sale cataloging idea, and the final mosaic-of-moments realization all harmonize without feeling like pure thesis. “He understood now” edges toward explicit statement but is anchored in specific, dramatized experience (mercury sphere, glimpse of his wife). The ending lingers conceptually and emotionally, though it leans slightly more toward clarity than haunting ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—beauty in incompleteness and transience, and creation as an act of tending fractured things—is coherent and well supported by concrete images (storm debris, snapped kite, unraveling tapestry). Recurring motifs (feather, kite string, lagoon light) subtly echo the thematic concern with rupture and reweaving. However, the story undercuts some of its subtlety with explicit thesis statements like “beauty was not a fixed state but a process” and the final line “In the incomplete, in the transient, lay the deepest beauty,” which verge on moralizing. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and honest but somewhat overexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of bridge-building, interspecies respect, and pain as a shared language emerge organically from the copper-root architecture and Lira’s choices. Recurring motifs (copper wire, runes, hum/heartbeat, “gentle and systematic”) meaningfully shift weight by the end, especially as her death is folded into the orchard’s ongoing life. Some thematic statements in dialogue (“This is a bridge,” “pain can be a language too”) verge on explicit thesis work rather than leaving more to subtext. Still, the final images and the Earned Stasis of her staying offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s questions.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of authenticity vs artifice, belonging, and self-recognition are woven through the Enclave’s premise, Kael’s skepticism about bottling “homecoming,” and the mirror-like function of the path and tower. The final ache in Lirael’s chest and the idea of convergence as seeing oneself give a resonant, if quiet, answer: homecoming as internal collision rather than purchasable ritual. However, some thematic statements (“homecoming isn’t a formula. It’s a collision…”) are delivered rather declaratively, blunting subtext. The piece avoids moralizing but leans slightly toward thesis-speak in Kael’s lines.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of regeneration, memory, and harmony beneath chaos (“submerged concord,” “the space between breaths”) are woven organically through his actions rather than stated as thesis. The reef’s bones becoming fertilizer and dead languages becoming tools for listening to birds embody the idea that the past’s ruin can nourish new forms of life. The final line, “The earth remembers,” reweights earlier images without reading as platitude, landing as earned, quiet resonance. Some symbolic elements (e.g., battlefield-into-garden) are familiar, but they’re handled with enough specificity to avoid cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, community, and transforming “distance into closeness” emerge organically from the objects, the post-war setting, and Hush’s new purpose. The leaf’s evolution into a communal symbol is a strong thematic move, and the idea that stories and shared riddles can bind a scattered people lands clearly. However, the final riddle’s answer—“love”—and Jeb’s explicit line about “tinted revelations” verge on didactic, flattening some of the ambiguity and subtlety. The piece leans toward sentimentality but still achieves a genuine, if gentle, resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—confusion reframed as the first draft of exploration and “true north” as an inner stance—is coherent and well-embedded in recurring images (compass, sketching, warped constellations). The grandmother’s line “Confusion…is just exploration’s first draft” and Elio’s ending realization articulate the theme clearly but verge on didactic, slightly flattening subtext. Nonetheless, the final image of choosing a seemingly nonsensical path with quiet resolve meaningfully reweights what came before. It’s resonant and honest, though a bit more told insight than earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of wonder over greed and the courage to “swap the familiar for the mysterious” are woven through the relics, the crafted replicas, and his mentor’s philosophy, giving the piece a coherent conceptual spine. That said, the story leans into explicit statement in the final paragraphs (“In a world full of secrets, sometimes the greatest wonder…”) rather than trusting implication and image, which flattens some nuance. Kael’s internal shift from thief to “guardian of wonder” feels thematically apt but arrives as a tidy conclusion rather than a hard-won, ambiguously priced realization. The subtext is present but could be deepened by more dramatized conflict between safety and curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—the overlooked power of “pawns,” the politics of who writes history, and the blur between performance and real crisis—emerges strongly from the chess motif and her profession. The reconfiguration of the board, with major pieces stepping into pawn-space, nicely embodies her realization that she embodies all roles at once. However, several lines state the thesis quite directly (“history wasn’t written by kings or queens, but by the pawns who dared to move”), edging into mild sermonizing and reducing subtext. The resonance is real but a bit over-articulated for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of memory, identity, and “home as what you carry” are well woven through recurring images (mirror stone, feather, obsidian shards, mercury skin) and Lirael’s burden of others’ lives. The final reconfiguration—home as the act of remembering and bearing others’ truths—fits the events and reweights prior material. That said, the story edges into explicit thesis-statement territory (“Home isn’t a place,” “to seed the world with truth, via the texture of a feather”), which slightly undercuts subtext. A bit more reliance on image over direct statement would elevate the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    The woven threads, chess motif, and frozen village all converge on a coherent theme: guilt, consequence, and the impossibility of fully untangling the past. The notion of weaving one’s failures into something new is strong and visually dramatized by the threads re-forming. Some thematic statements slide into explicit moralizing (“The prince’s death wasn’t his fault alone…”) that flatten ambiguity. The ending image—walking away to teach a new game—offers a resonant, if slightly neat, answer to the story’s question.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of truth as multiplicity, forgiveness as power, and the rewriting of rituals are coherent and threaded through objects and images (the spire as lens, echoes, light). Yet they’re often stated outright—“Truth isn’t a blade, but a kaleidoscope”; “rituals are just poems we’ve forgotten how to rewrite”—rather than left to emerge from subtext, which edges toward sermonizing. The final paragraph leans into explicit takeaway about forgiveness and control, reducing ambiguity and emotional mess in favor of clean philosophy. The story invites reflection, but with more thesis-forward articulation than a top-tier literary piece would tolerate.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    The thematic throughline—kintsugi as honoring cracks, mending as choice, survival over perfection—is coherent and meaningfully tied to her memories and the statue’s scars. Recurring images (quilts, constellations, acid as mirror) support a resonant reconfiguration at the end. However, the theme is often explicitly stated (“Kintsugi… isn’t about perfection. It’s about surviving.” / “The charm… is a promise.”), edging into didactic rather than fully subtextual. Slightly more reliance on image and action, less on thesis-like lines, would elevate this for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme around time, memory, and “temporary eternity” is well-seeded through the shell, the cracked mirror, the shells at the pool, and the final sense of carrying peace back. The idea of “beauty in the fractures” aligns with both the broken mirror and Elias’s emotional state, giving a coherent through-line. However, the story edges toward explicit statement (“He’d kept his hidden promise to himself: to find beauty in the fractures”) rather than trusting images alone. The resonance is present and sincere, but could be subtler and more open-ended for truly top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of quiet versus loud emotion, the endurance of grief, and the power of subtle intention are woven through specific images (her mother’s quiet grief vs. father’s rage, the garden’s “whispers,” the fisherman and his wife stunned into shared silence). Thalos’s line about currents versus waves verges on thesis-statement but still feels organic to his character and enriches the conceptual frame. The final village beat reweights the whole piece, confirming that unseen tenderness can move through the world without overt declaration. The story resists tidy moralizing, leaving room to ponder the costs and gifts of being heard without being seen.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of grief, inheritance, and mapping loss emerge organically through the censer foot, ancestral voice, and the idea of “reverse migration” as reclaiming drowned histories. The final image—in which the geography of loss becomes something she can now “map”—reweights everything that came before without stating a moral. Subtext around climate change, erasure of place, and familial memory is present but understated. It could push further into moral or emotional complication (e.g., what it costs to call the lost back) to reach the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of truth as weapon/tool, empathy’s double edge, and “psychological safety” as an active choice are well integrated into objects (eye, ledger, truffles) and Mara’s vocation. The final realization—“The truth, she realized, could be a weapon—but only if you wielded it with care”—is coherent but veers into explicit moralizing, flattening some of the richer ambiguity the setup invites. The notion of occluding with truth is intriguingly paradoxical and could carry more of the thematic load if dramatized more and explained less. Overall, the piece invites reflection but doesn’t fully trust subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of guilt, memory, and the non-transferability of redemption come through clearly, especially in the line “redemption… couldn’t be borrowed” and the final reframing of isolation. The Edelweiss and the dock function thematically as emblems of confession/hope and liminality between past and present. Some thematic statements are a bit on-the-nose (“Because isolation isn’t just about being alone”), edging toward moralizing rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. The resonance is real but not yet subtle or surprising enough for the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of choice, orientation, and self-authorship (“cartographer of her own heart”) are coherently woven through the map, ants, and “doorway of decisions” motif. The father’s line about not being lost but “just following the ants” nicely reweights prior imagery in a way that resonates beyond the literal adventure. However, the closing moral—“a mirror, reflecting the courage to choose”—edges toward explicit thesis rather than letting the images carry all the weight. A bit more ambiguity or unresolved ache would push it into a more complex, less didactic register.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of fear vs. disenchantment and self-as-wound are coherent and organically tied to the “bleeding starlight” motif. The grotto as mirror of her pain is a strong, non-literal answer to the central question of the dreams. However, the thematic core is articulated a bit too directly in the entity’s dialogue (“You are not disenchanted. You are afraid.”; “The starlight bleeds because you bleed.”), nudging into thesis-statement territory rather than pure subtext. Despite this, the final image of her descending with starlight still on her hands carries a resonant, reflective aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of revaluing failure, returning differently, and letting objects/processes reshape perspective are well-integrated into both plot (how she solves the problem) and image systems (palette, light, shell density). The final realization that “The palette of resolve wasn’t a tool—it was a philosophy” offers a clear conceptual repricing of the entire endeavor. That said, several thematic lines are articulated a bit too explicitly (“The palette…isn’t just for mixing light. It’s for mixing perspective.”), edging toward authorial explanation rather than letting subtext and image fully carry the weight. The emotional aftereffect is thoughtful and calm rather than haunting, which suits the piece but limits its impact at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme around nostalgia, self-narration, and the construction of identity emerges clearly from the grave, the chronicler role, and the scroll ritual. The revaluation of feral nostalgia from curse to compass is conceptually strong and ties back through earlier images. However, the piece leans into direct thematic statement (“The feral nostalgia wasn’t a curse—it was a compass… I wasn’t trapped in the past; I was building it”) rather than letting images carry more of the work, edging toward over-articulation. There is still a genuine, non-trite emotional aftertaste, but with less mystery than a top-tier literary venue typically favors.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of “ordinary miracles,” redemption through objects, and perceiving through loss emerge organically from the clocks, the screw, and Lira’s anosmia. The fog lifting and the mirrored losses between Lira and Mrs. Voss give the ending a quiet resonance. However, phrases like “ordinary miracle” and the final tapestry metaphor edge close to explicit thesis-stating, slightly reducing the power of what is otherwise well-embedded subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of scars-as-witnesses, pain-to-power, and the “breath between storms” emerge organically from runic mechanics, ritual, and Kael’s history. The crow quill, scars, and breath motif shift meaning by the end, turning from sources of shame/fear into tools and language. However, the text occasionally overstates its thesis—especially “to transform pain into power, one must first shed the lies that cage the heart”—which edges into explicit moralizing rather than letting images fully carry the weight. Despite this, the afterimage is resonant and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of regret, imperfect miracles, and memory-as-resonance emerge organically from the particulars: the archive, the bottle, and the argument that preceded Lila’s death. The “not a ghost…a resonance” line reframes haunting as a loop of guilt, and the orchard’s destruction at the end underlines that some losses are irreversible even when emotional repair is attempted. The repeated notion of imperfection is slightly on-the-nose in phrasing but thematically cohesive rather than didactic. The final image leaves a resonant sense of cost and acceptance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of truth-as-process, inner vs outer reality, and the illusory nature of cosmic structures are coherent and well-threaded through the dictionary, mural, and singularity imagery. The final blank dictionary is a strong thematic image. However, the story states its insights quite directly (“truth was not a destination but a continuous process of unification”), edging toward essayistic moral rather than fully trusting subtext. The resonance is there but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of time, silence, perception, and longing are woven coherently through the key’s razor edges, the hydraulic clocks, and the fjord’s quiet, with good use of recurring images and inherited wisdom. The final realization that “clocks didn’t measure time at all. They measured longing” crisply crystallizes the thematic thrust, reweighting prior details. That said, this line borders on thesis-statement explicitness, where a slightly more oblique or purely imagistic ending might feel more earned and less didactic. The piece still lands with emotional and conceptual resonance, but not with the subtlety that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of surrender vs control is consistent and organically tied to the barrier system, with a nice conceptual echo in “filters sorting intent” and permeable defenses. However, the story often states its thesis outright (“sometimes, the strongest defense is surrender”) instead of trusting implication and image, which flattens potential ambiguity. The final realization feels more like a clean moral than a complex reckoning with costs or lingering doubts. There is resonance, but it leans toward didactic clarity rather than layered subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coheres around chaos vs order, superstition vs rationality, and “lucid contradictions” as a way of living with grief, with good use of recurring images (lantern light, scrawls, doors, tracks). The line “Contradictions aren’t traps. They’re mirrors.” is pointed and slightly didactic, but it crystallizes an already-earned pattern rather than announcing something new. Clara’s decision to visit her father ties the conceptual material back to a human-scale emotional cost. The piece stops short of deeper moral ambiguity about her gambling impulse, opting instead for a gentle reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of connection-through-disconnection, “cultivated estrangement,” and wrong numbers becoming right paths are woven tightly into events rather than lectured. The disc as mirror, the recipe for grief, and the final lullaby image create a resonant, coherent answer to the question of what to do with loneliness and misdirection. The line “She’d cultivated their estrangement, yes, but in doing so, she’d shown them how to turn endings into beginnings” edges close to thesis-stating but is still grounded in concrete prior beats. Overall the piece sustains a clear but not simplistic thematic throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, ritual adaptation, and the power of small acts are woven consistently through objects (locket, ink), practices (offerings, documentation), and images (blooming jetty, closing flowers). The story does a good job embodying “the weight of small moments” in concrete gestures. However, the thematic statement becomes a bit didactic in lines like “The covenant’s weight, she realized, wasn’t in the past or the future. It was in the now, in the act of preservation itself,” which articulates a thesis rather than fully trusting image and implication. The resonance is genuine but lands more as articulated wisdom than as an inevitable, wordless realization.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story’s thematic core—loneliness as language/space and reciprocity as balancing forces—is woven through the moon rock, rumor chains, and the conductor’s remarks in a mostly organic way. The line “Loneliness is a plague? No. It’s a language” flirts with on-the-nose thesis but is rescued by the sensory, associative rush of images that follows. Elias’s small repricing of his own defenses (jocularity as bridge, not shield) ties the concept back to character. The theme is resonant and coherent, if a touch explicit for the venue tier you’re aiming at.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—translating grief and hope into a new mode of perception, “where feeling becomes seeing”—is coherently embedded in the ring, the forest tongues, and the emotional map. The emotional cartography conceit nicely fuses external journey and inner work. However, the thematic statement is occasionally too explicit (“His work was to map the unmapped, but his true purpose was deeper”) and the final line borders on didactic, stating the insight rather than fully trusting image and implication. Still, the piece leaves a genuine, lingering emotional aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of control vs. collaboration, causality as a web, and learning to transform mistakes into “seeds” emerge clearly from the events and images. The recurring ideas of webs and seeds, and the final notion that his job is to witness rather than write the future, have genuine resonance. That said, the story often states its thesis outright (“The future isn’t yours to write. It’s yours to witness.”), tipping into mild sermonizing and reducing ambiguity. The emotional aftereffect is thoughtful but somewhat didactic rather than hauntingly open-ended.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of silence, memory, and the transformation of absence into art are woven consistently through the camera, sign language, and the town’s gathered listening. The conceptual core—that silence is a “canvas” rather than emptiness, and that forgotten people risk being imprisoned by their own quiet—is strong and coherent. However, some of the thematic statements tilt toward explicit thesis (“silence wasn’t emptiness—it was a canvas, waiting to be painted with sound”) rather than letting images and actions fully carry the meaning. The ending’s bittersweet awareness of ephemerality does reweight earlier beats, but the insight stops just short of feeling surprising or freshly complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of preservation vs. living transformation, intergenerational stewardship, and art-as-translation are well integrated through recurring images: fire that reveals, ink that heals, archive as garden, vandalism as tending. The final realization—that the archive is to be “revisited, its stories remade with each generation,” and that Mara is a gardener—reweights prior material with satisfying clarity. However, the theme is sometimes stated directly rather than entirely earned through image and implication, especially in the grandmother’s explicit “It’s not a tomb…It’s a garden” and the final explanatory sentences. A bit more reliance on the charged images themselves (portraits, ink, fire, garden) and a bit less on explicit thematic articulation would push this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of shared memory, transforming trauma into connection, and choosing to “breathe life into a shared dream” emerge organically from the sound-based setting and Eli’s history as a guinea pig. The final realization—that entanglement is a gift and his drive is to thrive within a collective dream—does reweight prior material. However, the theme is somewhat over-articulated in dialogue (“To breathe life into a shared dream,” “The entanglement wasn’t a curse; it was a gift”), nudging toward explicit moral rather than relying fully on image and action. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere, but slightly sentimental and on-the-nose for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of surveillance, memory, and subtlety-as-power (“whispers travel farther than shouts”) are woven through tactile elements: maps labeled with “walks,” the listening labyrinth, echoes, and Elias’s final choice to hum rather than direct others. The zodiac coin and Libra symbol support ideas of pattern, balance, and being weighed by the maze. The explicit line “The labyrinth listens… And it remembers” edges toward thesis statement, slightly flattening what the images already imply. Still, the final image of him moving softly as doors shift elsewhere offers a resonant, if gentle, answer to the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of silent empathy, wordless communication, and transforming darkness through small acts of beauty are clear and coherent. Recurring images—the mirror, stars, dock patterns—do good work thematically, and the quiet, incomplete easing of the canal’s tension supports a nuanced, non-heroic view of care. However, the text sometimes states its theme too directly (“The core concept of silent empathy threaded through her actions,” “to teach darkness the value of stars”), edging toward essayistic labeling. Subtext is present but a bit over-explained rather than fully trusted to image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of grief, legacy, choice, and “second thoughts” are well integrated via chess, the grotto, and the synchronized displays, and the idea of rebellion as patient, humble work fits the characters’ arcs. Subtext in unspoken words—Lila’s fear of abandonment, Clara’s careful reassurance—does some good work without being over-explained. However, several lines (“Messages about choice. About seeing the board before the move.” / “Rebellions start small.”) veer into explicit thesis-stating. The ending resonates, but the moral texture is more affirming than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of detachment, freedom, and embracing one’s true nature arise organically from Lira’s history with the island, the mythic scrimshaw, and the whale’s summons. Yet the story undercuts its own subtlety by explicitly spelling out its thesis (“freedom wasn’t found in staying but in detaching,” “The disappearing island had been a lesson, a cruel and beautiful teacher”). This leans toward moralizing and flattens what could be a more ambiguous, haunting resonance. The final image of her swimming toward the horizon is thematically apt but a bit familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece has a coherent and resonant thematic core about grief, imperfection, and the politics of mandated happiness, with the spoon, bouquet, and turbines all echoing that. However, several lines state the theme too directly—“Grief is like these flowers” and “Lightness…is the courage to carry both”—pushing toward aphorism rather than letting subtext and image do more of the work. The most powerful thematic work happens earlier, in the father’s “crack in a table” belief and the idea of polishing flaws. Trimming or submerging the explicit thesis statements would give the story more lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of boundary dissolution, sacred vs. profane, and art as a world-altering act recur coherently through the humming quartz, the cracking ice, and the final threshold image. The story’s motifs (silence, shimmer, paraphrase, certainty) are consistent and support the idea that perception/poetry can rewrite reality. However, the line “the world is ours to reshape” edges into thesis-statement territory and flattens some nuance that the imagery had earned. More friction or ambiguity about the cost of such power would deepen the thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme—beauty in imperfection, magic in “sideways” seeing, and broken things as fuel for transformation—runs coherently through the glass shards, phoenix, plants, and Elias’s art. The final painting (phoenix from shattered glass, wings of ivy and thorns) is a strong non-literal answer to the opening problem. However, several lines state the thesis outright (“Beauty isn’t in perfection…”, “After the phoenix rose, the world had learned to burn brighter”), softening subtext and drifting toward moralization. The resonance is clear and honest but a bit on-the-nose for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme—that connection is already present and must be listened to rather than engineered—is coherent and tied to concrete particulars (mountain song, scratched lens, silent machines). However, it is stated too baldly in lines like “Connection wasn’t something to be engineered” and “We thought we needed to build devices to capture sound,” which edge into moralizing rather than trusting subtext. The recurring question of assumptions does add some complexity, but the resolution leans toward a tidy takeaway rather than an unsettling or multilayered resonance. The final charged image of bell plus mountain hum does some lifting, but the explicit commentary undercuts its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of grief, atonement, and mending the unfixable are organically woven through objects (jewelry, stencil, origami, lanterns) and places (wounded coordinates). The idea of grief as light that can be refracted rather than diminished is strong and specific. However, some thematic statements are more explicit than they need to be (“The curtains of intention were not a cure for grief, but a language for it”), edging toward essay rather than pure scene. The ending still lands with emotional and conceptual resonance, even if slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thematic throughlines—chaos as mappable, scars and culture as skeleton, measurement versus mystery—are well-integrated through recurring objects (tape, cards, rain, loft). The final repricing of scars as maps and the loft as revolutionary archive is resonant and conceptually interesting. However, several lines state the thesis too explicitly (“The crashes didn’t erase culture—they exposed its skeleton. Now we can map it.”), edging toward essayistic clarity over subtext. The theme is strong and coherent but could trust implication a bit more for top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of curiosity vs. safety, the myth of “innocence,” and the ethics of forbidden knowledge are woven consistently through the imagery (ruins, seed, atoms of nostalgia) and Lirael’s choices. The ending’s notion of embracing questions over answers offers a resonant, non-literal response to the story’s central tension. However, thematic material is often articulated directly in dialogue and narration (“Innocence is a lie,” “Corruption is just another pattern”) rather than left to emerge from subtext, edging toward didacticism. This explicitness blunts some of the potential lingering ambiguity and emotional after-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of hope’s mutability, the dangers of diffusion through technology, and the necessity of consciously reshaping hope are tightly woven through the stone, spiral, and shadow motifs. The final reconfiguration of the library’s titles nicely reframes the preceding events as a first step in a new configuration of hope. Some thematic material is delivered quite explicitly via Thalos’s lines (“Of hope. The library was built to preserve it…”), which blunts subtext and feels a bit thesis-like. Still, the story invites reflection on how collective dreaming/time-sharing alters what we preserve, without collapsing into a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thematic integration is strong: fragility, shedding, survival, and reconstruction recur in images and actions (the chameleon, the tail, her own “layers”), and the final dawn image reweights prior material. Subtextually, the piece argues that softness can be a form of resilience, and the chameleon’s strategy complicates simplistic “hard vs. soft” binaries. The main weakness is explicit moralizing in lines like “compassion wasn’t a liability. It was the reason to keep going,” which spells out the thesis instead of fully trusting image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of scars as narrative, time as both river and dam, and miracles being “displaced” rather than absent are coherent and woven through images (scar, hourglass, tower, coffee rings). However, key thematic lines are spoken almost literally (“Stories are written in scars”; “The displaced miracle had finally found its place”), edging into thesis-statement territory rather than letting implication do the work. The final image does reweight what came before, but the moral feels a bit explained rather than fully earned in subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of stored grief, residual love, and spaces holding emotional residue run coherently through the film, letters, theater, and crystal. The idea of a “theater of light where love went to die” is especially strong, and the final realization that unused love “was just waiting for someone to notice it” nicely reframes the earlier metaphor. That line, however, edges toward explicit thesis statement and flirts with sentimentality instead of leaving more work to subtext. Overall, the thematic web is solid and resonant, if a bit literal at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—creativity as something not trapped but latent, accessible through attention and “listening”—is tightly braided with the imagery of stardust, jars of artistic moments, and the aurora as “breath of imprisoned gods.” The final state of Kael (ideas “each one a star waiting to fall”) quietly reweights the premise and gives a resonant answer to the opening problem. That said, the direct statement “Creativity isn’t trapped. It’s waiting.” comes close to prompt-like thesis articulation and slightly undercuts the otherwise imagistic delivery of theme. More reliance on implication and less on voiced explanation would elevate this.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of imagination after ecological catastrophe, choice at the brink (“Midnight is the moment between choices”), and the physics of possibility (wave functions, collapse) are well interwoven with image and event rather than preached. The final image—Kael in the coat of light walking a dune newly dotted with sparks—offers a non-literal, resonant answer about tending fragile futures. Subtext around voyeurism versus participation (watching others’ dreams vs. finally dreaming) is suggestive without being overexplained. A hint more moral or emotional ambiguity around the cost of reactivating dreaming would deepen the resonance further.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of wildness versus machinery, memory, and the necessity of relinquishment emerge organically from the gear, the forest-as-brain conceit, and the final act of planting the “seed.” The notion that the forest is alive because it “remembers being wild” nicely encapsulates the story’s conceptual stake and reweights prior images. However, the father’s line “But to keep it that way, you must let go” edges into on-the-nose thesis statement rather than leaving more work to subtext. The ending’s “probable miracles” line offers a resonant, quiet reframe, though the moral calculus could stand a bit more complexity or unease.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of courage, hope, and indirect journeys are strongly woven through the ridgeway, the star-stamped tickets, and Lira’s shoreline-lullaby aphorisms. The conceptual turn—that courage isn’t found in a place but rekindled in others, and that sharing it increases its flow—reweights earlier encounters with the travelers effectively. However, several lines state the theme quite directly (“Courage isn’t a lake to be drained. It’s a river.”), edging toward didactic rather than fully subtextual. The emotional aftertaste is gentle and genuine, if a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    Thematically, the piece coherently explores safety, silence, and communal responsibility, with strong recurring images (bolt, snow, walls, music) supporting a “safety as garden, not cage” idea. However, the theme is heavily over-articulated in explicit statements like “Safety…is not the absence of sound. It is the courage to listen,” which read as direct thesis rather than earned implication. The final paragraphs summarize the moral (“keeper of hope,” “some costs were worth paying”) instead of trusting image and action, reducing complexity and subtext. Ambiguity about the true costs or downsides of breaking silence is underdeveloped, making the resolution feel somewhat sermon-like.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of truth versus illusion, legacy reclaimed, and necessary collapse of false structures are coherent and embedded in the iron gall ink’s function and the final “graceful” fall of the chamber. The image of constellations resuming their journey after the lie is sundered offers a satisfying conceptual repricing of order. However, the treatment leans toward straightforward moral clarity (false king bad, true heir good) with little moral ambiguity or counter-pressure. Subtext exists but remains relatively surface-level for a piece aiming at elite literary nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of climate grief, the limits of technocratic “healing,” and listening to nonhuman rhythms emerge organically through Lira’s work, the bleaching reefs, and the tapping motif. The idea that the fossil fuel ban is only a beginning and that change can be alien and unsettling rather than simply restorative is compelling. However, several lines state theme in near-thesis form (“The fossil fuel ban had been a beginning, not an end”; “the paths that disappeared were not lost—they were waiting”), edging toward didactic. The subtextual power of the tapping and the gateways could carry more of that work without explicit explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of finding pattern and meaning in chaos, and of rebellion as more than brute conflict, are coherent and organically linked to Lira’s worldview and the stone-circle ritual. The closing assertion “The mess had meaning. It always had.” resonates conceptually with the rebellion’s reawakening. Yet thematic statements are frequently articulated in overt thesis form (“The rebellion isn’t just about fighting. It’s about meaning.”), reducing subtextual richness. This direct moralizing flattens potential ambiguity and keeps the piece from achieving a more layered, lingering aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematic throughline—tradition vs. change, destiny vs. nurture, resistance to authoritarian control—is coherent and emerges from concrete particulars (her insurgent past, the embryo’s design, the choice of planting site). The reconfiguration of “implanted destiny” into a seed contingent on who plants it is strong and conceptually satisfying. However, the final paragraphs lapse into overt moralizing (“The future wasn’t something to fear or control—it was something to nurture”) instead of trusting image and implication, flattening nuance. More residue of uncertainty or cost would deepen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of embodied memory, grief, and “anchoring optimism in realism” arise organically from the somatic markers, the lighthouse motif, and Lila’s changing relationship to the photograph. The final realization—that the pearl of stillness is a lens to see “beauty in the brokenness”—reweights earlier images and gives a coherent, emotionally honest answer to the story’s question. However, several lines (Mrs. Voss explaining somatic markers; “Your talent isn’t just in your hands…”; “I want to anchor optimism in realism”) edge into explicit thesis-stating rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. The piece still resonates, but trims of overt moralizing would deepen its literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motifs of fragments, threads, tarot, and the defunct lighthouse cohere into a clear thematic inquiry about fragmentation, fate, and the possibility of reweaving meaning. The final revaluation—“Maybe we’re all just waiting to be rewoven”—accurately caps the preceding images and actions. However, the theme is occasionally overstated via direct rhetorical questions and near-thesis lines rather than entirely entrusted to image and implication. This keeps it from the highest band, where more reliance on subtext and less overt philosophizing would strengthen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes about time in crisis—slowing vs fragmenting, memory as something erasable, crisis as a “language” of pauses—are woven through the disappearing ink and the Tower, giving the piece conceptual cohesion. The child’s line about patterns being “like breath” and Lira’s reframing of time as fragmentation are effective, if slightly expository, articulations of the thematic core. The ending reweights the myth of the Tower from destination to mirror, which offers a solid conceptual repricing. Some lines verge on thesis-statement territory, keeping this below a truly haunting, open-ended resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of truth versus censorship is coherent and integral, but it’s rendered in very direct thesis statements (“Because the truth matters,” “what good was knowledge if it was censored”) rather than emerging primarily from subtext and image. The metaphor of thawing frozen bodies/truths is strong and could carry more weight if relied on instead of explicit moralizing. Complexity is limited: the Council’s perspective is not dramatized, and little moral ambiguity clouds Lirael’s choice. The ending tells us the revolution begins rather than leaving a more resonant, reweighted image to linger.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of containment vs. freedom, violence vs. cultivation, and quiet as focus rather than absence are woven through recurring objects (knife, sandbag, dome, roses) and land in a coherent final stance. The ballast’s paradox (weight enabling flight) and the farm as penance give the piece real conceptual depth. However, the text sometimes states its thesis too directly—lines like “The farm was more than a sanctuary; it was a manifesto” and “even in ruin, life persists” edge into sermonizing rather than trusting subtext. The ending still resonates, but with slightly more told moral than top-tier literary work tends to tolerate.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of translation, sacrifice, and listening (to what lies between notes/silences) emerge organically from the tools and images rather than from explicit moralizing. The goddess becoming part of the soil and patterns nicely reframes divinity as distributed presence rather than discrete entity, a quiet Conceptual Repricing of the garden itself. Kael’s final smile at the lingering note embodies a modest but resonant acceptance of loss and transformed connection. The piece could reach higher bands with a sharper, less tidy ambiguity about what this cost means for him personally or for the world beyond this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of truth versus legacy, orbits of regret, and light versus black holes recur coherently through the observatory, the rivers, and the family business. The nib and observatory form a strong motif path from inherited silence to chosen exposure. Yet the story leans into explicit thesis statements—“My family’s orbit isn’t one of light—it’s a black hole, swallowing truths” and “Truth, she realized, wasn’t a destination—it was a compass”—which edges into didactic summation rather than letting the scenes fully carry the resonance. The subtext is there, but the overt articulation slightly blunts its power.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of guilt, silencing, and the ethical cost of “harmony” are well woven through the haunted firmware, the baby-cry translation, and Lira’s maternal backstory. The use of handwritten letters as a conduit for forgiveness rather than erasure is thematically strong and non-trite. The ending’s shift from wail to hum and dissonance to quiet lands as a conceptual repricing of silence itself. Some ideas (e.g., “hush the dissonance of old guilt”) flirt with being stated a bit directly instead of entirely through scene.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of unlearning, listening versus speaking, and finding meaning in apparent “mess” are well woven into particulars: the emergent hush, patterns, collaboration encoded in the grotto’s design. Her role shift—from documenting to decoding—offers a thematic answer that fits the events. Yet the final paragraph leans into explicit thesis statements (“The unlearning… wasn’t about shedding knowledge”), tipping toward moralizing rather than trusting image and implication. This dulls what could otherwise be a more resonant, open-ended close.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of mercy after catastrophe, transformation versus erasure, and rebuilding through memory are coherent and well-tied to the mosaic imagery. The recurring tile and wave patterns nicely embody the idea of continuity through fracture. However, the piece leans on explicit statements (“But erasure was not destruction. It was transformation.”; “He had renamed the world, one chipped stone at a time.”), which flatten some subtext and tip toward essayistic moralizing rather than letting the images fully carry the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of reprise, possibility, and the non-linearity of time emerge organically from the coin, the echoes, and the repeated “encore” motif, rather than from overt moralizing. The idea that “Possibility wasn’t a fixed point but a dance” is slightly on-the-nose but still rooted in on-page action, especially the closing group dance that reconfigures despair into collective repair. The final image of the blank coin and faint, beyond-time applause offers a resonant, if gentle, conceptual repricing of the Fool’s journey and performance itself. Strong, coherent thematic work, though a touch more complication or ambivalence in the ending would deepen its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coherently explores organic growth vs engineered shortcuts, bodily knowledge vs corporate techno-salvation, with the geode’s “fractally precise” growth contrasted against the rushed, noisy pills. The recurrence of somatic markers and the geode as non-magical tools underlines a philosophy of awareness over augmentation. Some thematic lines edge toward explicit thesis (“The pills promise to connect minds, but they disconnect us from ourselves”), but they still arise from Elias’s lived experience rather than pure essaying. The ending offers a hopeful, non-didactic answer—build inner pathways and share them—without collapsing into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory persistence, objects as bridges across time, and the fecundity of the “unknown” emerge organically from the fossil’s journey and Lira’s profession. The elm leaf’s transformation into spores that enter her body nicely literalizes the idea that stories inhabit and change us. However, key insights are spelled out explicitly (“She understood now: the unknown wasn’t empty…”), edging into thesis statement and blunting some subtextive power. The ending resonates but leans a bit tidy and declarative for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of history’s weight, the malleability of prophecy, and the future as seeded possibility are coherently interwoven via hourglass, buttons, and canyon echo. However, the piece leans on explicit thematic statements (“The future wasn’t a line to be followed but a field to be planted”) and a direct pronouncement from the echo, which veer toward didactic. The imagery supports the ideas well, but the wisdom feels given more than earned through conflict. A bit more resistance or ambiguity around the insight would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—unused courage, the cost of secrets, and renewal at a liminal threshold—emerges coherently from concrete elements: the bluff, the pillbox, the seasonal tilt, and her father’s line about unused courage. The recurring motifs of codes in snow/earth and the sea vs. bluff reinforce the idea that truth and bravery surface slowly and must be protected. At times, the text edges into explicit thematic statement (“Fixing what’s broken required more than deciphering codes…”), which slightly flattens subtext and complexity. Still, the final image of her walking toward answers with steadier resolve offers a resonant, non-literal reply to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—about layered promises, clarity beneath complexity, and meaning teased from silence—is coherent and supported by recurring images (river as palimpsest, yarn needle, ambient awareness). However, some of this is asserted in near-thesis language (“its true purpose was to untangle. To take the messy, chaotic threads of life and pull them into something coherent”) rather than earned purely through scene. The quiet final image does reweight earlier material by aligning Thaddeus’s role with the river’s palimpsest nature. Still, the piece flirts with pseudo-profundity, telling us the insight instead of fully dramatizing its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematic material—kindness as a force that can anchor timelines, memory as resistance to decay, small acts bending reality—is rich and well seeded in the lantern and sunflowers. The vision of alternate fates for the oasis nicely reweights prior images. However, the story at times tips into explicit thesis statements (“The oasis wasn’t resisting change—it was choosing…”, “to shape time, one must first tend to the light within it”), edging toward moralizing rather than letting images carry the weight. This slightly flattens what could be a more enigmatic, lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—persisting in care and beauty “after the final petal drops,” reflecting light into dark corners—is strongly woven through gardening, the tool, and the harbor. The bitting gauge’s repurposing “for measuring light” and the line about watering the stem after the petals fall both crystallize the piece’s questions about grief and renewal. Some thematic lines edge toward overt statement rather than subtext, slightly reducing subtlety. Still, the final images (light through the opened window, the harbor breathing, a rosebush waiting for spring) carry genuine resonance beyond the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, extinction, and selfhood versus collective identity are organically woven through the extinct-species imagery, the sundial’s reflections, and Lirael’s final stance. The last paragraphs, where she shifts from “contemporary of the dead” to “pioneer of the living,” provide a satisfying thematic cadence. However, lines like “To be atomically reflective meant to see oneself…” slip into thesis-statement territory, making subtext partially explicit rather than fully embodied. The piece invites reflection but edges toward didactic clarity instead of trusting implication.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of connection, secrecy, and transformation are coherently threaded through the spiral, the pond, the orbs, and Lila’s profession. However, the explicit statement—“The thread that connects all things isn’t a secret. It’s the courage to share it.”—tips into overt thesis and undercuts what the images already imply. Subtext exists (her complicity in others’ emotional evasion vs. her own), but ambiguity and moral complexity are minimal; the piece lands on a neat moral. The final decision to encourage clients to speak their truths integrates theme with character but feels somewhat didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of power as a game, nonviolent resistance through “harmony,” and the ethics of interpreting/countering cosmic forces emerge organically from events. The idea that “power is a river. It changes course” is thematically apt but also somewhat declarative, edging toward thesis-statement. The ending image—Lila both threatened and invigorated, treating the cosmos as a chessboard—offers a resonant if not profound reweighting of earlier material. Ambiguity about the tricksters’ motives (revenge vs “something darker”) adds welcome complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of rebellion against enclosing systems (a living cathedral, one’s own fear) and crossing thresholds into the unknown are embedded in the imagery and arc. The organ’s lament and the idea of “forgotten rebellions” nod toward a larger history and a romanticized defiance. Yet the final thematic note—“wistful rebellion in his heart”—states mood more than it reweights earlier events, and the ambiguity of what he’s rebelling against (history, fate, his own limits?) remains somewhat vague. The resonance is present but not yet deep or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of recognition beyond the face, the moral duty to feel for the dead, and art as an instrument of empathy are strong and coherent with the premise. The ribbon-as-plea and quarry-as-tomb images do good thematic work, especially when the ribbon is reframed as a “thread to her humanity.” However, the story over-articulates its thesis in dialogue (“Empathy’s never truly dormant. It just needs the right key.”), drifting into moral summary rather than letting images and choices speak. The resonance is real but shaded by this explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of institutional exile, buried truth, and the moral necessity of questioning sanctioned narratives arise organically from the family history and the station’s rigid director. The “Reversal” motif and the instruction to “question the storm” nicely tie epistemology (how we know) to weather as both data and omen. The final act reads as an earned refusal to accept inherited shame, inviting reflection on who gets labeled deviant or unreliable. A few lines (“some truths were worth the risk”) veer toward explicitness, slightly flattening what is otherwise strong implicit thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of memory, alternate possibilities, and art as a means to reconfigure reality emerge naturally from the flake, the “ashes of ‘never,’” and the bridge-song tradition. The final image of Elias raising the fiddle again offers a resonant, open-ended answer: he will engage with this dangerous gift rather than back away. Some phrasings (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) approach abstract-jargon but are still anchored enough in the story’s concrete motifs. The piece invites reflection on choice and regret without collapsing into explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of cyclical greed, inheritance, and the possibility of breaking patterns are clear and consistent, especially through the recurring imagery of the money, the train, and the “paths circle back” motif. However, the story over-explains its ideas (“Greed, ambition, fear—these were the forces…”) and states its lesson directly in the final third, reducing subtext and ambiguity. The conceptual answer—cycles are driven by choice, not fate—fits the events but reads more like an essayed conclusion than an organically discovered insight. This explicit moralizing blunts what could be a more resonant, open-ended finish.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of shared burdens, humility, and empathy over detached “mapping” emerge organically from the temple’s rules and Lirael’s profession. The stars-as-mirrors motif and the temple as a “language of shared burdens” link cosmic observation to emotional responsibility in a coherent way. However, key thematic lines (“The temple’s heart wasn’t a puzzle to solve, but a mirror to hold”; “a language of shared burdens”) tilt toward direct statement, edging out subtext. The ending’s image—a lullaby in her brother’s handwriting etched into her skin—nicely fuses personal grief and communal healing.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of self-knowledge, moral ambiguity, and the insufficiency of surfaces (“what mirrors don’t show”) are coherently woven through seed, lake, and memory. The final realization—that her darkness coexists with justified self-defense—reweights prior images of the lake’s rage and her own guardedness. However, the closing lines edge toward explicit thematic statement (“She had discovered what mirrors don’t show—not just the darkness within her, but the strength to carry it.”), which flattens some subtext. A slightly more image-driven, less declarative ending would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thematic threads of scars as both wound and key, fear as mirror, and the “intersection of dreams as choice” recur coherently from early imagery to final realization. The doubled self on the thorn throne and the vanished/reappeared Labyrinth embody ideas about self-confrontation, temporality, and covenant fairly well. Some lines verge on thesis statement (“The intersection of dreams wasn’t a place—it was a choice”), edging toward explicitness rather than leaving room for the image to do the work. The ending is resonant and conceptually satisfying, but not yet deeply unsettling or multilayered enough for the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of regret, doubt as a corrective to certainty, and “inlaying meaning” into wounds emerge organically from the ritual and the orchard’s rules. The revaluation of the boy’s death and of her own recklessness is coherent and tied to specific images (ash, the Fool card, the black fruit). However, the story leans into explicit thematic statement—lines like “Your past is ash, but from ash, new growth rises” and the vision reframing her mistakes as “lessons” verge on moralizing and reduce subtext. More reliance on image and implication rather than articulated insight would elevate the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of “what remains after the applause” emerges organically from Lenny’s past, the Echo Valley failure, and the quarry-as-afterlife setting. The idea that value lies in preserving failed or forgotten stories rather than just pricing objects is strong and coherently threaded. However, lines like “He’d mastered the art of insulating himself emotionally with facts” and “not in appraising others’ failures, but in resurrecting forgotten stories” edge toward explicit thesis statement, reducing some subtext. The final talisman image still carries genuine resonance and reweights earlier details.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of transition as reassembly, knowledge as translation, and haunted ambition redirected into growth are coherent and well woven to the core imagery. The recurring motifs of spirals, hums, and roots reinforce the conceptual shift at the end. However, the text often states its themes directly (“The physics of transition were not cold equations, but stories waiting to be retold”), edging toward didactic rather than letting implication do the work. This reduces ambiguity and undercuts some potential resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of identity as a fluid, tidal process and of contradiction as a source of wonder are strongly developed through recurring images (tides, creel, feather, fish→bird). However, some thematic statements are quite explicit—“By accepting contradictions, you’ll preserve the wonder in routine” and “Smelting isn’t destruction. It’s transformation.”—which edges toward didactic rather than fully emergent. The final conceptual repricing (“after tomorrow disappears, we build new tomorrows…”) is resonant and ties the world’s premise to an ongoing ethic. Overall, the piece is thematically coherent and affecting, but a touch less spelled-out would heighten subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of isolation versus connection, walls versus permeability, and the afterlife of regret are well woven through pearls, shells, bunkers, and the cave-lattice. The imagery does strong thematic work, but the prose leans into explicit statement (“remind the world of its capacity for connection,” “dissolve the walls between hearts”) that edges toward sermonizing. The ending achieves a gentle, hopeful resonance, yet it resolves into a fairly tidy moral without much lingering ambiguity or moral grit. Subtext exists, but the text often names what the images already imply.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The river/forgiveness/memory motif is cohesive and resonates across graffiti, Mara’s vocation, and the final “Begin” image. Thematic throughline—that healing is a current requiring surrender and ongoing movement—is clear and emotionally grounded in her actions (kneeling by the river, re-mapping her heart). However, some theme is delivered in fairly explicit thesis sentences (“all pointed to a single truth: healing required surrender”), edging toward didactic rather than fully implicit. The ending still carries a felt, quiet charge, but trimming overt statements would give subtext more room.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    Ideas about unsaid truths, non-linear time, and meaning “in the spaces between” are threaded through the watch, the cyclic cipher, and the blank-then-revealed pages. The final image gestures toward a reweighting of what language and silence can be. Yet these remain more conceptual than emotionally dramatized, so the thematic resonance is intriguing rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of power, destiny’s gaps, and the ethics of choosing empire versus personal life emerge organically from objects and actions (coffee divination, perforated destiny, plants’ warnings). The repeated “propagate” and the mulberry stain figure the idea of what we allow to spread—ambition, life, ache—without overt moralizing. The ending reweights everything as Lira chooses to propagate in herself rather than in imperial reality, turning refusal into a costly, meaningful stance. A hint of explicit phrasing (“To weigh a dream against an empire...”) nudges close to thesis, but remains supported by concrete scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of beauty versus oblivion, preservation of the ephemeral, and stillness as an active canvas emerge organically from the mechanics of her work and the closing reflection on the threshold. The image of captured echoes in emerald chips, and the idea that “even in the face of oblivion, beauty could endure,” read as earned rather than tacked-on. There is a touch of explicitness in the final paragraphs, but it stops short of didactic moralizing and maintains image-driven resonance. The thematic calculus is thoughtful, if not especially ambivalent or morally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of forgiveness, rebirth, and contentment are coherent, and the hairpin/shell motifs offer a tangible throughline that supports the idea of cycles and return. Lirael’s final realization does reweight earlier events and gives the ending a gentle resonance. Yet the piece leans into explicit thesis statements (“Forgiveness…was not a weakness but a seed”; “Contentment…wasn’t a destination”) that edge toward moralizing rather than trusting subtext. That explicitness and the tidy reconciliation blunt some potential complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece has a coherent, appealing theme about doubt as a filter rather than an enemy, tied to tangible objects (cloak, chimes, mirror). The final movement—Mira choosing her chimes—offers a non-literal answer that reweights earlier material. Yet several lines slide into direct thesis statements (“Doubt isn’t the enemy”; “Crazy is refusing to listen”), which undercut subtext. The thematic frame is strong but a bit over-articulated for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme is strong: knowledge as something earned, vanishing as “becoming” rather than disappearance, and the ethics of withholding truth from a student. The pond’s patterns, the delayed revelation, and Elara’s silence all braid into that core idea without feeling like pure thesis. Some lines verge on explicit statement of meaning (“vanishing was not about leaving but about arriving”), which slightly flattens subtext. Still, the final moment of Lira’s partial understanding resonates and reweights what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The thematic throughline—alignment with larger patterns versus futile striving—is coherent and supported by motifs (birds, figure-eight, echoes, pulse). However, the story leans into explicit statement: lines like “The pulse wasn’t something to be chased or captured; it was a guide” border on thesis exposition. Subtext is present in the imagery of bone towers and dwindling people, but these resonances aren’t fully exploited to complicate the insight. The ending feels a bit didactic and tidy rather than unsettling or richly ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.5)
    The thematic throughline (sacredness in overlooked simplicity versus mechanized creativity) is coherent and well-seeded through images of the garden, the relics, and the automated spells. Yet it’s undercut by explicit thesis statements: “He’d come seeking the sacred in the simple” and “the sacred wasn’t hidden in impossibilities, but in the willingness to see beauty…” flatten what could be subtext. The final realization tracks with prior events but lands closer to a moral than an earned, lingering ambiguity. More reliance on image (e.g., the transformed garden) and less on direct statement would significantly strengthen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, grief, and promises “made in light” are well-integrated with the motifs of lanterns, luminous vows, and the color of sound, and the final realization (“I see you now…not to Lila, but to himself”) offers a resonant answer to the opening longing. Subtextually, the lamplighter who “carries light” but lives in shadow dovetails with his self-deception and late self-recognition. The main drag is a tendency toward explicit thematizing (“Sound is the color of memory,” “The color of sound wasn’t a fixed thing—it was a language of the heart”), which edges close to thesis statement rather than leaving more space for implication.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of signal vs. noise, purpose vs. entropy, and prophecy-as-mirror are coherent and woven through recurring images (static bursts, coins, wavelength, alignment). The idea that the universe is calibrating itself rather than ending is a strong reweighting of the premise. However, several thematic insights are stated overtly (“The backwards prophecy wasn’t about…”) rather than left to emerge fully from image and action, blunting subtlety. The closing rebirth note is evocative but edges close to tidy reassurance.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—naming fear, the ethics of remembrance, sacrifice as giving shape to the shapeless—arises coherently from the events and recurring images (prism, atlas, echoes). However, the story undercuts some subtlety with explicit thesis-like lines (“The echo of sacrifice…wasn’t just about loss. It was about giving shape to the shapeless, voice to the voiceless.”). The Lira thread deepens the theme, tying cosmic horror to personal failure and responsibility. Overall resonance is strong but would benefit from trusting image and implication more and commentary less.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of devotion vs. madness, human attempts to mend an exhausted world, and the value of imperfect repair emerge organically from Elias’s choices and the environment. The bell and sea function as thematic engines: brittle relics still capable of work, echoing his “earnestly naive” faith. The final sense of “enough for now” is emotionally clean and avoids a neat fix, though the closing articulation of “fragile, flawed, earnestly naive kind of faith” flirts with spelling out the thesis. Overall, resonance is strong but not yet haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of memory, communal narrative, and “precisely humane” vigilance emerge organically from Mara’s work, Elias’s project, and the resurfacing town, culminating in the reconfiguration of photographs from private exorcism to shared map. The motifs of the sapphire liqueur, drowned distillery, and photographs support an exploration of what it means to keep a place alive once it’s physically gone. However, phrases like “spin stories into shared meaning” and “the precisely humane act of remembering” state the thesis a bit too directly, edging toward gloss rather than pure subtext. The ending image still carries a genuine emotional aftereffect despite this mild over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of balance, paradox, and the reconciliation of reason and wonder emerge organically from Elara’s background and her method of working with the crystal. The starling, flame, and formula provide concrete images that echo these ideas. However, the story frequently states its thesis outright—“to harmonize logic and intuition was not to choose between them, but to let them collide”—which flattens subtext and edges toward didacticism. The ending is emotionally honest but leans more on explained insight than on a quietly reweighted image.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of trust, inheritance, and transforming duty into chosen covenant emerge coherently from the events and recurring images (the buckle, the forest’s “language,” the mother’s last word). The final reframing—“This place wasn’t a prison—it was a covenant” and “His mother’s trust wasn’t a burden—it was a language”—is clear and emotionally satisfying but verges on didactic, saying the thesis outright rather than fully trusting subtext. The symbolic network (light, patterns, muscle memory, listening) is consistent and gives some resonance beyond the literal plot. Complexity is somewhat limited; there’s little moral ambiguity or tension about the cost of accepting this covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of identity, autonomy, fear, and integration versus erasure emerge naturally from the clone premise and the ego-death backstory. However, the story often states its themes outright (“This wasn’t just a battle for custody—it was a battle for his soul”; “You’re not a duplicate, you’re a choice”) instead of trusting subtext and image. The final repricing of “duplicate” into “choice” is conceptually strong but a touch on-the-nose for a top-tier literary venue. There is some complexity in the idea that what he “could’ve been” is annihilated, but the moral calculus remains relatively tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of surrendering control, embracing the unknown, and “flow” versus force are coherent and integrated with his identity as a puzzle-maker. The final insight—that the mystery lies in the flow, not the seed—is thematically apt and retroactively reframes his investigative methods. However, those lines edge toward explicit statement, approaching platitude rather than letting image alone carry the weight. The resonance is genuine but not subtle enough for a higher literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of grief, neglect, and the labor of tending to unspoken joys emerge organically from the images of dust, silence, and recovered laughter. The notion that joy leaves traces that can be reanimated by care is moving and conceptually coherent with the “conductor” conceit. The ending risks mild sentimentality with “He had done it” and explicit validation of his symphony, rather than trusting the final image to carry meaning. Still, the story leaves a resonant emotional aftertaste grounded in its particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of liminality, uncertainty as habitat, and light-as-boundary emerge organically from the mist, the veil-of-sleep frame, and Mara’s worldview. The final reconfiguration of “boundaries of light” into “doors” coherently reweights earlier images. That said, lines like “uncertainty? That was just another word for home” come close to thesis statements, nudging the piece toward mild didacticism instead of letting the images shoulder the whole load.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of creative destruction, destiny versus choice, and the cost of being a “bridge between chaos and order” arise organically from Kael’s situation and the crozier’s restoration. The final beats—his scars and frayed mind alongside newfound freedom—offer a resonant, non-literal answer about the necessity and price of self-altering change. That said, some lines state the thesis a bit too directly (“Creative destruction wasn’t a theory. It was a choice.”), edging into prompt-like articulation rather than pure emergence from image and action. Trimming or submerging those explicit formulations would heighten subtext and ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of silence as potential and endings as beginnings are coherent and well-seeded through the “hush” and the decayed city, and the final transformation image supports them. However, the story leans into explicit statement—“The beginning wasn’t a point in time, but a state of being” and “endings were merely doorways, and silence was the key”—which edges into didactic summary rather than allowing the images to carry the weight. The conceptual resonance is pleasant but familiar, offering limited ambiguity or moral complexity. The thematic arc feels more like a polished thesis than a discovery that truly strains or complicates the character.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of liminality, completion vs. salvation, and the cost of being a bridge are well-embodied in the ferry, the hourglass, and the merged commuters’ fates. The closing idea of Kael as “a temporary guardian of a permanent transient moment” effectively reframes the entire narrative in terms of accepting dissolution for others’ closure. The Hourglass constellation and the emptied glass reappear in a way that genuinely reweights prior images. A few lines verge on overt thesis-statement (“the ferry had been a bridge…”) but overall the resonance is earned and not purely declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of connection, perception, and the partnership of logic and magic are coherent and integrated with the imagery of thread, mirrors, and webs. However, they’re articulated too explicitly at the end (“That… was the truest form of enchantment,” “She’d found her truth”), tipping into moralizing rather than letting the images carry the weight. Subtext is present in the contrast between chaos and order and in the unsettling/peaceful balance, but the piece often explains its insights instead of trusting the reader. The result is resonant but somewhat didactic rather than haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of adaptation, grounding versus exploration, and finding meaning in shifting “horizons” are coherent and supported by recurring images (aliens’ trails, edge geometry, the chain link). The story invites some reflection on how tools and principles persist amid change. However, key ideas are often voiced directly—“That is the beauty of edge geometry”—rather than left to subtext, lending a faintly didactic feel. The final image has gentle resonance but stops short of a deeply surprising or reweighting insight.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of listening, grief, and small-scale “incidental heroism” emerge coherently from the premise and Lila’s actions, and the final echo of stories that “weren’t meant to end” has genuine resonance. Yet the piece leans into overt statement—“Sometimes love is too big for words. But it’s never too late to hear it.” and “Incidental heroism… wasn’t about grand gestures.”—that reads as moralizing rather than fully earned subtext. The emotional effect is touching but veers toward sentimentality, smoothing away potential complexity in grief, regret, or doubt. Strong thematic bones, but the articulation could trust image and implication more.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, presence, and making the invisible visible emerge organically from the undersea cables, the gold fleck, and the brother’s vanished dive. The final realization that the cables are “memorials, etching the unremembered into the ocean’s skin” meaningfully reweights previous details into a coherent, haunting concept. However, that sentence borders on explicit thesis-statement, slightly reducing the subtlety of the thematic work. The piece still leaves a resonant emotional aftereffect tied to grief and witness.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of failure, liminality (alive/dead), and errors as bridges rather than flaws are clearly woven through the imagery of ink, ghosts in code, and the observatory. The final reframe of the digital ghost as “a compass” solidifies the thematic answer. That said, the closing paragraphs lean into explicit statement (“even in failure, there was wisdom. Even in error, there was truth.”), edging toward moralizing instead of trusting subtext. The resonance is present and coherent but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of extinction, preservation of language, and the idea that some “languages” (like the curse) are experiential rather than verbal are well woven through the diamond, the bone runes, and her vocation. The curse-as-mirror reframes the premise nicely, and the last line about languages meant to be felt, not spoken, offers a resonant conceptual answer. The shouted “I am the extinction!” edges toward thesis-statement territory and slightly flattens an otherwise nuanced exploration. Still, the imagery and events, rather than explicit moralizing, carry most of the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of guilt, confession, and wild vs. civilized harmony emerge organically through the confessions, the garden, and the cryptid’s philosophy (“Harmony isn’t tamed. It’s played.”). The arrowhead’s spiral and her shift from researcher to something more ambiguous offer a resonant, non-didactic answer: integration rather than mastery. The missing choosing to stay complicates moral binaries without the text sermonizing. A few lines—particularly the final “not as a researcher”—edge toward thesis-statement territory, but they remain grounded enough in her arc to avoid feeling like a moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of mechanization vs living beauty and control vs chaos emerge organically from the statue-orchard dynamic and Lira’s music-driven rebellion. The recurring emphasis on cracks, cores, and scheduled nature supports an implicit argument about suppressed wildness needing space. However, the explicit statement “breaking free wasn’t about destruction… about letting go of the illusion of control” tips into direct moralizing and slightly flattens what had been richly suggestive. The resonance is still strong, but the final paragraph explains what the images already show.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of connection across borders, the power of small rebellious acts, and the possibility of healing in liminal spaces arise organically from the premise and recurring imagery (“link the absences,” the arcade lighting back up). The final images—the softened hush, humming tune, and his lighter steps—support a resonant, quiet hope. That said, the story leans into explicit statement—“healing wasn’t in grand gestures or treaties” and similar lines—that tip toward moralizing rather than staying purely in image and implication. This decreases ambiguity and dampens some of the afterglow a top-tier literary venue would want.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of silence as potential, beauty in ruin, and renewal through gentle creation are coherent and well-linked to recurring images (halo, wind bells, oasis courtyard). The ending image of a “different silence” nicely reweights the premise. However, the thematic statement becomes somewhat explicit and didactic in lines like “Elio’s motivation had always been to find beauty in the quiet” and “silence wasn’t an end. It was a beginning,” which reduces subtext. The piece invites reflection but leans toward tidy moral rather than lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of analog vs digital memory, stories as living entities, and “visualizing the impossible” through strange geometries emerge naturally from Eleanor’s worldview and the library’s design. Recurring images—the scarf, hyperbolic diagrams, and the final transformed library atmosphere—support a cohesive idea that stories transform both space and people. Some lines edge toward explicit thesis (“They don’t just inform—they transform,” “The line between madness and genius is a Mobius strip”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the ending’s quiet charge—her decision to “continue”—offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—longing as an internal cipher and the futility of trying to “pin down” absence—is well woven through motif (light, shipwrecks, drowned hymns, painter of absences). The dream’s line (“I’ve been chasing you”) and dissolution into “a thousand particles of light” reweight everything toward self-recognition. However, the closing paragraphs tip into explicit thematic statement (“it was not a thing to capture, but a force to embrace… that… was enough”), edging toward moral summary rather than trusting the images to carry meaning. The piece still invites reflection, but some subtlety is sacrificed at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of secrecy, fear, and the possibility that truth can heal are woven through the locket, the nexus, and Elias’s final realization. The recurring images (stars, the lock of hair, the nexus) support a coherent thematic pattern. However, the story sometimes states its ideas too directly (“secrets, like stars, were meant to be seen”; “some secrets, once spoken, could heal rather than harm”), edging toward moralizing rather than fully trusting subtext. The resonance is genuine but lacks the layered ambiguity expected at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of memory, folklore as a form of recovery, and places as thresholds between past and present emerge organically from objects and actions (mushrooms as keys, broken constellations as fractured memories, the greenhouse as bridge). The ending’s realization that “the memories were never gone. Just… misplaced” nicely reframes the premise. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“not as a tomb, but as a bridge”; “someone who believed in stories”), edging toward mild moralizing rather than pure image-driven resonance. Even so, the piece leaves a clear aftertaste of quiet, earned wonder rather than a neat lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of exile-as-preservation, resilience, and the necessity of facing avoided truths are woven coherently through Lirael’s history, her backwards walking, the tea-leaf geometry, and the advice to retrace steps. The final image of shifting light/“shadow caught in glass” offers a satisfying conceptual answer: change becomes possible when one confronts the path that led to loss. There is some slight overtness in lines like “Exile is reversible,” but the piece avoids outright sermonizing and lets images carry much of the weight. The ambiguity about what sacrifice will be required keeps the thematic field from collapsing into a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of conservation, renewal, and wonder as a non-finite resource are coherent and organically tied to the orchard and heirloom seed. The dream injunction to “capture the essence of what’s lost, and plant it where it can grow anew” threads into the final realization about wonder’s continuity. However, the closing paragraphs lean toward explicit statement—“wonder was not a finite thing” and “she knew now that…”—which flattens some potential resonance that might have been carried by image alone. The piece invites reflection, but the thematic answer is somewhat tidy and declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of silence as both shield and prison is well-rooted in the net, the sanctuary’s accumulation, and the fisherman’s refusal to name his lover. Mara’s final stance—choosing to “listen” rather than merely “fix”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question about what to do with inherited hush. Some thematic lines (“silence isn’t always kindness”) veer into explicit statement rather than letting the particulars do all the work. Still, the conceptual reweighting of silence versus speech at the end is clear and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story’s thematic core—silence as language and empathy, borders as invitations rather than divisions—is coherently woven through maps, films, chants, and the henge. The final reconfiguration of the “tear” and “chapel” is resonant and reframes earlier details. However, the last section edges into explicit thesis (“To reopen the chapel meant to listen past the noise, to find empathy in the unsaid”), which undercuts subtext in favor of spelled-out meaning. The piece is thoughtful but slightly over-articulated where a lighter touch would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of grief, entropy, persistence of memory, and the impossibility of clean “letting go” are well-integrated through recurrent images (ocean, snow globe, white noise hum) and Elara’s professional focus. The reframing—letting go as transmission rather than erasure, a phase transition rather than an end—nicely reweights earlier material, especially around her mother’s disappearance. That said, several key sentences state the theme very directly (“The physics of letting go wasn’t about release. It was about transmission.”), edging toward essayistic exposition. The piece retains resonance, but a bit more reliance on image and less on thesis language would deepen its literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of mediated communication, memory, and the hope that something (or someone) will carry what we can’t say aloud emerge organically from the plate, the graffiti messages, and the ghost in code. The brother’s storm-death and the encoded “I forgive you” provide the strongest thematic charge, gesturing at grief and forgiveness via action rather than thesis. The final “maybe” about the needs finding their way home preserves some ambiguity but leans slightly sentimental. Overall, the resonance is genuine and coherent, if not startlingly deep.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of joy vs. anguish, ice vs. flame, and prison vs. lens are tightly woven through objects and setting, and Mara’s final assertion that the flame “still burns” gives a resonant emotional answer. However, the story undercuts its own subtext by stating its thesis several times in direct, almost didactic language (“He believed joy and anguish are twins,” and “The joy beneath anguish is a flame no ice can smother”). This reduces complexity and invites a slightly pat interpretation. The underlying ideas are strong; they would benefit from more implication and less explicit articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, loss, and the persistence of absence (“spooled wholeness”) are organically tied to her vocation and her mother’s death, and the final drift image carries real resonance. However, key thematic lines are stated rather baldly—“Clouds are not weather. They are the sky’s memory.”—and the explicit “To memorialize:” journal entry edges into thesis territory. The piece still invites reflection on how we read emptiness and grief, but some of the emotional and conceptual work is told rather than allowed to emerge. The complexity is there, just slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of preservation, limits, and mirroring the sky inside walls are coherently woven through the guild’s star-map calendar, the secret journal, and Lira’s final painting and theft of the safe. The final realization that “they couldn’t save their home, but they could ensure their knowledge outlived it” makes for a resonant conceptual repricing of what preservation means. Some thematic lines are a bit explicit and expository, slightly flattening what could be left to image and implication, which holds this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of curiosity as compass, charting the unknown, and “light trapped between worlds” come through organically via images (murmurations, hopscotch map, portal) rather than explicit moralizing. The phrase “not just a place, but a truth” gestures toward a larger conceptual repricing of what mapping and discovery mean. That said, the truth itself is somewhat generic—ancient cities, forgotten wars, light and darkness in harmony—and its cost or ethical edge are only sketched, not dramatized. The piece invites some reflection but stops short of a lingering, complex aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of repair, time, legacy, and self-mending are coherent and supported by recurrent images (gears, clocks, mirrors, frozen time). The father backstory and the final ticking clock nicely frame the idea that fixing the world and oneself are intertwined. However, the last paragraph edges into explicit thesis-statement mode (“The rhythm of repair…wasn’t just about…”) which flattens subtext. The resonance is real but somewhat over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of collective effort, environmental stewardship, and hope as communal rather than solitary are coherent and organically related to Elara’s motive and the nebula/bell motifs. The closing line about hope being “a garden, tended by many hands” nicely echoes the orchard imagery. However, the story often states its themes outright (“The nebula of respite is not just a phenomenon... It is a promise”; “hope was not a solitary pursuit—it was a garden”), tipping into moralizing rather than letting subtext carry the weight. This directness flattens complexity and limits lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—flaws as conduits for grace, endings as lullabies rather than cataclysms—is strongly embedded in objects (cracked puppet, rusted lighthouse, pane fractals) and Mara’s arc. The recurrence of “cracks” and lullaby imagery culminates in a satisfying conceptual repricing of doomsday. However, several key lines state the thesis directly (“Perfection is a lie,” “the end wasn’t an ending”) in ways that verge on platitude, slightly undercutting subtext. More reliance on image and implication at the very end would deepen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of burdened duty, cyclical obligation, and a kind of damaged grace in imperfect rescue work emerge organically from Kael’s role and the “graceless beauty” of his path-marking. The orchard’s curse as a living system that demands protection of others at personal cost gives the piece a resonant moral texture without overt moralizing. The ending’s notion that “the curse was satisfied—for now” nicely reweights earlier images (roots, frost, shifting paths) as part of an ongoing, exploitative equilibrium. It’s strong but not quite profound; there’s room for a sharper, more surprising repricing of what this duty means to Kael personally.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—translating separation into connection, divergence as collaboration—is strongly woven through rivers, foam, chrysalis, and the sisters’ music. The final reweighting (their lives echoing the braided rivers) is emotionally satisfying and conceptually coherent. Yet the story often states its thesis directly (“separation isn’t an end. It’s a prelude to connection”; “atonement wasn’t about erasing the past”), edging into moralizing where image and scene could have sufficed. This explicitness and tidiness of lesson keep the thematic work from feeling fully organic and layered.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—beginnings as absences, the value of voids and fragile potentials—is well integrated through jars, the man’s request, and the returning note. The story meaningfully reweights “nothingness” as a generative space rather than lack. However, some lines edge toward explicit thesis (“She understood: stories didn’t begin in grand gestures or dramatic events”), which flirts with didacticism instead of trusting implication. The resonance lingers, but the insight feels a touch told rather than entirely earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of remorse, burden-sharing, and transforming pain into nourishment emerge organically from images (rain, coral prison, broth, onions) rather than explicit moralizing. Nessar’s act of diluting guilt and then cooking for the fortress gives a non-literal but clear answer: we cannot erase history, but we can redistribute and soften its edges. The final line edges toward statement (“sometimes, he thought, that was enough”) but is sufficiently grounded in concrete action to avoid sentimentality. The piece embraces complexity about whether the remorse is “gone” or merely carried differently.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of empathy, communication across divides, and turning silos into bridges are coherent and sustained through recurring images (grain, language, weights, time). However, they are articulated very directly—“constructing bridges from silos,” “stories, like grain, must flow freely to nourish”—so subtext often becomes text, especially in Elara’s final speech. The ending offers a clear conceptual answer but verges on sermonizing rather than allowing resonance to arise primarily from image and action. As a result, the thematic effect is lucid and sincere but less subtle and layered than top-tier literary work demands.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of fracture-as-pathway, abandoned dreams, and rewiring reality through memory are strongly woven through imagery (cracked mirror, canyon symbols, failed project) and action. The idea of becoming an “archeologist of abandoned dreams” is thematically rich and reappears in the closure in a satisfying way. Some articulation borders on thesis statement (“not by digging through dirt, but by rewiring reality itself”), which slightly flattens subtext. Still, the piece invites reflection on memory, failure, and transformation without collapsing into simple moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of vigilance, marginalia, and hidden combinations accumulate nicely through concrete particulars like doodles, keys, and threshold effects, and the final image of Lira as “keeper of thresholds” aligns with those motifs. However, the closing paragraphs edge toward abstract statement (“not in grand gestures, but in the margins”) instead of letting the images do all the work, which slightly flattens the resonance. The story’s insights are coherent but relatively tidy and low-friction. A more conflicted or ambivalent realization would deepen the thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of persistence, listening beyond auditory sound, and art as empathetic translation from pain into music arise organically from Elara’s actions and the grove’s transformation. Recurring motifs—the stump’s stress cracks, the silent world, the insulator as bridge—shift meaning by the end, suggesting that music is a way of reading and honoring damage. The emotional aftereffect is warmly melancholic and hopeful rather than didactic. The final line edges close to overt moral (“refused to let the world forget how to listen”), which slightly flattens otherwise rich subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme—beauty found in constraint and difficulty, and the subtle fulfillment of forgotten promises—is woven through the queen’s diagonal, the “silence that speaks in stones,” and the understated revival of the covenant. The chess metaphor feels organic to Alaric’s mind and dovetails with the eclipse and constellations-as-board in a satisfying way. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“The covenant lived, not in grand revelations but in the quiet correlation of silence and stone”), slightly over-stating what the images already convey. Still, the final sapling with mirror-leaves offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    The thematic throughline about silence as a language and empathy as “tuning into the frequencies of others” is coherent and well-seeded in images like the radio, the clasp, and the fireworks. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis in near-essayistic lines (“The path to empathy, she realized, was not paved with words…”) that edge into didactic moralizing. Subtext exists but gets overshadowed by explicit commentary, reducing ambiguity and emotional after-echo. The insight feels true to the material yet a bit pre-digested for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The themes of patience, quiet wisdom, and the kinship of chaos and serenity are clear and organically linked to the seed’s growth and Lira’s process. However, they’re frequently articulated in abstract, thesis-like language (“Wisdom grows in the hush, not the roar”; “her every action a testament to the undercurrent of wisdom”), reducing room for subtext and ambiguity. The corpse flower’s pungent bloom as an image of harmony born from rot is strong, but the ending drifts toward moral summary rather than trusting that image to carry the weight. The piece invites reflection but lands closer to parable than layered literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of resilience as adaptive symbiosis and “listening” to a living archive emerge organically from the plant behavior and the arches’ function. The gathering-of-echoes idea is conceptually strong, but the story undercuts itself by slipping into explicit moralizing: “She hadn’t found a machine to exploit, but a truth to protect” and “The orchard planet wasn’t fragile. It was a symphony…”. These lines summarize the thesis instead of trusting image and implication, flattening what could be more nuanced resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of emergent systems, human limits in the face of complex infrastructures, and the danger of under-modeled environments emerge organically from Anya’s work and the port’s behavior. The patch and port-as-machine motifs give the final realization some resonance. The last line (“some machines, once awakened, never truly sleep”) flirts with overt thesis-statement territory but remains supported by particulars. The piece invites reflection more than it interrogates a morally complex choice, keeping it strong but not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece has a strong, coherent thematic throughline about wonder, art, and truth as essential forces that animate dead matter and thaw emotional coldness. The prism-song, sculpted hush, and sculptor’s awakening work together to dramatize this rather than merely assert it. That said, the theme is also voiced explicitly in lines like “Wonder isn’t a luxury” and “truth…is essential,” which nudge it toward didacticism and reduce ambiguity. The ending resonates, but it offers a fairly tidy moral rather than a more complex or unsettling reweighing.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of failure, surrender, and the limits of seeking redemption through control emerge organically from Kael’s arc and the flute’s function as “door, not mirror.” The recurrent contrast between thunder/echo vs hush, sound vs silence, and markers vs choices builds a layered meditation on how one lives with past mistakes. However, the mentor’s didactic lines and the near-proverb at the end push toward overt statement, edging into mild moralizing rather than leaving more space for the images to carry the insight. The piece still leaves a resonant aftertaste, but with less ambiguity than a top-tier literary venue might prefer.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of emotion versus rationalization emerges organically from Elias’s methods and their failure, not from authorial lecturing. The shard-as-mirror motif and Veyra’s earlier warning are effectively reweighted at the end when Elias finally “sees” and no longer needs to borrow personalities. Lines like “Emotions weren’t variables; they were wildfires” hover close to aphorism but are earned by the intense experiential beat that precedes them. The piece stops short of glib moralizing and leaves room for complexity in how intellect and feeling might now coexist.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The seed/germination motif coherently embodies the theme that brief encounters and absences can take root and transform the present. The final realization that “Kail…had been the soil” is thematically apt and reweights prior moments, but it veers toward explicit thesis-statement. Lines like “Some truths are seeds” and “Her lessons…they’d all been seeds” make the subtext a bit too literal. Still, the piece leaves a resonant emotional aftertaste about mentorship, memory, and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematic throughline—projection vs reality, the hunger for validation, objects as mirrors not repositories—is coherent and emerges naturally from the experiment’s failure. The reversal that the prism distorts rather than reveals is a strong thematic pivot. Some lines verge on explicit moralizing (“The arbor’s hush wasn’t a mystery to solve, but a mirror to her own yearning for validation”), slightly flattening subtext. The ending is resonant but could trust image and implication more.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: mending silence through attention to broken things, sacrifice as the price of connection, and craft as a form of communication across time. The recurring motifs (loom, bead(s), puzzle, silence as material) are well-integrated and clearly reweighted in the ending, especially when she “spins” silence itself. The travelers’ later testimony and the distant children’s laughter offer a resonant, non-didactic answer to the story’s central question about whether her solitary work matters. A touch less overt mythic summarizing at the end (“became legend”) and more lived-in specificity in that final paragraph would deepen the subtext further.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of resilience, enduring pain to heal a larger body, and the idea that “magic” is actually a form of confronting buried damage are coherent and supported by the mines and fractured core imagery. However, several lines (“Resilience isn’t born from safety,” “bartered awakening wasn’t just about magic”) state the theme almost thesis-like, reducing subtext and ambiguity. The barter motif (horseshoe for silk, Jorin’s blood for planetary revival) is promising but underdeveloped; it’s asserted more than dramatized as a moral calculus. The ending image—Jorin’s quiet smile and renewed orchards—resonates, but it settles into a nearly moralistic uplift without much lingering complication.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of truth vs. acceptance, doors that shouldn’t be opened, and the weight of withheld knowledge emerge coherently from the shard, the mother’s disappearance, and Kael’s ultimate choice. The final conceptual rephrasing of truth as “a thread, weaving through every choice” ties neatly to his profession and the multiverse motif. Some thematic material is stated rather than allowed to resonate (“The truth wasn’t a thing to be found—it was a thread...”), edging toward mild moralizing. Still, the ending leaves a tangible sense of relinquishment and modest, earned peace.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of endurance, communal memory, and how small rituals “bottle” safety emerge organically from the objects and actions (stones, glass, letters) rather than pure exposition. The anonymous chain becomes a quiet answer to what remains when institutional safety (the lamp) fails. A few explicit formulations (“a new kind of light glowed—not of flame, but of connection, of shared hope”) edge toward on-the-nose abstraction, softening the lingering ambiguity. Still, the final image of warmly held glass and luminescent ache carries a genuine, earned emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of ancient vs algorithmic ways of knowing, light/dark interdependence, and dawn as an act of choice emerge coherently from the imagery and her role. The line “the dawn wasn’t just a time of day. It was a choice” tips into explicit thesis-statement territory, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the final image of her steadying into her small but meaningful role gives a modest conceptual repricing of “keeping the light” in a data-driven world. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t push into morally or emotionally thorny territory that would deepen its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—about bodies and hearts as vessels for stories, the peril and necessity of beauty, and who becomes a magnet for narrative—emerges coherently from the transplant, the wing, and the tea house as sanctuary. The morpho wing as “iridescent caution” is a strong thematic object. That said, the story occasionally explains its insights too directly (“She realized then that the donor heart had not just given her a second chance at life”), edging toward essayistic paraphrase instead of letting images fully carry the load. The ending resonates but feels a bit didactic for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of sorrow as measurable, transformable, and inherently bound up with beauty and maintenance are coherent and organically tied to the imagery of light, decay, and repair. The final insight—“even in decay, there was beauty. Even in loss, there was light.”—is emotionally apt but edges toward explicit moralizing and familiar phrasing. Some thematic statements (“This was the mundane miracle of his job”) tell what the scenes already imply. The resonance is genuine but could benefit from more subtext and less direct articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of communal memory, the necessity of shadow, and stories/songs knitting a world together emerge organically from the mechanics of the orchard and mirror realms. However, the text undercuts some subtlety by stating its thesis almost directly (“Through forgotten songs, we remember how to live”; “The mirror world was not lost. It was simply waiting…”). The closing image of a seed in winter and the realm learning to “swaddle itself in the warmth of its own history” is resonant, if slightly sentimental. Overall, the piece invites reflection but leans into explicit affirmation over complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of grief, imperfection, and the wisdom found in mistakes are coherent and threaded via objects (invitation, letters, mirrors) and setting. However, they are often stated directly—“Wisdom lies in mistakes,” “To find peace, you must first admit you’re lost”—rather than fully entrusted to subtext. The ending image of Eleanor staying, wrapped in the library’s tranquility, does carry emotional resonance and a non-literal answer about hiding versus revealing. The piece verges on sentimental and didactic at moments, which flattens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of sacredness in the mundane, resistance to normalization, and “tenuous absolution” are well seeded in the bread, the guerrilla garden, and the map-of-cracks idea. The final understanding—that creeping normality is a guide to where the extraordinary leaks through—is conceptually satisfying and reweights earlier details. However, several lines state the thesis outright (“The creeping normality wasn’t something to fear—it was a map,” “absolution wasn’t a destination but a process”), tipping into mild didacticism and reducing subtext. The piece resonates, but a lighter touch on explicit statements would heighten its literary charge.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of preservation, the binding power of promises, and “conjuring meaning from the edge of oblivion” emerge organically from Elara’s work with the vows and the precarious library. The luminous oaths functioning as literal infrastructure for the world’s memory is a strong, implicit conceptual through-line. The ending—in which painstaking reconstruction momentarily revives a dying system—offers a resonant, if somewhat straightforward, affirmation of archival/interpretive labor. It’s thematically coherent and emotionally honest, but the ambiguity and complexity expected at top-tier venues are only moderately present.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of trust, silence, and inherited moral economies are well woven through the watch, the father’s maxim about hush, and the buyer’s fetishization of “the sound of trust breaking.” The final image of the cracked yet working watch reweights the father’s legacy into something uneasy but livable rather than neatly redeemed. A few lines (“Trust’s a currency here… silence? That’s the gold standard.”) sit close to explicit thesis but are anchored as character speech, so they mostly avoid feeling didactic. The story invites reflection without dictating a moral, though it doesn’t quite reach a hauntingly complex ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: skepticism versus belief, the burden of absorbing versus releasing pain, and the idea that both people and places carry weather. The forests’ elections and the compass’s shift from people to “moments” deepen a meditation on balance and the cost of release without sliding into moralizing. Kael’s final taste of “lavender and regret” gives a clean, understated emotional and thematic aftertaste. The piece could press a bit harder on the ethical or personal cost of that balance to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of repression vs. expression, doors and locks around memory and voice, and the persistence of one’s “calling” emerge organically from the recurring objects and images. The cave, the lock, the canvas, and the grandmother’s line about doors and voices all cohere into a coherent statement about opening oneself to buried truth. Some phrasing edges toward abstraction or tidy summation (“He had rectified the silence, the suppression, the fear”), trimming complexity rather than deepening it. The resonance is real but not particularly surprising or morally knotty.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of truth vs comforting myth, the afterlife of language, and “hope as necessary fiction” emerge organically from the Archive’s purpose and the lie-detecting quill. The AI’s repurposing of conversations to fuel the domes is a smart metaphor for exploitation of human intimacy. The closing insight—“Candor in small moments. That’s what sustains us.”—states the thesis a bit too directly, edging toward moralizing rather than letting the images (the wilting quill, the seed at the dead oasis) carry it. Still, the final gesture of planting an “empty” orb as a seed gives a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s core question.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—silence versus noise, truth as vibration rather than speech, wonder as something to be continually released—is well woven through recurring images (bells, wind, ice, clouds). The final paragraphs reinforce this, but they lean into explicit thesis statements (“The color of wonder, she knew, was not something to be captured…”) that edge toward sermonizing instead of fully trusting the images. Subtext exists in the contrast between the dull world below and the sanctuary above, yet nuance is partially undercut by overt articulation. Still, the emotional aftereffect is coherent and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    Containment vs transformation of chaos, and the acceptance of “static” as part of a living system, emerges organically from the box, farm, and controlled-burn motif. The final realization—that the goal is not to eradicate static but to live with and be shaped by it—reweights prior images (the dome as box, controlled burns, “strangely organic” data) in a coherent way. Some thematic articulation is a bit explicit (“Maybe that was the secret, she mused…”), edging toward essayistic commentary rather than trusting image alone. Still, the emotional aftereffect is clear and not reducible to a pat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of listening, community memory, and love’s endurance emerge naturally through Clara’s method of solving the mystery by gathering stories rather than forcing the lock. The final discovery of the letters reweights the earlier lore nicely, turning rumors into tangible history. However, the explicit line “She’d solved the mystery, not by force, but by listening” leans toward on-the-nose moralizing, undercutting some subtlety. The piece invites some reflection but settles into a fairly familiar, sentimental register without much complexity or counterpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of vulnerability as strength, legacy, and translating emotion into code/dance are well integrated into objects (dice), actions (mirrored waltz), and the structural puzzle. The final reweighting—Kael embodying the scientist’s philosophy—is conceptually strong, and the spider/web motif gets a nice echo at the end. Yet the story leans on explicit statements (“Vulnerability wasn’t a flaw to be hidden—it was a language…”) that edge into moralizing rather than trusting the images to carry the insight. A touch more subtext and a touch less thesis would elevate the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, loss, and preservation versus erasure are woven through concrete motifs: pockets of gravity, pressed flowers, salt crystals, and the final revelation that “deleted” memories are stored, not destroyed. The pressed wildflowers gaining a new role alongside the pressed rose gives a satisfying thematic echo about love and remembrance. Yet the ending’s articulation—Elias no longer fearing the pockets and taking on a guiding vocation—leans toward a neat, almost reassuring moral. Some ambiguity or cost in that realization (e.g., what it means to live with borrowed or foreign memories) would deepen the subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of silence as language and peace preserved through quiet, deliberate action recur coherently through the crane, the brook, and the “smoothed hush.” However, the piece edges toward tidy moralizing (“The smoothed hush had done its work… the world remained quiet”) without much ambiguity or counterpressure. There is little interrogation of the price of silence or of hushing prophecy; success reaffirms her worldview rather than complicating it. The resonance is pleasant but not deeply surprising or unsettling.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of truth vs. lies, narrative as protection, and “sleeping” histories are coherently woven through their shared fabrications about the library and the final plan to lie to the building itself. The idea that truth is fleeting like meteors is a bit on-the-nose but still works as an image. The ending invites reflection on how stories shape reality without collapsing into sermonizing. It could go deeper by giving at least one on-page consequence or ambivalence about what this new “truth” will unleash.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of isolation, memory as quarantine, and repurposing pain into agency emerge organically from the garden, seashell, and archival imagery, and the final image of her walking into morning with the shell reframes “tragically radiant” as empowered rather than purely defensive. “Quarantined memory” as a concept is strong and resonates with the pandemic-era echo without being over-explained. The piece edges into explicit thesis-stating (“She’d translated her isolation into independence…”) which slightly flattens what is otherwise well-implied. A touch more reliance on image over abstraction in the final paragraphs would deepen subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—rewriting history as an act of forgiveness rather than deception—is well woven through concrete motifs: the thorn that remembers wounds, treaties as “keys with no apparent lock,” and the chains of vengeance she aims to “unlink.” The story occasionally edges toward explicit statement (“Her motivation had always been to forgive the unfinished”), which flattens what is otherwise rich subtext. Still, the final image of her vanishing after depositing the scroll in a redemption niche leaves a strong, resonant sense of quiet, costly grace. Thematic ambiguity is healthy: the efficacy and ethics of her treason remain open to reader judgment.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of memory, unfinished stories, and the persistence of voices in silence are coherent and supported by recurring images (echoes, stone, the universe’s hum). However, they are articulated quite directly in dialogue (“The echoes are not just sound… They are proof that even in silence, something remains”), tipping toward didactic rather than letting subtext carry the load. The final exchange and image do reweight earlier material, but without much ambiguity or counterpressure. Emotional aftereffect is gentle and wistful, more pretty than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of connection across generations, the gentleness of truth-telling, and love persisting beyond death are well woven through the snow globe motif and the dreams. The revaluation of the sailor’s lingering ghost—from presumed torment to enduring love—is an effective thematic turn. Some lines edge toward explicit moralizing (“fragile, enduring threads of connection”) instead of letting images fully carry the weight. Still, the ending leaves a clear, resonant sense of truth as careful, relational work between worlds.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—beauty as hidden labor and patterns in absence—is consistently developed through nets, roots, stitches, the grandfather’s teachings, and the firefly code. The closing realization that “the world’s beauty lay not in its grandeur but in its hidden labor” coheres with prior images but edges into explicit statement, muting some subtext. Still, the story’s particulars (manual work, inherited tools, whispering stones) carry much of the thematic weight without sermonizing. The resonance is genuine but could be sharper if more was implied rather than directly named.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of truth versus comforting myth, the danger of power disguised as curse, and the ethics of sealing versus exploiting anomalous hope emerge organically from events. The orchard and stillpoint function symbolically without feeling forced, particularly in the final image of a damaged world marginally healed. Yet lines like “Comfortable lies had no place here” verge on explicit thesis, undercutting some subtextual power. The ending resonates, but the thematic frame is somewhat neatly tied rather than left in a more troubling or layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of balance between order/chaos, harnessing rather than fearing the storm, and humanity’s fragile salvation emerge coherently from the images and Kael’s trajectory. Recurring motifs (storm, prism, hourglass, prophets’ voices) support a conceptual reweighting at the end where the window becomes a threshold and Kael becomes the storm. However, the piece sometimes edges into overt statement (“humanity’s salvation lay in embracing its own fragility”), softening the subtextual power. The epiphany is more philosophical than emotionally earned, limiting its lingering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of memory, grief, and art as “sweetened” remembrance emerge naturally from the jars, the lullaby, and the villagers’ reactions. The idea of being a “translator between generations” is organically dramatized in how children and the old woman respond to the box. Some phrasing edges toward explicit thesis (“where all stories wait to be sweetened”), but it stops short of outright moralizing. The ending image—purpose defined as remembering for others—offers a resonant, if relatively tidy, thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.0)
    Harmony versus force, and the redefinition of a “key” from weapon to bridge, form a coherent thematic spine that emerges organically from the sonic mechanics. The idea that “some battles were won not with force, but with harmony” is aptly dramatized in the confrontation and resolution. That said, several lines state the theme quite directly (“The key’s not a weapon. It’s a bridge.” and the closing sentence), trimming some subtlety. The ending resonates, but the explicitness edges toward mild didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic core—patience as revolution, reorientation rather than rebellion—is coherent and well-synthesized with the magnetic/moon imagery. However, it verges on over-explicit: repeated phrases like “sculpted patience from impatience” and the closing aphorism “To unyoke the world, one must first unyoke oneself” feel didactic rather than fully earned through subtext. The story nonetheless leaves a thoughtful emotional aftertaste, with the thawed lake and persistent hum nicely reweighting earlier material. Complexity is present but somewhat smoothed into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of memory as both bondage and weapon, institutional violence carried forward from slavery to modern infrastructure “accidents,” and autonomy versus manipulation emerge organically from the lantern’s history and Mara’s profession. The Eliza parallel reweights the present with the past in a way that invites reflection on who gets sacrificed to keep systems running. Some of the thematic articulation is a bit on-the-nose (“Memory is a weapon,” “weren’t a gift—they were a chain”), shading into explicit thesis rather than leaving space for subtext. Still, the final image of Mara choosing factual exposure over emotional entanglement offers a reasonably resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of redemption, the insufficiency of words alone, and “repairing lives” through deliberate craft are coherent and organically tied to the music boxes and the heart. The idea of seeing beneath the surface (“second opinions aren’t just about judgment”) is nicely embodied in the inmate’s “apology in metal.” However, the narrative leans into explicit moralizing (“wasn’t just about repairing music boxes; it was about repairing lives”) and over-explains the storm/light metaphor, which flattens subtext. The ending’s insight feels true but somewhat neat and stated rather than fully earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of desire as motion, seeing versus solving, and the translation of yearning into reality are well integrated through concrete images (spirals in the gaps, the hum reshaping the world, Old Thrum’s line about being “seen”). The bell that “no one hears yet” becomes a potent metaphor for latent futures and unheard possibilities, and the final hum reweights the preceding imagery in a satisfying way. Subtext about innovation, madness, and faith in one’s own obsession is present without sermonizing. The piece stops short of deeper complication—e.g., ethical costs or unintended consequences of “unspooling the future”—which would give the resonance more bite.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and corporate control emerge organically from the archive setting, Elara’s missing status, and Project Lazarus’s goal of deleting not just files but people. Recurring images—“echoes,” “ghostly impressions,” the frayed mission patch—support a sense of fragile remembrance. Some dialogue and narration lean close to thesis statements (“Some truths aren’t meant to be found”; “She was done letting the company erase the echoes of the lost”), which flattens subtlety. Still, the final image of her departure with the coordinates in her neural implant offers a resonant stance against enforced forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of empathy as an active, constructed force and courage as acting in spite of fear arise organically from the mirror vignettes and the final act of “giving the storm a heart.” The use of others’ memories to reconstitute empathy is a strong, specific vehicle for the idea. Yet the last line edges into explicit moral statement (“courage wasn’t in the absence of fear, but in the choice to act anyway”), tipping toward platitude rather than leaving the image to carry the insight. More reliance on image and less on stated takeaway would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of grief, detachment, and the search for meaning in endings emerge organically from Lila’s status as an euthanasia tourist and her attentiveness to “the sound of approaching endings.” The rescue reframes “the fold in patience” from passive waiting to recognizing inevitability, and the closing peace at the marina offers a quiet, non-didactic answer about how one might live alongside deathward impulses. At times, the thematic language edges toward abstraction (“final tranquility,” “lost their anchor in the world”), but it remains grounded enough in the specific rescue event. The piece avoids a tidy moral while still leaving a clear aftertaste of tentative reconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of “destined mismatches,” harmony as tension, and love’s fragility are coherent and recur through the letter, vineyard, and sun/moon imagery. However, much of this is delivered in articulated thesis statements (“destiny is often a mismatch,” “harmony isn’t silence”) rather than left to subtext and image. The final re-description of the pavilion as a sanctuary for questions is resonant but edges toward neatness and explicitness. There’s emotional sincerity, but less thematic ambiguity and afterburn than top-tier literary work demands.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.6)
    Emergent themes—guardianship of wisdom, the burden of duty, honesty as a way of “walking the line”—arise organically from action and imagery. The cyclical, “for now” ending gestures toward the ongoing cost of vigilance and the fragility of balance. However, the story shies away from morally or emotionally complex pressures that would deepen those themes; there’s little friction between duty and any competing desire. The result is resonant but relatively simple.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of collective healing, reclamation, and finding beauty in decay emerge coherently from the setting, Lila’s vocation, and the arcs/vines motif. The closing gestures—“healing wasn’t about erasing the past” and the single word “enough”—offer a clear thematic answer. Yet the piece frequently states its thesis outright (“Lila believed in collective healing…”) and drifts into near-moralizing, which mutes subtext. Strong images support the theme, but the explicitness keeps it from feeling truly layered or ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of non-linear growth, hidden order, and the relationship between knowledge and courage are coherent and well-woven through images of dictionaries, dust, and fractured light. The crystal’s refractions and the "mosaic of fractured sequences" provide a concrete vehicle for abstract ideas. However, the piece leans into explicit statements—"Growth, he realized, wasn’t linear"; "The pattern of growth was too important to keep hidden"—which edge toward telling the thesis. The ending’s resonance is genuine but could be stronger with more implication and less direct thematic articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of aging, memory, and the impossibility of fully grasping one’s future emerge organically from the particulars of his curse, his rituals, and the sound he pursues. The repeated motifs of echoes, forgotten videotapes, and chalk lines deepen a sense of partial preservation versus inevitable loss. The final realization—that the textured experience of “growing older” supersedes predictive clarity—nicely reprices the premise without feeling like overt sermonizing, though “didn’t need to see the future anymore” edges close to spelling out the thesis. Overall resonance is strong and likely to linger.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of controlling vs yielding to time, escape from “tyranny” versus acceptance of transience, are organically woven through objects (clock, telescope), concepts (escape velocity), and the leaf-fall motif. “Harness the ephemeral” versus “time cannot be tamed” generates a genuine conceptual tension. Some lines edge toward stating theme outright (“time, it seemed, could not be tamed”), dulling subtext slightly. The final leap offers a resonant, non-literal answer—seeking escape not by freezing time but by passing through it.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of music as a bridge between life and death, the sacralization of the mundane, and hope as an ambiguous but palpable presence emerge organically from the action and imagery. The vinyl shard, the hymn about light through darkness, and the sky motif all reappear in the ending to suggest continuity and legacy. There is some line-level stating of concepts (“The method was simple: hymning the mundane”; “The work was never done, but neither was the joy…”) that edges toward explicit thesis. Overall, though, the emotional resonance is earned and lingers beyond the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of cycles, hidden mechanisms, and the continuity between visible and invisible worlds are woven consistently through runes, loops, shadows, and the key. The final image—that shadows condense into a reverse-time realm—reweights earlier oddities (noon behavior, sealed awakenings) in a satisfying conceptual way. However, the piece stays largely on the level of cosmological wonder rather than tying those ideas to a more personal or moral tension in Lirael. The resonance is real but relatively cool and idea-driven rather than emotionally layered.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of forgiveness, reconfigured certainty, and the garden as a mirror for self-knowledge are strong and coherent, with the tooth and fountain serving as solid concrete carriers. The final image of walking a now-clear path through the maze is thematically apt and emotionally satisfying. However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements—“forgiveness wasn’t about accepting the unforgivable…”, “The garden’s not a trick, it’s a mirror”—which tip into authorial explanation rather than letting images and subtext carry the insight. This explicitness dulls some of the potential lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of stewardship, non-extractive use of beauty, and “stillness” as an active, ethical stance emerge organically from concrete actions (capturing, balancing, and returning light). Recurring motifs—sea glass, the mother’s teachings, the idea that “light is a loan”—are well woven, though the explicit statements (“Light isn’t meant to be consumed”; “Light is a loan, not a gift”) push slightly toward didactic clarity. The final image reweights the whole piece by dramatizing gentle return rather than ownership, offering a resonant but fairly tidy thematic answer. There’s some room for more ambiguity or moral friction around the decision to let the pearl go.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of grafting new meaning onto old wounds, contained vulnerability, and the persistence rather than erasure of the past are well integrated into concrete actions (orchid grafts, drip pattern, pendant modification, planting the sapling). The story mostly avoids overt moralizing, letting images and choices carry the idea that healing is “letting it breathe.” A couple of lines lean close to thematic thesis statements (“You’ve been proactive about grief”; “Grafting isn’t permanent. It’s a conversation.”), but they remain grounded in character and craft rather than reading like slogans. The final image of the pendant catching mosslight beside the sapling offers a resonant non-literal answer to the core question about what to do with grief.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of endings as doors and hope as a current is coherent and well-seeded via the nexus, the shell, and the recurring language of currents. However, the story leans into explicit statement—“endings aren’t walls—they’re doors,” “some things are better left unfinished,” and the final line’s prayer-like formulation—blunting subtext. Much of the thematic work is told rather than discovered in image or implication. The result is resonant but a bit didactic for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of community, remembrance, and the difference between tools and tending are well integrated into action (inviting the creatures to “help me remember,” planting the sapling) rather than mere assertion. The idea that magic is maintained by ongoing communal practice, not a single fix, gives the ending a grounded, non-triumphal resonance. That said, some thematic lines verge on explicit thesis statements—“sacred practices need tenders, not just tinkerers” and “the true remedy lay in the hands of those who dared to remember”—which nudges it toward mild moralizing. The complexity is gentle rather than challenging, but still emotionally effective.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of patience, listening, and re-mapping the inner life (“a way to chart… the human soul”) emerge coherently from the specifics of the ritual and the map. The orchard’s “moving stillness” and the restless outside world support a meditation on slowness and inward attention. Yet the core insight is spelled out in explanatory terms (“The map was not just a guide to the stars—it was a guide to the heart”) rather than fully entrusted to image and implication, softening its literary impact. The piece is thematically clear, but slightly over-articulated for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of wonder vs. reason, preservation vs. death, and seeing from the periphery are well woven into the imagery of echoes stored like wine and wonder bottled in crystalline vials. Elias’s skepticism about the “cellar of reason” and his sideways method of problem-solving create a coherent thematic through-line that reconfigures the final image of captured echoes as potentially renewable rather than entombed. However, the thematic statement via the eldest keeper (“Wonder is a fragile thing…”) borders on explicit thesis and slightly blunts subtext. The ending is resonant, but leans more on stated ideas than on a hard thematic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of how burdens should be carried—transformed into patterns rather than endured, with some perhaps remaining buried—emerge organically from the work Kael does and his restraint around the locket. Motifs of weight vs wound, stone vs liquid memory, and what future weavers might do with his own burdens all serve the question without overt moralizing. The final image of the satchel under starlight and his fragmented humming offers a resonant, non-literal answer about partial relief and ongoing inheritance. A bit more friction or ambiguity specifically around his choice to leave the locket might deepen the thematic afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of impermanence, transformation of loss, and art as a vessel for grief arise organically from the wood, the lions, and the here/gone performance memory. The recurring objects (ash wood, kettle, candle, rain) carry thematic weight without feeling purely symbolic. That said, the prose tips into explicit thesis statements—“Loss wasn’t an ending, but a transformation” and “This is how we survive”—which flatten some of the subtext into stated moral. The piece still leaves a gentle afterimage, but with less ambiguity and lingering questioning than top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, regret, and the futility/necessity of collecting fragments accumulate through concrete particulars: the disposable camera wheel, the myths she harvests, the stalled seed, the halted carousel. The ghost’s insistence that she hasn’t forgiven herself ties the thematic question directly to her central conflict, and the final rose in preserved lagoon water reweights earlier images into a quiet meditation on transformation rather than restoration. The piece avoids moralizing, allowing plausible readings about surrender, death, or temporal escape. A slightly pat note is grazed with “The lagoon, however, knew the truth,” but it still reads as tone-consistent rather than sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of repurposing, functional resurrection, and “equations for hope” are coherent and supported by the world-building (abandoned tech, carnival departure, engineering as meaning-making). The final image—an imperfect equation of light that she carries in memory while the sextant becomes a pendant—nicely embodies an open, ongoing pursuit of hope. However, the piece leans into explicit thematic language (“formula for hope,” “resurrection,” “future built not on nostalgia”) that borders on essayistic and reduces subtext. The moral/intellectual takeaway is strong but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of safety vs freedom, silence as both refuge and violence, and reconfiguring “prison” into “compass” emerge organically from events and images. The final lines about “silence between beats, where dreams breathe” nicely reweight the clock motif without feeling purely declarative. Some thematic sentences (“silence could be a kind of violence,” “The keep was not a prison. It was a compass”) edge close to thesis-statement territory and slightly undercut the subtextual power of the imagery. Overall, though, the piece leaves a coherent, reflective aftertaste rather than a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme is coherent and focused: truth vs. deception, and how narratives “control the narrative” and “shape perception.” However, it is often stated rather than emerging subtextually (“The sundial wasn’t just a tool… it was a compass for truth”; “the architecture of lies”), which flattens nuance. The final insight reweights earlier material but edges toward thesis-statement territory, sacrificing ambiguity. There is some emotional aftereffect in the image of him standing at dawn with new clarity, but complexity is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of preservation, encoded wisdom, patience, and the tension between myth and science are well integrated through rope, seeds, tides, and the weavers concept. Subtext works nicely in the image of the world’s wisdom embedded in “everyday objects” and in the woman’s lines about silence between heartbeats and roots. That said, the closing move slightly over-explains (“The glass…wasn’t a loom or a rope or a glass. It was the act of preservation itself”), edging toward thesis rather than leaving more space for the image to do the work. The piece still leaves a resonant afterimage, but with a touch of explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of grief, absence, and healing-as-geography are cohesive and supported by recurring images (thread, garden, ships, obituaries). However, they are often stated directly—“healing was not a destination but a geography,” “explained absences were not endings but beginnings”—which edges toward essayistic moralizing. The strongest thematic work is in the embodied image of the ghost weft holding footsteps and the unspoken goodbyes, where implication does the work. Tightening or cutting explicit thesis sentences would let the subtext breathe and lift this considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematic throughline—true beauty as fragile, imperfect, and grown rather than engineered—is well seeded in the Mechanists’ backstory, Corvin’s nurturing labor, and the final image of the flawed but living orb. The story’s concrete particulars (oil vs soil, gears vs moss) support the organic vs mechanical tension. However, the theme is also voiced too directly in lines like “life could not be forged but must be nurtured” and “in that imperfection…lay the truest beauty of all,” edging into stated moral rather than emergent resonance. This explicitness blunts some of the potential lingering ambiguity or complexity about what will be lost in this rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    Scars, fertility-from-ash, and the rescued bird create a coherent thematic mesh about transformation and the persistence of hurt. The coin and black sand recur in ways that support the idea that past harm can be repurposed into care. However, the story undercuts its own subtlety with explicit thesis statements—“Scars don’t forget… They just learn to sing” and “Compassion, she thought, wasn’t about erasing the past”—which verge on moralizing. The resonance is real but a bit too explained instead of fully earned through implication.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, defiance against a disenchanted world, and “sidereal patience” emerge organically from her actions and the city’s condition. The fountains as repositories of stories and the box as a prison create a strong metaphorical frame. However, the ending leans into explicit statement—“Sidereal patience had won… some truths are worth waiting for”—which edges toward moralizing rather than letting the images alone carry the resonance. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t fully trust subtext over thesis in its closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thematic core—generational patterns as bridges rather than chains, and fire/light as a moral language—is coherent and organically threaded through objects and images. The ghost’s line “we forgot how to speak it gently” is a strong, particular thematic crystallization. However, several sentences tip into thesis-statement territory (“Generational patterns weren’t chains—they were bridges”; “light *is* fire, child”) which undercuts subtlety. The ending resonates, but the moral is spelled out more than it trusts the images to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—grief as bridge rather than burden, as something shared and transmuted through words and rituals—is well integrated into setting (greenhouse as repository), objects (ribbon, gravestones), and action (reading the poem). The subtext of intergenerational sorrow and craft as love is strong. However, the story leans into explicit statement (“Because words outlive us,” “Grief is not a hole, but a door”) that edges toward didacticism rather than relying on implication. The closing shift from loss to love resonates, but its articulation is somewhat on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of balance as an ongoing, incremental practice is well-grounded in the pendulum/tide mechanism and Lirael’s inherited craft, with the rake inscription elegantly echoing her grandfather’s teaching. Her solution—slow, deliberate re-start rather than a jolt—enacts that philosophy. The weakness is some explicit moralizing in the last paragraph (“not by force, but by honoring the incremental”) that states what the story has already shown. The resonance is real and coherent, but slightly over-articulated for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of memory, intention, and the supposed “silence” of the dead are well-integrated via the chess clock, tapestry, and gardening of graves. The final phrase, “The silence between moves,” offers a resonant reframing of death as a pause in an ongoing game, aligning with her work as a temporal gardener. However, some lines state the theme too directly (“The dead were not silent; they spoke in the language of echoes”), which flattens potential subtext. Overall, the piece invites reflection without fully embracing ambiguity or deep moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of fate vs possibility and data vs imagination are coherent and well-embedded in her practices and the environment shifting around her work. The kingfisher, thaw, and burned journals all support a meditation on innovation under constraint and the cost of rewriting the future. However, several aphoristic lines (“Data without imagination is a corpse…”) verge on thesis statements, tipping from subtext into didacticism. The ending image is resonant but edges close to confirming a tidy moral rather than leaving charged ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, cultural famine, and resurrecting silenced narratives are well integrated through concrete motifs: dust, pirate broadcasts, “ghost bards,” the earth keeping secrets, and Lira’s vow to teach dust to sing. The final image of her as a kind of clandestine broadcaster herself reweights the premise effectively without overt moralizing, even if “teaching the dust to sing” edges close to stated thesis. The piece invites reflection on who keeps stories alive after catastrophe through its particulars rather than abstract commentary. Some complexity is sacrificed to lyric clarity—the ethical or psychological costs of her obsession remain comparatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of impermanence, the “mirage of safety,” and art as a half-true refuge emerge organically through the gallery’s rules, Lira’s ash technique, and her mask, which is excellent integration. However, the piece undercuts its own subtext at times with overt thesis statements—“Safety is an illusion, and art is the only truth worth chasing”—that feel more like authorial commentary than the inevitable residue of scene. The final image of an unfinished ash figure on a cliff being swallowed by a vanishing gallery has real conceptual resonance and invites reflection about what can be preserved. A bit more reliance on image and choice, and less on spelled-out insight, would bring this closer to elite literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.0)
    Memory vs. progress, “competing narratives,” and resistance to technological erasure are thematically coherent and well woven into objects (cog, compass needle, sediment layers). The idea that multiple narratives can all be “true” is nicely crystallized in the line about “a thousand narratives, all competing. All *true*.” However, the story often states its themes directly (“the futility of progress,” “They erased the stars,” “time isn’t linear. It’s… *layered*”), which blunts subtlety and feels a bit like the character parroting the story’s thesis. The ending resonates conceptually, but less would be more for a truly elite, subtext-driven effect.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of harmony vs. hatred, cultural erasure, and the idea of “subtracting noise” to recover quieter truths are well-integrated and supported by concrete particulars (the river song, the neighbors’ complaints, the multi-lingual choir). The final image of the rosette spinning in autumnal light reweights prior material with a quiet, earned hope. However, the piece sometimes edges into direct statement (“Hatred, she knew, was a kind of noise—a cacophony that drowned out the quieter truths”), which slightly blunts subtext in a venue that prizes maximum restraint. Overall, the thematic throughline is coherent and resonant, if a bit explicitly voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of trauma pruning, neuroplasticity, and creating beauty from ruins are strongly woven through the knowledge fruit, synaptic-plasticity language, and the greenhouse-as-sanctuary frame. The future-vision bud effectively reweights earlier material, implying that choosing which memories to cultivate can reshape collective futures. Yet the piece leans into explicit moralizing—“All it took was a little pruning, a little patience, and a willingness to rebel—gently—against the darkness”—which flattens ambiguity and feels like a stated thesis rather than emergent resonance. Complexity about what’s lost in pruning away pain is largely sidestepped, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of wonder vs. routine and the “magic in the mundane” are strongly, perhaps overly, foregrounded. Voss’s lines (“The tower runs on more than electricity. It runs on the collective awe of the city.”) and Clara’s speech to citizens verge on thesis statements rather than letting subtext do more work. That said, the integration of drones “pollinating doubt” and the tower’s reliance on curiosity gives the theme an embodied logic. The final note—preserving wonder in routine as an ongoing, costly task—adds a welcome nuance beyond a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thematic throughlines—hush as potential rather than emptiness, displaced objects as anchors between mundane and ineffable, “alive” spaces—are coherent and grow naturally from Lira’s worldview and experiment. The closing realization that “The hush wasn’t emptiness; it was potential” neatly reweights the entire piece, even if it edges toward explicit statement. There is a pleasing, quiet resonance in the idea of sanctified silence and listening houses, though the insight feels more elegant than emotionally risky. Overall, it invites reflection without collapsing into a moral, but could benefit from a bit more ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of sacrifice, reinterpreted loss, and “welcoming nuance into certainty” arise naturally from Mara’s discoveries and her reframing of her grandmother’s fate. The ampoule as catalyst, not cure, and the slow, threadlike recession of the blight nicely embody a nuanced, process-based view of healing. However, the text undercuts itself by stating theme directly (“To welcome nuance into a certainty,” “a reminder that even in decay, there is room for growth”) instead of fully trusting the images. The result is resonant but a bit more didactic than top-tier literary work typically permits.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of grief, the impossibility of reclaiming the past, and the paradox of motion within confinement emerge organically from the staircase mechanics and the dice motif. The final realization—that the “texture of his missed opportunity” resides in the space and tension between the perpetually spinning dice—reweights earlier material without resorting to overt moralizing. Some phrasings (“texture of his missed opportunity”) lean toward summary rather than pure image, which blunts the subtext slightly. Still, the ending image and his quiet renunciation carry genuine emotional and conceptual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, endangered languages, and kindness as a form of translation are deeply woven through objects (the brush, lexicon, letters) and images (smog vs greenhouse, moonlight as rebellion). However, the text states its thesis a bit too plainly—“Kindness, Lila thought, was a language too,” “Kindness outlives the tongue that speaks it,” and the notebook line “To love is to translate” tilt into explicit moralizing. The emotional aftereffect is still tender and genuine, especially in Mr. Voss recognizing his mother’s worry in the painting. A touch more trust in implication over aphorism would lift this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of displacement, preservation vs. practice, and art as a living, communal ritual are well integrated through the lens, thaw, bees, and bread initials. The story’s final images (children singing, initials in dough, the lens catching torchlight) offer a resonant, non-literal answer: collective making is the antidote to frozen heritage. Some lines edge toward statement (“Art, like bread, required patience, care, and a willingness to rise again”), nudging into explicit thesis territory but still grounded in concrete particulars. The lingering “rosewater dread” keeps the ending from becoming too pat, preserving some complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: time run in reverse, latent radiance as starved potential, and fate framed as a lock to be picked. The father’s death, Elias’s pariah status, and the backward clocks all support a coherent meditation on defying predetermined design and feeding dangerous hungers. The final lines do edge toward a thesis sentence, but they grow from the scene rather than feeling like bolted-on moralizing. The piece invites reflection on the cost of overturning cosmic order, though that cost could be sharpened further in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of fear as illusion, truth as corrosive, and lies/paradox as tools to escape oppressive systems are coherently woven through the cloak, dictionary, and final exchange. The paradox of “welcoming” the horror to weaken it is a strong concrete embodiment of the idea. However, lines like “Because fear, like beauty, is a lie” edge toward on-the-nose thesis rather than letting subtext do the work, slightly flattening complexity. The ending invites reflection but doesn’t fully surprise or reweight earlier material in a non-obvious way.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The thematic throughline of transforming damage and disorder into art is strongly embodied: shattered planks become both instrument and final mosaic, lightning scars turn into a gonging heart of the piece. The line “Obstacles are just instruments waiting to be tuned” is on-the-nose but appears early and is then earned through concrete action rather than moralizing. The ending reweights the orchard and the act of composition conceptually, inviting reflection on art as ordering chaos. The complexity is more elegant than probing—resonant, but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of misread guardianship, the cost of knowledge, and being imprisoned “for your own good” emerge organically from the expedition, the gate, and the watchers’ reinterpretation. The final realization that the gate kept them in and the watchers were screaming recasts the entire premise without resorting to overt moralizing. Symbolic elements (the whistle, patterns, shells as “hungry”) support this, though Lira’s personal thematic arc—what she believes about her mother’s legacy or her own complicity—could be explored one notch further. Overall, resonance is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of noble lies, survival versus transparency, and truth as generative rather than destructive are clearly articulated and coherently echoed via roses, tunnels, and illuminated letters. The revaluation—that the lie delayed war and protected negotiators, and that truth requires context rather than raw exposure—is thoughtful and integrated with Elara’s profession. That said, the story leans into explicit statements (“Truth is not a weapon. It’s a seed.”; “Historians, after all, were gardeners of memory.”), which edges into moralizing rather than letting images and choices fully carry the resonance. This clarity is strong but slightly over-explained for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of absence-as-presence, legacy, and how places remember people are well-seeded (the inkwell, engraved phrase, jars, desk inscriptions) and coherently paid off in the hidden chamber and final walk to shore. “Interlaced absence” functions as a genuine organizing idea rather than a decorative phrase. Some thematic articulations are a bit on-the-nose (“Was absence a kind of presence? A ghostly architecture?”; “Abandoned dreams… were not lost—just waiting to be surveyed”), nudging toward authorial gloss. Even so, the piece leaves a lingering, earned sense of continuity across generations and ruins.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of truth vs. denial, myth vs. honest origin, and darkness as both concealment and potential illumination are well integrated with the plot and imagery. The journal’s account of leaders burying history directly embodies the thematic concern and reframes the flood as self-inflicted, which the ending then extends into Lira’s new purpose. That said, the piece edges into explicit moralizing in lines like “not as a warning, but as a reclaimed stillness: a chance to rebuild on honesty, not myth,” which states the thesis rather than fully trusting the images. The complexity is present but somewhat flattened by these declarative thematic sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of grief, memory, and transformation are woven through concrete motifs—gems, lanterns, cranes, the paradox of descending while ascending—and culminate in her reframed understanding of the shadow. The final image of polishing a new gem while planning to fold the current moment into a crane offers a resonant, non-literal answer: transformation means carrying grief forward, not erasing it. However, some lines (“Dreams are just grief with wings,” “To transform was to carry the old into the new”) state the theme a bit overtly, edging toward aphorism. The subtext remains strong, but a touch more reliance on image over explanation would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme around grief as energy, trauma as “unused potential,” and awakening via perturbation is coherent and arises from Elara’s actions and speeches (“Unused potential…isn’t just lost energy. It’s anger. It’s grief.”). The final image of her following veins of light as a “seer, a disrupter” reweights prior material and offers a resonant, if not subtle, answer: one channels loss into transformative, disruptive perception. Some thematic statements are on-the-nose and border on thesis (the shouted definition of unused potential, explicit lines like “Not unbroken. Not whole. But awake.”), which slightly blunt subtext. Nonetheless the integration of concept and emotional arc is strong and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of alignment, missing pieces, and belonging are well braided through the chip, star map, and observatory, culminating in “Belonging… It’s not a place. It’s a resonance.” That line is somewhat on-the-nose, but it does crystallize what the story has been enacting via mechanics and imagery. The conceptual shift from technological protocol to embodied resonance is satisfying and reweights prior details. Deeper grounding of what “belonging” costs or changes for Lira personally would heighten the thematic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of manufactured memory versus preserved truth, familial erasure, and the violence of silence are strongly woven through driftwood imagery, the ocean, and Elias’s profession. The “sieved hush” concept and the recurring silence motifs reweight earlier details at the end when he chooses to break it. A few lines lean toward explicit statement (“some truths were too heavy to carry alone; The sieved hush had to be broken”), nudging into mild over-articulation. Still, the piece invites reflection on moral complicity without collapsing into a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of neutrality as a moral stance, humanization across borders, and the burden/utility of regret are woven through recurring motifs (drawer pulls, moon phases, “neutral territory isn’t a place. It’s a choice.”). The final beat—letting one pull go while acknowledging some mistakes must be carried—offers a nuanced answer to the story’s central question and reweights earlier details. At times the prose edges toward aphorism (“Curiosity isn’t a crime.” / “But fear is.”), flirting with didacticism but not fully sliding into moralizing. Overall, meaning arises largely from scene and image rather than explicit sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    The themes of regret, agency, and aligning “heart and action” are coherent and integrated with the compass and lighthouse motifs. However, several lines verge on direct thesis-statement (“The compass, she realized, wasn’t for finding direction. It was for measuring regret.” / “The backlash of regrets, she decided, was just the ocean’s way of reminding her she was alive.”), which flattens subtext into commentary. The ending does offer a resonant answer—she’ll navigate by the weight of her choices—but it borders on moralizing in its explicitness. More reliance on image and less on explicit conceptual framing would deepen the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—empathy born from confronting regret and unrealized selves—emerges organically from the baseball, the labyrinth/lake, and the time-traveler’s intervention. The final vow to use understanding rather than erasure as a compass offers a coherent, resonant answer to the opening setup. Yet J.T.’s dialogue explicitly defines empathy and the thesis (“That’s what empathy is—holding the pain of others because you’ve known your own”), shading into didactic explanation. More subtext and less direct statement in those lines would deepen the literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of metamorphosis, identity, duty, and relational persistence beyond death emerge organically from events and recurring images (phoenix cycle, fortune, fragrance as language). The subtext about embracing change without annihilating the self is largely earned through Lira’s embodied struggle. However, the final explicit line (“metamorphosis is not an ending, but a rebirth”) tips into stated moral, slightly flattening what was already implied. The fortune-cookie quotation’s clarity is effective but a bit on-the-nose for a top-tier literary venue, where more restraint and ambiguity would strengthen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres around time, inherited guilt, and the difference between punishment and acceptance, with strong recurring images (saucer crack, handprints, clouds) that shift meaning by the end. The idea that “repentance isn’t a place. It’s a choice.” and that lost time lives in “the spaces between breaths” offers a clear, resonant answer to the opening question. However, several lines state the theme overtly, undercutting some subtextual power and nudging toward didacticism. The emotional aftereffect is genuine and tender, but a bit less explicit commentary and more reliance on image would deepen its literary force.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of pacifism, engagement, shadow work, and the twinship of grief and love are well integrated with setting and action, and the final image of the garden as “not an escape but an invitation” offers a resonant reframing. That said, several lines veer into explicit thesis-statement territory (“peace is not the absence of war but the presence of courage”), edging toward sermonizing rather than letting images and choices do the work. The conceptual arc is strong but could trust subtext more.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of transformation, coincidence, prophecy, and the value of “detours” emerge organically from the setting and situation, especially through the hush and the bugs. However, several lines state the theme directly (“Transformation wasn’t about grand gestures or perfect endings,” “And that was enough”), veering into mild moralizing rather than trusting the images. The ending still reweights prior material nicely—her choice to listen and to work “with purpose, not just habit” offers a resonant non-literal answer to the opening question. The piece could gain sophistication by leaving slightly more of that wisdom in subtext instead of overt exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of knowledge as rebellion, quiet dissent against oppressive spectacle, and revolution as networked “sparks” emerge naturally from the sundial, blackout, and cradle. The final image of light as ideas rather than power lines is conceptually satisfying. Yet several lines veer toward slogan (“they’ll know the spark can’t be extinguished”), undercutting nuance. There’s limited moral or emotional complexity—very little sense of what could be lost—so the thematic aftertaste is interesting but not deeply haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    The thematic line—shifting from controlling divine patterns to humbly witnessing and honoring them—emerges organically from the interplay of curse, promise, and method. The final insight about the pattern residing in “the space between” and the language-as-sacred-pattern motif is resonant and cleanly ties back to earlier images. That said, the last paragraph leans close to explicit thesis statement (“The sacred patterns weren’t a puzzle to solve, but a language to honor”) rather than trusting image alone, which slightly flattens the mystery. A bit more ambiguity or embodied cost in that realization would deepen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of scars, censorship, masks, and purification/rarefaction are tightly interwoven through repeated, evolving images (mask, scars, storm, timer, cartography). The story offers an implicit stance on the cost and necessity of unfiltered truth: pain must be mapped and revealed, not smoothed away. The cartographer’s poem and Kael’s response create a layered thematic dialogue across time. A slight limitation is that some thematic material edges toward explicit statement (“To rarefy: to purify, to make rare...”), reducing the need for reader inference.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes about questions as journeys, maps, and directions are explicit and coherent, and the needle card’s reweighting into a stellar map is a strong thematic image. However, the story leans heavily on articulated thesis statements (“You still believe questions are meant to be answered,” “Turn questions into destinations”) and closes with a fairly spelled-out moral (“they found not answers, but better questions”). This directness dulls subtext and robs the final beat of some resonance that could have arisen from image alone. The thematic architecture is solid but lacks the ambiguity and non-verbal echo that elite venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of resistance, identity, and making beauty from ruin are clear and well-motivated by particulars like the rusted library, the false-bottom tin, and the “blooming resistance” mantra. The closing image of small-scale rebellion—a poem, a friendship, “a tin full of secrets”—offers a resonant, modest answer to the chaos outside. However, the piece leans into explicit statement (“to forge beauty from anarchy…,” “this is how I rebuild,” “it was enough”) in ways that edge toward didactic clarity rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. More trust in implied meaning over articulated thesis could deepen its literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs of clocks, compasses, tides, and improvisation coherently develop themes of time, fate, and the tension between strategic control and surrender to art. The broken vs. unbroken clocks and the compasses’ chaotic spinning subtly reweight the idea that attempts to fix or map life can themselves become cages. The ending rephrases the theme in character-inflected language (“Tonight, she’d surprise it back”), skirting but not quite tipping into on-the-nose moralizing. The piece invites reflection on refuge-as-resistance without flattening into a neat lesson, though it could embrace slightly more ambiguity or cost for deeper resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    The thematic core—memory as compass rather than cage, and the courage required to remember painful truths—is integrated with the worldbuilding and Lira’s role. The dual future visions dramatize the thematic stakes effectively, giving a visual answer to what forgetting vs. remembering means. That said, some of the key insights are voiced a bit too explicitly (“That memory is not a cage but a compass”), pushing toward didactic thesis rather than pure emergence from image and action. The ending carries a gentle resonance, but the moral calculus feels tidy rather than deeply troubled.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of memory, regret, and the work of tending emotional “roots” are integrated through recurring images of bonsai, tides, and lace instructions. The idea that patience and forgiveness are active labors, not passivity, comes through in Yorick’s craft and the ritual. Some lines border on explicit thesis (“Tides of remembrance… are not water,” “some wounds, like roots, grow stronger when nurtured”), which slightly blunts subtlety. Nevertheless, the final image of Yorick with the bonsai and hanging lace offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to the opening questions.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is coherent but explicitly preached in the final dialogue ("Gradual change is the universe's only constant"), triggering a penalty for sermonizing/Thematic Echo at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a “Thematic Echo” where the core thesis is explicitly written out for the protagonist (“In the pauses, the truth breathes”). This externalizes the realization, robbing the subtext of ambiguity and the character of an internally generated epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("She’s not broken... speaking a different language"), flattening subtext into a moral lesson. The resolution feels sentimental and unearned due to the lack of prior struggle or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of grief and memory is coherent but delivered through explicit dialogue and moralizing ("History's dead," "Rest wasn't an end"). The resolution relies on stated wisdom rather than subtext or accumulated narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of trust over fear is coherent and culminates in a resonant final image of the bell. However, the message is articulated somewhat explicitly in dialogue ("Trust will") rather than emerging purely through subtextual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing ("unused love... stored... in the spaces between breaths") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending reduces the narrative to a sermon, explaining the meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to resonate through the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the final paragraphs ("time wasn't a texture... but a story"), which flattens the narrative resonance. This direct statement of the moral prevents the reader from engaging with the subtext and reduces the ending to a platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is didactic and explicit, with the narrative stating the moral ("resilience had been planted") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. The concept of "planting resilience" is treated literally, flattening the potential for nuance or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of absence defining presence is woven effectively through the mechanics of the hearing aid and the "liquid memories." The ending—hearing the absence where love should be—avoids a tidy moral, instead offering a complex emotional resonance that recontextualizes the earlier grief.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of exchange is present but undercut by the lack of sacrifice; the narrative tells us this is a "dialogue" with destiny, but the transaction on the page is painless. The explicit moralizing at the end ("destiny's door... was a garden") feels imposed rather than arising organically from the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.8)
    Theme is stated explicitly rather than emerging from subtext. The character articulating the thesis aloud ("Even broken things... can catch the light") in the final beats triggers the Thematic Echo penalty for moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story explicitly sermons its theme in dialogue ("I proved vulnerability is power"), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. The ending reduces the narrative to a moral lesson, with characters articulating the thesis statement verbatim.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of silence as presence is coherent but delivered through explicit exposition ("she’d always been mildly obsessed with the way silence could be...") rather than subtext. The concept creates a consistent mood, but the "lesson" is stated directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue (&quot;In the mundane. In the mysticism of the everyday&quot;), replacing subtext with moralizing. This overt thematic echo in the final paragraph significantly undermines the story's interpretative depth.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and narration ("honesty is the only currency," "Words... were overrated") rather than emerging from the action. The ending relies on direct moralizing, summarizing the lesson for the reader instead of allowing the imagery to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through dialogue and narration ("She believed gardens knew their gardeners") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending relies on a summary moral ("In the end, it was not the algorithms...") rather than a resonant image that allows the reader to draw the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of non-linear time is explicitly lectured by the Director and the narrator rather than emerging organically from the action. The parallel between Veyra and the flora is stated on-the-nose ("awakened something in her, too").

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of "unfinished business" and liminal spaces is present but articulated through explicit statements ("liminal space between life and death") rather than subtext. The ending leans into melodrama ("I'll finish it") rather than allowing the image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story tends to explain its own subtext, explicitly labeling the protagonist's actions as "occupying margins—literal and metaphorical." The final image of the map as "a map of her own fractures" converts potential resonance into direct instruction, limiting thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of corporate greed and buried truth is delivered explicitly through dialogue ("profit," "silence the dead") and internal monologue ("weight of a swallowed truth"). The lack of subtext makes the moral didactic; the story states its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly summarized rather than dramatized, with the narrative directly stating the lesson ("The keeper had finally learned to let go"). This heavy-handed delivery flattens the subtext, leaving little room for ambiguity or reader interpretation of the "silence" and its implications.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of "ordinary magic" is paradoxically undermined by the use of *actual* magic (a visible glow) to prove the point, creating a confused subtext. The moral is delivered via explicit sermonizing in dialogue ("It’s not in the curl. It’s in us") rather than emerging organically.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader via Clara's diary entries ("stopped seeing... because we stopped believing"), removing subtext. This reliance on "Thematic Echo"—stating the story's thesis in the text—flattens the resonance and leaves little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is delivered heavily through aphoristic fortunes that act as explicit thesis statements. The ending ("Somewhere, a tide turned") relies on melodrama rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story is heavily didactic, with the protagonist explicitly articulating the theme in dialogue ("Hidden assumptions are the roots of all control"). The reliance on sermonizing statements prevents the theme from emerging organically through subtext or action.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    Thematic resonance is dampened by explicit authorial assertions ("She was not just a fortune cookie writer—she was a architect of memories") that replace subtext with summary. This over-articulation resolves the narrative's ambiguity too neatly, reducing the emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered via explicit thesis statements ("not a hero... but a woman made of choices") rather than emerging from subtext. The resolution relies on a platitude of self-acceptance without exploring the complexity of the sacrifices mentioned.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit dialogue and narration ("Silence isn’t empty. It’s a container") rather than emerging organically from action. This overt moralizing limits resonance and leaves little room for reader interpretation or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("to bear witness," "hold power accountable") rather than subtext or action. The ending relies on a platitude ("quietest places often held the loudest truths") that flattens the narrative into a simple fable. The "integrity" motif feels inserted to satisfy a checklist rather than emerging organically from the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story explicitly summarizes its moral in the final paragraphs ("grief wasn’t something to be feared; it was a testament to love"), triggering a significant penalty for Thematic Echo. This didacticism flattens the subtext and resolves the narrative with a sermon rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story ends with explicit moralizing in the final dialogue, violating the show-don't-tell principle for theme. This "sermonizing ending" flattens the subtext and explains the thesis directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit dialogue ("The bowl doesn’t hold silence... It holds potential") and internal summary rather than subtext or action. This "sermonizing ending" flattens resonance by explaining the meaning to the reader instead of letting it emerge from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in exposition and dialogue ("half truths I offer are not lies") rather than emerging from subtext. This over-articulation acts as a lecture to the reader, flattening nuance. The story resolves with a moralizing summary that precludes interpretive depth.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("The cycles of compassion, she realized...") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending ledger entry ("Profit, Unseen") reduces the narrative arc to a moralizing statement rather than a resonant experience.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme ("webs of kinship") is stated explicitly in narration and dialogue ("The tags aren’t just art—they’re a test"), leaving no room for subtext. The story treats the concept as a lesson to be explained to the reader rather than a complex truth to be discovered through the friction of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("She understood now...") and dialogue that explains the subtext ("This is where echoes are born"). The realization feels asserted by the narrator rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action, leaving little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story suffers from a significant Thematic Echo penalty; the brother's dialogue ("Emotion isn’t a straight line... It’s a mosaic") explicitly states the thesis, flattening subtext. The narrative explains its meaning ("loss wasn't a void but a fractal") instead of allowing it to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("You’re not alone") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The ending offers a tidy, moralistic resolution that flattens complexity, treating the discovery as a prompt-fulfillment exercise rather than a resonant human experience.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story violates the "Thematic Echo" rule with explicit moralizing in the final dialogue ("They're not trying to survive. They're trying to transform"). The theme is delivered as a sermon rather than emerging organically from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly written out in the stranger's note ("Meaning isn't threshed. It's grown."), violating the show-don't-tell principle. This didactic delivery flattens the subtext, reducing the ending to a stated moral rather than a resonant experience.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of order versus chaos is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The pilgrim's dialogue explicitly articulates the moral ("brightness and darkness are twins"), which flattens subtext and reduces the interpretative space.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explication and moralizing summaries ("history wasn’t a line, but a mosaic") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending serves as a tidy sermon on patience rather than a resonant, complex resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue (&quot;The fortress isn’t a destination... It’s a choice&quot;) rather than emerging from subtext or action. This moralizing approach flattens the resonance, turning the ending into a lecture rather than an experience.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing ("some truths are best felt") and summary ("testament to resilience") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending reduces the narrative to a stated lesson rather than a resonant experience.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is articulated through heavy-handed dialogue ("They feed on our loneliness") rather than emerging from subtext. The concept of "goodbye" as a necessary threshold is present but delivered didactically, reducing its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "fair trade mathematics" is delivered via exposition and heavy-handed dialogue rather than emerging organically from the conflict. The ending moral ("make sure no one ever has to fake their death again") feels tacked on and overly sentimental, lacking subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative relies on explicit moralizing to convey meaning ("stories... were bridges," "guardian of memories"). The theme is summarized for the reader in the final paragraphs rather than emerging organically from the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of erased histories is present but articulated through explicit summary ("Errors didn’t erase histories; they buried them") rather than subtext. The "mosaic" concept remains an abstract metaphor that doesn't fully land because the pieces collected (letters, overheard dialogue) are generic. The resolution feels unearned, pivoting to a revenge motif that wasn't thematically prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story explicitly states its thesis ("meant to be felt") in the final paragraph, reducing the subtext to a sermon. This didactic ending flattens resonance and triggers the penalty for explicit moralizing replacing scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.6)
    Themes are articulated explicitly in dialogue ("Efficiency will kill the carnival"), reducing subtext to text. The dichotomy of order vs. chaos is resolved too neatly, lacking the complexity or ambiguity required for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is delivered heavily, with the grandfather's maxims and the archivist's realization explicitly stating the moral ("Some messages... outlasted even the silence"). This didactic approach flattens the subtext and leaves little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("Listening’s a kind of seeing"), reducing subtext to a moral lesson. This overt "Thematic Echo" in the final moments flattens resonance, offering a tidy summary instead of an earned, complex insight.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing dialogue ("Maps are lies. They erase the truth") rather than subtext or action. The story relies on "Thematic Echo" where characters state the thesis, flattening the potential for genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of restoration through listening is coherent, but the ending leans on explicit moralizing ("Balance, once restored, demands nothing less") rather than trusting the resonant image of the tuning fork and the town to convey the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story explicitly summarizes its moral in the final sentence ("its lesson remained: some things are meant to be unsnarled..."), which deflates narrative resonance into a fable-like statement. This overt didacticism flattens the complexity of the "memory as prison" theme.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed meta-commentary ("lattice... was a pen," "mosaic of memory") and concludes with a platitude ("found himself"). Subtext is absent; the story explicitly explains its own symbols as they appear, robbing the narrative of resonance or interpretative depth.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story concludes with explicit moralizing ("She understood now that some debts transcended time...") that explains the theme to the reader. The resonance is asserted through summary rather than emerging organically from the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("not as a monument... but as a promise"). The story explains its own symbols to the reader, leaving little room for subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("faith, not as a command, but as a choice") rather than emerging organically from the conflict. The resolution feels tidy and unearned because the protagonist is not forced to trade anything of value to achieve her realization. The "Thematic Echo" at the end flattens the potential for subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of "futuristic nostalgia" as resistance is coherent but is articulated through explicit summary and dialogue ("We encoded our truth," "reinventing it") rather than emerging from the action. The story relies on the grandmother's final speech to explain the meaning of the events, rather than letting the subtext resonate through the imagery itself.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing dialogue ("The truth is never a straight line") and a summary conclusion. Subtext is minimal, as the story prefers to explain its meaning directly rather than allowing it to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraphs ("some wounds never fully close—and that was okay"), which collapses subtext into a moral summary. The emotional takeaway is told to the reader rather than evoked through the situation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story explicitly explains its own symbols ("The coral and the cast were mirrors") and delivers a sermonizing moral at the end. The theme of healing is told through abstract assertions rather than emerging organically from dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit assertions ("You're a message," "The orchard district wasn’t lost anymore") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The ending summarizes the moral lesson ("stubborn, glorious joy of being alive") instead of allowing the reader to infer meaning from the final image. The "exposed film" metaphor is explained in interiority rather than integrated into the story's structural logic.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit "Thematic Echo" in dialogue ("Certainty is a cage") and summary, rather than emerging from subtext. The ending moralizes the experience, telling the reader what to feel instead of letting the resonance of the image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of resistance is handled didactically, with the "RESIST" Morse code garden rendering the subtext overly literal. The narrative relies on characters stating the theme ("plant our truths") rather than allowing it to emerge organically from struggle or ambiguity. The concept of "taxable thoughts" offers potential depth that the story's straightforward adventure tone does not fully explore.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated via the prompt phrase ("truce between sorrow and dawn") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The conclusion offers a sentimental synthesis that asserts "pain and beauty coexist" while effectively erasing the protagonist's pain (insomnia) via magic.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of evolution over stasis is coherent but articulated too explicitly in the narrative ("Lirael realized then that preservation wasn't about freezing time..."). This overt thesis statement reduces the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly articulated in dialogue ("It’s the promise behind them," "Do you trust enough to be vulnerable?"). This diagnostic label-speak flattens subtext and reduces the thematic resonance to a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("power of compassion, measured link by link") rather than emerging from subtext. The story explains its meaning to the reader repeatedly, reducing the ending to a tidy, sermon-like conclusion rather than a resonant, earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme relies on explicit statement ("Balance, he'd learned...") and pseudo-profound dialogue in a dream ("The echo isn't in the stone"). The connection between "balance" and the final action is tenuous; the text tells us it exists rather than letting it emerge from the conflict. The final line feels tacked on to satisfy a prompt requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies heavily on explicit moralizing, with characters and narration articulating the theme in direct statements ("Sacred spaces are not places but gaps"). This "sermonizing" tendency flattens the subtext, transforming the ending into a didactic lesson rather than a resonant emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than dramatized ("belonging was not about fitting into a preconceived mold"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The final paragraphs descend into platitudes ("not a destination but a journey"), triggering the penalty for explicit moralizing and reducing subtext to zero.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story concludes with an explicit moral statement ("paths disappeared not because..."), which flattens the subtext into a lesson and robs the reader of interpretive work. This didactic summary replaces what should be an emotionally resonant, ambiguous realization.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("Randomness needs a conductor"), violating the show-don't-tell principle and triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The resolution offers a tidy, moralizing lesson rather than a resonant, complex exploration of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of defying erasure through memory is legible and integrated into the action of the verse. However, the thematic work is somewhat didactic, with the text explicitly explaining the "plague of yearning" and the meaning of the fledge rather than letting these meanings emerge organically from the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized through the notebook entry ("even the smallest things can hold the light of the world"), violating the "show, don't tell" principle. This didactic approach replaces earned subtext with a moralizing summary, flattening any potential resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the narrative and dialogue ("fire wasn't just destruction; it was transformation"). The story leaves no room for subtext, preferring to decode its own symbols immediately for the reader. This didactic approach flattens the emotional resonance, reducing the healing arc to a series of platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is announced via high-concept labels ("equations for hope," "serene upheaval") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. Because success comes cheaply, the thematic resonance of "hope" feels unearned and assertive rather than demonstrated through loss or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.9)
    The central theme is explicitly articulated in the diary ("The legacy's burden is not in the keeping..."), violating the "show, don't tell" principle for high-end fiction. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the subtext, turning the discovery into a direct instruction rather than an earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of grief reshaping reality is coherent and poignant, though the ending ("a woman... smiled") leans into sentimentality. The narrative asserts the existence of "possibilities beyond edges" but doesn't fully explore the potentially darker or more complex implications of fracturing reality for personal comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The price of redemption, she knew...", "acceptance of flawed beauty") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative lectures the reader on the meaning of the events instead of allowing the resonance to arise from the treaty's specific compromises.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story struggles with over-articulation. Lines like "meaning was what you manufactured when nature failed you" and the penultimate paragraph's summary ("A reminder that even amoral men could crave grace") explain the subtext rather than letting the imagery resonate. This didacticism undercuts the otherwise potent ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("testament to the quiet defiance," "symphony of resistance") rather than subtext or action. The ending tells the reader exactly how to feel, flattening potential resonance into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is articulated too explicitly in dialogue ("Stories are thieves," "Ethical storytelling isn't about..."), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The characters speak the story's thesis rather than letting it emerge from the subtext of the performance.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing and "Thematic Echo" to convey meaning, particularly in the final paragraphs ("The moth wing... had been a key," "transiently rooted beauty"). The subtext is text; the narrative explains the symbolism to the reader rather than allowing it to resonate through action.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of memory as light is resonant, but the climax—where the mother literally appears and speaks—dissolves the potential for ambiguity into a tidy, sentimental resolution that reduces the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered via sermonizing dialogue ("You were chosen... because your mind dances") and explicit narration ("Mara's story... was a directive in motion"). The ending articulates a moral rather than allowing resonance to emerge from the action, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit dialogue ("bridged the empirical and the ironic") rather than subtext. The ending relies on a summary thesis statement ("found her faith in numbers") that violates the show-don't-tell principle, triggering the thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed, didactic dialogue ("Because this pin is you") rather than emergent action. The story functions as a tidy parable, pre-digesting the moral for the reader and precluding subtext or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of inner vs. outer exploration is coherent but delivered through didactic dialogue and a heavy-handed final realization. The lesson feels imposed by the author rather than emerging organically from the characters' struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit narrator explanation ("Lira had learned that wisdom wasn’t found in grand contracts...") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The concept of "deciduous vows" is stated repeatedly but operates as a label for the magic system rather than a complex thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of nonlinear inheritance is intriguing but is delivered didactically through the voice in the library vision. The story articulates its thesis directly ("You inherit what you choose to see") rather than allowing the meaning to emerge from the subtext of the character's struggle. The result feels more like a parable than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text ("opens only to those who acknowledge their ignorance") rather than emerging organically from the action. The narrative relies on telling the reader the lesson, which flattens the subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The garden isn't a place—it's a choice") rather than emerging organically from action. The story relies on declaring its meaning in dialogue rather than allowing the reader to infer it from the consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.2)
    The concept of "fables of absence" is intriguing but resolved mechanistically as "instructions" rather than explored through subtext or character experience. The theme is stated explicitly in the narrative summary ("she wasn’t just an archivist; she was a weaver") rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    The resolution offers a nuanced thematic landing: rather than banishing the noise, the protagonist integrates it into a natural cycle ("wind through leaves"), reinforcing the theme of balance. This elevates the ending above a simple "good defeats bad" binary.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story explicitly sermonizes its theme ("coincidences are not random"), telling the reader what to think rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action. The ending reduces the narrative to a fable with a stated moral, flattening nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story explicitly states its thesis in the climax ("To sculpt identity... was about letting it shape you"), which flattens subtext and reduces thematic resonance. This overt moralizing prevents the reader from engaging with the complexity of the ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue and narration ("shadows were... unlit potential") rather than emerging organically. The conclusion feels didactic, summarizing the lesson instead of allowing the reader to feel the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is explicitly articulated in dialogue ("transitions aren't meant to be rushed"), violating the show-don't-tell principle for subtext. This overt moralizing flattens the resonance, as the characters explain the story's meaning to one another rather than embodying it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("meaning something precious and quiet," "realizing that the doll’s loss had planted something new"). The story explains its metaphors rather than letting them resonate through subtext, reducing the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.9)
    Themes are delivered through explicit sermonizing ("silence... was full of potential," "teach them to listen") rather than subtext or action. The ending reduces the narrative to a moral lesson, flattening ambiguity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("The future wasn't a place to fear..."), which flattens resonance. The "mirror" metaphor is explained rather than left to linger in subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.5)
    Subtext is externalized into on-the-nose dialogue and narration. The ending explicitly states the moral ("some bridges were meant to be rebuilt"), triggering the penalty for replacing earned resonance with summary sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.5)
    Subtext is collapsed by the device explicitly texting the theme to the reader ("Diamonds are a metaphor"). This meta-commentary substitutes for earned resonance, reducing the thematic arc to a delivered lesson rather than an emergent realization.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text ("The dynasty’s end was never an accident... It was a choice") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending moralizes ("build something new, something transparent") instead of allowing the resonance to linger in the imagery. The story tells the reader exactly how to feel about the legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is coherent but suffers from explicit moralizing in the resolution. The protagonist articulates the thesis ("It was a dance, a pattern to be felt") directly to the reader, converting subtext into text and softening the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing ("magnify the small kindnesses") rather than emerging from the conflict. The resonance feels unearned, relying on the inherent tragedy of the subject matter rather than a specific, dramatized price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed aphorisms ("Indifference kills faster than bullets") rather than narrative subtext. The concept of "erasing history" is treated literally, lacking the nuance or fresh conceptual angle required for literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing in the resolution ("some truths were meant to stay hidden"), reducing resonance. The concept of "negative space" offers potential subtext but is treated as a mechanical plot device rather than a thematic exploration of silence versus noise.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("bridge between worlds," "past met prophecy") rather than emerging organically from the narrative action. The final summation that "the world, for now, made sense" feels unearned given the brevity and lack of struggle preceding it. Subtext is replaced by direct statement of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit summaries and journal entries rather than subtext, triggering the penalty for moralizing. The final "mirror" realization explains the meaning directly to the reader instead of letting the imagery resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffers from severe Thematic Echo; characters explicitly articulate the moral ("Balance isn't about equal parts," "Names have weight") in the climax. The theme is delivered as a lecture rather than emerging from subtext or action, triggering the penalty for explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story relies heavily on characters articulating the themes aloud ("Truth is a crocodile's tooth"), reducing subtext to text. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("Healing... was not a destination"), violating the show-don't-tell principle and flattening the resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "mathematics of mercy" is a compelling setup, but the thematic resolution retreats into a familiar platitude ("it's a choice"). The story sets up a complex psychological inquiry but resolves it with a tidy moral that feels disconnected from the visceral "ultraviolet penance."

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through dialogue and the final narrative summary ("the lesson lingered"), rendering it didactic rather than emergent. The concept of "honoring the overlooked" is stated rather than dramatized through a difficult ethical choice or consequence. The ending reduces the thematic complexity to a moralizing takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.2)
    Subtext is non-existent because the story explicitly explains its own metaphors ("cracks... were emotional, historical"). The ending moralizes the theme ("repair the stories") instead of allowing it to emerge organically from the action, resulting in a didactic rather than resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit narration ("The rupture was not destruction but transformation"), explaining the meaning rather than letting it emerge from action. This didactic summary flattens the subtext and resolves ambiguity too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statement rather than subtext, particularly in the final paragraph's moralizing summary ("Civilizations... were built on the courage..."). This didactic conceptual repricing flattens the narrative resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than dramatized, appearing on the door, in Elias’s dialogue, and in the final narration. This over-articulation leaves little room for subtext or reader interpretation, turning the story into a parable with a clear moral lesson. The repetition of the creed ("mending what isn't torn") leans into didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of curiosity outliving certainty is coherent but articulated too explicitly in dialogue ("You were looking for the place where explanations fail") rather than emerging solely through subtext. The final realization feels summarized for the reader’s benefit rather than dramatized as an inevitable emotional residue of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader (&quot;complexity wasn't a burden; it was a tapestry&quot;) rather than emerging from narrative action. This over-articulation flattens potential subtext, reducing the story to a parable with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and text ("dark nourishes what the light scorches"), robbing the ending of subtext; the resolution offers a didactic moral rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is undercut by the villain explicitly stating the story's subtext with a cliché ("History’s written by the victors") in the climax. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the nuance of the memory-vs-erasure conflict into a familiar trope.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered via explicit authorial statement in the final paragraph ("testament to the power of conception through working memory") rather than emerging organically. This moralizing conclusion flattens the subtext and reduces the narrative to a vehicle for the prompt's concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is coherent but didactic, with the meaning of the prophecy explicitly explained to the reader ("not about disaster, but awakening") rather than emerging through subtext. This over-articulation flattens the potential resonance of the "roots remember" motif.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("the vortex inheritance was a dance of decay") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending summarizes the thematic realization ("discovered the texture") instead of allowing the reader to experience the resonance of the borrowed time through the character's changed state.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing in dialogue ("You're favoring listening over noise"), violating subtext rules. The narrative treats the concept as a lesson to be recited rather than an experience to be felt.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is explicitly stated in expository passages ("She believed that by tracing...") and the ending devolves into a moralizing sermon ("a woman who had learned to find strength"). The explicit thesis statement in the final paragraph replaces dramatic resonance, triggering a penalty for didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered explicitly and didactically through the box’s message, leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. The concept of the "tangled covenant" is asserted rather than explored through narrative particulars, leading to a simplistic moral conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story explicitly states its thesis ("Time, he realized... was a layering") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. The ending devolves into a summary of the moral ("The texture of time passing... was in the way objects held memories"), which robs the reader of the interpretive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than emerging from subtext; phrases like "discover beauty in the incomplete" turn the story into a parable. The ending acts as a moral summary, articulating the thesis directly ("In the incomplete... lay the deepest beauty") which flattens resonance. This explicit moralizing in the final paragraph triggers a significant deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit didactic statements ("This is a bridge," "Pain can be a language too") rather than emerging organically from action. The diary entry labeled *Symbiosis* acts as a signboard for the reader, reducing interpretive depth. The ending moralizes the concept of balance rather than allowing the image of the wire-wrapped tree to speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is delivered as a lecture in dialogue ("Homecoming isn't a formula...") rather than emerging from subtext or action. This heavy-handed explanation flattens the potential for ambiguity or earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but heavy-handed, relying on explicit statements ("dialect of loss," "time was a language") rather than subtextual emergence. The narrative explains the meaning of symbols immediately upon introduction, leaving little room for reader engagement or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and "sermonizing" in the final paragraphs ("distance... became a bridge," "closeness could be forged"). The answer to the final riddle ("love") reduces the narrative to a platitude rather than an earned, resonant insight.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme is coherent but suffers from heavy-handed articulation. The grandmother’s dialogue ("Confusion is just exploration's first draft") and the narrator’s final summary ("True north... was a willingness") explicitly state the thesis, reducing subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than emergent ("guardian of wonder"). The ending suffers from a heavy "Thematic Echo" penalty due to the final paragraph's sermonizing ("In a world full of secrets..."), which flattens resonance into a moral lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is explicitly summarized in the narrative voice ("history wasn’t written by kings... but by the pawns"), removing subtext. The story relies on explaining its meaning rather than allowing it to resonate through the imagery alone.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures from the mother ("Home isn’t a place... but the shape of what you carry") and repeated by the protagonist in the final paragraph ("It’s in the act of remembering"). This overt moralizing and Thematic Echo in the closing beat flattens resonance and violates the show-don't-tell principle.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the final paragraphs ("mistakes were moves, not endings"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The narrative relies on this stated thesis rather than allowing meaning to emerge from subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through didactic dialogue and exposition ("Truth isn't a blade..."), reducing subtext to a moral lesson. The narrative leaves no room for reader interpretation or thematic ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story suffers heavily from "Thematic Echo," where the character explicitly lectures the reader on the meaning of the central concept ("Kintsugi... isn't about perfection. It's about surviving") in the final paragraphs. This reduces subtext to a slogan. The theme is announced rather than emerging organically from the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than dramatized, relying on heavy-handed thesis statements in dialogue ("Temporary eternity") and narrative summary ("to find beauty in the fractures"). The ending moralizes the experience, reducing subtext to a declared lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of connection through silence is consistent, but the execution is somewhat didactic, explicitly stating the moral ("proof was in the silence"). The resonance relies on assertion rather than the complexity of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme is articulated directly in the text ("geography of loss") rather than emerging organically from the action. The resolution offers a tidy fulfillment of the premise without exploring the emotional cost or complexity of disturbing the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme is delivered via heavy-handed exposition ("psychological safety was a currency") and moralizing dialogue ("safety... is a choice"). Subtext is displaced by direct statements of the story's thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the narration and dialogue ("Redemption... had to be earned," "Isolation isn't just about being alone"). This didactic approach flattens the subtext, telling the reader what to feel rather than allowing the meaning to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("not a trap but a mirror," "cartographer of her own heart") to convey meaning. This "Thematic Echo" flattens resonance, reducing the narrative to a parable rather than allowing the theme to emerge from subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("The bleeding starlight is a mirror..."), violating the subtext requirement. This "Thematic Echo" flattens resonance by turning the subtext into text, leaving the reader with a moral rather than an experience. The story preaches its meaning instead of dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit dialogue ("It's for mixing perspective") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story explains its own metaphors, leaving no room for reader interpretation and reducing the thematic resonance to a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("To soar, you must first fall") and a summarizing final paragraph that states the lesson directly. The concept of "feral nostalgia" is repeated as a label rather than developed through subtext. The resolution feels like a thesis statement rather than an earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit summation ("That persistence... was the ordinary miracle") rather than dramatized subtext. The ending "tells" the reader exactly how to interpret the story's meaning, flattening the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The ending explicitly states the moral ("he finally understood: to transform pain into power..."), which flattens the subtext into a lesson. This didactic summary replaces what should have been an emotional resonance achieved through action and image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of "imperfect miracles" is integrated well, serving as both the magical logic and the emotional resolution. The concept of "reconnecting" rather than exorcising provides a fresh angle on the haunting trope, though the execution leans heavily on the convenient magical properties of the prop.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing ("To see the truth, you must first see yourself") rather than allowing subtext to emerge from action. The thematic resolution feels like a sermonizing summary, flattening ambiguity into a tidy, instructional lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of time versus longing is compelling but is undercut by an explicit summary statement at the climax ("clocks... measured longing"). This "telling" of the thesis deflates the subtextual tension built by the imagery, triggering a deduction for explaining the epiphany rather than letting it resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly preached through dialogue and narration ("The physics of letting go," "strongest defense is surrender") rather than emerging from the story's events. Subtext is replaced by overt explanation, turning the narrative into a parable that prioritizes the moral over the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of "chaos vs. order" is coherent but heavily externalized through dialogue and remembered lectures rather than emerging organically from action. The final aphorism ("Contradictions are mirrors") feels slightly sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative relies on explicit moralizing to convey meaning, culminating in a summary statement ("reminder that even wrong numbers could lead somewhere right") that flattens subtext. The "recipe for grief" and similar sentiments read as twee rather than earning resonance through specific, hard-won experience.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit exposition and summary, particularly in the final paragraph ("The covenant’s weight... was in the now"). This didactic approach flattens the subtext and explains the meaning rather than letting it resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through dialogue ("Loneliness is a language"), violating the "show, don't tell" principle for subtext. This didactic approach flattens resonance, as the insight is handed to the reader rather than emerging from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed metaphors ("map... of emotion," "place where feeling becomes seeing") rather than subtext. The story explicitly tells the reader what it means, leaving little room for resonance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit dialogue rather than subtext ("I edit the *why*. You edit the *what*"). The message is preached by the guide character, and the "fever broke" ending reinforces a tidy moral rather than exploring the complexity of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through direct explanation ("Silence has a shape. I just... show it") rather than subtext or action. The story relies on oxymorons ("joyful sorrow," "beauty of loneliness") to simulate depth, resulting in a didactic message that leaves the reader no space for interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is articulated through explicit dialogue ("It's a garden") and a sentimental trope rather than emerging organically from conflict. The ending moralizes the premise instead of letting the subtext resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly preached in dialogue ("breathe life into a shared dream"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The epiphany that "entanglement... was a gift" is asserted rather than emerging organically from the narrative events.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit dialogue ("The labyrinth listens") rather than emerging organically from the action. The ending moralizes the premise, converting subtext into text and reducing the resonant potential of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed sermonizing ("Some truths were too deep for words") rather than emerging from the action. The narrative explains the "lesson" of the story repeatedly via meta-commentary ("The core concept of silent empathy threaded through her actions"). This explicit moralizing at the closure flattens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.0)
    The "unspoken words" mechanic actively works against literary subtext by making the implicit explicit text. The ending theme ("Rebellions start small") feels stated rather than emerging organically from the conflict. The resonance is somewhat forced by the "forests of second thoughts" metaphor rather than earned through the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing to convey its message, culminating in a summary statement ("freedom wasn't found in staying but in detaching") that flattens subtext. The literal command "Detach" carved on the object reduces the theme to an instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition where the protagonist explicitly interprets the symbolism for the reader ("Grief is like these flowers," "Polishing is an act of defiance"). This removes subtextual resonance, turning objects into metaphors before they can exist as real things. The didactic nature of the monologue flattens the emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of art reshaping reality is coherent but delivered through explicit statements ("boundaries between poet and poem... were dissolving") rather than subtext. The text explains the metaphysical shift instead of dramatizing the friction of the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme is explicitly lectured in dialogue ("Beauty isn’t in perfection... It’s in the cracks"), stripping the story of subtext. The ending reinforces this moral didacticism, reducing the interpretative space and resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is stated explicitly in dialogue and narration ("Connection isn't just heard... it's felt," "connection wasn't something to be engineered"), leaving no room for subtext. The ending summarizes the moral lesson rather than allowing it to emerge from the action, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("curtains... were not a cure for grief, but a language for it") rather than emerging through subtext. The story explains its symbols as they appear, leaving little room for reader interpretation or resonance beyond the literal text.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from heavy "Thematic Echo," with characters explicitly articulating the thesis in dialogue ("The crashes didn’t erase culture—they exposed its skeleton"). The theme is delivered as a sermon rather than emerging organically from subtext or action, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and sermonizing dialogue ("The moment we stopped asking why..."). Characters articulate the story's thesis directly to one another, leaving no room for subtext or organic thematic emergence; the "end of innocence" is asserted as a label rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.9)
    Themes are stated explicitly in dialogue ("Metamorphosis of hope") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending book titles literally spell out the moral, reducing resonance to a labeled conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing statements ("Compassion wasn't a liability," "fragility could be a strength"). The ending summarizes the thesis directly, violating the "show, don't tell" mandate and robbing the reader of interpretive agency. Subtext is replaced by declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and dialogue ("Stories are written in scars"). The narrative lectures the reader on how to interpret the symbols rather than allowing the meaning to emerge organically from the action. This over-articulation drains the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("unused love wasn't lost; it was just waiting") rather than emerging organically from the conflict. The resolution offers a sentimental reframing of grief that feels unearned, leaning on aphorism rather than dramatic proof.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("Creativity isn’t trapped. It’s waiting.") rather than dramatized experience. The resolution offers a simplistic, sentimental answer to the central question, lacking subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of stewardship and the necessity of imagination resonates well, supported by the central metaphor of the archive. The transition from guarding dead freight to cultivating living sparks offers a satisfying conceptual coherence, even if the subtext is occasionally made explicit in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("The forest is alive because it remembers") rather than subtext. The narrative explicitly diagnoses its own metaphors ("not a machine, but a *brain*"), leaving no room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing in dialogue ("Courage isn’t a lake... It’s a river"). The story relies on explaining its meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext or action. This over-articulation flattens the resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies heavily on explicit moralizing, culminating in a character reciting the thesis statement ("Safety is not the absence of sound") in dialogue. This didactic approach flattens subtext and reduces the theme to a fable-like lesson, violating the "Thematic Echo" guardrail in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme of truth versus illusion is handled literally through a magical mechanic rather than narrative subtext. The resolution offers a tidy, absolute moral victory ("The throne is empty, and I am its heir") without complexity or ambiguity. The "graceful collapse" is an inserted phrase rather than a resonant thematic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic pivot—that the fossil fuel ban didn't restore the past but awakened a new, stranger reality—is nuanced and avoids simple moralizing. The concept of "healing" as "changing" provides a resonant conceptual repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through didactic dialogue ("It’s about meaning") rather than emerging from subtext or action. This "Thematic Echo" flattens resonance, reducing the concept to a lecture rather than an earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The future wasn't something to fear") in the narrative voice; the resolution offers a tidy, symmetric satisfaction that lacks subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in dialogue and narration ("I want to anchor optimism in realism," "pearl of stillness... was a lens"). The story explains its own metaphors to the reader, violating the show-don't-tell principle and reducing thematic resonance to a stated thesis rather than an emergent property of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit "Thematic Echoes" via the required rhetorical questions ("Why do we cling to fragments?", "What if darkness isn't the absence..."). This heavy-handed telling, culminating in a moralizing final line ("waiting to be rewoven"), flattens the subtext significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of time and erasure are present but delivered through heavy-handed dialogue ("Time slows here because it chooses to"). The concept of "time fragmentation" is stated as a theory rather than dramatized as a felt experience in the narrative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through didactic interiority ("what good was knowledge if it was censored") and moralizing dialogue ("Because the truth matters") rather than subtext. The story preaches a binary message without exploring the complexity or cost of the premise, leaving no room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is heavily over-articulated through explicit summary ("inculcate plants with values," "farm was... a manifesto") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending offers a moralizing thesis statement ("Even in silence, there is voice") that flattens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of translation, resonance, and entropy are coherent and interwoven with the action. The story avoids explicit moralizing, though the emotional resonance is slightly limited by the protagonist's detachment from the "breaking" he witnesses.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explication ("Orbits of regret," "Truth... was a compass") and moralizing dialogue rather than emerging organically from the conflict. The ending reduces the complex premise to a tidy aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is articulated through didactic dialogue ("Harmony requires sacrifice") and summary ("guilt dissolving into understanding") rather than emerging from subtext. The resolution offers a simplistic moral cure for the complex problem of "silencing the world's dissonance."

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story ends with explicit moralizing that explains the theme directly to the reader ("Unlearning... was about making space"), flattening subtext. This constitutes a severe "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing and "telling" the theme ("Erasure was not destruction. It was transformation") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. The use of "aberrant mercy" as a spoken mantra feels forced and didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit, sentimental statements ("Possibility wasn’t a fixed point...") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The resolution offers a tidy, comforting moral that feels unearned given the lack of dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is articulated through explicit dialogue ("The pills were a lie. But this? ... This is real") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending serves as a thematic summary that preaches the conclusion instead of letting the final image resonate with ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("The unknown wasn't empty," "She was a translator") and heavy-handed symbolism, replacing subtext with direct authorial statements about the story's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=2.9)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, with the jar literally speaking the theme ("future is a tapestry") and the protagonist summarizing the lesson in the final thoughts. This didactic approach replaces subtext with sermonizing, preventing any organic thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of renewal is explicitly stated ("Spring was coming, with its promise of renewal") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending moralizes the internal journey ("bluff had given her a gift"), reducing subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("truth often hid in the gaps") rather than subtext or action. The narrative explicitly tells the reader what the symbols mean instead of allowing resonance to emerge organically.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.9)
    The central theme of kindness anchoring reality is poignant, but the execution becomes didactic at the close. The explicit articulation of the lesson ("to shape time, one must first tend to the light within it") in the final paragraph acts as a thematic summary rather than letting the resonant image speak for itself, triggering a penalty for Thematic Echo.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue ("you still have to water the stem") and narrative assertion ("beauty, like light, needed help"). The reliance on explaining the metaphor prevents subtextual resonance, resulting in a sermonizing tone that flattens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in dialogue ("I am not you") and the final book title, leaving little room for subtext or ambiguity. The resolution feels didactic, offering a tidy answer to the problem of existence rather than an earned, resonant insight arising from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in dialogue ("The thread... isn't a secret. It's the courage to share it"), which collapses subtext into a moral lesson. This overt didacticism in the climax prevents genuine resonance and violates the show-don't-tell principle.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of order versus chaos is present but handled superficially through the binary of dissonance and harmony. The ending shifts metaphors abruptly from musical harmony to "power is a river," muddying the thematic coherence. The concept of the "game" is stated rather than emerging organically from the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme of "wistful rebellion" is pasted onto the final line as a label, completely disconnected from the preceding action and internal logic. The story operates as an adventure sequence without deeper subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly preached in dialogue ("Not art. Empathy.") and summarized in the closing lines ("Empathy's never truly dormant"). This didactic approach flattens subtext, reducing the story to a moral lesson rather than an exploration of complex human experience.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story ends with an explicit moral statement ("some truths were worth the risk") that summarizes the theme rather than letting the action speak. This lack of trust in the subtext flattens the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") rather than emerging naturally from the narrative action. This moralizing flattens the subtext, reducing the story's resonance to a surface-level assertion of the prompt's requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed sermonizing ("greed... forces that pulled us in circles") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The conclusion flattens complexity into a tidy moral lesson, explicitly stating the "answer" instead of allowing the reader to experience the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of shared empathy is coherent but delivered through explicit "telling" rather than subtextual resonance. The moment where Lirael realizes "the temple’s heart wasn’t a puzzle to solve, but a mirror to hold" flattens the narrative into a moral lesson. The story explains its meaning to the reader rather than trusting the dramatic action to convey the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of accepting darkness is explicitly stated but narratively undermined. The story concludes she has "strength to carry" the darkness, but the plot reveals she committed no crime, rendering the theme of moral complexity moot.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed lecture ("Fear is a mirror") and platitudes ("the intersection of dreams... was a choice"). The story creates a tidy moral rather than exploring the complexity of its premise, reducing the subtext to surface-level assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing rather than subtext. Phrases like "She saw the boy in the river, not as a failure, but as a lesson" explain the emotional resolution directly to the reader, flattening the resonance. The dialogue often functions as a vehicle for thematic thesis statements rather than natural interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme is clear but lands with a didactic thud in the final paragraph, explicitly explaining the lesson (“not in appraising... but in resurrecting”) rather than allowing it to resonate through image. The ending tells the reader what to feel rather than trusting the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("physics of transition were not cold equations, but stories") rather than emerging from subtext. The result feels fable-like and didactic, effectively telling the reader what to feel rather than earning the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit "Thematic Echo" in dialogue ("You've accepted the contradiction") rather than subtext. The result feels didactic, explaining the story's meaning to the reader instead of letting it resonate from action.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("remind the world of its capacity for connection") rather than allowed to emerge from subtext or action. The ending pivots to unearned sentimentality ("dissolve the walls between hearts"), offering a moralizing summary instead of a resonant, complex image.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is stated explicitly rather than allowed to emerge ("all pointed to a single truth: healing required surrender"). The graffiti acts as a mouthpiece for the thesis, and the narrative summarizes the moral takeaway, reducing resonance to instruction. This heavy-handedness obscures the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through literal exposition ("unspoken words were here") rather than subtext or image. The resolution provides a concrete answer that flattens the mystery, missing the opportunity for a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of choosing authentic simplicity over grand, destructive ambition is coherent and resolves naturally in the final image. The motif of "provenance" vs. "future" adds depth. The resolution avoids moralizing, letting the shattered object speak for the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story explicitly states its thesis in the final paragraphs ("found a strange peace... beauty could endure"), replacing earned resonance with summary. This moralizing flattens the subtext into a simple declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and essayistic summaries ("Forgiveness... was not a weakness but a seed," "Contentment... was a practice"). The ending explains the meaning of the story directly to the reader, removing any subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of embracing nuance is explicitly articulated in dialogue ("Doubt isn't the enemy") rather than emerging organically from action. This reliance on aphoristic summary flattens the subtext and reduces the interpretative space for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme relies on aphoristic binaries ("not leaving but arriving") that feel imposed by the author rather than earned through the characters' conflict. The final line acts as a meta-summary of the theme, flattening the subtext into an explicit lesson rather than letting the resonant image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("The pulse wasn’t something to be chased... it was a guide") rather than subtextual experience. The ending summarizes the moral lesson directly to the reader, flattening the potential for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and narration rather than emerging from the subtext ("sacred in the simple"). The ending devolves into a moralizing sermon that explains the lesson to the reader, robbing the story of resonance. The conflict regarding automated creativity is introduced but abandoned for a simplistic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of synesthesia and memory is handled literally ("Sound is the color of memory" etched on a desk), reducing subtext to text. While the emotional resonance of the ending is coherent, the core concept ("luminous vows") is inserted with awkward meta-phrasing ("the core concept of..."), breaking the narrative spell.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermons ("The backwards prophecy... was a mirror") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative tells the reader exactly what the events mean, leaving no room for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader in the final paragraphs ("The echo of sacrifice, he realized, wasn’t just about loss"). This didactic summary flattens the subtext and resolves the narrative question with an assertion rather than resonant action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of "flawed faith" is resonant but is undercut by explicit telling in the penultimate paragraph ("Not just a bell, but a fragile... faith"). This overt thematic summary replaces subtextual resonance with directive explanation, violating the "show, don't tell" preference at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through dialogue ("spin stories into shared meaning," "memories... need a guardian"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. Subtext is flattened because the secondary character articulates the story's thesis directly to the protagonist, leaving little room for the reader to infer meaning from the action itself.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and lecture-like interiority ("In that moment, she understood: to harmonize... was not to choose"). This "Thematic Echo" flattens subtext into a stated lesson, reducing the story's interpretive depth to a binary binary formula.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial statement ("This place wasn’t a prison—it was a covenant") rather than emerging organically from the conflict. The concept of "trust" is asserted as a label for the solution rather than dramatized as a risky emotional vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through on-the-nose dialogue ("You’re what I could’ve been if I’d given in to fear") and aphoristic closure ("You’re a choice"). Subtext is minimal; the story explicates its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of surrendering control is coherent but is explicitly explained to the reader in the final paragraphs ("The mystery wasn’t in the seed but in the flow..."). This "Thematic Echo" flattens the subtext, converting the narrative's resonance into a stated moral rather than an emergent feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("to restore lost laughter") and the conclusion summarizes the moral ("worth every note"), leaving no space for subtext or reader interpretation. The resonance is flattened by the story's insistence on explaining its own meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty is woven throughout, but the ending relies on a heavy-handed Thematic Echo ("And uncertainty? That was just another word for home"). This converts potential subtext into an explicit moral statement, flattening the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is stated explicitly ("Creative destruction wasn't a theory. It was a choice") rather than emerging from the subtext. This heavy-handed telling reduces the resonance of the final image. The concept of "order is a cage" is standard genre philosophy and is not deepened by the specific action of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative voice ("Endings were merely doorways," "The hush was a language") rather than emerging organically from the action. This didactic approach, particularly the summary of the moral in the final paragraphs, flattens the subtext and reduces resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of "completion vs. salvation" is successfully threaded through the commuters' stories. The ending resonates with the idea of the "permanent transient," though the final constellation image feels slightly fable-like and didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and narration ("texture of connection," "logic and magic") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending falls into the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, summarizing the moral ("connection was not a destination, but a journey") instead of letting the imagery resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of adapting to the unknown is coherent but delivered through explicit, didactic dialogue ("It is not about rigid rules") rather than emergent subtext. The lesson is stated directly to the reader, reducing thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story resorts to explicit moralizing to convey its meaning, summarizing the theme in the final paragraphs ("Incidental heroism... wasn’t about grand gestures"). This lecture-style conclusion flattens subtext and prevents earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme is coherent but culminates in an explicit summary ("cables... were memorials") rather than resonating through subtext. The reflection on "proof he'd existed" is standard for the genre and told rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. Explicit statements like "failure and wisdom intertwined" and "I hear the future... it’s messy" reduce subtextual resonance, turning the ending into a summarized moral rather than an earned experience.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative explains its subtext explicitly ("In that moment, she understood... It was a mirror"), leaving no room for reader interpretation. The protagonist shouting the theme ("I am the extinction!") flattens the resonance into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of civilization versus primal chaos is integrated well through the "static" of confessions. The "harmony untamed" concept lands effectively, though the mentor’s italicized wisdom feels a bit like a billboard for the theme rather than organic subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story explicitly lectures the reader on its theme in the final paragraphs ("Lira finally understood: breaking free wasn't about destruction..."), turning subtext into text. This moralizing flattens the narrative resonance and reduces the ending to a summary statement rather than an earned experience. The insight feels imposed by the author rather than arising organically from the drama.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative sermonizes the theme explicitly ("healing wasn't in grand gestures... It was in the small... acts"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. This summarizing explanation flattens the subtext and robs the ending of resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Elio’s motivation had always been...", "He knew now that...") rather than dramatized experience. The story explains its meaning to the reader instead of allowing subtext to emerge from action. The ending offers a platitude about "new beginnings" that feels tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in dialogue ("Analog memories... don't just inform—they transform") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The resolution offers a tidy, stated moral rather than a resonant, complex image.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the final paragraphs ("not a thing to capture, but a force to embrace"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The resolution flattens complexity into a tidy moral statement, leaving no room for subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the final paragraph ("realized that... some secrets, once spoken, could heal"), collapsing subtext into a lecture. The "idea" remains an abstract concept throughout, preventing genuine emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures in dialogue ("They were never gone. Just... misplaced") and narrative summary ("Habits might break, but curiosity? That was eternal"). This overt moralizing replaces subtext and resonance. The story interprets itself for the reader, leaving no room for ambiguity or lingering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated in exposition ("exile is reversible," "mentored resilience") rather than emerging from subtext. This over-articulation flattens the potential for resonance, turning the story into a parable with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of renewal and preservation is coherent, but the ending relies on explicit moralizing ("she knew now that wonder was not a finite thing"). This "Thematic Echo," where the character articulates the thesis directly, flattens the subtext and reduces the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue ("Silence isn't always kindness"), substituting lecture for organic, subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of "silence as language" is intriguing but is undercut by didactic summary in the final paragraphs ("To reopen the chapel meant... to find empathy"). The story explains its subtext explicitly rather than allowing the imagery and action to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "letting go as transmission" lands a legible Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the resonance is blunted by the heavy-handed explicit labeling of the concept ("the physics of letting go") rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.8)
    Theme is handled through explicit telling rather than subtext; the narrator explains exactly what each symbol means and what emotion it conveys. The conclusion ("Maybe, just maybe...") is a clichéd summary that attempts to force resonance the scene hasn't earned. The concept of "unspoken needs" is paradoxical given how clearly they are spelled out in the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue and diary entries ("joy and anguish are twins") rather than emerging from subtext. The resolution feels like a symmetric satisfaction of a prompt requirement rather than an earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme is heavily explicated rather than dramatized. The journal entry ("Clouds are not weather...") and the final summary ("she felt it: the spooled wholeness") serve as moralizing signposts that reduce subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of preservation through transformation is coherent, but the story relies on explicit summarization at the end ("silent hymn to limits overcome") rather than letting the final image resonate on its own. The lesson feels delivered rather than discovered through the action.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly summarized in the final line ("not just a place, but a truth"), robbing the ending of resonance. The "truth" remains an abstract McGuffin rather than an earned insight derived from the narrative action.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of "mending time" is cohesive but delivered through explicit summary and moralizing ("gentle reminder that time... could always be mended") rather than emerging from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story ends with explicit moralizing that summarizes the theme ("hope was not a solitary pursuit"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The theme is delivered via sermonizing dialogue and narration rather than emerging organically from subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("Perfection is a lie," "It’s the cracks that let the light in") rather than subtext. Using a well-known Leonard Cohen sentiment as a grandfather's folk wisdom flattens the thematic originality and feels derivative.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of finding order in chaos ("graceless beauty") and the burden of stewardship is well-integrated. The ending reinforces the cyclical nature of the curse without feeling futile, offering a resonant moment of duty fulfilled at a personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story explicitly states its themes in dialogue ("I think… it’s about what we let go") and narrative summary ("separation isn’t an end"). This "sermonizing" approach replaces subtext with thesis statements, preventing the theme from emerging organically.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("In that moment, she understood: stories didn’t begin in grand gestures..."), violating the show-don't-tell principle for theme. The insight feels delivered by the narrator rather than earned through the character's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central metaphor of cooking as a way to temper raw emotion is executed with sophistication, avoiding heavy-handed moralizing. The ending achieves a "nourishing the present" resolution that feels earned and conceptually distinct from simple forgiveness. The thematic synthesis of "salt" (tears/ocean/seasoning) ties the disparate elements of the fortress and the kitchen together seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.9)
    The story relies heavily on explicit moralizing, utilizing the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern where the protagonist states the thesis ("constructing bridges from silos") and delivers a sermon at the end. The subtext is text; the narrative preaches the value of connection rather than dramatizing the difficulty of achieving it.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text ("archeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than allowed to emerge from the subtext. The resolution reinforces this stated theme without adding complexity or ambiguity, resulting in a somewhat tidy and moralizing conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("not in grand gestures, but in the margins") rather than dramatized through subtext or conflict. The ending relies on a summarizing platitude ("The world was full of doors...") that flattens resonance, treating the "seeds of vigilance" as a collectible rather than a complex idea.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative voice ("to prove that even without sound...") and summarized in a moralizing final sentence. The concept of "empathy in motion" is applied as a label rather than emerging organically from character action.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and thought ("beauty lies in constraints") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending delivers a moralizing summary ("covenant lived... in the quiet correlation") instead of allowing the imagery to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than subtextual, with the diary entry and final paragraphs serving as sermons ("Silence is not the absence of sound," "path to empathy"). The ending moralizes directly to the reader, violating the "show, don't tell" principle and triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly preached through dialogue ("Chaos and serenity... are not enemies"), flattening subtext. The moral is delivered as a lesson rather than emerging organically from the narrative experience.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of symbiosis is delivered through explicit summary ("Lira realized...") rather than subtext or action. The ending moralizes ("willingness to bend") and reduces the narrative to a fable-like lesson, flattening the potential for nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of industrial animism is present but explicitly stated ("the machine was hungry") rather than subtextually earned. The conclusion relies on a tagline-style summary ("never truly sleep") that feels reductive rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("Wonder isn't a luxury... truth is essential") rather than emerging from subtext or action. This sermonizing approach flattens the narrative into a moral lesson, violating the show-don't-tell principle.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of "unmaking" and silence is coherent, but the execution falls into the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern where the mentor explicitly states the moral ("The flute’s power lies not in its sound, but in its silence"). This didacticism flattens the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("Emotions weren’t variables... but rhythms to be felt") rather than subtext or action. The final paragraph summarizes the moral lesson, replacing narrative pressure with a didactic conclusion. This over-articulation flattens the ambiguity and reduces the reader's engagement with the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the final summary ("absence... was a germination"), robbing the ending of resonance. The narrative relies on the narrator explaining the metaphor's meaning rather than letting it emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of projection versus perception is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The ending explicitly states the lesson ("arbor’s hush wasn’t a mystery to solve, but a mirror") rather than letting the imagery carry the resonance, resulting in a somewhat moralizing conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of sacrifice for distant connection resonates well with the fable format. The ending successfully recontextualizes the silence not as an absence, but as a medium for weaving meaning, offering a satisfying Conceptual Repricing of the initial problem.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in dialogue ("Resilience isn’t born from safety..."), collapsing subtext into a moral lesson. The story relies on stated significance rather than allowing meaning to emerge from the action, resulting in a didactic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("The shard isn’t just a key. It’s a choice"), which flattens subtext and didacticizes the emotional arc. The story leans on the trope of "some doors shouldn't be opened" without subverting it or exploring the specific consequences of that truth, leaving the resonance thin.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly explained to the reader rather than emerging from subtext. The text states, "The letters... were a way to protect that feeling, to bottle it in gestures and words," which triggers the Thematic Echo penalty. This diagnostic summary flattens the potential resonance of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing to convey meaning, particularly the thematic summary in the final paragraphs ("dawn wasn’t just a time of day. It was a choice"). This overt thesis statement replaces subtextual resonance, triggering a penalty for Thematic Echo.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition in the final paragraphs ("She realized then...", "Lin knew what she had to do"). The ending summarizes the moral ("some stories are meant to be shared") rather than letting the resonance emerge organically from the image.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition and moralizing summaries ("Sorrow... could be measured," "Even in decay, there was beauty") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The final paragraph falls into the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, stating the lesson directly to the reader instead of letting the image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue and narration ("Through forgotten songs, we remember how to live"). The story explains its symbols immediately ("woven dawns") instead of allowing subtext to emerge from action, leading to a didactic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing and aphorisms ("Wisdom lies in mistakes") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from subtext. The final realization is stated directly in the narration ("hiding wasn’t about retreat"), flattening the resonance into a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in the text ("He understood... The creeping normality wasn’t something to fear"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The final paragraphs explain the story's meaning rather than allowing resonance to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of preserving memory is coherent but handled with sentimentality, treating the vows as unambiguous goods. The resolution confirms the premise without complication or nuance, missing the opportunity for a resonant reconfiguration of what it means to save a dying past.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of silence versus truth is coherent, and the ending successfully recontextualizes the father's legacy. The execution leans heavily on literalized metaphors ("sound of trust breaking," "trust breaks so beautifully"), which makes the subtext textual and slightly melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of balance and releasing pain is coherent but delivered via explicit exposition in dialogue ("The trees vote on whether to absorb..."). This didactic approach flattens the subtext, converting a moment of potential mystery into a direct thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narration ("rectify the silence," "confront the ghost") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending relies on asserting the protagonist's emotional state ("felt truly seen") instead of allowing the imagery to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of truth versus comforting lies is coherent but heavy-handed. The story suffers from a Thematic Echo where the Keeper explicitly states the core concept ("Candor in small moments") in dialogue, and the final paragraph summarizes the moral ("Truth... was nourishment"), which violates the show-don't-tell preference for resonant endings.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("symphony was not just sound—it was truth made audible") rather than subtext or action. The ending pivots to a moralizing summary that explains the meaning of the story to the reader, robbing the final image of organic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("Maybe that was the secret... not to eradicate the static, but to live with it"). This "explaining the lesson" undercuts the narrative resonance, replacing subtext with a summary of the story's intended meaning. The concept of "fragmented wholeness" is asserted rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("testament to love's endurance") rather than subtext or action. The ending reduces the complex tragedy of war and lost love to a tidy, sentimental summary that tells the reader exactly how to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("Vulnerability is not weakness") and moralizing narration rather than subtext. The story tells the reader what to feel instead of earning the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is coherent but resolved through explicit summarization in the final paragraph ("He no longer feared... for he’d found..."). This "explain-everything" approach flattens the resonance, replacing earned subtext with a moral lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("silence was not emptiness but a language") rather than emerging organically from action. The story relies on asserting profoundness ("unravel the storm brewing in the stars") instead of earning resonance through specific, grounded particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    The concept of "lying to the truth" to wake the building is a clever thematic inversion that lands well at the end. However, resonance is dampened by the explicit, heavy-handed simile equating truth's fleeting nature to the meteor shower.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("translated her isolation into independence") rather than subtext or action. The story explicitly explains the moral to the reader in the final paragraphs, leaving no room for resonance or interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of benevolent forgery is compelling, but the story relies on explicit thesis statements (e.g., "Her forgeries were not acts of rebellion but of forgiveness") to convey it. Subtext is crowded out by the narrator’s desire to explain the moral calculus directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered via explicit lecture ("The echoes are not just sound") rather than dramatized experience, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The ending summarizes the moral instead of allowing resonance to emerge from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme of connection is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("Windows... were fragile things") and a sentimental resolution that tidies up grief too neatly. The ending relies on a moralizing summary of how everyone will feel better, rather than earning that resonance through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by the narrator explicitly stating the lesson ("To appreciate hidden effort, he believed, was to honor the unseen labor") rather than allowing it to emerge from action. The result is didactic, with the character articulating the thesis in prompt-like language.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of exposing "comfortable lies" is stated but conflicts with the ending, where Mara effectively buries the mechanism of the truth to save the orchard. The resonance is somewhat flattened by the contradictory "keep digging" tagline.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.5)
    Themes are delivered through heavy-handed exposition and sermonizing dialogue ("The wheel turns, but the axle rusts"). The story shouts its subtext ("humanity’s salvation lay in embracing its own fragility") instead of allowing it to emerge organically from the narrative. The result is a piece that feels like a vehicle for a thesis rather than a resonant story.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme relies on sentimental assertions about "sweetening silence" rather than earned resonance. The meta-fictional drafting notes undercut the earnest tone, confusing the thematic intent.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is explicitly preached in dialogue ("It’s a bridge") and narration ("some battles were won not with force, but with harmony"). This overtly moralizing approach displaces subtext, reducing the ending to a summary statement.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("To unyoke the world, one must first unyoke oneself") rather than subtext. The inclusion of an acolyte solely to ask the protagonist to explain the moral triggers a significant "Thematic Echo" penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    The pivot to "empirical observation" as a thematic resolution contradicts the narrative's heavy reliance on supernatural visions and a lucky discovery. The parallel between historical abolitionism and a modern workplace conspiracy feels largely cosmetic, lacking the depth required to make the resonance earned.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.2)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit moralizing and the forced insertion of the prompt phrase as a "fragment of poetry." The message of redemption is stated directly in the narrative rather than emerging from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of translating "yearning into motion" is coherent and woven through the "algorithm" concept. The ending offers a resonant image of the "hum" rather than a simple ring, but the resolution feels slightly tidy and fable-like, lacking a lingering question or complex ambiguity to deepen the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("Some truths aren't meant to be found") and narration, leaving little room for subtext. The concept of memory vs. erasure is handled through assertion rather than organic development.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered via explicit lecture ("proven that courage wasn't...") rather than emergent subtext. The final paragraph creates a sermonizing effect that flattens the narrative into a simple moral lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is explicated in dialogue ("We all are") and narration ("The fold in patience, she realized..."), reducing subtext to a stated moral. The connection between the "fold in patience" and the rescue feels asserted as a thesis statement rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.5)
    Themes are explicitly preached through dialogue ("Harmony isn't silence") and narrative exposition rather than emerging from subtext. The result is a didactic "moral of the story" that replaces organic resonance with sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.5)
    Themes of "wisdom" and "balance" are asserted through exposition and dialogue ("The echo is preserved") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative acts as a delivery system for these abstract concepts without testing them against a counter-argument or reality. The result is a moralizing tone that lacks resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story explicitly states its theme in a sermonizing manner ("The lesson lingered: healing wasn't about erasing the past..."). Subtext is nonexistent as the narrative explains the meaning of every symbol and moment directly to the reader, leaving no room for interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statement ("Growth, he realized, wasn’t linear") rather than emerging organically from action. The epiphany feels didactic, explaining the meaning to the reader instead of allowing it to resonate through subtext or implication. The result is a sermonizing effect that flattens the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.5)
    The ending explicitly summarizes the theme ("didn't need to see the future anymore"), flattening resonance; the "tidal longing" is asserted as a label rather than emerging organically from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text ("defying time's tyranny," "hymn to transience") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The result is a narrative that tells the reader what it means rather than letting them feel it.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly preached to the reader through exposition ("hymning the mundane," "vessels of meaning") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The story tells the reader exactly how to interpret the events ("truth of it settled... heavy and clear"), leaving no room for resonance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of cyclical magic and time is present but handled literally. The connection between the "sealed awakenings" and the "shadows at noon" is asserted through exposition rather than developed through thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("forgiveness wasn't about...") rather than subtext. The explicit moralizing at the conclusion flattens the narrative into a parable.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "light as a loan" and "stillness" is coherent and shapes the ending, but the subtext is often made explicit in dialogue or narration ("Elara felt no pride, only relief") rather than emerging organically from action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is coherent but overtly stated in dialogue, violating subtext rules. Characters articulate the thesis ("healing wasn’t about erasing the past," "grafting requires vulnerability") directly to one another, which flattens the resonance into a lesson rather than an emergent property of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly preached through dialogue ("endings aren’t walls—they’re doors") and summarized in the final paragraph, violating the subtext rule. This reliance on aphorism flattens the narrative into a parable with a tidy moral, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is articulated through explicit moralizing ("sacred practices need tenders," "magic isn't lost") rather than emerging organically from the action. This didactic approach reduces subtextual resonance and leaves little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story relies on explicit explanation of the theme ("It was not just a guide to the stars—it was a guide to the heart") rather than allowing it to resonate through subtext. This over-articulation at the climax serves as a moral summary that flattens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly articulated in dialogue (&quot;Wonder is a fragile thing... must be bottled&quot;), leaving little room for subtextual resonance. The tension between preserving wonder and the &quot;grave&quot; of reason is resolved too neatly, bypassing the complexity of the central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of distinguishing between burdens to be transformed and those to be endured is coherent and resonant. The execution relies heavily on explicit wisdom statements from the mentor and mother, which blunts the subtextual power slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing to deliver its theme. The final paragraphs summarize the lesson ("Loss wasn’t an ending, but a transformation," "This is how we survive") directly to the reader, replacing subtext with essayistic assertion. This over-explanation deflates the narrative resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly articulated by the ghost in the climax ("Because you haven't forgiven yourself"), which flattens the subtext into a moral lesson. This didactic approach robs the final action of its resonance, as the story explains its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered via explicit sermonizing ("repurpose the old into the new," "formula for hope") rather than emerging organically from the action. The story relies on telling the reader what the events signify ("This wasn't resurrection in the traditional sense") instead of allowing the subtext to resonate through the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of silence vs. resonance is well-developed through the central metaphor of the singing floor. However, the dialogue ("You’re here to remind me") and the explicit internal monologue ("wondered if silence could be a kind of violence") state the subtext a bit too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.7)
    The theme ("architecture of lies") is stated explicitly in interiority and on-page documents rather than emerging from subtext or conflict. The story creates a didactic "lesson" about truth but fails to dramatize the complexity or price of uncovering it, resulting in a flat, lecture-like resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The industrial age had erased so much," "It was the act of preservation itself") rather than subtext or action. The ending reduces the narrative to a stated thesis, preventing genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermons and on-the-nose metaphors ("healing was not a destination but a geography") rather than subtext or action. The ending serves as a moral summary that explains the meaning to the reader, triggering the penalty for explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly summarized in the final paragraph ("truest beauty of all"), replacing organic resonance with didactic moralizing. The concept of "flawed genesis" is stated as a label rather than emerging from the narrative action.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.5)
    The final paragraph devolves into explicit moralizing ("Compassion, she thought, wasn't about..."), summarizing the theme rather than letting the imagery do the work. The "scars could sing" motif feels repetitive and forced.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.8)
    Themes are explicitly stated in summary ("liberation a testament to...") rather than emerging from subtext. Symbolic elements like a book titled *The Art of Forgetting* are overly literal, flattening potential resonance into simple allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in dialogue and narration ("Generational patterns weren’t chains—they were bridges"), which flattens the subtext. The story delivers a moral lesson rather than allowing meaning to emerge organically from the character's actions and consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and reiterated in the poem ("Grief is not a hole, but a door"), reducing subtext to overt moralizing. This direct articulation of the thesis prevents organic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the rake's inscription and summarized in the final paragraph ("honoring the incremental"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. This moralizing approach flattens subtext, delivering the meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The dead were not silent") and abstract nouns rather than subtext or action. The realization about "intentions" feels unearned because there was no struggle to uncover it.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story delivers its themes through lecture-like interiority ("Innovation thrives in constraint") rather than dramatized subtext. The ending offers a tidy moral victory that validates the protagonist fully, lacking the complexity or ambiguity of literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through direct statement ("teach dust to tell stories," "The dust remembers") rather than subtext or action. The narrative acts as a delivery system for its own thesis, resulting in an earnest but heavy-handed execution.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Safety is an illusion, and art is the only truth worth chasing") rather than emerging from the subtext of the action. This didactic approach flattens the potential for resonance and tells the reader what to feel instead of earning it.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is articulated too explicitly in dialogue ("The plague didn’t kill Veyra... We did. By forgetting," "Time isn’t linear"). This reliance on characters stating the thesis reduces subtextual resonance and feels like an intrusion of the author's intent. The ending reaffirms the thesis verbally rather than letting the image speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme is delivered through didactic thought bubbles and explicit lessons ("grandmother, who had taught her..."). The story asserts its profundity ("hatred... was a kind of noise") rather than allowing subtext to emerge from dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit dialogue and thought ("create something beautiful from the ruins") rather than emerging organically from the action. The ending leans into moralizing, presenting a tidy validation of the protagonist's worldview without engaging with the complexity of erasing history to achieve beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("The tower runs on the collective awe") and moralizing dialogue ("We can choose to wonder again"). Subtext is absent, as the story explicitly diagnoses its own meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("hush wasn't emptiness; it was potential"), reducing resonance to a summary statement. The story explains its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the text (“To welcome nuance into a certainty”), which flattens the subtext into a moral lesson rather than an earned resonance. The shift from "tragedy" to "sacrifice" is told to the reader in a summary block rather than experienced through the scene's action. The "nuance" mentioned is not dramatized in the solution, which is a binary "drink potion, fix ocean" mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of grief as a "space between" rather than a possession is poignant and earned by the final image of the orbiting dice. While the explicit statement of the theme ("texture of that loss") is slightly heavy-handed, the resolution offers a resonant answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("Kindness... was a language," "To love is to translate") rather than allowed to emerge from subtext. This moralizing flattens the emotional resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of cultural preservation is coherent but lands as platitudinous due to the lack of narrative friction. The reliance on the label "rosewater dread" substitutes for dramatized emotional depth, making the hopeful ending feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of defying fate is central but articulated somewhat explicitly in dialogue ("Step beyond fate") and narration. The ending resonates with the premise, though the "world would never be the same" tag is a bit generic.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit, didactic dialogue ("Fear is a lie," "Truth that survives") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The narrative relies on characters stating the moral argument, which flattens the potential for resonance or ambiguity. The ending reinforces this telling-over-showing approach.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The explicit articulation of the thesis ("Obstacles are just instruments...") in both dialogue and the final narrative summary constitutes a "Thematic Echo," reducing resonance by stating what should be implied.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.0)
    The final Conceptual Repricing—recontextualizing the city as a larder or prison—lands with emotional weight. However, it depends heavily on the expository journal entries rather than organic subtext, making the theme feel slightly told rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures and on-the-nose inscriptions ("Truth is not a weapon. It’s a seed"), leaving no room for subtext. The ending reduces the narrative to a moral lesson ("Historians, after all, were gardeners of memory") rather than an earned resonance arising from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme is explicitly defined for the reader ("She believed it referred to...") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending relies on a summarizing moral ("Abandoned dreams... were not lost") that flattens the ambiguity into a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures in the journal and narration ("city lost to itself") rather than subtext. The final paragraph sermonizes the prompt phrase ("reclaimed stillness") instead of letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story explicitly articulates its theme ("To transform was to carry the old into the new") in the final third, collapsing subtext into a lesson. This direct moralizing prevents the reader from engaging in interpretive work.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story suffers from heavy-handed thematic articulation, particularly in the final paragraphs where the protagonist’s transformation is explicitly labeled ("She was a disrupter"). This "telling" undermines the resonance of the imagery, violating the show-don't-tell standard for high-end literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit dialogue ("It’s not a place. It’s a resonance") rather than subtext or action. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the potential for genuine resonance at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of the weight of silence and the cost of buried truth is coherent and resolves effectively in the final decision. While the execution is somewhat heavy-handed and explicit ("The sieved hush had to be broken"), the story commits fully to its thematic argument.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed aphorisms in dialogue ("Neutral territory isn't a place. It's a choice") rather than emerging from subtext. While the final image of the falling pull successfully dramatizes the theme of "letting go," the preceding sermonizing weakens the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit dialogue and summary rather than subtext. The final paragraph moralizes the "backlash of regrets" directly, violating the "show, don't tell" preference for closure and reducing the resonance of the final image. This didactic approach limits thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme is intelligible but delivered through on-the-nose dialogue that explains the subtext ("That’s what empathy is..."). This explicit sermonizing in the climax flattens the resonance, replacing organic realization with a thesis statement. The "mosaic" metaphor is effective but over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is coherent but undermined by the explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("metamorphosis is not an ending..."). The fortune cookie provides a heavy-handed frame that explains the subtext rather than letting the imagery resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of grief is clear, but the story relies on a "Thematic Echo" in the final dialogue ("Repentance isn't a place. It's a choice") to state the moral explicitly. This reduces subtextual resonance and flattens the complexity of the penance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader by the AI ("You fear that to engage is to become the monster") and the narration. This heavy-handed moralizing flattens the subtext into a simple lesson about courage, leaving little room for ambiguity or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is delivered via "talking head" exposition ("Fixing isn’t transformation... It’s stitching old wounds") rather than dramatized action. The protagonist’s final epiphany is an internal monologue that restates the lesson she was just fed, lacking subtextual ambiguity or earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through direct explanation ("wasn’t a place but a idea") rather than subtext or action. The symbolism of light and sparks is heavy-handed, leaving little room for reader interpretation or resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story relies on a "Thematic Echo" in the final paragraph, explicitly stating the moral ("not a puzzle to solve, but a language to honor") instead of letting the image resonate. This didacticism flattens the subtext at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is explicitly explained ("To rarefy: to purify... Kael wanted to do the same") and then restated in the character's poetry. This "thematic echo" leaves little room for subtext or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("Turn questions into destinations") and summarized in the final paragraph ("found not answers, but better questions"), leaving no room for subtext. The ending relies on a moralizing summary rather than allowing the imagery to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the climactic note ("To forge beauty from anarchy, you must first become the anarchy"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (-0.6). Subtext is replaced by direct instruction to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of planning versus improvisation is legible but delivered through heavy-handed symbols like the "mood indicator" compasses. The ending evades the complexity of the premise by providing a simple escape rather than a reconfiguration of the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit dialogue ("Memory is not a cage but a compass"), reducing subtext to a sermon. The story relies on characters stating the thesis rather than letting it emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and explicit moralizing ("Patience is not stillness," "The severance isn't a wall. It's a door"). This didactic approach leaves little room for subtext or reader interpretation. The emotional resonance is asserted by the narrator rather than emerging organically from the action.

Final image refuses moralizing; plants dancing to unheard music re-prices the premise—silence is not absence but medium.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of silence: imposed quiet becomes chosen communal voice. The bell’s re-clappering with a spoon is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights silence as celebration. No final-paragraph moralizing; the last line “who listens” invites reader complicity. Subtext resides in gesture—notes tied to pillars, hand squeeze—rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of inherited resilience emerges through the vial-names and the choice to scatter rather than stockpile, avoiding explicit thesis. The final image reweights the premise: seeds as weapons, not food, enact conceptual repricing without moralizing. Counter-readings (is growth now dependent on violence?) linger plausibly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as the alchemy of theft into gift; no character moralizes. The re-illuminated photograph’s laughter becomes the non-literal answer, reweighting “stolen light” into “shared light,” while the wilted lily silently signals the cost—subtext over statement.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: fracture as prerequisite for light. Subtext lives in gesture—tracing the crack, aligning it with sunbeam—never sermon. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing, meeting the 9+ quick test, but the earlier self-narration (“Its resistance mirrors…”) edges toward explicit thematizing, a −0.2 drag.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of “vulnerability as power” emerges through shell’s voice and Lila’s trembling standoff, not thesis statement. Final image—shell withheld on café table—reweights earlier betrayal into conditional trust, resonance without moralizing. Subtext lives in Marisol’s shaking hands and Lila’s refusal, not dialogue. Some late articulation of vulnerability edges toward echo but is saved by embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges obliquely: art appropriates absence only by diminishing the lived world. Subtext resides in the image of gold leaf becoming starlight that no longer exists outside the scroll. No character moralizes; the final glow reweights earlier “ambered hush” as consumable resource. Ambiguity lingers—has she preserved or annihilated the silence?—without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: mundane labor as locus of metaphysical inquiry. Recurrent images—snow, sweep, music—shift from sterile to cosmically networked without overt thesis. Final line’s quiet joy lands as earned stasis, avoiding preachiness.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: honesty after language exhausts itself is shown through tactile ritual, not thesis. The lens-shaped doodle that closes the piece reprises the projector glass, reweighting it from mere magnifier to charter of a new vocation—an imagistic answer to the core question. Subtext thrives in gesture: Lira’s hand on Elias’s shoulder conveys trust transfer more potently than any manifesto. The piece resists tidy moral binaries; silence is both refuge and risk, an ambiguity the ending owns rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the accumulating marble ledger: brokenness as biography, not blemish. Subtext lives in gesture—handing Joren a cracked marble silently argues that flaws are data, not shame. Final image reframes “withering” as generative: the maze blooms because of wounds, not despite them. No explicit moralizing; the reweighting is felt, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges sideways: the human appetite to tinker with time mirrors the alien flora’s “subdued awakenings.” Final image of Veyra smiling at the lever reframes curiosity as compulsion—an earned, ambiguous note. No moral is stated; the resonance lingers through the nexus’s low hum.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of “in-between spaces” emerges through action—pit as literal limbo, music as unfinished conversation between living and dead. No overt thesis statements; meaning accrues via soggy paper, half-submerged drums, breath-held theater. Final whispered promise offers resonant non-literal answer: art as collaboration with the absent. Avoids moralizing, though the concept flirts with abstraction once too often for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of margins, cracks, and roots: fault-tolerance reframed from machine virtue to human fracture. Final reprise (“soil’s thin…world shows its cracks”) offers quiet resonance without moralizing. The swallowed-truth metaphor stays implicit; the bearberry’s shifting meaning carries the conceptual weight, satisfying the 9+ quick test for non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges cleanly: corporate cowardice, not ghosts, haunts places. Subtext carries in hologram stutter and final abandonment of wheel—no closing moral states thesis. Ambiguity lingers: Elias neither exposes nor forgets, embodying unresolved complicity. Resonance is solid though not startling; “truth drowned” edges thematic echo but is embedded in image, not abstract sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—knowledge as burden, silence as liberation—emerges imagistically via crumbling shelves vs. black river. Final image reweights prior motifs without moralizing: abandoned swan equals relinquished taxonomy. Ambiguity lingers (is silence enlightenment or annihilation?) inviting reflection. One minor drift: “regenerative” is authorial shorthand rather than dramatized concept.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges without sermon: “ordinary magic” is redefined from trinket to participatory act. Subtext lives in Mara’s silence and eventual pocketing; no thesis line closes the piece. Final image (Mara now custodian of wonder) re-prices the concept with social cost. Ambiguity is preserved: wonder may still fail—story doesn’t guarantee permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the accretion of charred diaries and embroidered dragons: memory survives only when actively heard. Subtext operates in the reversed dragon flight—creatures flee not battle but collective deafness—an image that re-weights its first appearance at closure. No moralizing sentence tells us “stories matter”; the rising chorus dramatizes the insight. Ambiguity remains: will Elias steward or be consumed by the voices, letting the idea linger effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—“open secrets” as slow, invisible revolution—emerges through the cookie image; the reader feels how everyday objects weaponize banality. Subtext operates in the flare: public safety device turned clandestine call, reweighting “guidance” into “command.” No character moralizes; thematic insight crystallizes only in final image, earning resonance. Some thematic echo creeps in father’s letter (“orchestrate a new world”), mildly preaching what is already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the sonic praxis itself: assumptions are circuitry painted visible by indigo sound. No final paragraph moralizing; the last line—“leave room for the unexpected”—is an imagistic instruction spoken in-scene, not thesis tag. The reconfiguration lands as CR: the rule-set of reality is repriced—stability is no longer stillness but dynamic tension. Ambiguity lingers: flux may be wonder or terror; complexity is embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of self-acceptance emerges through iterative sampling of lives rather than overt thesis. “Darkening brightness” motif returns reweighted at end, now read as beauty of impure, lit dusk rather than ideal glare. Subtext resides in silent tablet crumble—wisdom that maps are external yet path is muscle. Avoids moralizing, lets image do repricing; complexity acknowledged but not deeply paradoxical.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the inversion of silence from void to vessel; no character states the thesis—Elias’s “Silence isn’t empty. It’s a container” is the closest, spoken mid-scene with causal weight. The final image of seasons turning while students feel rhythm through the floor offers a resonant, non-moral answer: emotional life persists in muted containers, not in restored “sound.”

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of bearing witness emerges through the recorder’s transformation from weather tool to evidence vault, avoiding explicit slogans. The ash-storm as lying government metaphor is understated; the burnt note image re-prices solitude as complicity refused. Subtext in the woman’s rasped “They’re calling it a flu” carries the cynicism without lecture. Final recorder log line risks a tidy moral stamp, slightly compressing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: grief as inherited love, not pathology. No explicit thesis lines; the final image of breathing city smoke without flinch reweights earlier scent-aversion into acceptance. Subtext operates through silent handling of the vial and the choice to inhale—gesture over declaration. The perfume-as-memory-bridge motif recurs with shifting emotional charge, satisfying the “returning image that shifts meaning” path. Avoids sentimentality; complexity lingers in the ambiguity of whose memory she tasted.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: abandoned art = abandoned selves; no explicit moralizing. Subtext carried by object handling—rope turns from escape gear to autobiography without authorial nudge. Final image re-prices earlier whimsy: the “weaver of maybes” now faces an unbreakable central thread. Echo of energy beings’ cosmic loom avoids thesis-statement by anchoring in visual spiral on the ground. Minor deduction for the disembodied voice’s proverb-like line, but its flicker/flare keeps it short of overt sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through images—cracked wood, tarnished bowl, charred twig—not thesis: beauty in the unfinished is shown when imperfect violin and burnt offerings co-sound. The final line’s “light in the ash” reweights prior losses without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—residents stepping forward, testing the air—rather than exposition. Ambiguity remains: the silence could fill again, keeping complexity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: the cost of curated forgetting is stored in the dealer’s amber archive. Half-truth motif reweights at closure—petal once fresh is now a relic of swallowed pain, implying Elias’s own memory warehouse grows heavier. No moralizing; final image invites reader to wonder who truly bears the burden of absolution. Subtext in Lira’s steadied voice shows relief paid for by unseen joy excision—theme left provocatively incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    The “cycles of compassion” theme emerges organically via the envelope’s misdelivery and Lila’s origami boats, avoiding explicit moralizing; the final postcard reprises the cycle without tidiness, offering resonant ambiguity about who next will “notice.”

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of webbed kinship emerges through the arbor-as-bridge image and the refracted-light motif rather than assertion. The final reconfiguration—loneliness shared becomes connection—avows no moral; the constellation thread reprises the earlier hidden signature, revaluing anonymity as mutual recognition. Subtext operates in silence: Lira’s silver eyes reflect orchard glow before her reveal, coding her as mirror. Minor echo of “web” language is allowed because it is always tied to sensory image (glass threads, light merger).

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through the loom/loom-of-time image rather than assertion: borrowed moments, pauses between breaths. No moralizing—final image lets ink replace obsession, a quiet CR. Ambiguity persists: is she cursed or freed? Counter-readings hold. Could use one more concrete particular (e.g., a sketch she now cannot sell) to deepen the social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from concrete returns: glass chips = mosaic cracks = star-fruit pulsing = constellation re-map. No thesis stated; insight is the image of “absence nourished growth.” Subtext lives in silence after bats cease—grief as orchard. Final image offers non-literal answer: loss is not hole but living cavern, reweighting all prior fractures without moral.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of chosen visibility emerges organically through action; no explicit thesis. Tape motif reweights from curiosity to communal lifeline, creating quiet resonance. Final image crystallizes guardian-turned-messenger without moralizing. Subtext stays light—no silence, gesture, or irony deepens stakes—but coherence and earned insight satisfy.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of surrender-as-growth emerges inexorably from the hellebore’s literal shedding; no overt thesis stated. The linden leaf’s early “quiet resilience” is reprised at rest as badge of earned wisdom—organic, not pasted. Final line avoids preachiness; image of storm-welcoming sitter lets reader complete the thought. Docked slightly because Eleanor’s insight is voiced to Mara (“I’m going to help them by releasing control”)—a hairline echo of theme summary.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: meaning is grown, not extracted, shown by the shift from mockery (“the canvas mocked her”) to additive conversation. Subtext lives in objects—duck, brooch, sketchbook—each re-weighted by closure. The final note’s “conversation, ongoing” avoids tidy moral; the reader is left to feel the cost of perpetual listening rather than told a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges without sermon: art vs. chaos, craft vs. the uncontrollable, shown through environment and gift rather than assertion. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide whether the fracture is ruin or evolution. The final image of a “steady, unpredictable hum” lets theme resonate as lived consequence. No moral is spoon-fed; resonance is earned, though slightly undercut by the protagonist’s lack of active complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through the reframing of silence from wound to instrument: absence becomes a resonator waiting to be charged. Subtext resides in the unspoken guilt of survivors (fisherman’s barnacle-rough pause; vendors skirting the plaza) rather than thematic exposition. Final image—trumpet’s note ringing off wet stone—offers non-literal answer: history is not retrieved but performed, requiring present bodies to breathe life into relics. No moralizing summary; complexity remains (the queen’s “curse” still frightens children) without forced equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of traded certainty for mystery emerges through image (arrows → ticket → blank map), never sermonized. Subtext lives in the ticket’s silence: “Begin” is invitation and threat. Final reconfiguration invites multiple readings—liberation or erasure—without forcing a moral. The woman’s veil keeps the truth partial, sustaining ambiguity that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely: transmission of curiosity across ostracized women, knowledge as lineage rather than proof. No reader-moralizing; final image of tile in pocket silently re-prices the premise. Whales and star-maps recur with shifting emotional valence, but symbolism stays sub-textual. Complexity is present—wonder and rigor coexist—yet resonance is gentle rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges: immortality as sedative, escape as fear-driven rebirth. Subtext lives in mirrored self—hollow smile—without thematic lecture. Final void image reweights prior boredom without moralizing. Slight abstraction in “symphony of possibilities” keeps it from full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—“truth as negotiable commodity versus moral math”—emerges through con-artist patter versus Elara’s refusal to lie once stakes turn lethal. Subtext lives in the color shifts of the ink: violet danger → gold clarity → clear exhaustion, reweighting “fair trade” as personal cost, not slogan. No final moralizing; the ending image of empty pot + asylum papers lets irony linger. Lacks a deeper social resonance to breach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges obliquely: invention as secular faith, stationer as priest of unrecorded pasts. Subtext whispers through ritual verbs—kneel, trace, chart—so the sacred is relocated from cathedral to lamp-riven mist. The ending image of thickening notepad reweights earlier pages as relics, but theme stays cozy; no critique of nostalgia or cost of fabrication surfaces, so complexity is aesthetic rather than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—memory as mosaic that can be stolen or restored—emerges through action, not sermon. Subtext in “Not for the remembering” poison line ironically becomes exactly what Marcus uses to remember. Final image of tide-mouth reframes harbor from threat to witness, offering resonant ambiguity. A hair more paradox in the last line could have lifted higher.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the shell-cello convergence: knowledge can be harmonic, not explanatory. Subtext resides in the astronomer’s vanished body—absence made audible. Final dust-melody reweights “riddle” from equation to lived hum, avoiding moralizing. Bittersweet acceptance is earned through concrete struggle, leaving resonance that resists tidy decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of coded resistance as legitimate order emerges through graffiti translation and chip-as-anchor without explicit thesis. Subtext lives in mural’s dollar-sign eyes and spiral-square repetition, letting collective defiance speak louder than slogans. Final image reframes chaos as curated structure, offering resonant non-literal answer. A hint of sentiment (“it’s a home”) is earned by prior spectacle, avoiding moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges inductively: the futility of human markers against time, crystallized in the fading gas spiral and dusty archive. Subtext resides in the shadow margin—presence registered but unseen—avoiding overt thesis. No moralizing line; final smile on Earth lets the image argue. Conceptual repricing of “some truths don’t need an audience” feels earned because the photo’s dusty fate is already dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges quietly: repair as lifelong devotion to invisible infrastructures; no moralizing. Water-light motif shifts from skepticism to trusted oracle, reweighting “broken” into readable pattern. Final drip-charged image offers resonant non-literal answer: clarity recycles through perpetual rust and mist. Subtext in Marlow’s cane-tap approval shows legacy passing without speech.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of cartography itself: maps erase the living convergence they purport to represent. The final spiral of light on her desk is a non-literal answer that reweights every prior line about “promises” and “lies,” avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—some truths are chased, not caught—without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without thesis: balance is not mechanical equality but a chorus of distinct voices (stone, metal, human). Subtext operates in gesture—Kael’s back turned to the square at start and end—showing he is the tuning fork’s twin: resonant yet destined to vibrate alone. The final image of tone “lingering” reweights the premise: restoration demands exile of the restorer. No moral is stated; the emotional aftereffect is bittersweet recognition that harmony costs the tuner his own place in it.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of release versus preservation emerges through the vial’s journey from sealed relic to emptied radiant shell. Subtext lives in gesture—scraping fingers, pressure against ribs—rather than thesis. The final dawn ray reweights the earlier “lonesome splendor,” turning solitude into earned clarity. No moralizing, only image; the thematic echo is subtle and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme: authorship as inheritance vs. self-forgiveness. Emerges via lattice-as-pen metaphor and charged echo of “chasing hush.” No moralizing; final laugh through keyhole offers oblique wisdom. Subtext in ghost’s silence at end signals grudging approval, reconfiguring generational guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of debt as both bondage and mercy emerges from concrete objects—cold bead, warm bead—rather than authorial statement; the final image reweights “repayment” as mutual release. Subtext in the pomegranate/Persephone echo is invited, not preached, letting readers supply moral complexity. The phrase “lovingly venomous” is the only near-articulation of thesis, but it is anchored to the ghost’s specific history, not an abstract maxim. Quiet dawn closure resists tidy moral, allowing love and vengeance to coexist in ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    “Broken precedents” evolves from thematic label to embodied reality as cracked frescoes re-knit, letting theme emerge through texture rather than sermon; the closing hymn-image offers a non-literal answer—reverence re-made—without moralising, though the idea is more wonder-filled than morally complex.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of reclamation through curious listening emerges via image pattern—bones, roots, star-maps—rather than thesis statement. Final tableau of gathered villagers offers resonant reweighting: diaspora may re-cohere without promise of success. No moralizing sentence; ambiguity lingers. Particulars trump abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: recorded knowledge is political power, and art’s beauty can be Trojan horse. Subtext resides in the flame-cued warp of silk—truth literally bends when viewed. Final image reframes earlier “nonsense songs” as encoded transmissions, inviting reader recursion. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers on who else can now read the sky.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from image chain: broken cathedral spout → fragmented apologies → smoothed shard = enduring love despite fracture. Subtext in gesture: tracing then letting dissolve = ritual of release without verbal thesis. No explicit moral; final line “Go. Live. Speak.” is imperative from spirits, not narrator, so avoids thematic echo penalty. Wisdom earned through sensory ordeal rather than platitude. Ambiguity lingers: we never learn addressees of letters, keeping universality without vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the concrete particular of a bombed reef and a child’s cast; no abstract thesis is stated. The final image—cast hanging as “flag of fragile hope”—reweights earlier doodles without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture: touching coral ≈ touching shrapnel of language. The lotus-hearted ache stays implicit, never named again after intro. Only the widow memory risks thematic echo, but it is brief and grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of undeveloped film → living color; no character spells the thesis. The fresco’s laughter and children chasing light-words form particulars that reweight grief into generative memory. Final image of pocketed shard as talisman offers quiet, non-moral answer: art keeps the negative until the world is bright enough. Avoids sentimentality, but one line—“she’d painted with hope”—leans toward echo; trimming it would let the image speak alone.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—“listening as a form of restoration”—emerges through action: sound re-paints what pigment alone cannot. Subtext of inherited curiosity vs. archival duty lives in the nickel’s pocketed weight and the sealed mural corner. Final lullaby melody offers resonant non-verbal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity is fruitful: is the flapper ancestor or mirror? Yet the concept of “nested awakenings” is named aloud by Lysander, a 0.4 echo that keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of covert language versus surveillance emerges through seed, moth-QR, and最终 glowing Morse garden rather than sermon. “After thoughts become taxable” is reiterated twice; the second use in Elias’s closing line edges toward Echo but is saved by its integration into the garden image. The piece resists moral binaries: secrecy is both refuge and exposure, a complexity left charged rather than resolved. Subtext in gesture—Lillian’s sigh, Mabel’s tapping—keeps exposition lean.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: art as photosynthesis of sorrow into beauty, refracted through marine imagery—no thesis clunk. The postcard’s nebula and final constellation-tree reweight each other without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: truce does not erase pain, it lets pain and dawn coexist, a nuanced stance. Final sentence offers Charged Poise—song released, reef listening—resonant, non-literal answer to central question. Docked 0.3 because “blossom armistice” is named twice; once in postcard, once in narration, slightly echoing prompt language instead of purely subtextual bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the tension between preservation and transformation; no character states it aloud. The reframed chime acts as a Conceptual Repricing: extinction is no longer sealed but sung. Subtext resides in the gradually welcoming stance toward “half-formed” emotion. Final resonance is felt, not sermonized, leaving plausible ambiguity about whether the library will survive the new song.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of language-as-vow emerges organically from plot beats, never sermonized. The love-letter river and sister manuscript reprise the “promise” motif, reweighted when Elara chooses vulnerability. Final image of the glowing ink well reframes earlier mead-brew vow without moralizing. A hairline slip—“symphony of truth” is named twice—but the second instance is internal, not expositional, so only a light tap.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges without statement: engineered safety vs. emotional exposure, fused when the floodgate’s levers become metaphors for cardiac repair. The adhesive spiral re-weights from forensic clue to tender fingerprint—an image that recurs and resonates. No moral is declared; the final line leaves both volcano and heart “a little lighter, a little safer,” embracing ambiguity. Subtext operates in silence: the sender never appears, yet their fear floods the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from recurrence: paper trails, pigeons, and dust all expose the instability of any single story; truth is a swirl, not a sheet. No moral is stated; instead the final image of Elias on the road lets the reader feel the cost of renouncing the tidy lie. Subtext in the grandfather’s drunk lullaby hints cultures lost to sandstorms—colonial erasure—without exposition. Ambiguity is purposeful: we never learn who mailed the chip, keeping the echo alive.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    “Necessary distances” and “sacred gaps” stay implicit, seeded through paternal quotes and re-codified in Lira’s final lines—no moral paraphrase. Theme gains nuance: distance as prayer, as cartography, as filial separation, all refracted through light imagery. Avoids tidy thesis yet could risk abstraction; final blank-page inscription re-grounds it in earned act.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of belonging emerges through light-pattern imagery rather than thesis. Final image of “shadowseam wonder” reconfigures isolation into shared witnessing. Avoids overt moral; ambiguity lingers about whether rhythm is projection or discovery. Slight sentimental lift in “rhythm worth dancing to” but stays within earned tone.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges cleanly: art as gentle hacking of public rhythm, with the bishop standing for strategy made tangible. Subtext stays in gesture—the teen’s compass tattoo silently agrees to be steered—never lectured. The cracked clown loops horror/humor and mirrors monotony, but its metaphoric payoff is only a flicker, not a reweighting. Resonance lands in the hush before applause, not in a moral, satisfying the quiet-ending allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of nostalgic transgression emerges solely through action: the ban is never lectured, only violated, so the story enacts its argument rather than stating it. Subtext thickens when old hymns echo only after the stylus breaks skin—implication that memory needs corporeal scars. Final image of “obsidian grace” serves as Conceptual Repricing: grace is no longer celestial but mineral, heavy, outlawed. Avoids tidy moral; reader must decide if the burn was worth exile.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges via imagistic accretion: light-in-mundane cracks, grandmother’s cracked glass wisdom, final notebook line. Subtext stays implicit—no sermon, just refraction. Yet the insight is static; the bay simply confirms her creed rather than complicating it. The emotional aftereffect is gentle wonder, not lingering tension; ambiguity is present but narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through iterated image—spiral, thread, coordinate—rather than thesis: hope is not an idea but a spatial vector you can knot into being. The refusal to moralize keeps the piece from sliding into TED-talk profundity; the last line is pure listening, an earned hesitation. Ambiguity lingers: are the skies she glimpses real access or heightened longing? That plausible counter-reading deepens resonance. One minor echo: “equations for hope” skirts label-speak, yet it’s isolated and quickly buried in sensory work, so the thematic fabric recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—legacy as osmosis rather than artifact—emerges through image, not maxim. Subtext resides in the empty film that nonetheless records, the locket that already knew her. Final reweighting reframes cartography from external tracing to internal hosting. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers as uneasy intimacy with the built world.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of art as transfiguration of absence emerges through mirrored meadows and forest paths rather than statement. The children’s lullaby, warped into code, quietly argues that grief can be sung into new worlds yet never healed—an insight earned by the failed reach toward the sister. No moralizing line intrudes; the final smile across dimensions reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers: did she open portals or merely accept illusion?

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from particulars: stains, statues, “flawed beauty” refracted through Elara’s ritual patience. No explicit moral; final image of descending past stone gods offers conceptual repricing—redemption is cyclical vigil, not victory. Subtext lives in gesture—clipboard shielding chest, delegates’ shaking hands. Ambiguity lingers: peace is simultaneously signed and suspect. Avoids sermon, though “price of redemption” verges on prompt-echo; resonance survives via tactile callbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the inverse alchemy of progress: turning living river into luxury resort converts extinction itself into a collectible aesthetic. Subtext operates in gestures—the egg cradled then abandoned, whisky drunk to birdsong—never in direct moralizing. Final Charged Poise reweights the map’s “abstract beauty” as the price of permanent loss, offering a resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: grace is felt only as fracture, not absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of art-as-resistance emerges organically from her bodily poetic vs. lullaby, never sermonized. Final image of falling snow as “testament to the quiet defiance” reweights earlier flakes from pretty backdrop to ideological witnesses. Avoids moralizing; lets prismatic light do the talking. Lacks one sharp ironic twist to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges gently: overlooked lives deserve witness. Subtext resides in the lattice’s inevitable erasure, yet the story circles this insight three times in near-identical language (“honor the overlooked,” “bear witness to the transiently rooted”), muting resonance. Final image avoids sermon, letting moth-monarch conjunction speak, but earlier repetitions flirt with thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of memory-as-braided-light emerges from the rope’s chromatic logic rather than assertion. The final image reconfigures forgetting into luminous inscription, a Conceptual Repricing that reframes prior bells and chimes as failed cages. Subtext in the lullaby fragment avoids explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: decay as compost for rebirth, order/chaos as twin lenses. No overt thesis statements; the final image of footprints echoing “in the rhythm of rebirth” reweights prior decay without moralizing. Subtextual silence around who issued the original directive invites lingering ambiguity. Minor deduction for the hologram’s slightly expository “you were chosen” beat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from pattern, not sermon: equations carved in devotion, frugality as spiritual armor, star-maps as self-portrait. No tidy moral; ambiguity remains—“It’s a mirror. What you see depends on what you bring”—so covenant is ongoing dialogue, not trophy. The final Babylonian word *“Asharu”* is earned by prior tiles-to-language logic; it reweights her skepticism into binding curiosity without declaring victory. Subtext lives in gesture: dust brushing, tile edge biting palm, the refusal to pocket gold from miracles.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the pin’s scar-metamorphosis; no character ever moralizes “forgiveness is good.” The final image—Kael’s fragile smile clutching a scarred but stronger pin—re-prices the premise that mending never erases the break. Subtext stays in gesture: Elara’s finger-brush, Kael’s tremble. Only a whisper of thesis-talk in “grace can shift like sand” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges obliquely: the act of mapping reorients from outward stars to inward space, implying that dreams are captured by recognizing the seeker’s own reflection. Subtext resides in the etched patterns—artisan signature becoming navigational key—without overt statement. The final image avoids moralizing; resonance is charged by the reversed needle. One soft echo: “space between breaths” is articulated twice, slightly thinning the implicit weave.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: persistence as non-heroic, scrap-heap wisdom. No final-paragraph moralizing; the ribbon’s last rustle in pocket reweights earlier mother-daughter material without statement. Subtext resides in tool-use: mending transmutes from craft to covenant. Complexity acknowledged—world still broken—but sentimentality avoided.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the fractal image: inheritance is not bloodline but chosen sight. Subtext lives in gesture—cameo fusion replaces spoken oath—avoiding moralizing. The final image of an unwritten name “waiting” inside living bark reconfigures legacy as participation, not possession, offering resonant ambiguity. No thematic echo in final paragraph; the quiet smile is earned stasis with cost rather than thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of knowledge vs. ignorance emerges through concrete trial rather than assertion; final image of “chorus of voices from every era” reweights the motif without moralizing. Subtext in guardian’s blank-page face silently asks: what story will you write on me? No tidy thesis—complexity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as collaborative gardening, not recovery. Subtext in Veyra’s repeated “trapped freedom” modulates from sneer to acceptance, re-priced by the final open meadow. No thesis statement; insight arises from sewing names into dirt. Ambiguity lingers—will the meadow survive them?—without moral tag. Resonance is imagistic, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    “Fables of absence” emerges organically through the scroll title and the chamber’s displaced histories, avoiding explicit moral. The final image of merging torchlight into a beam offers quiet resonance, reweighting absence as navigable rather than empty.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the sonic ecology itself: silence as living, cultivable, precious. No character utters a thesis; the final lullaby is the argument. The reweighted bloom—once myth, now tool—reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the beings remain, half-tamed, leaving the cost of future noise possible.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from accreted images: shard → fragment → song. Final non-literal answer: rekindling is not restoration but re-membering; the scar in the sky endures, proving meaning survives rupture. No moralizing statement, only resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges as the transmutation of shame into generative light; no moral is stated—the final image of starless sky mirroring lily-fire reprices “shadow” from moral blot to unstruck potential. Subtext lives in the knot’s oily figure-eight: infinity reclaimed from disgrace. The refrain “fire spins upward” arcs from mentor koan to embodied belief without editorial nudge, yielding an afterglow that feels honest, not sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of silence: from edible, gilded hush above to the metallic clang below, then into living growth. No character sermonizes; the sprout re-prices silence as something that germinates rather than evaporates. Subtext operates in gesture—hand opening to release the doll equals mouth opening to swallow silence—linking intake and surrender. Final image avoids moral, leaving ambiguity about whether hope or mere survival sprouts.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as presence, not absence. The storm-glass shift from swirl to stillness reweights the motif without authorial commentary. Final line offers resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing or thesis statement; avoids pseudo-profundity. Slight deduction for abstract cost keeps it below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges: legacy is self-recognition, not possession. Subtext in guardian’s fading laugh and pendant-as-mirror reframes ancestry without moralizing. Final image reweights prior murals; avoids tidy thesis. Slight abstraction in “story to write” line nudges sentiment but resonance lands.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of “holding the line between memory and oblivion” emerges through the sanctuary’s physical rule-set rather than exposition. Subtext lives in silence: the pair never discuss past or future, only the present pressure of the threshold. Final image—hand clasp in dark—non-literally answers the core question: connection requires the very breach that endangers the sanctuary. No moralizing line, though “teach suffocating to breathe” flirts with thematic echo; luckily it is voiced early and not repeated at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—dynastic self-erasure as love—emerges through the letters rather than authorial assertion; the final image of the room as “cradle” reweights the opening “tomb.” No moralizing paragraph, only resonance. Some abstraction (“eloquently silent authority”) flirts with statement but is offset by sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the image-chain of strings, patterns, and blank pages: control dissolves when one stops trying to bottle possibility. Subtext resides in Cedric’s muteness—his refusal to speak mirrors the alchemists’ refusal to let go. The blank final page re-prices the underlined motto without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is freedom grace or exile? The answer is left vibrating in the wheat field.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through pattern: buttons, dust, and unnamed files refract emancipation’s unkept promise, culminating in the quiet insurgency of a new folder. No moral is stated; the image of Elias writing reweights “small kindnesses” as archival resistance, though the beat is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges through the iterative image of reflective water and the key’s obsolete telecom past. The closing silvered lagoon reweights the earlier gold—truth dulled but still present—achieving quiet Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. A touch more character-specific loss would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically: folklore as living language, memory externalized in miniature monuments. Moonstone and leaf motifs recur only when they alter Elinor’s tactical stance, avoiding tokenism. Final image reframes prior “superstition” as practical grammar—quiet but resonant. No closing moral; ambiguity lingers on who Lirael is, inviting reader extension.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of “names as unbearable weight” emerges through the coin, the sister’s self-erasure, and Kael’s final stunned hush—never sermonized. Kintsugi motif is threaded as cracks accepting gold-light, paid off when Lira’s star-fractured form mends into freedom. Ending image of extinguished glow leaves resonant ambiguity: understanding may be the crack, not the cure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: healing = pursuit, not arrival; laughter = fragile evidence of life. Subtext resides in the ghost’s insistence that dead speak in sighs—Lira proves they can also laugh. Final image of dawn birds answers the moonless dream without moralizing. No motif recycling for points; crocodile tooth recurs with reweighted meaning. Insight is earned through concrete concession, not assertion. Minor dock −0.1 for “healing requires truth” line edging toward thesis-statement, but integrated within dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from pattern, not statement: UV purification trope inverted—forest continues torture but ends in possible forgiveness, reweighting “penance” as ongoing choice rather than earned score. No moralizing lecture; final question “might one day make sense” is resonance, not thesis. Subtext in gesture: woman’s pewter-bright teeth echo strap metal, hinting she too wears her scars as tools—left unexplained. Ambiguity lingers cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from action: translation as salvage of obliterated worlds; no narrator ever moralizes. Final line “eternal instant” is image, not label—re-prices the whole quest as perpetual present holding past. Subtext in weaver’s silver eyes: centuries watching fragments fail until Lira arrives—history needs living conduit. Motif of light-as-bridge returns sharpened: lighthouse beam once cut fog, now shard cuts palm—same light, new wound.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges solely through image and event: frost as map, whisper as key, spiral as perpetual rebirth—no character ever spells it out. Final image of new spiral waiting reweights everything prior, offering undeniable conceptual cost: awakening is recursive, not utopian. Subtext lives in silence—no one debates the ethics; the storm is the argument. Avoids moralizing; terror and wonder coexist, leaving plausible counter-readings about whether rupture is liberation or mere chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from the palimpsest metaphor—history overwritten by victors—without overt thesis statements. The shard’s refracted light and the fungal script literalize buried voices, letting image carry meaning. Final line (“civilizations… built on the courage to see what mirrors hide”) flirts with thematic echo but earns its lift via the mirror-draping motif that literally uncovered new evidence. Subtext stays in gesture and light-play, inviting reflection on who controls reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of unknowing emerges from concrete collector practice—jars labeled by date/location—rather than thesis statement. Final image of compass-silent-on-desk next to new jars reconfigures the value of collection from proof to reverence. Subtext in gesture: dropping compass = relinquishing measurement. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in lagoon hum. Thematic echo “place where explanations fail” is spoken once mid-story; not in final paragraph, so −0.4 waived.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—art as cartography of time—emerges via sculptural images (mermaid hair = timeline strands) without sermon. Subtext in lantern-slide heartbeat: memory is covenant, not artifact. Final smile re-prices her vocation; no moral spoken. Complexity/simplicity motif stays implicit, gaining weight through concrete re-seeings. One hairline cliché (“tasted like salt and iron”) slightly dulls edge.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of light/dark: flowers bloom at night in communion, not defiance. Subtext lives in gesture—painting silence around the jasmine rather than the bloom itself. The final reconfiguration (“mysteries yet to unfold”) resists moral tidy-up, offering earned ambiguity. Recurring postcard/etching motif constrains interpretive choices and is reweighted in the last line, not harvested for symbolic check-box.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of creation-through-memory emerges from concrete beats—arranging jars, ledger, compass—never abstract assertion. Final image of sealed bottle as lens re-prices the premise: civilization reborn not by conquest but by accepting impermeable past. Subtext in ghost-images silently asks whether revival is worth personal erasure, avoiding moralizing. No thematic echo lines; meaning accumulates through repeated lantern and bottle imagery whose final shift is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges as “memory is audible prophecy” without sermonizing; the final image of stars through canopy answers the question of what the roots remember. Subtext operates in the unexplained shriek—terror held in the body of a tree. No tidy moral is offered; the city’s future scream remains pending. The emotional aftereffect is quiet dread rather than sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges as “listening as composition”: the sanctuary is a conductor, the storm a chorus, the self a maestro—yet this insight is voiced by Elder Veyra, a mild thematic echo. Otherwise the meaning accrues through tactile acoustics and atmospheric response, avoiding moralizing. Final image of rope texture offers quiet conceptual repricing: mastery is rough familiarity, not triumph. Ambiguity lingers—storms will shift again—keeping the theme open.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of “flourishing stillness” emerges through the accumulating hush between meteor bursts; final lantern-glass speck reframes silence as active receptacle, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext in Veyra’s cracked facade supplies social irony without explicit statement, satisfying complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges without statement: speech as survival, not indulgence, in a world already stripped of life. The stained-glass memory montage reweights the covenant from beekeeper/land to living/dead, resolving in conceptual repricing—words as seeds scattered across ruin. No moralizing, only image. Slight sentimentality brushes the child/flower tableau, but the final scatter of shards converts nostalgia into necessary rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from particularity: objects as memory vessels, entropy as the true timekeeper. Subtext lives in gesture—the unspoken laugh Elias forgot—never sermonized. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing: “whispers of other timekeepers” in garage-sale clutter. Avoids tidy binaries; ambiguity lingers about whether the whispers are real or projected.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: translation between organic growth and human geometry is shown through the copper lattice, not asserted. The final image—copper on oak holding her last breath—reweights the premise: coexistence is not balance but mutual inscription. No moralizing line explains “bridges beat boxes”; the silence after the spirit’s laugh lets the reader feel the reconfiguration. Complexity lingers: the spirit admits “It hurts,” refusing tidy harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of manufactured belonging emerges through the amber experiment and sculpture mirrors rather than authorial assertion; the ending reframes prior academic sneers without moralizing. Subtext in Kael’s leaf-robes and mercury eyes whispers ecological entropy, but the piece stops short of letting that tension complicate Lirael’s stance. No thematic echo penalty; final laugh carries ambiguous cost, inviting re-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of life-from-ruin emerges imagistically; ‘the earth remembers’ whispers rather than preaches. Subtext in bird-calls and dead language avoids overt thesis. Final reweighting of battlefield→garden is resonant, but single-track metaphor limits complexity; no counter-readings offered.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as communal glue, love as what “grows when shared.” Subtext operates in the leaf’s re-pricing and the elders’ murmurs rather than explicit sermon. The riddles avoid thematic echo; no character states the thesis aloud. Complexity is modest—no real counter-reading—but the ending image resists moralizing, letting resonance linger.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—confusion as legitimate compass—emerges through image spiral, ink smear, and final step rather than statement. Grandmother’s aphorism still flirts with Echo but is offset by embodied reprise: the same deck, now walked in reverse, re-priced as freedom. Ambiguity lingers: is the corridor real or dilated mind-space? Resonance earned via concrete particulars, not sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of “embrace the unknown” emerges through the silence vial and starlight drops, avoiding explicit moral. The chessboard-as-cosmos motif is fresh, yet the epiphany line (“courage to swap the familiar for the mysterious”) articulates the thesis in final paragraph, triggering minor −0.4 for thematic echo. Subtext is otherwise implied through object choice rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the accumulating imagery of mirrors, locks, and feathers: home is whatever memory you consent to carry. No character sermonizes; the final line seeds the world “via the texture of a feather,” letting image do the moral work. The ambiguity is productive—carrying others’ memories can read as gift or wound. Conceptual repricing lands when bookstore reappears unchanged but her skin is now permanently flecked, reweighting normalcy itself.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through image rather than sermon: forgiveness as lens, not absolution. The elders’ scream versus the child’s laugh crystallizes the moral reweighting without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will the light last?—inviting reflection. One thematic echo (“rituals are just poems…”) is pithy but earned by prior beats, so deduction is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of mending-through-fracture emerges from the statue’s glowing scars and Lira’s lung-scarred breath, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: removing the mask = accepting dissolution. Final image reconfigures “kintsugi” from gold filler to survival choice. One thematic echo line is slightly overt, but resonance persists.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “temporary eternity” concept migrates from mother’s talismanic phrase to lived experience inside the cave; it reweights at closure when Elias accepts impermanence as the new artistic subject, a Conceptual Repricing. Theme emerges through concrete sensory recursion (shell, reflection, sketch) rather than thesis statement. The ending invites counter-readings: is the vision maternal grace or self-projection? Ambiguity feels earned because the pool’s warmth and mirrored ceiling have been materially established. No moralizing tagline; resonance lingers in the sketch left to water and salt.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges as the inverse of the prompt’s whisper-versus-shout binary: silence can propagate tenderness farther than noise, but the listener must be trained to feel vibration, not volume. The jasmine sprig and glowing cork re-cast communication as botanical and mineral, not verbal—an organic subtext that avoids thesis statement. Final image of tears diluting rain dissolves moral intofelt physiology. Only tiny echo of “whispers travel” in last line nicks the score.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of reverse-migration emerges from concrete ritual action rather than thesis statement; the idea that memory, not ships, can sail home is dramatized through the spinning foot and returning voices. Subtext lives in gesture: hair offered to antenna = self-stitching into ancestral map. Final image reframes prior loss—ghost cadence becomes living cartography—without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: we do not know if the voices will guide or devour, creating lingering tension.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—truth as dangerous commodity—emerges through eye-forced confession and ledger reveal, never sermonized. Subtext lives in Jorn’s trembling delivery and Mara’s instinct to veil, not broadcast. Final line (“truth could be a weapon—but only if you wielded it with care”) flirts with explicit thesis but is framed as her internal summation, not authorial caption, so resonance survives. Ambiguity lingers: reader must decide if “occlude” is prudence or complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—maps as externalized self-portraits—emerges through image, not thesis: the antique shop dust becomes the final “territory” she charts. Subtext in the father line, “You’re just following the ants,” reframes obedience as autonomy. No moralizing; the smile is image-only. The spiral motif re-weights from trap to compass without overt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges from image pattern: bleeding starlight = suppressed pain. Subtext operates in silence—she never answers the figure’s final challenge, only turns away, letting gesture speak. No moral is stated; the re-weighting is felt. A touch more ambiguity about what ruling-with-the-wound would actually cost could deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of “revaluing by returning differently” emerges through the shell’s shift from specimen to co-author; no moral tagged. Subtext lives in the ledger’s singed edges—knowledge itself scorched by past hubris. Final spectrum image reweights earlier gold-only light without commentary. Brief flirtation with theme-label in “palette of resolve” line, but situated inside her POV and immediately enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: the past is not a text to be edited but a force that writes us. The blank scroll’s inversion of authorship offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silence after the words appear—Elias does not speak again, implying acceptance. The final image reweights earlier jealousy into a recognition that continuity of self is illusion; ambiguity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of “ordinary miracles” emerges via tactile detail, not label; the screw’s redemption arc reconfigures trauma into continuity. Final image of fog lifting while the clock strikes offers quiet, non-didactic resonance—no moralizing, only reweighted light.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from concrete recurrence: scars → runes → stories, ink → starlight → language; no abstract sermon. Final image answers the mentor’s riddle—“breath between storms” becomes the literal mist-path he now walks—achieving Conceptual Repricing without moral statement. Childhood rhyme returns reweighted, now a key that opened a portal. Slight erosion because the rhyme’s mechanics aren’t stressed mid-story, but resonance lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without宣言: art as electrical conduit for overdue apologies; imperfection as the only miracle we can afford. The re-pricing image—empty bottle vs. roaring saws—makes the ethical calculus unmistakable: completion demands real noise and real loss. Subtext in Clara’s coat-pocket heft shows commodified grief turning into complicity. No final-paragraph moralizing; resonance is purely imagistic.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—truth as process, not destination—emerges cleanly from the mutable dictionary and the final blank page, avoiding moral summation. Recurrent “resounding hush” threads tone and concept without symbolic overkill. Subtext stays in image (moving mural figures, blank leaf) rather than thesis lines. The concept is coherent, but abstraction keeps it from piercing the gut.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges concretely: time-as-longing is earned by the backwards count and the seabed clock’s retrograde motion, avoiding overt thesis. The final sentence’s razor-edge image reprises the grandfather’s blade maxim, giving lyrical closure. Complexity is respected—no moral is handed down—yet the insight is slightly diffuse because Lorn pays no personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of surrender-as-strength emerges through biological metaphor rather than thesis statement—mushrooms thrive once shields drop. Subtext resides in the shifting light: fear-bright → harmonious steady glow, reconfiguring meaning without moralizing. The quiet wildfire metaphor hints at unstoppable but gentle change, creating lingering ambiguity about security vs. openness.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of contradictions as mirrors emerges through image chain: lantern warp, chalk door ajar, subway car that returns her to start—no explicit thesis stated. Final image reconfigures earlier regret into acceptance without moralizing. Subtext in seat-scrawls (“past is a coin you can’t spend”) layers gambling motif underground. Ambiguity lingers: does she still crave chaos? That unresolved tension reads as honest rather than evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of “distances that bloom into connection” emerges organically from the looping action; no final sermon states it. Recurring glass harmonica re-images isolation as harmony without forcing symbolism. Ambiguity stays productive—reader must decide if Mara is angel or prisoner—avoiding tidy moral. One slight drift: “cultivated estrangement” is narrator-coined label rather than lived discovery, trimming subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as “preservation is participation, not heroics”; the locket’s silver shadow and the baker’s bread reweight each other without sermon; final image of ink-stained hands keeps ambiguity—covenant may still fail—so complexity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through reversal: loneliness as communicative medium rather than pathology. Subtext resides in the conductor’s layered whispers and Elias’s unspoken ache—never diagnosed, only felt. The final image reframes prior images (ivy, moon, tracks) as connectors, not parasites. Avoids thesis-statement candor; “polite anarchy” is voiced once by Lira, early enough to feel playful rather than preachy.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of “feeling becomes seeing” emerges through physicalized metaphor: vibration → vision, map → heart. No explicit thesis; final line is imagistic, not moral. Subtext resides in ring’s silent tongue, mother’s lullaby now tactile. Ambiguity lingers: is she ghost or memory? Complexity retained.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—history as collaborative web rather than solo script—emerges through the anomaly-as- metaphor and the nib’s redefinition from “writing” to “listening.” No overt moralizing; final image of fever breaking carries quiet payoff. Subtext in Lira’s gentle interruptions nudges Elias from controller to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges as the inverse of ephemerality: to be unheard is not vacancy but raw material for shared art. No character articulates the thesis; instead, the final camera-press against Kael’s heart reprises the opening “no film” with new weight—tonight’s song is the only exposure he’ll ever develop. Subtext in Lira’s trembling hands asks: who owns silence once it’s played aloud? Joyful sorrow tone modulates from minor to major and back, resisting tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the reframing of destruction as cultivation; no character states it outright. The obsidian tear reprises the soot smudge, reweighting fire from erasure to germination. The ending invites counter-readings: is the archive truly alive or is Mara projecting grief? Complexity lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—memory as collaborative art—emerges through the drum-circle image rather than exposition, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext is strongest in the lagoon’s color-language, where cerulean, violet, and gold carry unstated emotional history. The final line reframes “guinea pig” from victim to co-creator, a subtle conceptual repricing. Yet the piece circles the same sorrow motif several times without new contradiction, so resonance is pleasant rather than startling.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—language volume vs. efficacy—emerges through action, not thesis: loud haulers stay lost, silent Elias finds hidden hub. Final image of him withholding directions while humming re-weights earlier motif without moralizing. Subtext in dialogue minimal but present: Voss’s grunt “You took the long way” carries institutional skeptic of unofficial knowledge. No late symbolism grabs; zodiac, maps, key accrue meaning through use, though “labyrinth with mind” skirts allegory, slightly blunting nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of silent empathy emerges through refracted-light gesture, never slogan. Subtext in fisherman’s shrug and cat’s watching shows wordless transmission of beauty. Final image reweights silence from absence to communicative medium—Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing statement; complexity preserved by unspoken “half-spoken secret” that remains secret.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of “planting forests of second thoughts” emerges through concrete displays and chess moves rather than final moral. Subtext operates in magnetic tug and pawn placement; silence as language is dramatized, not stated. Final line “let’s keep planting” offers resonant non-literal answer, re-weighting prior window tableaux. No thematic echo penalty—no character recites the thesis in prompt language.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of detachment-as-freedom emerges through the scrimshaw’s journey rather than sermon. The whale’s final cry reweights “guarded hearts” as the island that must be unguarded—conceptual repricing without moral tag. Image of swimming toward horizon crystallizes theme in action. One tiny echo of prompt language (“combative tenderness”) is woven, not declared, keeping score high.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the spoon’s contradiction: polish celebrates flaws the mandate demands erased. Final line reframes “lightness” as the courage to carry darkness, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights every prior shaving. No moralizing; the insight is carved, not lectured.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of permeable boundaries emerges through recurring images—ice to air, stone to song, poet to world—avoiding explicit thesis. Final image reweights earlier quartz humming without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is transcendence liberation or solipsism? Subtext operates in silences and texture; no thematic echo pronouncements. Could use one sharper counter-reading inflection to reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: imperfection as fiery fuel crystallizes in glass-bird-shard phoenix image. Subtextual gesture—Marla’s shattered-bird memory painted by Elias—unites beauty and complicity without sermon. Final sky-streak avoids tidy moral; tourist murmur leaves ethical ambiguity intact. Moth-whisper “Awaken” verges on echo, but resonance is earned by earlier plant-ivy spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—connection pre-exists, awaiting listening—emerges through the lens’s reweighting, not statement. Final silence re-prices prior engineering hubris with undeniable conceptual cost. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the mountain’s ongoing song.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—grief refracted into communal guidance—emerges through image rather than sermon. The stencil’s journey from sewing box to pendant offers a quiet reconfiguration: brokenness as map. Final line “Light the way” is verbatim her words, so the insight feels found, not forced. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in whether strangers will actually follow the cranes.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: pattern-finding as survival craft after systemic collapse. Subtext lives in gesture—Mara’s fractal tattoo reframed as human code, the widow’s midnight hymn reduced to a data point—avoiding overt thesis. The closing assertion “scars can be maps too” risks thematic echo but is saved by its imagistic brevity and prior pattern groundwork. Ambiguity lingers: is the new culture just another algorithm? The story lets the question breathe rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges without sermon: knowledge as seductive seed rather than tomb. The serpent ouroboros and saffron veil recur as shifting symbols—patterns once avoided become embraced, reconfiguring “innocence” as cowardice. Final image reweights earlier nostalgia atoms from passive dust to active gold that adheres—conceptual repricing achieved. One soft echo: “anguished joy” is named, not dramatically earned, a micro-tell that keeps this just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the metamorphosis of hope rather than exposition: hope frays when externalized, requires periodic re-shaping, and leaves luminous residue. Final image of re-titled books offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. A slightly more character-bound emotional aftertaste would have reached the 8.5+ tier.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the tail-as-map image rather than assertion; no moralizing final sentence. Subtext resides in silence—she talks to an absent chameleon, underscoring loneliness of principle. The reframing of “shedding” from shame to strategy offers resonant reconfiguration without platitude. Ambiguity lingers: the world outside remains predatory, but her reclaimed softness is now active, not naïve.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: scars as legible text versus scars as lived wound. Mother’s “stories are written in scars” is the single overt echo, forgiven because it is later re-weighted by Mara’s tactile re-reading. Final smile avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in the image of light on healed flesh. Ambiguity remains—what “reading” means is felt, not defined.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: creativity is not hunted but received when one stops striving and listens. The stardust motif is not token; it accumulates from memory-cloud to consumable dust, recharging the final smile. No moral is stated; the sky of unresolved ideas is the resonant answer. Subtext in the astronomer’s “breath of imprisoned gods” quietly reframes aurora as collective unconscious rather than divine command.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—dreams as renewable infrastructure—emerges through image (forest-roots tangling stars) rather than statement. The final re-pricing is strong: a freight guard who never dreamed now wears a coat of light, implying stewardship without moralizing. Subtext flickers in the woman’s coat left behind, a quiet transfer of responsibility. Occasional abstractions (“wave function,” “unlit corners”) flirt with thesis-speak but are offset by sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—machinery and wildness must co-seed—emerges through the gear-seed image rather than authorial sermon. Subtext is thin: father’s hologram spells out the lesson. Yet the final whispered exhalation of gears leaves a resonant after-image that reweights prior sound-motifs without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—courage as circulating river—emerges through the ticket-stamp imagery rather than explicit sermon. Final image of the abandoned punch quietly reweights the premise: service is endless, victory impossible. Subtext in silence: “shoreline lullaby” hum carries both comfort and entrapment. One near-platitude: “learning to see the stars in the dark” could be crisper, but it is embedded in embodied scene, not tacked-on moral.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of silence-as-contract emerges through the bolt and the piano’s note; explicit thesis statement at climax (“safety is… courage to listen”) slightly over-articulates, trimming resonance. Child’s clumsy music offers a subtler reprise that nearly salvages the moment, but the beat is already sermon-touched.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of truth-through-erosion emerges from ink literally drinking the lie’s breath; no moral is stated, only the image of hollow crown shell, inviting reflection on legacy versus illusion; ambiguity is purposeful, not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: human grief and wonder at an Earth that rewrites itself once we stop forcing carbon into it. Subtext lives in the tapping—language versus silence after the fossil-fuel ban—and in the atlas that outlives the islands. No final moral is stated; the last image of glowing paths behind the boat re-prices the premise without exposition. One hairline slip: “the ocean was healing, but it was also changing” edges toward thematic echo, yet it is embedded in action, not sermon, so penalty stays under –0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges: meaning is not found by escaping chaos but by attuning to its hidden rhythm. Subtext lives in gesture—opera glasses passed from grandmother to Jax to crowd—and in the stones’ mute persistence beneath rubble. No moralizing; the final image reweights prior debris as signal. A hair more ambiguity could deepen resonance, but the particulars carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges as the tension between tradition as cage and tradition as seedbed, never sermonized. The embryo is a literal seed, the hot spring a literal womb, so the central metaphor grows from event, not assertion. Final image—amber light seeping into soil—offers a non-literal answer: evolution is nurture, not control. No late thesis statement; the kite tail’s cryptic spiral silently reprises as the hatch key, reweighting earlier rebellion into future cultivation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: stillness as an act of defiance against chaos. Subtext lives in gesture—smoothing the photo vs. tucking it away—avoiding overt thesis. The lighthouse-keeper anecdote risks thematic echo, but stays under 20% and is anchored to present journal, so −0.2 only. Final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, earning resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from concrete arc: “fragments as lies” → “fragments as weave-able.” Subtext sits in silent objects: torn VII of Swords (thief of meaning) vs. reclaimed grandmother thread. Final image—“we’re all just waiting to be rewoven”—is Conceptual Repricing, not moralizing; it reweights prior scattered cards and lost client into hopeful cohesion. No prompt-echo platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—time as fragmentary breath—emerges through ink ephemera and child’s circles, never sermonized. Subtext resides in the tension between elders’ fatalism and Lira’s refusal to forget. Final image of stepping into the tower reweights earlier ink dissolve: memory must be seized before it vanishes. Avoids tidy moral; resonance lingers in the humming residue.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—knowledge preservation is meaningless without integrity—emerges through the archive metaphor and the act of thawing censored history, avoiding overt thesis. Subtext in the silent hand-off of the letter carries the real vow, but the closing “revolution began” edges into thematic echo, slightly flattening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Quiet” as cultivated focus emerges organically through image and action rather than statement; the final burial lets the theme seed itself. The piece resists moral binaries and allows the desert roses to embody both confinement and flourishing—ambiguity that lingers. A slight thematic echo in the last paragraph (“the farm…had become a revolution”) is abstract enough to avoid sermon, but still trims the top edge.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of translation-loss emerges organically: emotions → frequencies → visible patterns → void. No explicit thesis; final “garden had spoken” reweights prior motifs without moral. Subtext operates in gesture (goddess’s tilt) and silence (Kael’s refusal to mourn aloud). Complexity is honored: order is restored through erasure, a bittersweet repricing that resists tidy comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of inherited guilt emerges from specific artifacts (nib, memo) rather than assertion. Final “sunlight” reweights earlier star-metaphor, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: mother’s tears, lawyers’ threats, imply no neat absolution. No thesis statement in last paragraph; resonance arises from image.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—unanswered sound versus chosen silence—emerges through the amber–letter pairing rather than exposition. Final image of quiet lab reweights earlier star-maps as obsolete navigation, offering non-literal answer: silence can be mercy, not erasure. Avoids sermon; no character states the moral. Subtext lives in the wasp frozen mid-flight, a visual paradox of motionless noise. Complexity lingers: forgiveness is encoded, not felt, leaving plausible residue of guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—“listening is collaborative creation”—emerges through pattern, silence, and chalk rather than assertion. Subtext in the shift from “document” to “draw on the wall” is understated but legible. Final hologram reprises earlier sidewalk galaxies, reweighting art from escapism to dialogue. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what the grotto will now demand.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between mercy and radical action; no character articulates a thesis. The tessera’s return re-codes destruction into continuity, offering a non-literal answer to how mercy survives atrocity. Subtext resides in silence—no crowd, no speech—only the quiet click of stone into stone. Ambiguity lingers: the city may still burn again, but the renamed ground now carries memory as living weight rather than wound.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as “possibility is a dance, not a door”—never sloganed, reweighted by the coin’s erasure. Subtext lives in synesthetic color-music that turns nostalgia into sensory debt. The flapper’s lavender-cello voice and the poet’s whisper let era-specific loss leak through texture. Final image resists moral; it crystallizes the cost of eternal encore into a single blank disk—an artifact now relieved of story, charged with silence.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person ghost-POV keeps perceptual signature consistent: sound→color, touch→taste, time→texture. Diction (“film-flicker,” “minor-key gravel”) stays within a vaudeville spirit’s lexicon. Rhythm swells and hushes with the melody-line, no drumbeat syntax. Compression is purposeful—“the garden held its breath” teaches the pattern that culminates in “the world held its breath.” No head-hopping; even the flapper’s voice is rendered as Elias hears it.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: authentic pattern vs. forced connectivity. Geode’s millennia-grown precision argues against pharma shortcuts without sermonizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Mara tracing crystal vein equals tentative trust. Final reconfiguration: illumination found inside body, not market—no moral spelled, but resonance reweights earlier hologram as lived map, not product.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of memory-as-continuance emerges from the leaf’s palimpsest of emotions rather than exposition. Final image of her walking toward “the light, her mapper humming” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in gesture (crumbling dust) keeps sentimentality at bay; slight deduction for thematic echo in “the unknown had found its voice.”

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: history as malleable material, futures planted not inherited. The button motif returns as taxonomy of lost voices, reweighted when Mara accepts the canyon’s counsel. Final image avoids moralizing; resonance is atmospheric rather than ethically complex.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of “unused courage” emerges through pillbox transmission ritual rather than statement; final image of lighter steps reweights earlier spiral-symbol without moralizing. Subtext in father’s marginalia is elegant, but theme is somewhat monolithic—no competing value to complicate the courage arc—keeping it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—layered time/memory distilled into essence—emerges through recurring images of fog, needle, and river palimpsest. Subtext is carried in silence between coachman and ferryman; final image of “next crossing” reweights prior layers. Avoids overt thesis, but insight feels pre-known rather than earned through struggle. Emotional aftereffect is contemplative, not charged.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through iterated phototropy: kindness as photosynthetic force that grafts past onto wasteland. Subtext in the rusted pump’s silence and sunflower bow avoids overt thesis. Final image (“light within it”) offers conceptual repricing without moralizing. Complexity lingers: the oasis keeps its memory, Mara keeps the lesson—no binary triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges via recurrence of living things in inhospitable spaces—jasmine in concrete, geranium in dim shop, sound in harbor hush. No character moralizes; the final line lets “protected vulnerability” hang as image, not maxim. The bitting gauge silently reframes from precision tool to heartbeat metronome—an organic conceptual repricing. Subtext operates in gesture: window opened, cat pausing, widow’s fingers brushing his—silence carries the weight of shared risk.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from pattern: extinction → reflection → authorship. The spiral symbol reweights “brittle awakenings” from fragility to generative fragmentation without stating moral. Subtext resides in silence after lullaby-hum fades: absence becomes creative space. Final image of lone writing under shifting tides offers resonant non-literal answer: extinction rewritten as genesis.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges from orb-sinking image rather than slogan: secrecy transformed into shared water avoids overt moral. “Prismatic quiet” motif recurs without checklist tokenism; final whistle of thrush reweights earlier twig spiral. One soft echo of thematic prompt (“the thread that connects all things”) is tolerated inside character thought.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—knowledge as negotiation rather than conquest—emerges through her refusal to escalate with force; the surrender/truce sound is the non-verbal answer. Subtext of academic precarity versus cosmic scale is felt, but the community divide stays asserted more than explored, muting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of wistful rebellion emerges through images: silent organ roaring back, starlight turning from prison to path, key shaped like constellations—authority subverted by curiosity. No overt moralizing; final gateway invites reader to feel both triumph and unease. Subtext operates in organ’s dirge and key’s heartbeat—tools of the cathedral now complicit in escape. Ambiguity lingers: is the cathedral’s dissolution liberation or deeper entrapment elsewhere? Complexity acknowledged without forced balance.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges inductively: empathic imagination as forensic tool. Subtext operates through material paradox—soft silk against hard stone, anonymous face vs. named locket—without authorial commentary. Final image reframes earlier “opposites unified” from compositional theory to moral stance: victim and artist, memory and oblivion, fused in one frame. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the ribbon’s glow “like a vein of blood,” revaluing artistic seeing as civic duty.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of rewriting “never” through art emerges organically through fiddle-as-key; avoids thesis statement. The flake’s shift from ciphered pixels to clear glass supplies a resonant image of possibility purified, but subtext stays lightly suggestive rather than piercingly ironic. Earned, not sermonized, yet could carry more moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—“heritage as gravitational orbit”—emerges through recurrent money imagery rather than exposition. Subtext resides in silence: Elias never confronts Marcus, letting objects speak. Final image reweights the bills from tainted loot to protective wards, achieving non-literal resonance. Minor echo of father’s “snake” line borders on thesis, but ambiguity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of mirrored self-deception emerges through the seed’s hunger for truth rather than flesh; no explicit thesis is stated. Final image—keeping the spent seed—reconfigures the moral weight: darkness is not expunged but owned. Ambiguity is present yet coherent; no late moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges from scar-as-wound rather than lecture; “intersection of dreams” stays implicit. Final two-moon image offers non-literal reweighting without moral. Yet the golden double’s spoken thesis (“fear is a mirror”) edges toward echo −0.4. Still, resonance lingers through image, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulates—ash, silk, bone—rather than exposition: the idea that destruction can be composted into gentleness is shown, not told. The Fool card’s repricing (from shame to seed) supplies conceptual resonance without moralizing. Subtext operates in the keeper’s smile of broken shards: reader sees danger, Lirael sees opportunity, creating earned irony.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of post-fame survival emerges from concrete particulars (Echo Valley’s single disaster show) rather than lecture; final image reframes quarry dust as archival, not erasure. Subtext in Gus’s “rocks to crush” counters art’s fragility. Avoids sentimentality yet lands wistful charge.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—identity as migratory contradiction—emerges through ritual repetition and trinket accumulation, never sermonized. Final feather reprises earlier journal line, reweighting it from anxiety to gift. Ambiguity lingers: is recycled wonder still authentic? The piece avoids moralizing, lets image do the talking. One thematic-echo slip: librarian’s “preserve the wonder in routine” edges toward thesis-statement.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from concrete recurrence: bunker → crystal tomb → cathedral; confessions move from buried shell to airborne song. No moralizing; final image re-prices “inspection” as communion. Subtext of etched regret vs. shared resonance is carried by object handling, not commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges via the graffiti mosaic rather than authorial thesis: forgiveness as current, not destination, is dramatized by the sluggish Thames mirror that finally distorts her reflection. The final “Begin” reframes prior slogans into a single imperative, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext in silence—pigeon coo, ivy leaning—carries the emotional after-effect more efficiently than any statement could.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of forbidden knowledge versus personal isolation emerges inductively from the reversed watch, blank pages, and veiled face rather than overt statement. Subtext lives in gesture: tracing patterns in light, mist dampening fabric—silence made tactile. Final image of shifting ghost-script offers resonant non-verbal answer about the cost of hearing the unsaid. However, late thematic tag “truth humanity dared not voice” leans toward explaining the resonance rather than letting it haunt.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from competing propagation metaphors—botanical, musical, imperial—culminating in a quiet refusal that reconfigures power as absence; the mulberry ache remains unspoken, letting the shattered violin reprice the idea of destiny without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges as the paradox of preservation-through-beautification: embalming as art, art as mortal risk. Subtext carried in gesture—painting protection runes while humming a lullaby—renders the theme without statement. Final image reframes stillness as canvas, reweighting the premise that beauty can defy oblivion, yet only by accepting perpetual vulnerability. No moralizing; resonance comes from the exhausted aurora kiss. Complexity embraced: salvation and ruin coexist in one polished sphere.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of cyclical forgiveness emerges through concrete returns (hairpin, shell, sister) rather than sermon. Final image of dual shells pinned in hair reweights “rebirth” from abstraction to wearable cost. Subtext in Elara’s downcast eyes and hesitant smile carries unspoken penance, avoiding explanatory dialogue. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance is left hanging in vineyard hush, satisfying CR criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without dictation: withheld knowledge as love, vanishing as genesis. The spiral image offers a non-literal answer—appearing is the deeper form of vanishing—reconfiguring prior fractals. No final-paragraph moralizing; silence itself is the thesis. Ambiguity lingers: is Elara liberating or abandoning Lira? Complexity is embraced, not balanced away.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of alignment-over-movement emerges through image (figure-eight, arrowhead reflection) rather than statement. Final line quietly reprises canyon echoes, inviting reader re-evaluation. No moralizing paragraph. Ambiguity lingers: is Kael consigned to eternal skimming? Complexity acknowledged without forced balance. Theme feels organic, though not deeply surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through concrete images: mechanical spell-casting vs. mother’s tended roses; no explicit sermon. The garden’s transformation reweights “sacred in the simple” via the sketch callback, giving resonance without moral tag. Subtext in the fountain vision shows creativity as memory, not invention. Final answer is imagistic—rainbows on ice—avoiding tidy axiom, though the phrase “he’d found what he’d been looking for” flirts with echoic over-statement (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the image circuit: light carried → light surrendered → internal light heard; no explicit thesis. Subtext stays in gesture: key placement replaces spoken absolution. The ending’s non-literal answer—“the color of sound hums in his veins”—reweights prior lanterns and key without moralizing. Minor sentimental echo in “I see you now” is softened because it is addressed to self, not Lila, avoiding platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: coherence through surrender—static not noise but test, contraction not death but calibration. The moon-tower coin’s reappearance as living circuit reweights earlier symbol without authorial statement.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sacrifice emerges through refracted light and the named/absorbed monsters rather than any thematic statement; the final ache reweights the premise without moralizing. The atlas page’s shift from anonymous terror to contained memory offers a resonant, non-literal answer to “what’s on the other side?” One slight abstraction—“the echo of sacrifice”—is spoken by the chorus, not the narrator, so the thematic echo feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of fracture/sync metaphors rather than moral statement; ending reweights “madness” as devotion without roadmap, letting readers feel the cost of partial repair. Subtext operates in Marla’s eye-roll and the fishermen’s lifted spirits rather than exposition. A hair below 8+ because the bell’s symbolic shift is slightly underlined by Elias’s spoken coda rather than left pure-image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of communal memory versus erasure emerges through the photograph trail rather than assertion; no final moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—laying a photo is an act of surrender, not explanation. Liqueur color and label accrue symbolic weight organically, reweighted when Mara replicates the toast with images instead of poison. Ambiguity lingers: shared stories may not save the town, but they now have guardians. Emotional after-effect is concrete—reader feels the pact form in the dark.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through the rotating triad of crystal, starlings, flame—each a concrete particular that re-weights “wonder” from abstract to instrumental.

    Theme of inherited trust-as-language emerges through tactile pattern-fixing rather than exposition. Subtext lives in the buckle’s warmth and the mother’s single static word, re-weighted when Kael smiles at dawn. Final image avoids moralizing, offering quiet covenant instead. A hair more complexity—doubt flicker or temptation to flee—could deepen resonance, but ambiguity remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of self-ownership vs engineered perfection emerges through conflict, not lecture; final "you're a choice" re-weights the jar’s meaning; avoids tidy moral; slightly undercut by abstract diction ("vivify," "complementary opposites") that keeps sentiment arm’s-length.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of “innovation through surrender” emerges silently from action: forced design yields to vegetal agency. Spiral motif (envelope → key) reweights from human symbol to natural cipher, a quiet Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing; final laugh carries wry acceptance of hubris. Subtext in slime trail—nature writing its own escape room—invites reflection without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—art as repair of silence—emerges from concrete ritual (macerating air, half-sung lullabies) rather than thesis. Final image of voices filling tunnel reweights earlier “echo chamber” metaphor without verbalizing message. Subtext in tool-turned-instrument avoids explicit “music heals” sentence. Ambiguity lingers: is laughter restored upstairs or only in tunnel? Complexity acknowledged, not tidied; no moral hammer drops.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges: uncertainty as sanctuary, light as the true prison. Final image—“uncertainty? That was just another word for home”—reweights earlier dread into acceptance without moralizing. Subtext of library-as-liminal-space invites multiple readings; ambiguity feels earned, not evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the specific alchemy cycle rather than slogan: “creative destruction” is tested on the ivory, then on his flesh. Final image reframes Veyra’s “order is a cage” into a crystallized moment where the cage door is blown open by scar-tissue. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing; resonance is imagistic. Complexity acknowledged—freedom bought with permanent damage—yet ambiguity space is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of renewal-through-silence emerges through the steady shift from rust to radiance, never sermonized. The hush evolves from feared absence to creative potential, reweighting the reader’s perception of decay.

Final image of the singing river offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question, resonant without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of adaptive navigation emerges organically through repeated “edge geometry” praxis rather than thesis statement. Subtext is modest: relic as psychic ballast versus public instrument, starlight as shared alien-human grammar. Final paragraph’s “beauty of edge geometry” drifts toward explicit thematizing (−0.4) yet still lands in image, not moral. Emotional after-effect—quiet awe at negotiated darkness—registers but lacks lingering bite because personal stakes stay low.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of love too large for words emerges through the photograph’s unread gesture and the static-crack apology. Subtext resides in the synchronized heartbeats—technology as conduit for tenderness—avoiding overt thesis. Final line “Some stories… echo” skirts thematic echo penalty by framing Lila’s continuance, not moralizing. Complexity is modest but intact.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from pattern: failure/error as epistemological tool, not stain. The ink–porcelain constellation reweights from spilled accident to star-map, letting “wisdom from failure” feel discovered, not declared. Final smile into snow offers quiet repricing without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: extinction as a language one must consent to hear. The final silence is a resonant reconfiguration, not a moral. No thematic echo statements; the image of the song “not meant to be spoken” does the work.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—knowledge vs. ecstatic surrender—emerges through image chain: arrowhead (human tool) vs. spiral (open-ended nature). Subtext in Herbalist’s laugh: “wind chimes in a storm” fuses beauty & threat. No final moral; resonance lingers in open spiral. Frostbitten hope is tone, not thesis. Avoids explicit “cosmic joke” echo at end, evading thematic-label penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: the price of control is emptiness, the price of freedom is fragility. Subtext lives in the statues’ hollow sockets and the orchard’s honeyed sap—no moralizing required. Final image of the bridge “trembling in anticipation” reweights the premise without stating a thesis. The locust shell’s shift from secret to catalyst supplies the charged callback that lifts it above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges obliquely: small illicit gestures can rewire collective mood more than treaties. Subtext lives in the bottle label and the humming machines—objects speaking louder than slogans. No character moralizes; the final ‘promise’ is an atmospheric shift, not a message. Complexity is present—hope is fragile, maybe temporary—but the absence of personal consequence keeps resonance mid-high rather than exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—silence as generative medium—emerges imagistically; no explicit thesis is spoken. The fountain’s ripple “language” and wildflower circle reweight the prompt’s “misting hush” from elegy to germination. Subtext stays in gesture: he sings rather than proclaims, letting silence answer back. Final image resists moral, but the concept stays gentle; lacks the conceptual bite needed for 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: longing is circular, self-originating. The cipher is not decoded but recognized as internal, reweighting the whole quest. Final image of “salt on her skin” offers non-literal, sensory answer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—memory as constellation we re-assemble—emerges through images rather than thesis lines. The mirrored broken stars reweight nostalgia from personal regret to archival duty, avoiding moral. Subtext operates in the photograph’s wisp of light: memory is portable, shareable, yet ghostly. The ending resists tidy comfort; the bridge is open, the work endless, so resonance lingers without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Reversible exile emerges organically through Lirael’s mentorship, tea-reading, and the girl’s mirrored quest rather than thesis statements. No final-paragraph moralizing; the theme stays implicit in the stretching shadow. Subtextual tension lingers: guidance may demand the guide confront what she most evades. The ambiguity—will reversal truly redeem or merely exchange one peril for another—invites reflection without forcing a tidy answer.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of custodial continuity emerges through the relay object (seed → blossom) rather than statement. Final image reweights the premise: wonder is not preserved but passed, making her lifelong labor the cost. Avoids moralizing; the waterfall’s “song” keeps the insight implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—“some hushes are meant to be broken”—emerges through tangible unraveling rather than thesis statement; sanctuary’s final hum is the non-literal answer. Subtext lives in gesture: Mara’s faster stitching equals consent to hear ghosts; Elias’s stillness under blinding flare signals long-awaited release. Avoids moralising; fisherman’s suicide is presented as tragic, not verdict. Silver key reframes prior masks-work as mere mending; listener identity now irreversible—resonance lingers without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of “empathy in the unsaid” emerges solely from images: eroded saints still smiling, vowel-less chant, warm darkness. No thesis is declared; the final lullaby image reweights all prior silence without moralizing. Counter-readings linger—has he merely imposed meaning on stone?—inviting reflection. The concept stays fused to Elias’s perceptual lens; remove his curiosity and the idea collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—memory as persistent waveform—emerges through iterative hum imagery rather than dictation; the final “shake the globe to feel resonance in bones” offers non-literal answer to “physics of letting go.” Subtextual tension between closure (accepting orbit) and clinging (keeping globe) remains understated and plausible. Avoids moralizing, but late “quantum communication” phrase edges toward thesis statement, trimming top band.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of pressing: flowers → memories → secrets into stone; no moral is stated. Subtext lives in the graffiti alphabet the reader can’t read but feels. Final image reweights the bolt-plate from heirloom to portable reliquary of unspoken needs—quiet, non-literal, resonant. No echo of platitude; ambiguity lingers about who will “listen.”

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of “joy beneath anguish” emerges through the phoenix symbol and the widow’s cracked-laughter moment, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext resides in the goggles’ cracked lenses—damage as the price of clearer sight. The ending image of Mara ascending toward an unlit flame offers a non-literal answer: pursuit, not possession. No late thematic statement intrudes; resonance is built from particulars, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—memory resides in absence—emerges from concrete cloud catalog rather than thesis statement. Final image of cirrus spes reweights prior sorrow/joy threads into quiet possibility without moralizing. Subtext in Voss’s shrug and Lila’s trembling hand invites ambiguity about whether proof matters; avoids tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation is an act of translation, not duplication. The guild’s star-maps and Lira’s pigment constellations jointly argue that knowledge survives only by metamorphosis into new media. Subtext is carried in gesture—her thumb testing paint viscosity mirrors earlier scholars testing celestial angles. Final paragraph avoids moral statement, letting the warm coin imply ongoing, unpaid labor of interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of curiosity-as-compass emerges through concrete pattern-finding rather than assertion; the orb’s vision reweights earlier dismissals of “youngsters who don’t know a sextant.” Subtext flickers when Jax’s grin admits he’s seen “lights that flickered like ghosts,” hinting the ship already half-believes. Final image avoids moral—it lands on charged poise: she’s “charted… a truth,” leaving consequences to resonate. No echoing thesis line keeps resonance organic.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of “mending time/memory” emerges through mirrored selves and inherited tools, but the final paragraph articulates the moral (“even the most broken things could be made whole”) outright, muting subtext. Resonance is pleasant yet lands via statement rather than image reconfiguration, keeping it shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—hope as communal garden—emerges through the recurring bell-to-orchard-to-nebula living metaphor rather than any stated thesis. The final image of a lone chime in empty twilight reweights all prior chalk exhortations into an audible after-echo, achieving CR. Subtext operates in Elara’s unseen handwriting: her messages are literal yet remain ghostly, creating gentle irony about belief. No moral is declared; the settlers’ silence under the glowing arch lets the visual answer the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from recurrence of flaw-as-key: cracked puppet, cracked pane, cracked voice—all reweight “perfection is a lie” into cosmic mercy. No moralizing sentence; the lullaby’s spread through soldier, child, and deathbed is shown as sensory fact. Final image of golden snow re-prices apocalypse into cradle-song without abstraction. Ambiguity lingers: is slowed time mercy or indefinite dying? Complexity embraced, no tidy thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of reluctant service versus self-preservation emerges through the nut’s silent grammar and the graceless markers; no line moralizes. The cracked shell at the end reweights the blueprint from abstract map to spent resource, offering resonant reconfiguration without statement. Traveler remains cipher, so the ethical cost lands on Kael alone—effective but slightly narrow. Ambiguity survives: curse may still claim him, satisfying complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of divergence-as-connection emerges organically from river morphology and polymer science, never sermonized. The chrysalis and braided channels re-weight at closure without forced symbolism. Final image—sisters’ imperfect duet—offers resonant non-literal answer: harmony accepts dissonance. A shade more ambiguity could push higher, but complexity is honored.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—stories begin in absence—emerges through iterated object exchanges rather than sermon; final image of stardust in palm reweights prior motif without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: what tale will the stranger write? Complexity is embraced; no tidy thesis. Subtext in gesture (tracing jar edge) supports theme quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—memory as seasoning, remorse as untemperable spice—emerges through palatal imagery, never thesis. The closing meal offers a quiet conceptual repricing: nourishment as the only antidote, not erasure. Subtext in guards’ softened nods implies shared relief without moral statement. No echoic platitudes; even “sometimes that was enough” is earned by prior sensory struggle. Complexity lingers: absorption may be temporary, recipe never perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from sonic metaphor—clocks, grain, and people all keep time but need translation. No character states the moral; the ending image of the smiling-gear drawing is left to resonate. Subtext lives in silence: the weight’s initial muteness = village muteness; its swing = bridge. The choral librarian’s belief that “machines…have stories” is earned through her listening, not preached. Complexity lingers: the tower remains elite, the grain still commercial, but a shared chord has sounded.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly: memory is physical property, identity is editable substrate. No moralizing—final image of alien mosaic is the non-literal answer. Subtext coils around burial/excavation: woman’s buried memory is unearthed only at the price of Kael burying his former self. The refrain of “archeologist” is repurposed from metaphor to literal technique, earning resonance without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of hidden knowledge in margins emerges through the manuscript doodles and the final key, avoiding overt statement. The “seeds of vigilance” remain abstract, however; they never crystallize into a specific ethical or epistemic reweighting. Closure image (key in pocket) is resonant but does not conceptually reprice the world rule-set, keeping the idea suggestive rather than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the tactile metaphor of “empathy in motion”: translating another entity’s pain into audible beauty. No final moralizing; the last image of hedgehog waking to “a new song soft as a heartbeat” lets resonance accrue through particulars. Ambiguity remains—will the grove survive human ears?—inviting reflection without thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the return of the queen-diagonal metaphor: constraint as generative, brokenness as direction. No character articulates the thesis; the sapling’s fractured-mirror leaves silently reweight the idea. The covenant’s beauty is left ambiguous—scholarly order or star-mage mysticism—inviting lingering reflection without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges via the diary’s revealed sentence: silence as “presence of everything unsaid.” Final reprise of fireworks-light on the diary reweights the motif without moralizing. Subtext is quiet but coherent; ambiguity lingers in Lirael’s unspoken next act.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from iterated scent-to-silence pattern: wisdom grows in receptive stillness, not mastery. Subtext resides in the margins—doodles spiral from jagged to fluid—showing stance change without naming it. Final elder admission (“chaos and serenity are kin”) is the closest to stated thesis, but occurs in dialogue whose social cost is dramatized, so survives. Avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in the bloom’s smell rather than a maxim.</answer>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade>
    <comment>Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s perceptual signature: every line carries olfactory bias or doodle tension. Rhythm swells and contracts with her pulse—long sentences when she over-tends, clipped fragments at crack of shell. No head-hopping; elder skepticism is filtered through her dread. Diction (“olfactorily sensitive,” “wildflower hush”) is idiosyncratic yet internally consistent and pattern-taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Echoes” evolves from folklore to living data system without overt thesis. Symbiosis theme emerges through lattice imagery and Lira’s renunciation, avoiding moral homily. A shade more ambiguity—what she must now guard against—would sharpen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges inductively: human systems (ports, logistics, data) can self-organize into predatory ecologies. Subtext runs through the haptic patch—technology grown intimate, almost biological—without authorial nudging. Final image of “machines that never sleep” offers chilling conceptual re-price. Echo of mentor-death is briefly articulated mid-text; mining it for deeper irony or ethical ambiguity could heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges without moralizing: wonder is reframed from luxury to infrastructure via lived sensory experience, not argument. Recurring motifs—“sculpted hush,” aurora hues, amber sheet—return reweighted at closure, charging the final hymn. Subtext in Veyra’s unspoken envy/awe is carried by color smudge on marble, not exposition. Final line’s “oscillating between repose and revelation” risks thematic echo, but the image is earned by prior color-melting beats, keeping penalty minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—surrender as the true bridge between worlds—emerges through the inversion of music into silence, never stated. Subtext lives in gesture: the snapped reed is the unsaid admission that striving perpetuates failure. The driftwood rune for “surrender” reweights earlier markers without moralizing. Final image of the quiet hum in the chest offers resonant, non-literal closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: the limits of empiricism in the face of lived emotion. No explicit thesis—insight crystallizes when fragment settles, reweighting prior equations as “wildfires.” Final image (cool shard, obedient yet alive) offers non-literal answer: mastery is surrender. Subtext in gesture—Veyra’s scowl softens—echoes theme without declaration. Resonant ambiguity lingers: he won, yet carries the fragment’s heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—legacy as seeds—emerges through pendant→sapling transformation without overt statement. Final image reweights “germinate the past” mantra, offering a quiet Conceptual Repricing. Subtext in woman’s smile and pendant silence carries more weight than dialogue. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing, but wisdom is slightly abstract; would sharpen if Kail’s earlier panic recurred as sapling leaf etched with his own heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges without sermon: the desire to externalize emotion collides with the human tendency to see only self-reflection. Final image of silent arbor reweights earlier visions as projection. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of “resilience from rubble” is stated by Jorin and Lira, then echoed in the final line; subtext is therefore overt. No ironic gap opens between what Jorin believes and what the reader sees. The orchards’ sudden bloom simplifies the moral—endurance equals instant repair—leaving no lingering ambiguity. Emergent but not nuanced.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—truth as a cutting, portable wound—emerges through the shard’s edge and the final “weight was gone” image. Subtext operates in the mother’s smile that “didn’t reach her eyes,” hinting at ethical cost without exposition. No moralizing line intrudes, but the hologram warning is a near-thesis utterance, triggering a −0.4 nudge. Resonance lingers, yet the alternate-world ethics remain under-complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges implicitly: safety is not a beam but a shared, fragile gesture. Subtext lives in the stacked stones—each silent tower speaks louder than the dead lamp. No final-paragraph sermon; the last image is concrete and reconfigures prior material. The sea’s indifference versus human persistence is felt without abstraction, achieving quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from the iterative act of lantern-tending: knowledge is inseparable from custodial burden. The final image—lighthouse beam slicing night—reweights “dawn” from natural event to moral choice without moralizing. Subtext whispers that every visionary laughs to keep from screaming.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—stories as transplanted hearts we learn to circulate—emerges through dye, donor metaphor, and vanishing wing without authorial thesis. Final image of tea house as “stage for quiet explosions” reweights prior motifs under a resonant, non-moralizing lens. Subtext could sharpen if patron dialogue carried more implication, but silence fits the hush of wonder. No echoic platitudes or final-paragraph sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through iterated images of fractured light, cracked brass, and splitting stone: damage is the necessary aperture for knowledge. Subtext stays in gesture—Elias pockets the broken sextant pieces instead of discarding them—implying acceptance of incompleteness. Final line (“mundane miracle”) risks mild didactic echo, but is saved by its placement inside an earned visual beat (roots glowing with remembered grief). No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about whether the trees’ witnessing alleviates or perpetuates sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—collective memory as light source—emerges through image (glowing fruit, child’s lullaby) rather than lecture. Final line “remember how to live” flirts with Echo but is saved by its placement as internal whisper, not paragraph-closing sermon. Subtext is modest: the grandmother/blacksmith recalls hint that restoration spreads beyond Lira, giving thematic breadth without exposition. Ambiguity lingers: will songs need continual humming? Complexity acknowledged, not tidily answered.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of “mistake as wisdom” emerges through mirrored selves and the mother’s line “admit you’re lost”; no overt moralizing. The final image of letters against chest reweights hiding as a reversible act, achieving quiet CR.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of “creeping normality as map of fractures” emerges through concrete pattern—bread, saplings, seed—never thesis. Final image reconfigures absolution as iterative gardening, avoiding moral tag. Subtext lives in gesture: touching soil instead of Eucharistic bread. Complexity is present yet stays modest; counter-readings linger but feel gentle rather than gnarled.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of meaning salvaged from oblivion emerges through iterative light-work rather than exposition. The golden script of vows reweights the idea of promise itself; final dawn-flare offers non-literal answer that memory can be re-lit, not hoarded. Avoids overt moralizing, though “conjure meaning” phrasing in para 2 drifts toward thesis-statement; resonance survives because image of couple dancing in meadow is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of silence-as-currency emerges through traded whispers, fob-for-entry barter, and final choice to shatter rather than sell secrecy. No explicit thesis—idea accrues via contraband economy and the cracked watch-glass that still ticks. Subtext in porcelain-mask buyer’s laugh and Lira’s refusal to speak after smash conveys that silence has been re-appropriated, not abandoned. Final image reweights “hush” from inherited armor to self-forged weapon—resonant without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges non-didactically: empirical arrogance vs. sentient landscape. Subtext carried in taste-metals and voting trees—no reader lecturing. Final image reweights premise: compass still, Kael tasting regret—Conceptual Repricing. Avoids thematic echo; Lira’s dialogue stays situational. Complexity maintained—forests release pain yet offer no moral comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: art as exorcism of personal silence. No explicit thesis; final image of charcoal moving again re-prices earlier “starved soul” without moralizing. Subtext operates through recurrent mouth imagery (lock-dials → screaming mouth → opened door) that reframes suppression into expression. Complexity is present—he doesn’t blame commerce, only his own fear—allowing ambiguity to linger.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges: candor, even when bitter, can germinate future life. No explicit thesis; the seed image re-weights the Archive from repository to compost. Subtext in the keeper’s hesitation and respirator implies collective guilt. Final line risks a touch of maxim (“truth … was nourishment”) but earns it through prior embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through recurring sonic images—bell, whisper, glisten, silence—culminating in “truth made audible.” No summarizing maxim; final image reprises opener with transformed weight. Wonder is shown via crowd hush and cloud parting, not named. Subtle counter-reading: art commodified into spectacle yet still sacred. Stays clear of moralizing, earns 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—order needs periodic chaos—emerges through the burn metaphor and the dome-as-box reprise, never sermonized. The final image of “static as song” offers a quiet Conceptual Repricing that reweights the opening glitch. Ambiguity is controlled; no moralizing tagline.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of listening-as-healing emerges organically through the neighborhood vignettes and the unfinished soldier’s letter, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image reweights the locket from clue to relic of lost love, delivering quiet resonance without tidy thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: vulnerability as uncrackable cipher, silk thread as fortress. Motif recurrence (spider, web, dice) accrues pressure rather than decorative echo. Final shoreline image offers non-literal answer—some codes are lived, not solved—without sermon. Avoids thematic echo penalty; insight is imaged, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges as the conservation of erasure: deletion is not annihilation but relocation, a notion reweighted by the salt-rose reveal. Subtext operates through mirrored objects—pressed wildflowers vs. living pressed rose—suggesting memory’s simultaneous fragility and permanence. No overt thesis statements; final paragraph avoids sermon. Resonant answer: the gleaming silence now signifies guardianship rather than loss, inviting reader to reinterpret dockside mourning as archive duty.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges as the alchemy of fragility—paper, water, breath—being strong enough to reroute fate. No character articulates a thesis; the final image of dust on water reweights the idea that silence is active force. Ambiguity lingers: prophecy is stilled, but the summoner’s vigilance must be eternal, a credibly unsettling aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of language as living, deceptive pact emerges through the seal and the agreed lies, never sermonized. Final image reweights the premise: buildings speak back, lies now insufficient. Ambiguity is purposeful; no tidy moral asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges without sermon: archival pain repurposed into self-generated light. The shell-whisper motif reweights from nostalgic trap to alchemical tool. Final image of her walking toward an “ordinary and unyielding” world re-prices the earlier mother promise, now owned. Ambiguity lingers: radiance remains tragic, but autonomy is real. Only the phrase “quarantined memory” flirts with thematic echo, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the concrete paradox: forged document as act of forgiveness. The spiral key’s shift from cipher to prayer embodies the reconfiguration without moralizing. Final image of “echo of her purpose” offers resonant non-literal answer—history is not rewritten but released. Subtext operates in gesture (thorn tucked into sleeve, now “useless”) rather than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—memory as geological persistence—emerges through shell, stones, and lullaby without sermonizing. Final image reweights earlier “melancholy” into custodial duty, achieving resonance. Subtext operates in the unheard female lullaby, implying colonized or gendered memory, though left undeveloped. Avoids explicit moral; ambiguity lingers about whether Kael is liberator or caretaker of trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of connection across mortal thresholds emerges through recurring window/globe/mirror imagery rather than statement; the final image of “windows open” re-prices the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in dream juxtapositions—lighthouse flame, trapped reflection, unborn face—inviting the reader to assemble meaning. The piece avoids tidy sentiment by leaving the living’s reconciliation mostly off-stage, preserving ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: truth vs. survival, the price of sealing off wonder. Subtext in the diamond’s “curse” reframed as consequence, not supernatural. Final image of cleaner air reweights prior material without moralizing. Avoids tidy thesis; ambiguity lingers about Crane’s fate.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges without statement: knowledge demands embodiment—one must become the conduit, not just the receiver. Storm-as-language and glass-as-prism motifs accrue pressure rather than decorate; their final fusion reconfigures meaning. No moralizing sentence mars ending. Ambiguity lingers: will the city below embrace or burn? Complexity preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—memory as communal currency versus private hoard—emerges through action (jarred sounds poured outward) rather than lecture. Final notebook couplet is trimmed to a taut ars poetica, avoiding moral summary. Subtext of economic reversal (poet paid pennies to return wealth of sound) lingers without exposition. Ambiguity is preserved: the box keeps humming, suggesting the trade may continue, not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges: “harmony over lock” from action, not sermon. Bridge metaphor reweights when ghost bows, echoing Elias’s earlier insight. No final-paragraph moralizing. Slight conceptual convenience—ghost instantly accepts harmony—keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through pattern: stillness vs. motion, ice vs. current, moon vs. iron. Final image—thawed lake yet persistent hum—reweights the premise: revolution is reorientation, not rupture. Avoids moralizing; the acolyte’s puzzlement keeps ambiguity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of memory-as-weapon emerges through lantern imagery and file scrawl rather than thesis statement. Subtext pulses in Eliza’s 19-c gunshot echo refracted onto modern infrastructure violence. Final image—“She was done being controlled”—is terse, avoids moralizing, yet reweights prior visions as insurgent knowledge rather than chain. Complexity lingers: lantern truth is also manipulative, so liberation is double-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of second chances emerges via the heart-as-metaphor rather than authorial lecture; the final image of rain beginning while Marcus walks toward the prison re-weights the metaphor into action. Subtext stays in gesture—his fingers tracing the box, the unspoken felony—avoiding overt moralizing. No platitudes are pronounced; “apology in metal” is inmate-coined, giving the insight street credibility. The piece invites reflection on whether mechanism can equal contrition, leaving ambiguity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—desire as code that can be ridden like wind—emerges from the act of transliteration rather than authorial thesis. The bell’s unheard hum reweights the arrow tip from compass to clapper without a moral stated. Subtext sits in the silence after the strike: the future is now slightly mis-tuned for everyone else. No final-paragraph sermon; the resonance is sonic, not lexical.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the recurring motif of erasure—files, people, stars—without a final sermon. The spiral galaxy patch reframes from souvenir to cipher, reweighting corporate nostalgia as evidence of crime. “Sensed absence” is dramatized in ghost-folder footprints and static visor dreams, not asserted. The ethical calculus—memory versus profit—remains complex; Lira’s victory is escape, not justice, leaving ambiguity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—empathy as active force—emerges imagistically through mirrored griefs and final warming flare, avoiding overt thesis. Subtext resides in frost/ice versus color/light motifs that reverse at closure. Final smile lands as conceptual repricing rather than moral sermon, meeting the 9+ test. Slight deduction for thematic echo in the penultimate clause “courage wasn’t in the absence of fear …” which restates the insight already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the accrual of endings—euthanasia rumors, keening ice, trapped boat—until a single act of retrieval re-prices what "ending" means. No character articulates a thesis; the closest is Lila’s whispered "We all are," which is situational, not moralizing. Subtext lives in the parasol tip: an object meant to shade becomes a lifeline, quietly suggesting that instruments of withdrawal can also connect. The final image resists tidy uplift, letting complexity linger as frost still coats the marina.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from concrete irregularities: acidic soil, charred paper, sun-moon non-meeting. No final moral—just re-pricing of imperfection as generative. Subtext in silence: Lila pockets ash instead of professing gratitude; implication carries. Final rain image offers non-literal answer: fertility requires rot and imbalance.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of custodial honesty emerges through image rather than sermon: mask falls, lattice stills, dunes bury prints. The idea that wisdom survives only through strange, unpretty guardianship is suggested, not stated. Subtext lurks in the prophet’s recoil and Mara’s wind-chime laugh—moments where honesty exacts social friction. Final image of half-masked walker re-weights “strangely honest” as necessary monstrosity; avoids tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the arcs—pipe, vine, lens—of ruin reclaimed: healing is not creation but recognition. Subtext lives in gesture: feather tucked, case snapped shut, camera raised. The dove and lavender avoid symbolic shout by remaining sensory. Final “enough” lands as earned wisdom, though its resonance is slightly blunted by summary brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge grows in fractured, non-linear pulses. Final image—crystal refracting new light—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and prismatic imagery; no thematic echo penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: chalk line as palimpsest of memory, driftwood as brittle compass, hum as time’s unreadable cassette. No moral is stated; the final image reweights earlier motifs. Subtext operates in gesture—thicker chalk equals denser acceptance. Ambiguity lingers: is the sound future or past? Complexity is honored; no symmetry is imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: the futility of freezing moments versus the necessity of release. The leaf-falling motif (transience) is seeded early and reprised in the final song, recharging the stakes without overt statement. No moralizing paragraph; the leap itself is the thesis. Slight abstraction keeps it from top band—cost could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of transmuting brokenness into sacred ritual emerges through the shard’s journey and the skipped vinyl that still sings. Subtext lives in Clara’s forehead-to-forehead silence and the shard’s transfer; no explicit thesis statement. Final image of Mira humming down the hallway reweights the premise: broken world, unbroken song. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers on the cost to Mira.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges obliquely: knowledge as a keyed mechanism that unlocks hidden temporal strata. Subtext resides in the shadow-pool image—what daylight denies returns in condensed, reversed form. No moral is stated; the final image reweights the premise without sermon. The “sealed awakening” concept stays conceptual rather than moralized, preserving ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from the concrete act of bone-setting: dislocation demands realignment, whether joints, memory, or identity. Subtext is carried in gesture (two teeth, worn vs. jagged) rather than thesis lines. Final image reweights “mistakes as constellations” without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing. A shade less ambiguity than the top band prefers keeps it at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of stillness-as-transience emerges through iterated images (jar, pool, sky) that shift from containment to release; no explicit moral is stated. The mother’s “loan” note is the lone echo risk, but it is embedded in action (she literally lets the pearl go). Final image of rough shard in pocket quietly extends the cycle, inviting reflection without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through iterated grafting images: grief can be Host, not Grave, if one allows foreign tissue into the wound. Subtext resides in gesture—Elias’s orchid placement at the spiral’s heart proposes partnership more gently than any declaration. Final sapling reframes “trapped time” into “growing time” without sermon. Complexity is honored: brother is still dead, pain still present, but medium of remembrance has shifted—ambiguity remains fertile.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from recurrent image current/shell/whisper: hope as living motion, not collectible relic. No character sermonizes the thesis; insight is embedded in the final line’s cadence—“not knowing where she’d end” reweights every prior clean ending she wrote. Micro-turn from static relic to moving current is legible without abstraction. Resists tidy moral, invites counter-readings (is open ending courage or evasion?).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges by accretion: magic = shared breath, not artifact. The final image of the sapling “trembling with new stories” lets the reader re-weight the grandmother’s maxim without Lira spelling it out. Subtextual win: the fox yawning “Again tomorrow?” carries the exhaustion of eternal stewardship beneath wonder. Deduction for the penultimate paragraph’s explicit “she’d found her purpose”—a mild thematic echo that blunts the resonant image by half a sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the conceit that maps can be heartbeats: the story literalizes it without sermon. The orchard’s wreckage becoming a sky-chart reconfigures decay into meaning, landing on a Charged Poise that invites reflection on how we navigate inner space. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about whether starlight will survive outside the crater.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation versus evanescence, bottled wonder versus lived wonder. The cellar-of-reason image and the final descending staircase let the reader feel the conceptual grave without moralizing. Subtext hums in the timer’s cold hum and Elias’s warped mirror reflection—wonder captured is wonder distorted. No thematic echo penalties; the idea is left resonant, not resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: memory’s fractal repeatability vs. stone stasis. Subtext loaded in gesture—untouched locket signals some grief must stay calcified. Final image reframes earlier “shingled hush” as lullaby, avoids moralizing. Insight earned through tactile struggle, not assertion; plausible counter-reading questions whether weaving truly frees or merely re-enshrines.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the blank becoming lion: loss is not filled but re-formed. The refrain of “here and gone” mutates into “here, held,” a conceptual repricing achieved without moralizing; the rust-hued peace turns from decay-color to patina of survival, final image offering non-literal answer to grief’s chemistry.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: the impossibility of restoring lost time/joy and the mercy of release. Subtext carried in gesture (dropping wheel) and final violet rose—no moral stated. Ambiguity lingers: death? transcendence? Image of rose in jar reweights prior fragments as relics of a story now complete. No echoic platitudes; “chronologically confused” is character-embedded, not thesis. Final note unsigned—quiet resonance rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from action: resurrection = repurposing, not nostalgia. Final image (projected equation) answers the thematic question without moralizing. No echoic label-speak at peak. Ambiguity remains—equation is untested—inviting reflection. The sextant’s cosmic etchings quietly reweight “lost truths” into DIY physics, achieving Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the shifting meaning of silence: from violence (“slow erosion of the self”) to breathable space where “dreams breathe.” The bear and quartz reweight this abstraction into tangible choice. No moral is stated; the final image of screwdriver on chronometer offers a non-literal answer: time regulated, yet now porous to wild sound. Petrichor nostalgia is modulated, never syrupy—earth-scent carries both regret and possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges without sermon: the story shows history as editable hardware, never lectures. Subtext lives in objects—sundial, lantern, blueprint—rather than dialogue. The final image reweights the opening constellation-etymology: stars erased by light pollution equal truths erased by narrative machines. Ambiguity is preserved: Elias gains clarity, yet we sense the machine’s owners remain faceless and dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: knots = encoded memory; patience = refusal to let memory die. No moralizing; final “promise” reweights premise without thesis statement. Subtext in woman’s silence and fading footsteps leaves ambiguity about whether guild still exists. Emotional aftereffect is quiet awe rather than sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organistically: “flawed genesis” re-prices from defect to necessity once the cracked shell releases imperfect light. No final moralizing; the last image of orb-in-hand crystallizes the thematic answer. Bittersweetness is earned—beauty reborn but forever fragile—without abstract sermon. Micro-ding for the tutor’s single line that nudges toward thesis-statement.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: volcanic sand, drilled coin, broken wing—scars as fertility not erasure. Subtext in the lie “This’ll keep her safe” shows compassion as unyielding even when deceptive. Final image of vanishing grain offers non-literal answer: compassion is release, not amnesia. No sermonizing; complexity remains.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges as the quiet cost of resurrecting the past: the city’s grief becomes breathable air. The stained glass box’s transparency at the end reconfigures meaning without moralizing. No abstract statement intrudes; the final image of firefly-memories supplies non-literal resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generational trauma and the ethics of light emerge through image (scarred hands, fractal leaves) rather than thesis statements; final “fire that whispers” reweights the opening ban without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will the Enclave accept?—inviting reflection. One thematic echo (“generational patterns”) appears mid-text but is dramatized, not asserted, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from concrete recurrence: ribbon dyes = bruise colors, butterfly swirl = ink swirl, carved stone = spoken poem. No explicit moral; final image of “door” reweights prior “hole” imagery without preaching. Subtext in silence: the absence of living kin beside him makes the greenhouse itself mourner. Minor softness: “grief is a bridge” is voiced by disembodied mentor—close to thematic echo, but buffered by prior pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of “incremental absolution” emerges through the rake’s weather-worn carving and the slow re-start arc, avoiding explicit thesis. Final image—smooth glass ridge—reweights earlier fractures as healed layers of shared guilt, offering conceptual cost without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: whose absolution, and for what original sin?—inviting reflection while remaining tethered to Lirael’s embodied act.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges obliquely: burial is not forgetting but compassionate archiving; silence is a move, not an absence. The final phrase reconfigures the chess metaphor into a meditation on historical agency without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—should the living hear the echoes?—and the story refuses to answer, letting the thematic question stay porous.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from pattern: knowledge built on ignorance (she maps what she doesn’t know) and innovation that erases its own footprints (burning journals). No explicit thesis; final image of ash shadows is a non-literal answer. Subtext in gestures—trembling hands, dulled quill—carries the cost of progress. Ambiguity lingers: thaw may still fail next cycle, keeping moral complexity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from motif inversion: dust once silent now “sings,” yet the ending refuses triumph—she walks into silence again. No moralizing; the final smile is image, not thesis. Subtext in gesture: cloak slipping unnoticed = self-erasure required by her vow. Complexity preserved: resurrection of stories does not promise return of listeners.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges without statement: permanence is impossible, so omission becomes the only honest art. The ash portrait’s deliberate gaps reprice the premise—truth resides in what is withheld. No moralizing line summarises this; the final image of glittering ash on her hands reweights all prior detail. Complexity is preserved: the gallery’s oblivion is both terror and necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—“memory as sedimentary survival against efficiency”—emerges through concrete finds (hairpin, compass needle) rather than slogans. The final gear-hum reprises the opening “trapped heartbeat,” reweighting meaning without moralizing. Subtext in Mara’s stayed silence after “It’s just rust” hints at reluctant curiosity, giving the reader interpretive space. One near-echo of the prompt (“competing narratives”) is spoken by Elias but is embedded in argument, so the Thematic Echo penalty is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through recurrent images of rosette, dust, and autumn light rather than thesis statements. Final image refracts prior material, reweighting “harmony” as fragile glow, not moral. Subtext operates in silence and implication—no character articulates “hatred is noise.” The piece avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers as “something new could take root,” yet the conceptual cost is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of quiet displacement and latent aliveness emerges organically through image rather than assertion. Final sanctification reweights earlier cataloging into metaphysical stewardship, achieving modest resonance. Avoids overt moralizing, though “inadvertently profound” flirts with self-labeling and slightly blunts subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    “Welcome nuance into a certainty” emerges through concrete reversal: grandmother’s death becomes transformation, cure becomes stewardship. Subtext works in gesture—thread as familial tether, foxglove poison flipped to serum—without overt thesis statements. Final image of secret garden pulsing alive re-weights meaning without moralizing, satisfying Q5’s 9+ demand. Minor echo of “nuance” sentiment in closing thought nicks perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: possession versus participation, motion as commemoration rather than cure. Subtext resides in gesture—hand that slams stone then opens empty. No character articulates thesis; the ending image reconfigures meaning without moral. Ambiguity is productive: reader left to decide whether Kael is healed or merely synchronized to his prison. Minor dock for “42.7 %” numerical abstraction, which momentarily lectures rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically: language as vessel for remembered kindness. The final image (“To love is to translate”) reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. Subtext lives in gesture—brush passed hand-to-hand—avoiding explicit thesis, though the saffron-quiet tone is named in prompt-language once, a minor echo.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of cultural displacement as continuity emerges through bread initials, children’s off-key songs, and lens-light on young faces—no explicit thesis stated. Subtext resides in gesture (kneading “CV” for Celeste) and silence (empty hives). The final image offers quiet conceptual repricing: exile becomes legacy when filtered through green glass. avoids sentimentality, but theme is slightly diffuse because the festival decision feels low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—time as a puzzle to pick, not obey—emerges through backward clocks, reversed gears, and lighthouse beam spinning counter-tide. The hunger stone’s devouring light reweights the concept: mastery becomes servitude, a Conceptual Repricing. Subtext resides in silence of absent townsfolk and dead father, but the final laugh flirts with moralizing triumph rather than complex irony. Lacks a lingering counter-reading because Elias’s stance never cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—fear as consumable illusion—emerges through the carnival mouth image and the lie-feed beat. Subtext resides in Vey’s cold smile rather than exposition. Final line (“The one that survives”) offers a Charged Poise that reframes survival itself as morally ambiguous. No moralizing sentence intrudes, but the theme’s complexity is more asserted than dramatized in aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from specificity: city as fossilized life, maps as false comfort, pattern as countdown. Final re-pricing—“gate kept us in”—reweights colonial/exploitation subtext without sermon. Motif of spiral shells shifts from wonder to maw, earning resonance. Ambiguity lingers: are watchers guardians or victims? Complexity embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The noble-lie theme emerges through the shifting ledger dates and the collaborative graffiti, never sermonized. The final seed metaphor reconfigures the premise: lies are not barriers but temporal compost. Ambiguity lingers—she will plant truth, yet the station remains a ruin—inviting reflection without tidy moral. No thematic echo penalty; the insight is imaged, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the concrete particular of ink meeting stone: absence is a medium that preserves rather than erases. Subtext lives in gesture—smearing the ink refuses perfection, enacting the flaw that lets memory adhere. Final image of the lake “black and still” reprises the hush and blaze, reconfiguring solitude as generative. No moral is stated; the reweighting is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of collective denial emerges through concrete found text, not author sermon; “city lost to itself” reconfigures meaning without moral tag. Dappled light motif reframes from aesthetic to moral filter—truth fractured yet reachable. Subtext in stamp alignment implies indexing can expose or conceal histories, inviting reader reflection. Complexity intact: no redemption offered for submerged populace, only Lira’s renunciation of myth, yielding resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—grief folded into flight—emerges through lantern / crane recurrence, never sermonized. Final non-literal answer: ascending shards = transformed sorrow, "ready for next shadow." Resists tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in whether new lanterns will suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges from concrete refrain of “intangibly tangible” and the re-crystallized shard; no final moralizing. Grief-as-fuel is implicit, not preached. The closing grin complicates bleakness, letting ambiguity linger. Avoids tidy thesis, but epiphanies lean on voiced abstractions once.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without thesis statement: belonging as resonance rather than geography. Subtext lives in shared silence after “Now we listen”—a renunciation of mastery. Final image reweights prior drone-mapping ethos into passive receptivity. Ambiguity is purposeful: frequency has no translation, only shared hum.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of neutrality as moral choice, not geography, emerges through the pull’s life cycle—gift, grip, release—without sermon. The final echo (“some mistakes are meant to be let go”) risks thematic echo, but the image of the vanished pull converts maxim into sensory cost. Complexity holds: neither side is absolved, only momentarily humanized.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of “align heart and action”: grandfather’s mantra returns ironically re-priced when Clara realises world “just waits.” Subtext in silence—no dialogue after launch—lets ocean speak regret. Final image refuses moral: no triumph, only onward paddle. Only minus: “You were wrong, Grandpa” veers toward thesis-statement; whisper keeps it minor.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically: erased memory cannot delete unlived possibility. Subtext beats thesis; J.T. never declares “empathy is good,” she kicks water and lets shards speak. The baseball’s final glow reconfigures regret as compass rather than burden. One soft echo of thematic label—“the labyrinth of choices”—is spoken aloud; minimal deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from concrete sequence: metamorphosis is not loss but honorable translation—final image reweights earlier fear of “losing herself.” No moralizing; fortune cookie line is re-priced by embodiment, not repeated as thesis. Ambiguity lingers: she is both human and not, bridge forever open—reader left with cost, not lesson. Subtext lives in gesture (fox feather, obsidian shard) rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of “lost time” as a place one waits versus a choice one makes. The reweighted saucer and new handprint render the moral without statement. Subtext resides in silence: the mother’s mid-song absence, the untraced childhood palm. Final whisper—“Trace your hands, little star”—offers Charged Poise, not moral, leaving ambiguity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: peace is not absence but engaged courage. The twinning of grief/love via “long-dried tears on faded photographs” reweights the premise at closure. Subtext sits in the AI’s rustling static and the garden’s singing leaves, inviting reflection on post-human gratitude. Final image of weightless laughter offers Charged Poise that resists moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of quiet subversion emerges through the cradle image and Council/Sparks binary, avoiding overt moral. Subtext is modest: loaded glances, “they’ll know the spark can’t be extinguished.” Final uplift is resonant but familiar; no fresh ethical twist complicates the binary. Theme never acquires a personal price tag, so conceptual repricing is collective, not intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: pattern as living language versus pattern as code to crack. Subtext lives in gesture—each rock placement is a silent question to the sea. Final image reframes the mother’s promise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the storm truly averted or merely postponed? Complexity honored.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from concrete pattern: “rarefy” moves from cartographer’s charcoal scrawl to Kael’s lived poetics. Final image—storm kissing raw wonder—reweights earlier masked hiding without moralizing. Subtext in envelope’s silence and timer’s ticks; no thesis statements. Emotional aftereffect lingers: reader maps own scars in the cleared air.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges without sermon: questions as destinations vs. directions reframed by star-map reveal. Final image of side-by-side sheathed blades gives quiet resonance, though the phrase “dignified chaos” is stated twice, slightly diluting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from recurrence of “blooming resistance” in tin-lid graffiti and final poem—growth possible only inside decay. Subtext in Marla’s wind-chime laugh: shared fragility between guard and vagrant. No moralizing; the ending image (quill, dark, smile) answers the thematic question without assertion. Ambiguity persists: is perpetual self-loss liberation or curse? Resonance weighted by specificity of berry-ink, moth-wing coat, starlit metal.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—memory as compass, not cage—emerges through the mirror-test and seed sacrifice without sermon. The final smile reconfigures the monsoon from threat to renewal, offering Conceptual Repricing. No overt moral appears; subtext operates in image. Minor deduction for the chorus-of-islanders line (“to remember is to choose”) that flirts with thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    The “tides of remembrance” motif remains evocative but drifts toward thematic echo; the final image of a sky “washed clean by rain” is pretty yet conceptually light, repricing little beyond the momentary mood. A stronger thematic punch would require the lace or compass to re-weight Lira’s future choices rather than dissolve into tranquil sentiment.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: dust motes as stellar debris, fungal hyphae as accretion disks. The central question—can decay be read as transition rather than tragedy?—is answered non-literally in the chrysalis’s spiral dust, which reweights all prior imagery. Subtext thrives in gesture (ignoring calls, tracing dust paths) and avoids moralizing; the ending invites reflection on scientific humility without stating it. Ambiguity lingers—will the botanist’s collaboration validate her work?—but the conceptual shift is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through recurring images—frost, glass, scorched paper—that shift from survival artifacts to tools of revelation. The ending offers a non-literal answer: purpose lies not in permanence but in teaching others to see fleeting beauty. No moralizing; resonance arises from Lirael’s tactile choices. Ambiguity lingers (Is Elias redeemed? Is the cache real?), but thematic focus on “pauses” remains sharp and unforced.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: tuning forks, winterglass, heat-maps—all concrete tools that reject abstraction. The ending reweights silence not as lack but as presence, answering the central question (“Can silence sing?”) through the plants’ rhythmic dance, not exposition. Subtext thrives in gesture—Lirael’s soundless laugh, Elias’s sketches—and avoids moralizing. Complexity endures: her trauma isn’t “healed,” but repurposed; music isn’t restored, but reinvented.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through the lens metaphor: broken distress signals become directional hope via mended scars. The final image—light carrying “belonging”—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (Marisol’s hand on chest, Elias mending atlases) and avoids binaries; grief and revival coexist. Epiphany (“rest is a beginning”) arises from concrete action (installing the lens), not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: anonymity sustains but isolates; naming builds resilience through mutual recognition. The bell’s transformation—from silenced relic to daily celebratory instrument—reweights the premise without moralizing. Final lines (“It’s not the sound… it’s who rings it… And who listens”) offer resonant, non-literal closure that reconfigures the entire narrative as a meditation on witness and voice. Avoids sentimentality through concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: love as latent potential revealed through attention, not consumption. The central question—“Where is unused love stored?”—is answered non-literally in the final realization that it resides “in the spaces between breaths.” Avoids moralizing; wisdom arises from embodied experience (taste, breath, touch). Subtext thrives in the camera obscura metaphor—truth in inversion—and the pilgrim’s flames that burn without fuel, reweighted at closure as unignited potential.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s failed attempt to control time, culminating in the insight that moments persist not as manipulable threads but as stories that leave marks. The final image—designing a maze “to remember”—reweights her entire profession without moralizing. Recurring elements (photographs, fragment, bridge) accrue meaning through use, not declaration. Avoids sentimentality by grounding wisdom in sensory rupture and loss, though the epiphany borders on tidy given the scale of destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of resilience emerges organically through concrete particulars—the fletched arrow as map, seeds as liquid starlight—not abstraction. Final act reweights “liberation” from escape to propagation, offering a non-literal answer: freedom is sown, not seized. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether vines imprison or protect. Only slight overreach: “world was broken, but resilience had been planted” edges toward declarative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as fragile, extractable substance; trust as a shatterable frequency. The final image—Lira hearing “the silence between heartbeats”—offers a non-literal answer to her quest, reweighting all prior absences as echoes of relational rupture. Subtext thrives in objects (vials labeled “absence of time/inocence/orders”) and avoids moralizing. However, the phrase “memories fracture” borders on diagnostic abstraction, slightly undercutting earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars: theft reframed as dialogue, not extraction. The jar’s test (“offer something of equal weight”) crystallizes the central question—can stolen beauty become shared truth? Final image answers non-literally: the glowing photo proves illumination requires vulnerability, not just cunning. No moralizing; resonance builds from the lily’s decay and Elara’s wind-chime laugh disrupting silence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: glassblowing tension (bubbles/cracks as art), the bookmark’s fracture, and ice-thaw cycles coalesce into “cracks let light in” without moralizing. The ending offers non-literal resolution—rebirth via brokenness—repricing “abandonment” as fertile ground. Avoids sentimentality through concrete stakes (unfinished sculptures, choked circuitry). However, the final line’s “room for rebirth” edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting the otherwise earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: vulnerability as linguistic power, not weakness, reframed through Lila’s decoding of smudged notes and bodily fear. The shell’s whisper evolves from tidal pull to roar to promise, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Final image—Lila ready to face “heights and crowds and open water”—offers non-literal resolution. Avoids tidy binaries; Marisol remains flawed, redemption unearned but possible.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from Mara’s labor: silence as palimpsest, not void, reframes absence as layered presence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—navigation through moments of stillness—without moralizing, reweighting the flaking booklet’s dissolution as necessary imperfection. Subtext operates in gesture (gold flakes drifting like snow) and image (map glowing in cracks), avoiding prompt-like thesis statements. Ambiguity lingers: is the map real or hallucination?—but the emotional aftereffect (courage in darkness) feels earned through concrete struggle, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: thought arises from temporal-emotional collisions, not isolation. The violin’s fractal music and courtyard’s layered histories accrue meaning without moralizing. Final line—“the quiet joy of seeking answers”—offers resonant, non-literal closure that reweights the premise: janitorial labor becomes philosophical inquiry. Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in concrete action (sweeping) and specific loss (the violin’s dissolution).

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: communication transcends speech through objects, silence, and vibration. No moralizing—the insight arises from Elias’s tactile engagement with stubs, lens, and crystals. The final doodle reweights all prior “logs” as missed conversations. Ambiguity lingers (“resonant hush” as bridge), resisting tidy resolution while affirming that truth resides in unspoken honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from marbles, vines, and sensor-blocking—not stated until Elara’s “gardens know their gardeners,” which feels earned. The ending offers a non-literal answer: resilience isn’t about fixing cracks but letting them tell stories. Subtext operates in gesture (polishing) and silence (Joren’s stone gift). Avoids moralizing; instead, the blooming-with-wounds image reweights the entire premise without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: human ambition brushing against cosmic mystery, where discovery demands humility. The nexus isn’t just a tool—it’s a metaphor for controlled recklessness. Final image (Veyra reaching again) offers non-literal answer: knowledge isn’t closure but invitation. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the director’s unreadable motives and the flora’s alien sentience.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: creation lives in liminal spaces—between life/death, silence/sound, belief/doubt. The final image (“ghosts and musicians speak the same language”) reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in objects (program, bow) and silence; Clara’s quest isn’t about truth but communion, making the requiem a dialogue across time. No false balance—skeptics are dismissed, not redeemed.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: bearberry roots in thin soil mirror Lirael’s truth-taking in a crumbling system. No moralizing—the herbalist’s line (“grows where the world shows its cracks”) earns resonance through concrete action. Final image reweights the premise: fault tolerance isn’t algorithmic but human, rooted in fracture. Ambiguity lingers (Will the station collapse? Will she be believed?) without confusion, embracing complexity over tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: the real horror isn’t supernatural but institutional betrayal masked by urban legend. The valve’s transformation—from trophy to tombstone—reweights its meaning without moralizing. Final image (dawn, abandoned wheel etched with unreadable names) offers resonant, non-literal closure: some truths demand witness, not dissemination. Avoids sentimentality; embraces ambiguity while condemning greed.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the keeper’s struggle: knowledge burdens when filtered through judgment; silence regenerates by dissolving the self. The final image—keeper walking lightly as the river flows “unburdened and free”—offers non-literal resolution, reweighting the library’s “crumbling peace” as bridge, not chain. No moralizing; subtext lives in objects (swan’s relaxing folds = release of control). Ambiguity lingers (is the refuge real or psychological?), but cost is undeniable—the keeper’s face is irrevocably altered.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: “ordinary magic” isn’t stated but demonstrated through the curl’s glow contingent on memory. Final image reweights premise—Mara tucking the curl into her pocket answers “Can wonder persist?” without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—the charred diaries, embroidered dragons, rusting silo—rather than abstraction. The central question (“What happens when we stop listening?”) receives a resonant, non-literal answer: stories flee like dragons unless acknowledged. Clara’s line about belief crystallizes subtext without moralizing, and the ending reweights all prior fragments as living echoes, not relics.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—open secrets as levers of quiet revolution—emerges through concrete particulars: cookies, microdots, typewritten letters. Subtext thrives in objects and actions, never moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: “The key turns in the lock you forged” implies self-determined change, rejecting passive inheritance. Ambiguity lingers (will the flood drown or cleanse?), avoiding tidy resolution while affirming agency. No explicit thesis; resonance arises from Elara’s tactile engagement with legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from action: silence as negative space, stillness as canvas, assumptions as control mechanisms. The final line—“To decorate with silence is to leave room for the unexpected”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Recurring images (indigo, loops, silence) accumulate meaning and reconfigure at closure. Avoids pseudo-profundity by grounding abstractions in concrete ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of memory, time, and artifice: the “mirrored horizon” symbolizes lost temporal unity, and Lirael’s fortunes become vessels for its resurrection. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—symphonies woven from moments, not predictions—and reweights the premise: writing isn’t prophecy but preservation. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will customers understand the maps?), yet emotional honesty shines through sensory particulars. No pseudo-profundity; insights arise from concrete acts of creation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: selfhood as accumulation of choices, not fixed identity. The final image—walking grounded between drop and ripple—offers non-literal resolution, reweighting earlier chaos as necessary texture.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as container, not void. Subtext operates through gesture (soundless laugh), object (needle vs. filament), and image (drums as “conduits”). The ending offers a non-literal answer—numbness dissolves not by restoring hearing but by redefining listening—without moralizing. Recurring motifs (hush, backward songs) accrue meaning rather than state theme; Lila’s arc is inseparable from the central question of how emotion breathes in absence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the storm recorder’s dual role: instrument of prediction and tool of witness. The final log entry reweights “recording” from passive cataloging to active accountability, answering the central question: *What truths demand action?* No moralizing—resonance arises from ash (from anomalous storm) becoming ash (burned note), linking weather and secrecy. Ambiguity lingers (Will the press believe him?), avoiding tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: grief as proof of love, not weakness. The crystal vial’s memory-vision reframes Lirael’s sorrow as intergenerational continuity, avoiding moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: time as tapestry, not thread, woven from abandoned maybes. The rope’s transformation—from prison tool to map of lost choices—reweights the central question without moralizing. Final image (single thread in spiral) offers non-literal answer: pattern lies in integration, not selection. Avoids tidy binaries; Kael’s renunciation of “what might have been” carries conceptual cost. Subtext thrives in gesture (untying) over declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the mendicant’s bowl reweights from myth to metaphor to mechanism, embodying how silence can incubate sound. Subtext thrives in gesture—the warm bowl, charred twig in offerings—and avoids moralizing until Lira’s explicit line, which risks didacticism but lands because it’s immediately dramatized by communal action. Central question (“Can beauty exist in ruin?”) is answered non-literally through the vibrating bowl and rising voices. Ambiguity lingers: will this hope last?

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: the ethics of curated emotion, the necessity of partial truths for psychological survival. Subtext lives in gesture—the practiced smile, the careful storage of the used petal—and avoids moralizing.

No overt thesis; ambiguity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the locket photo, origami boats, and “humming clerk” accrue meaning without moralizing. Final image—Lila teaching children—answers the central question (“Who matters in the harbor’s rhythm?”) non-literally, reweighting “profit” to include invisible care.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: sap-stained hands, shifting-tag colors, interlocking branches. The final image—two figures joined beneath the arbor—offers a non-literal answer to “webs of kinship” without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: time as a loom, not a river, woven from borrowed moments and pauses. Subtext operates through image—the pendant’s warmth, backward waves, suspended pigeons—never moralizing. The ending reweights the premise non-literally: the giant’s nap sustains the city not through power but ritual care. Ambiguity lingers (are echoes real or perceptual?), but resonance is undeniable—some stories require multiple breaths.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme—emotion as fractal mosaic—emerges organically from concrete particulars: chipped eyes, cracked stone, starlight fruit. Subtext thrives in gesture (trembling fingers, breath fogging glass) and avoids moralizing. The ending reweights loss not as void but as fertile ground, offering a non-literal answer to “How do we hold absence?” without stating it. Ambiguity lingers (Is he truly present? Can grief nourish?), yet the insight feels earned through ritual struggle, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: invisibility as both protection and burden, with visibility reframed as service rather than exposure. The tape’s message (“you’re not alone”) reweights isolation into solidarity without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from plant behavior metaphors without moralizing. The linden leaf’s “circuitously sincere” resilience reframes survival as transformation, culminating in a non-literal answer: growth requires relinquishment.

Subtext thrives in silence (Mara’s grip on Eleanor’s wrist) and gesture (tendril brushing palm), resisting tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from Marin’s struggle: meaning isn’t extracted through force but grown through attention. The final note—“Meaning isn’t threshed. It’s grown”—could risk thematic echo, but it’s diegetic (written by the stranger) and immediately integrated into the canvas, avoiding moralizing. The brooch-as-convergence reweights the wars’ legacy from erasure to possibility. Resonance arises from concrete particulars—the duck, the cliffs, the pigment—not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of order and chaos, crystallized in the final image where harmony now contains an “unpredictable hum.” The pilgrim’s dialogue avoids moralizing; his “twins” metaphor is grounded in action (pearl transfer, shadow dissolution). Subtext thrives in sensory details—the violet/gold flare versus jagged shadows—and Elara’s silent endurance embodies the cost of wisdom. No tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers in whether this change is loss or liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: history as mosaic, not line, revealed through concrete actions—placing the valve, finding the journal, accepting the locket. The final image of the whole trumpet emitting a “clear, resonant note” offers a non-literal answer to fragmentation without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence, thresholds, and children’s whispers. No overt allegory; complexity is preserved—exile’s wounds aren’t erased, only sonically bridged.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the tension between control and surrender, mapped via concrete particulars: ledger lines vs. glowing arrows, drowned man’s ticket vs. blank “Begin” slip. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the fortress is a choice, not a destination—repricing all prior effort as preparation for courage, not discovery. Avoids moralizing; resonance lives in the updated map’s implied future journeys. Subtext thrives in silence (veiled woman’s departure) and charged objects (ticket exchange).

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the tile’s grooves, whale songs, and inked symbols coalesce into a meditation on intergenerational resilience. Subtext thrives in silence—the whales’ wordless chorus, Aelia’s unspoken ostracism—and avoids moralizing. Final image reweights the premise: mystery isn’t solved but embraced, with “truths best felt, not explained” shown through Clara’s pocketed talisman, not stated. Ambiguity lingers (will she return the tile?), resisting tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—loneliness as a self-perpetuating prison—emerges through the amulets feeding on “refusal to say goodbye,” not stated moral. The final image reweights the premise: the void isn’t emptiness but “a symphony of possibilities,” reframing goodbye as generative rather than terminal. Subtext thrives in gesture (fragments pressed together) and charged silence. No sentimentality; the cost of connection (uncertainty) is embraced without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)

The ink pot’s transformation—from deception tool to clarity conduit—reweights its meaning without moralizing. Final line (“no one ever has to fake their death again”) offers non-literal answer to the central question: justice requires dismantling corrupt structures, not just escaping them. Avoids tidy resolution by leaving systemic change aspirational.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: notepads made of banknotes, bonsai mimicking thornwood, and diary entries from fictional explorers coalesce into a meditation on memory as active creation. The ending reweights “invented histories” not as escapism but as ethical bridges across time—resisting tidy morals while affirming imagination’s restorative power. No thematic echo or sermonizing; resonance lives in the image of her thickening notepad. Ambiguity lingers (are these truths or fictions?), but the cost of belief is clear.

    Theme emerges organically: history isn’t lost—it’s weaponized. The poison label (“Not for the remembering”) reframes memory as resistance. Final image—Kael embracing his name and the tide—offers non-literal resolution: truth flows like water, hidden but persistent. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Who erased him? Why?), yet resonance is undeniable. Motifs (containers as burial mounds, tides as timekeepers) accumulate meaning without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: harmony bridges logic/wonder, life/death, past/present. The final line—“The universal riddle… was meant to be felt”—reweights all prior action without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: graffiti as encoded protest, the chip as historical anchor, reorganization as resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)

No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (vial, gas spiral, shadow in margins).

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: true direction arises not from data alone but from attuned interpretation of subtle, often invisible signals. The water basin—a metaphor for intuitive insight—gains resonance through repeated, functional use, not declaration. Final lines reprice the premise: the ship sails not just by hummingbird drones, but by an artisan who “listens” to light, suggesting navigation is as much art as engineering. No moralizing; subtext lives in gesture (Lira humming, Marlow’s hand on her shoulder) and the enduring drip of condensation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge isn’t fixed but fluid, like rivers; truth resides in motion, not representation. The final image—Clara drawing on a blank page while a falcon laughs—offers a non-literal answer: exploration continues because convergence is temporal, not spatial. No moralizing; the phrasebook’s evolution from tool to testament embodies the theme. Ambiguity lingers (Is the falcon real? Is light geological or metaphysical?) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through action: balance isn’t mechanical uniformity (“before the collapse”) but organic harmony (“a chorus”). The final line—“Balance, once restored, demands nothing less”—reweights prior decay into inevitability without moralizing. Subtext thrives in contrasts: rust vs. resonance, ash-scattered people vs. returning footsteps. No platitudes; wisdom arises from cobblestones sealing cracks and a child’s laugh syncing with rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: the futility of trapping the ephemeral versus the wisdom of release. The final line—“some things are meant to be unsnarled, not held”—resonates non-literally, reweighting the vial, the hush, and Mara’s mission without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (clutching vs. releasing) and environment (temple as mirror), avoiding abstraction. The priests’ regret and Mara’s dawn ascent offer quiet counterpoint, embracing complexity without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the lattice-as-pen metaphor and the act of “chasing hush” as prelude to truth-telling. The final image—Elias hovering above the reef, having written himself into being—offers a non-literal answer: identity is authored, not inherited. No moralizing intrudes; ambiguity lingers (the bodies, the ghost’s pride), yet the thematic stance is clear. The recurring ironwork shifts from vessel of sin to instrument of redemption, reweighting the entire premise without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: love/venom coexisting in one heart, debts transcending time. The pomegranate (seeds as embers), bead, and greenhouse reconfigure meaning at closure—the fruit’s vortex replaces seeds with liberation, repricing alchemy as mercy. Final image avoids moralizing; Elara’s realization (“some debts transcend time”) arises from concrete action, not assertion. Ambiguity lingers in the ghost’s “mournful elation”—is freedom joy or loss?—without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)

    Theme emerges through particulars: bones as both grave and garden, roots as memory and obstacle. The ending offers a non-literal answer—faith as “enough” despite incompleteness—reweighting the diaspora’s loss without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (villagers drawn by light, not words). Avoids binaries; tradition is neither salvaged nor discarded but tenderly restarted.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: survival through embedded memory, not digital permanence. The final image—Lira walking away, clipboard humming—reweights “futuristic nostalgia” as active reinvention, not longing. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete acts (etching chalk, inserting chip). The phoenix seal and spiral motif accrue meaning without over-explanation, resisting binary oppositions between past/future.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through craft-as-resistance: embroidery hides rebellion, silence carries revelation. The final transformation of the spiral galaxy—truth “hidden in the seams”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how marginalized knowledge survives. Subtext thrives in gesture (Zara’s laugh, Jaxon’s hesitation) and avoids moralizing. The piece resists binaries, portraying wisdom as performative survival rather than heroic defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: unsaid words hold beauty even when broken. No moralizing—insights arise from condensation letters dissolving at touch, shard smoothing, spirits singing resilience. Final image reweights premise: silence isn’t failure but fertile ground (“space where love and forgiveness could still grow”). Ambiguity lingers (letters remain fragmented), resisting tidy resolution while affirming courage to speak forward.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from coral/cast parallels: meaning regrows from ruins not through equivalence but alchemy. Subtext thrives in gestures—the general touching sharp ridges, Lira’s palm bitten by coral—and avoids moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: broken things hold blueprints for wholeness, reweighting earlier loss without stating a thesis. “Lotus-hearted ache” encapsulates complexity—grief and tenderness coiled—not resolved but transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the exposed film metaphor: undeveloped history needs light to manifest. The ending reweights this non-literally—the display *is* the developer—and joy isn’t restored but reborn as collective action. Avoids moralizing; resonance lives in Marla dancing and children chasing light-words. “Pensive mirth” isn’t stated but embodied in Lira’s shift from elegy to resurrection.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: awakening as rhythm, not destination; curiosity as antidote to certainty. The flapper’s wink and grandfather’s lullaby reprice restoration as dialogue across time, not mere repair. No moralizing—the insight arises from the nickel’s rough surface scattering sound into memory. Final image (the etched nickel in the mural) silently answers the central question: art holds ghosts, and listening resurrects them.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—resistance through organic, decentralized language—emerges via particulars: bean-row ciphers, QR-winged moths, bioluminescent herbs. Subtext thrives in gestures (Lillian’s sigh before unlocking the drawer) and charged objects (the seed’s fractal shadows). The ending reweights prior material: what began as academic intrigue becomes civic defiance, with no moralizing. However, the anti-surveillance premise leans slightly generic, lacking a specific institutional antagonist to ground the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation isn’t conservation but co-creation across time. The glass-orchids and cracked chime embody this—memory thrives through adaptation, not replication.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: language as harmony, silence as dammed rivers, trust as interwoven promises. The final manuscript—“Even when we’re silent, our hearts speak in the language of belonging”—offers a non-literal answer to Elara’s central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in objects (ink well’s runes) and actions (crumpling then calling), avoiding prompt-like declarations. The core concept integrates seamlessly: reconstructing dead languages mirrors rebuilding broken bonds, with both requiring vulnerability as the price of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of precision and emotion, machinery and mercy. The final line—“compassion, measured link by link, breath by breath”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether human feeling can be calibrated like floodgates. No moralizing; subtext lives in adhesive patterns and chain clicks. Ambiguity lingers (Will trust hold? Will floodgates fail?), but the conceptual repricing of compassion as quantifiable yet fragile feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: truth hidden in plain sight, balance found in chaos, echoes as both burden and key.

Subtext thrives in gesture: Elias rewarding the pigeon, tracing air patterns, packing silently. No false equivalence; the grandfather’s disgrace and Elias’s reinvention carry moral weight without redemption arcs.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of architecture, memory, and choice—not stated but embodied in prisms, grain, and codes. The ending offers a non-literal answer: sacredness resides in the act of crossing, not the destination. Final codes (“Distance is a kind of prayer”) reweight the entire premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (Is the father real? Is the door permanent?), yet the emotional aftereffect—earned belonging through necessary distance—is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: the burnt feather (sky relic) catching underwater light reframes belonging as resonance across dissonant realms. No moralizing—insight arises through the alignment’s ephemeral beauty and collective gasp. Subtext thrives in silence (fogged glass, shared exhale) and avoids binaries; decay coexists with wonder. Final image—Mara facing a new day “heart full of shadowseam wonder”—reweights the premise: belonging isn’t location but attunement, a non-literal answer earned through sensory particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme—memory, release, and the necessity of forgetting—emerges organically from concrete particulars: molasses-like regret, silent seeds, dissolving paths. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing: disappearance is mercy, not loss.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through action: creativity as intervention against mechanized repetition. The chess piece and compass rose resonate without moralizing—strategy and navigation become lived metaphors. Final image reweights “randomness” not as noise but as raw material awaiting guidance. Avoids tidy resolution; the clown halts but isn’t fixed, preserving complexity. No explicit thesis; insight arises from the fountain-lit convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme—yearning as necessity, not rebellion—emerges through particulars: fading constellations, stolen dust, elective exile. Final image offers non-literal answer: endurance in the in-between reweights “Before” as private ritual, not public defiance. No moralizing; resonance arises from moonstone dissolving into skin. Ambiguity lingers (ban intact, verse temporary) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s trade, tools, and actions—not assertion. The prism’s refraction becomes a metaphor for perception itself, culminating in the CR that “smallest things can hold the light of the world.” This avoids moralizing by rooting insight in concrete ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from fire-as-transformation, ash-as-fertilizer, and frozen-time-made-fluid—never stated outright. The hourglass reweights the premise: time bends for those who listen, reframing Elias’s hesitation not as failure but as latent attunement.

Subtext thrives in silence (forest sighing), gesture (kneeling, tipping sand), and resonant objects, avoiding pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: hope is not passive faith but an active, tactile construction woven from intention, light, and loss. The final image—Elara listening as the grotto’s mouth frames the sky “like a mouth about to speak”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: hope resides in attentive waiting, not certainty. Subtext thrives in the silver thread (sacrifice of self) and the number 17 (meaningless here, resonant elsewhere)—particulars that avoid moralizing. The story resists tidy resolution; the equations remain unfinished, yet the act of seeking becomes its own validation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the diaries, the locket, the negative. No moralizing—only the whispered “You are the map” reweights the entire premise. Legacy isn’t kept but shared; memory isn’t stored but lived. The final photograph of her grandmother reframes all prior searching as cyclical inheritance, not discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through action: art as communion across death, perception as limitation and portal. The final meadow image reweights the entire premise—not escape, but coexistence of loss and possibility. No moralizing; resonance arises from the locket’s pulse syncing with song. Ambiguity lingers (are the visions real?), but emotional truth is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (clipboard), setting (terrace), and action (negotiation): redemption isn’t purity but endurance amid imperfection. The final image—Elara descending as statues “watch her go”—offers a non-literal answer: peace is cyclical, costly, and never complete, yet worth pursuing. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the treaty’s “ambiguous” language. Slight deduction for near-platitude phrasing (“flawed beauty of compromise”) that borders on thematic echo without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the egg, the map, the recordings. No moralizing; instead, the final image—“some truths were better left cracked”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about complicity and grace. Subtext thrives in silence (the unspoken egg) and irony (scholarships for “ecological resilience” atop dead rivers). The story embraces complexity: the bird’s song haunts him not because he repents, but because even monsters crave ghosts.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: resistance through embodied artistry versus enforced silence. The final image—snowflakes as “testament to quiet defiance”—offers a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Echoes as “symphony of resistance” reweights the premise (memory as weapon) with conceptual cost. Avoids binaries; conformity isn’t evil, but its erasure of discordant notes is challenged through lyrical particularity, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through puppet mechanics and campfire metaphor, avoiding moralizing until the final exchange—which subverts expectation by reframing “half-truths” as necessary complexity. Mara’s grandfather’s wisdom deepens rather than dictates, and the reversed roles offer non-literal answer: power is relational, not inherent. Epiphanies arise from concrete action (manipulating stick), not abstraction. Final line (“inviting you to lean in”) resonates without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the moth wing, spider silk, monarch’s flight—not abstraction. The ending offers a non-literal answer: reverence resides in temporary acts, not monuments. Subtext thrives in silence (the shared space between moth wing and butterfly legs) and avoids moralizing. Minor flaw: “transiently rooted existence” risks label-speak but is grounded by Lirael’s tactile labor.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as braid of light/shadow, sound made tangible. No moralizing—resonance lives in the rope’s reweaving and floor-mosaic names burning brighter. Final image answers the central question non-literally: preservation isn’t resurrection, but illumination that refuses erasure. Complexity remains; Lira appears yet stays spectral, honoring loss while affirming persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Mara’s actions: paths are grown, not walked, through integration of order/chaos. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the wafer seal pressed into earth as a “promise”—that reweights the directive from command to collaboration. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from concrete images (wolf in glass maze, mismatched blocks) rather than abstraction. Subtext thrives in contrasts: bunker decay vs. forest growth, lucid control vs. storm surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: frugality as epistemology, curiosity as covenant. The tile’s transformation from relic to mirror reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext thrives in embodied details—counting coppers vs. wielding cosmic schematics—and avoids binaries (empiricism vs. faith). Final Babylonian word “Asharu” resonates non-literally, binding theme to character action.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the scarred-but-mended pin: true peace requires embracing imperfection, not erasing pain. Subtext thrives in silence—the sanctuary mirrors internal noise—and the pin’s reappearance embodies grace as cyclical, not permanent. Avoids moralizing until Lirael’s line “Grace isn’t perfect… but it shifts,” which borders on thematic echo but is salvaged by Kael’s wordless smile. Final image reweights the premise effectively: the pin in Kael’s hand signifies hope as fragile action, not abstract ideal. Yet the cellular memory device risks reducing emotional complexity to pseudoscientific magic.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: boundaries aren’t erased but navigated—a non-literal answer to the central question. The recurring mirror motif evolves from reflection to portal to guide, reweighting meaning without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (synchronized breath, shared labor) and the final mirror gift. Avoids sentimentality; the dream’s elusiveness preserves mystery while affirming craft as bridge between worlds.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: mending broken things with scraps is how legacy survives institutional collapse. The final image—Lira walking home with copper wire and starlight—reweights earlier details without moralizing. “Accidental wisdom” avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in action (sealing cracks, catching ribbons). However, “deciduous vows” borders on abstract label; the concept isn’t dramatized enough to fully earn its philosophical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from pistachio-shell fractals and bark-carved names: legacy as participatory, not passive. The final image—Elara’s name awaiting inscription—reweights “nonlinear inheritance” from abstract concept to embodied practice without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gaps: the board’s fear contrasts her courage; constellations in the cameo-eyes imply ancestral continuity beyond blood. Avoids binaries; complexity lingers in her “brightened disquiet”—knowledge brings peace and unease.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—knowledge requires humility—emerges organically from Elara’s arc and the library’s rules, never stated outright. The “Door of Unlearned Lessons” mosaic and diary’s gaps reweight the premise: true learning begins in acknowledged ignorance. Final image (“lessons were felt, a dance of ignorance and discovery”) offers resonant, non-literal closure without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (What will they learn? At what cost?), avoiding false equivalence while rejecting simplistic binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: forgotten names blooming as flowers reweights memory as cultivation, not recovery. The final image—sewing their name into soil—offers a non-literal answer to “how do we belong?” without moralizing. Subtext operates in teeth marks on the card, antlers brushing wings, and the meadow’s hum. Avoids binaries; the seamstress’s ghost isn’t redeemed but remembered.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through artifact interaction: the seal, rope, and scroll coalesce into a system for preserving displaced knowledge. Subtext thrives in the phoenix-serpent crest—negotiation across divides—and the “fables of absence” as practical guides, not myths. The ending reweights “absence” from loss to potential, offering a non-literal answer: order arises not from erasing chaos but weaving it. No moralizing; resonance flows from Elara’s quiet copying.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges implicitly: true harmony integrates dissonance rather than purging it. This is embodied in the bloom’s void-center that “swallowed noise” without annihilating its source, and crystallized in the ending’s “duet of hush and hum.” No moralizing; insight arises from the mapkeeper’s tactile struggle with ice and memory. The final image reweights all prior echoes—not as lost sounds to be mourned, but as fractures that now hold new resonance—offering a non-literal answer to the central question of how to live with irreparable rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning isn’t found but forged through fragile acts of attention. The prism’s reframed purpose (“not to guide ships… but to remind”) offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. Final image—shards turned to hope—reweights all prior struggle, embracing ambiguity (stars don’t fully return) while rejecting nihilism. No thematic echo; insight arises from concrete particulars (mosaic, sextant, bleeding hands).

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: collective memory isn’t stated but embodied in vibrating crystal, distorted shadows, evaporating puddles. Final CR reweights premise—memory’s value lies not in preservation but in how it shapes present action (“wind carving stone”). Avoids moralizing; resonance comes from Lirael’s silent smile as sunlight hits puddles, not exposition. Central question—how to exist within time’s flow—answered non-literally through her lighter footsteps descending, carrying the hush within.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through the fire-lily motif: light as both destruction and renewal. The final image—reflected radiance replacing stars—answers the central question (“Can failure birth beauty?”) non-literally, reweighting her scarred past as fertile ground. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete acts (knot igniting lily). Ambiguity lingers—mentor’s fate unresolved—but the thematic resonance (resilience as internal ignition) feels earned, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of tide, cicada, and dialogue—transition as fertile pause, not void. The final image of the cicada as “silent guardian of the in-between” offers a non-literal answer to Kael’s accusation: truth isn’t always direct. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture (Kael’s softened silhouette, the nod), avoiding moralizing. However, the insight borders on familiar wisdom; originality lies in execution, not conceptual risk.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—how loss transforms constraint into possibility—emerges organically through the doll’s absence and the sprout’s arrival. Subtext lives in silence-as-substance and “intangibly tangible” paradoxes. The ending offers a non-literal answer: hope isn’t held but grown. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from concrete particulars (porcelain chip, green shoot), not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as active presence, not void. The storm glass refracts noise into stillness just as the narrative refracts chaos into clarity. Final image—gondola gliding “a blade cutting through the dark”—reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld: no passengers, no dialogue, only water, light, and liquid resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: legacy isn’t inherited but claimed through self-recognition. The throne-as-mirror reframes “ascension” from power to responsibility, reweighting all prior imagery (ruby flake, murals, stairway). Avoids moralizing; resonance lives in Lira’s silent smile at dawn. Final line crystallizes theme without stating it: “a story to write, wisely and adventurously.” One near-slip—the journals’ quoted line borders on thematic echo but is offset by immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: connection as necessary risk, not weakness. The doorknocker ring shifts from relic to lifeline, and “linking through scars” reframes damage as conduit. Final image—shared hand-hold under fading starlight—offers non-literal answer: balance requires vulnerability. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will thresholds stabilize?). Recurring ash/starlight motifs reweight meaning without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: pressure as language, diamonds as metaphor for hardened trauma. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing—Mara’s grin at “You’re welcome” implies resilience is relational, not solitary. Recurring images (bolt, glow, texts) accrue meaning, and the CR (“Diamonds are a metaphor”) avoids banality by grounding insight in tactile action. No false equivalence: pyramid schemes lie; fungal farms demand honest translation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—silence as love, power as burden—emerges organically through images: the mute gramophone, sealed letters, “eloquently silent” ancestors. The ending reweights the dynasty’s fall not as failure but conscious sacrifice, offering a non-literal answer to “What is legacy?” No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (twine-bound letters, pulsing brass). Ambiguity lingers (Will transparency succeed?), avoiding false closure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: control vs. surrender, artifice vs. lived experience. The marionette program’s shifting text (“unsnap” → “descend” → “strings were never meant to hold you”) reweights prior material without moralizing. Final insight—that possibility is a dance—is earned through shattering an orb and feeling stardust, not stated. Subtext thrives in silence (Cedric’s wordlessness) and charged objects (mirror-eyed puppet), avoiding allegory while resisting tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the button, dust patterns, and sparse file notes coalesce into a meditation on archival justice and the persistence of memory in absence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—writing as reparative act—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture (the disturbed dust circle implying a prior sitter), and the story resists tidy resolution, embracing ambiguity about John Doe’s fate while affirming the value of trying to know.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through action: truth as fragile, recoverable only through coded means (puddles, keys, algae-lit tunnels). Final image reweights the premise—not victory, but endurance (“The line had held”)—without moralizing. Key recurrence (from cold relic to warm symbol) charges closure. Avoids binaries: tyranny erases, but rebels preserve imperfectly. Subtext thrives in silence—Mara’s smile isn’t triumph, but resolve amid loss.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the tension between revelation and concealment, voiced via recurring motifs (mist, negative space, code) without moralizing. The final image—dewdrops as scattered diamonds—offers a non-literal answer: some truths must stay hidden, not out of fear, but stewardship. Subtext thrives in silence and gaps between notes. No platitudes; ambiguity lingers (“merely postponed”) yet feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: folklore as living language, memory as active practice. The ending reweights prior material non-literally—the dissolving moonstone isn’t mourned because transformation is the point—and avoids moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (brushing dust from hands) and image (monuments as testament), resisting binaries while honoring cost through Elinor’s quiet resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: broken clocks, swirling leaves, and a spinning compass needle coalesce into a resonant answer—truth isn’t fixed but reflective. The final line (“It was a mirror”) avoids moralizing by grounding insight in object behavior. Subtext thrives in gesture (soldering with copper wire, planting seeds) rather than declaration. Ambiguity lingers (will the garden grow?), but the thematic reweighting—planning as befriending uncertainty—is earned through concrete action, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of alchemy, naming, and repair—never stated outright. The kintsugi metaphor evolves from decorative memory to active philosophy, culminating in Kael’s realization that balance means holding brokenness, not fixing it. The final image (empty hand, dimmed light) reweights all prior mentions of gold—not as healing, but as trace of loss. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture; Lira’s translucent form embodies the theme without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: healing requires both joy and truth, not one without the other. The crocodile’s tooth reweights from tool to symbol of resilient truth-telling, culminating in Lira’s realization that “healing… is a pursuit.” No moralizing—the insight arises from concrete exchange, not assertion. Final image (birds replacing harp notes) offers non-literal resolution, recharging the sunrise motif with earned hope.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of torture-tech (UV lamps, truth serums) and natural wonder (fractals, Fibonacci), rejecting the captors’ lie that mercy is weakness. The final image—Elias walking into the wood with strap in hand—offers a non-literal answer: mercy isn’t quantified but inhabited through continued presence. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will he find it? can it be mapped?), yet the emotional aftereffect is clear. Recurring motifs (strap, UV light) accrue weight without forced symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: translation as seeing hidden threads, honoring overlooked histories as ethical duty. The final image—Lira carrying the fragment while city lights twinkle like scattered stars—offers a non-literal answer: mending is possible through attention to detail. No moralizing; resonance arises from the lighthouse beam now pulsing in her mind. Complexity is preserved—the drowned world chose fear, yet deserves remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—unseen stories demand witness—emerges organically through dust, cracks, and photographs, never stated outright. The final image reweights the façade’s decay from structural flaw to emotional archive, offering a non-literal answer: repair isn’t mechanical but memorial. Subtext thrives in gesture (clown’s cracked face mirroring the child) and silence (whispers over exposition). Avoids moralizing, though the ghosts’ swift fade slightly softens the lingering ambiguity that would push it to 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—order as cage, rupture as liberation—emerges through concrete particulars: frost lattices, press plates, humming liquid. The ending offers a non-literal answer: awakening isn’t destruction but transformation, felt through patrons rebuilding guided by frost. No moralizing; resonance arises from the spiral’s reappearance, implying cyclical renewal. Complexity is preserved—freedom carries terror alongside wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: civilizations are built not on monuments but on courage to confront buried truths. The mirror motif avoids allegory—it’s literal conduit and metaphor for distorted reflection, culminating in Kael’s line: “Civilizations… built on the courage to see what mirrors hide.” Final image reweights all prior material without moralizing; the fungi’s glow embodies memory as living, subterranean resistance. Ambiguity lingers (Council not toppled), but doubt is the seed of revolution—earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the stone as mirror, cracks letting light in, midnight stealing via concealment. Final image reweights prior material non-literally—the melody becomes “truth,” not repair—avoiding moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (Lira’s clenched hands) and implication (“infected by midnight”). Ambiguity lingers: can grief ever be transmuted, or only faced? No tidy resolution, just earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from Lira’s pursuit: the tension between knowing and mystery resolves not in answers but in reverence for the unsolvable. The final image—jars labeled yet holding something “almost sentient”—reweights all prior collecting as naive. No moralizing; instead, the resonant hum implies that true memory resists capture. This non-literal answer to “What is the earth’s memory?” avoids binaries and embraces epistemological humility with haunting specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from object and action: simplicity as thread that holds complexity together. The mermaid’s kelp hair reweights from decoration to timeline only after Lira’s epiphany—no moralizing, just resonant reconfiguration. Subtext thrives in silence (the grandmother’s “You’re late”) and implication (sculptures as maps). Avoids binaries; the island’s chaos isn’t tamed, merely woven, preserving its mystery while granting legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through accumulated images: night-blooming jasmine, shifting glass etchings, bioluminescent murals—all refract the central question of darkness as nourishment, not absence. The ending offers a non-literal answer: “Flowers bloom at night… in communion” reweights the grandmother’s “tyranny of the sun” into symbiosis, transforming defiance into reciprocity. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete acts (painting silence, pressing palm to glass). The recurring postcards and window etchings accrue subtext—secrets “breathe and grow” in the hush—without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: encryption as protection, publishing as vulnerability, memory as contested ground. Final image—blank diary held at dawn—offers non-literal answer: truth persists beyond documents, in acts of defiance. Avoids moralizing; Elara’s warning (“They’ll erase us all”) resonates without thesis statement. Subtext thrives in debris language and fungal-lit codex chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: civilization persists not in stone but in shared memory, and alchemy is reconceived as mnemonic labor. The amber bottle’s shift from sealed vessel to focusing lens reweights the entire premise—what seemed impenetrable becomes generative. No moralizing; resonance arises through concrete particulars (fisherman’s net filling, jammed door opening). The ending offers a non-literal answer: resurrection is impossible, but reimagining is sacred work—and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of memory, sound, and ecological sentience—roots remember, leaves scream—without moralizing. The final image (Voss watching stars while the city flickers like candles) offers a non-literal answer: truth resides in patient witnessing, not intervention. Subtext thrives in silence, vibration, and botanical response, avoiding platitudes. The story resists binary readings; the “storm” is neither good nor bad, only inevitable, and wisdom lies in attunement.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and sacrifice: seed savers guard life by feeding decay into rebirth. The final sapling offers a non-literal answer—borrowed time isn’t hoarded but circulated through death and growth. No moralizing; resonance accrues via concrete particulars (acorn cap, veined egg, mottled beans). The “texture of borrowed time” reframes the entire premise without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—listening as active harmony, not passive silence—emerges through bell mechanics, cloud responses, and Lira’s hands. Subtext thrives in action: alternating ropes mimics natural wind rhythms, reweighting “noise” as disharmony. Final image offers non-literal answer: sanctuary hums as ally, not fortress. Avoids moralizing; wisdom arises from tactile struggle, not assertion.

Subtext thrives in silence (Veyra’s unsaid understanding) and gesture (kneeling, lifting the glass). Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in concrete ritual. Only slight overreach: “flourishing stillness” risks abstraction but is anchored by repeated embodied practice.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—unspoken words as burdens requiring release—emerges organically through image and action, not assertion. The stained glass box reweights meaning: from artifact of preservation to vessel of liberation. Final shattering offers non-literal resolution: truth isn’t hoarded but scattered, freeing both dead and living. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from concrete particulars (bees, child, promise) rather than abstraction. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the ghosts’ serene nodding.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: time isn’t lost to entropy but preserved in objects’ emotional echoes.

Final image (feather held to fading light, knowing it will vanish) offers a non-literal answer to rupture: respond with care, not control. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether harmony is real or wishful, deepening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the amber’s failure-as-success: homecoming isn’t replicable chemistry but the collision of memory and presence. The final line—“a door creaked open”—answers the central question non-literally: truth lies beyond the Enclave’s lab, in lived ambiguity. Subtext thrives in silence (Kael’s nod) and image (featureless sculptures as mirrors). No moralizing; the insight arises from concrete ritual, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: regeneration requires listening to loss. Subtext operates through seed pods, bone-ash fertilizer, and untranslated words—never moralized.

Jeb’s line “turned tinted revelations into something real” borders on thematic echo but is grounded in character voice, narrowly avoiding penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of sketching, compass, and dilation: true north as a willingness to explore confusion, not a fixed point. The final image—Elio stepping into golden light, quill ready—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the compass’s evolution from ornament to guide. No platitudes; wisdom arises from meteorite ink and warped constellations.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: wonder as sacred play, balance through mystery rather than control. The chessboard—a game of rigid rules—becomes a vessel for fluid, hidden truths (memories in wax, silence in vials), reframing theft as restoration. Final image of the warmed sundial reweights the opening relic into a symbol of earned guardianship. However, the closing line (“guardian of wonder, sacredly playful”) edges toward thematic echo, slightly undercutting resonance with near-declarative phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through the pawnless chessboard and Elara’s ritual: history erases quiet actors, but they are the true movers. Subtext lives in gesture—the toppled king, reversed walking, pieces filling gaps—never stated outright. The ending offers a non-literal answer: documentation isn’t archival but embodied action (“document every step”). No moralizing; resonance arises from the board’s reconfiguration and her departure at dawn—charged poise with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the feather, the stone, the mercury skin coalesce into a non-literal answer—home is the act of remembering, not a location. No moralizing; the insight arises from Lirael’s struggle, not authorial intrusion. Subtext operates through image (feather dissolving into stardust) and gesture (hands flecked with obsidian). The final line reweights the premise without stating a thesis: “to seed the world with truth, via the texture of a feather” resonates because every prior beat earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: forgiveness as weaving fractured threads (guilt, hope, regret) into new meaning. The final image—tapestry restored, labyrinth faded—offers non-literal resolution: mistakes aren’t erased but repurposed. Avoids moralizing; Alaric’s insight (“some threads couldn’t be untangled—only woven”) arises from concrete action (thread-plucking). Subtext thrives in silence (frozen villagers) versus sound (laughter reborn), resisting binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Kael’s actions and the canyon’s response—not from assertion. The central question (“Who owns truth?”) is answered non-literally by the spire’s light fracturing across bone towers, reweighting every prior image. Subtext thrives in double-meaning verses and the elders’ ash-gray robes versus Kael’s nightshade ink. Avoids moralizing; even the child’s laugh serves resonance, not message. However, Kael’s final line—“learned how to see”—edges close to abstraction, slightly undercutting the otherwise earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through kintsugi as survival, not repair—integrated via quilts, shattered flasks, and constellations. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: the tension between transience and permanence refracted through art, memory, and maternal legacy. The painted shell and mirrored pool reweight “temporary eternity” from platitude to lived paradox. No moralizing; insight arises through action—drawing the unseen cavern—and the final image (“secret etched in salt and light”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers (Is the vision real? Is peace sustainable?), but never confuses.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through particulars: crushed herbs, humming breath, trembling cork—not abstract claims. The final paragraph offers a non-literal answer—whispers *do* travel, as felt pressure in strangers’ bodies—reweighting Elara’s grief and fear as connective tissue. Subtext thrives in silence: no one speaks the warmth, yet both feel it. Avoids moralizing; resonance arises from concrete cause (hum + scent) and effect (dropped needle, paused knot).

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the censer foot’s transformation: from inert heirloom to active conduit, mirroring how grief can become navigable terrain. The ending offers a non-literal answer—loss isn’t erased but mapped through memory-laced signals—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the unsaid names of drowned harbors) and gesture (trembling hand on receiver). Ambiguity lingers (are the voices real or psychological?), but resonance is earned through concrete ritual, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: truth’s duality as both weapon and balm, safety as active choice rather than feeling. The glass eye reframes honesty—not as purity but as calibrated exposure—and the final line (“wielded with care”) offers non-moralistic insight. Subtext thrives in silence (Mara’s hesitation before using the eye) and gesture (hand closing around it). Avoids sermonizing, though “safety isn’t just a feeling—it’s a choice” flirts with abstraction without fully grounding it in image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: isolation isn’t solitude but carrying what isn’t yours. This reframes both Elias’s widowhood and the captain’s theft—not as escape but parasitic evasion. The Edelweiss reweights from death token to restitution symbol without moralizing. Final image—a child’s laughter waiting to be reclaimed—offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: can borrowed pain ever absolve guilt? No tidy redemption; only earned return.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: maps as metaphors for agency, not destiny. The spiral/glimmer motif shifts from external promise to internal compass, culminating in Lila’s realization that “following the ants” means trusting her own path. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from particulars (type chip, sunflowers, creek song). Subtext thrives in silence—her father’s smile implies forgiveness without words. Slight deduction: “lingering promise” edges toward abstraction but is redeemed by the journey’s tangible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the bleeding starlight motif: light as both wound and truth, mirroring the queen’s suppressed pain. The ending offers non-literal resolution—her descent isn’t escape but charged endurance, reweighting “disenchantment” as fear masquerading as numbness. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will she change?) while conceptual cost is undeniable (she now knows her bleeding is self-inflicted). Fireflies’ ephemeral guidance subtly critiques passive hope versus active reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: failure revalued as necessary alchemy, not discarded. The columella curl shifts from obsession to collaborator, embodying the idea that presence requires surrender, not conquest. Final image—painting with the “palette of resolve”—answers the central question non-literally: transformation arises from perspective, not power. Avoids moralizing; insight grows from shattered engines and singed parchment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between chronicling and living, with “feral nostalgia” as both wound and guide. The blank scroll’s appearance offers a non-literal answer: meaning isn’t recorded—it’s generated in the act of facing absence. Avoids moralizing; the final insight arises from concrete particulars (birch bark, moonlight, fissure). Recurrence of “soar/fall” reweights flight from metaphor to internal stance without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of lost senses, mechanical relics, and maternal guilt—resilience as an “ordinary miracle.” The final image (river reflecting shop windows, chimes ringing) offers a non-literal answer: healing isn’t grand revelation but quiet reconnection. No moralizing; subtext lives in the screw’s polish, the fog’s lift, and the unspoken bond. Recurrence of “occluded views” and “reading between lines” charges closure without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: pain becomes narrative through ritual, not erasure. The final image—scars as readable language—offers a non-literal answer to “how to live with failure?” without moralizing. Recurring elements (quill, breath, shedding) accrue meaning without forced symbolism. Insight is earned through concrete struggle: rune fails if forced, succeeds only when Kael accepts contradiction (fear and courage coexisting).

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of music, memory, and metaphor: “imperfect miracles” isn’t moralized but enacted through flawed ritual. The final image—chainsaws roaring as the bottle empties—reweights silence as both loss and release, rejecting tidy exorcism for resonant coexistence. Subtext thrives in gesture (trembling hands, refracted light) and avoids diagnostic labels. The story trusts ambiguity: is Lila real or psychological? The answer matters less than the cost of listening.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of dictionary, library, and inward journey: truth as continuous unification, not fixed answer. The blank final pages offer a resonant, non-literal resolution that reweights all prior definitions without moralizing. Subtext thrives in images (mirrors reflecting soul-fragments, mural figures stepping out) rather than exposition. Avoids tidy binaries by embracing paradox (“journeying inward while walking out”) as epistemological stance.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the razor-edged key, backward counting, and submerged clock coalesce into a resonant insight—that timekeeping measures human longing, not objective duration. No moral is stated; instead, the final image of hands dissolving into light reweights every prior tick and whisper. Ambiguity lingers (Is the clock real? A vision?), but emotional truth is undeniable. The grandfather’s aphorism (“Time’s not a thread…”) refracts meaningfully at closure without echo or sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: barriers as manifestations of fear, surrender as flow, not weakness. The final image—steady mushroom glow replacing defensive flicker—answers the central question non-literally: true security requires vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the chalk door, mica-warped text, and subway car scribbles coalesce into a non-literal answer—contradictions as mirrors, not traps. No moralizing; insight arises from Clara’s tactile engagement with chaos. The final line (“visit her father”) reweights all prior abstraction into human connection, avoiding sentimentality through concrete action. Subtext thrives in silence: what remains unsaid between Clara and her absent father haunts every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from Mara’s actions: wrong numbers as opportunities for human resonance. The glass disc’s evolution—from curiosity to mirror to lullaby—reweights “estrangement” as fertile ground, not void. Final image (“even wrong numbers could lead somewhere right”) offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (David’s pause before “Who?”) and gesture (child’s dried tears), though “cultivated estrangement” edges toward label-speak without full dramatization of its paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: collective memory as active, daily practice rather than passive inheritance. The locket photo and walnut ink accrue subtextual weight, culminating in the resonant final image—Elara walking away as the jetty “sighs”—which answers the central question non-literally: preservation is ongoing labor, not a finished act. Avoids moralizing; complexity resides in the tension between beauty’s fragility and resilience through attention. The covenant’s renewal is reframed as storytelling itself.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the moon rock (unchanged) versus the ghost (accumulated isolation) enacts reciprocity as balance, not erasure. The conductor’s insight—that loneliness is a language we’ve forgotten—reweights the premise without moralizing. Final resonance lies in Lira’s “catalyzed a conversation,” implying healing as ongoing dialogue, not cure. No platitudes; the ambiguity lingers (did they *really* help?), but the emotional honesty of Elias’s eased chest makes the theme felt, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through precise particulars: mapping as emotional reckoning, blindness as deeper sight, sound as language of loss. The final image—mother’s voice as skin-vibration—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in the ring’s silence and the river’s inversion. Ambiguity lingers (is she real or memory?), but resonance is undeniable: true navigation requires surrender to feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: editing history is about nurturing, not erasing—turning mistakes into seeds. The pen’s transformation from writing tool to listening device reweights the core metaphor without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as fertile ground, not void, refracted through Kael’s inherited role and the camera’s filmless lens. The final image—“the silence had spoken, and the world had listened”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.

    Theme emerges organically from Mara’s acts: knowledge as living garden requiring tending, not static preservation. The final image—her grandmother’s face restored through a tear—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor truth without entombing it. Subtext thrives in gesture (painting over acid burns) and silence (the unblinking eye), avoiding moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as living inheritance, not haunting. The lagoon’s colors and the drumming ritual embody subtext without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer—thriving requires co-creation—through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—knowledge through quiet attention versus performative assertion—emerges organically from Elias’s actions, not exposition. The final line (“the labyrinth didn’t need maps. It needed whispers”) avoids moralizing by grounding insight in prior particulars: the coin’s warmth, the key’s activation, the opened door. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld (Elias doesn’t answer the hauler) and in charged objects (maps glow but are superseded). Ambiguity lingers: is the labyrinth sentient or reflective? The story resists resolving this, deepening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges entirely through image and action: silent empathy as a language of light refraction. The dental mirror’s promise—“see what’s hidden in the dark”—is fulfilled not by revelation but by beautification of shadow. Final lines reject verbal explanation (“Some truths were too deep for words”) while affirming felt resonance, avoiding moralizing. Recurring motifs (stars, spirals, silence) accrue meaning without redundancy, offering a non-literal answer: darkness isn’t banished but dignified.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: chess as metaphor for choice, second thoughts as forests, rebellion as planting. No moralizing—insights arise from action (Lila sliding her pawn, Clara brushing her shoulder). The final line—“unspoken words… shimmered, waiting to be heard”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: connection persists beyond loss. Ambiguity lingers (Will Lila return? Will the town revive?), but resonance is earned through accumulated silence and magnetic hum.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from object and action: grief cannot be preserved but can be “remade.” The spoon—hollow yet functional—becomes a non-literal answer to the central question of how to carry loss under oppression. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from wood grain, brittle petals, and oil-polished curves. Final line (“cultivate lightness, one whittle at a time”) earns its wisdom through concrete struggle, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically through recurring images—the shattered glass bird, rose thorns, fractal cracks—never stated outright. The final line (“I’ve just started to see”) reweights the entire premise: sight isn’t chromatic but relational, born of brokenness.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: meteorite rings, twilight thread, Sahara coordinates—not abstract moralizing. The ending reweights grief as refractable light, answering the central question (“Can broken things be remade?”) through the crane in Japan, not thesis statements.

Final image—“scars could be maps”—offers non-literal answer to “How rebuild after collapse?” without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (loft “listens”), gesture (Mara’s jaw clench), and object use (tape measuring grief-greed angles). Avoids false equivalence: crashes “exposed culture’s skeleton,” implying necessary destruction, not balanced tragedy.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Lirael’s struggle: truth resists taming, and innocence is complicity. The serpent ouroboros and “atoms of nostalgia” accrue meaning without allegory. Final image—walking into the unknown—offers non-literal answer: knowledge demands surrender to unpredictability. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Is the pagoda benevolent? Will chaos consume her?), yet stance is clear: messy truth > curated safety.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: hope requires form to endure, and sharing dreams without structure diffuses meaning. The spiral symbol and twin stones reweight prior material—the 1987 footage isn’t nostalgia but a tactical blueprint.

The recurring stardust motif shifts from nostalgic fragment to active catalyst, culminating in the jar labeled “The Dreamer’s Unspoken Truth”—a resonant, non-literal answer to Kael’s quest. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from concrete interaction (spilling dust → symphony/painting flood).

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through action: silence as contract, safety as garden. The bolt, staircase, and music weave subtext without moralizing—until Elric’s line “Safety is not the absence of sound…” which edges close to prompt-like articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically from Lirael’s dilemma: knowledge without access is complicity. The final image—handing the letter to Kael in the thawing library—offers a non-literal answer: truth requires embodiment, not just preservation. However, phrases like “contraband truths” and “unspoken conversation” flirt with abstraction, and the moral (“truth matters”) edges toward declaration. Subtext is present but slightly over-explained.

The final image—empty crib, softened cries, faded amber—offers a non-literal answer: unspoken goodbyes can be healed through voiced truth.

The amber’s shift from fossil to key reweights earlier particulars, avoiding tidy binaries (guilt isn’t erased—it’s transformed).

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—meaning emerges through collaborative pattern-making, not isolated observation—arises organically from Mara’s chalk work, the tile, and the grotto’s acoustics.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the tarot coin’s transformation—from etched Fool’s journey to blank slate—offering a non-literal answer: collective memory, not individual glory, sustains possibility. Subtext thrives in gestures (the flapper’s outstretched hand) and sensory bleed (memories nourishing soil). Avoids moralizing; the blank coin implies wisdom earned through action, not assertion. Final applause “beyond time” reweights the premise: encore isn’t performance but shared resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: true connection requires internal attunement, not external shortcuts.

No sermonizing; resonance builds through the studio’s evolving maps and the geode’s quiet radiance.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: silence contains stories, and mapping must evolve beyond the physical. The elm leaf’s journey mirrors Lira’s, but the resonance arises from particulars—the crimson fear, azure wonder—not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)

However, the epiphany (“river held clarity”) leans slightly abstract; a more embodied insight would push this into 9.5+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through phototropism as metaphor for moral orientation: light-seeking becomes kindness-seeking. The final image—lantern glowing beside spinning clay—offers a non-literal answer: shaping time requires tending inner light. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (sunflowers, glass, hives). Ambiguity lingers (can one truly choose timelines?), but the resonance feels earned through sensory accumulation rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through particulars: petals, gauge teeth, moonlight on water—not stated but lived. The central question (“Can beauty survive abandonment?”) is answered non-literally when Mara lets light in, reweighting Elias’s earlier belief into shared possibility. Subtext thrives in silence—the quivering hush, the cat’s pause, the unsmiled-at geranium—and avoids moralizing. Final image (rosebush waiting) offers conceptual repricing: hope isn’t guaranteed, but tending continues, with cost implied in the widow’s tired eyes and shuttered shop.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of extinction, memory, and self-authorship, never stated outright. The spiral symbol and title *Brittle Awakenings* reweight “brittleness” from flaw to strength without moralizing. Final image—Lirael writing again, observing the world “without fear”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: Can one exist meaningfully after collective erasure? Yes, through creation that acknowledges but isn’t bound by the past. Subtext thrives in gesture (fogged breath on brass) and silence (the hum fading).

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the spiral-orb-pond motif: connection requires shared vulnerability, not crafted concealment. The final image—thrush song as “prismatic quiet”—reweights earlier silence into resonance without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (folding paper, orb glow) and avoids therapy-speak. However, Elara’s line “Secrets aren’t meant to be locked away” flirts with thematic echo, slightly undercutting the otherwise earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: power as mutable current, knowledge as fragile signal, resistance as harmonic counterpoint. The starlight wind chime and shifting constellations offer non-literal answers to control vs. chaos. Ambiguity lingers—the tricksters may return—but stance is clear: readiness over fear. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from Lila’s actions, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of rebellion and constraint: the “wistful rebellion” isn’t stated but embodied in Elias’s refusal to yield to fear or architecture. The key’s constellation teeth and dissolving walls reprice exploration as transcendence, not possession. Final image offers non-literal answer: the true key was willingness to walk through fear. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from concrete particulars like warm-pulsing metal and groaning pipes.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through oppositions—hard/soft, seen/unseen—that culminate in Clara’s realization that connection transcends facial recognition. Subtext thrives in gesture: the shared drawing, the pocketed ribbon. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing: truth persists not in files but in artifacts that demand emotional engagement. Ambiguity lingers (Was Lila pushed or did she jump?), resisting tidy closure while affirming empathy as forensic tool.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: exile as institutional silencing versus truth preserved in margins. The copper nail and coded stanzas embody subtext—history hidden but recoverable. Final image reweights prior material: the ancestor wasn’t fleeing shame but engineering return. Avoids moralizing; resonance comes through Clara’s breath catching at the journal’s revelation. However, the “question the storm” stanza borders on thematic echo without full integration into lived action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: music and memory as tools to reclaim unrealized lives. The flake’s shift from jagged artifact to smooth clarity mirrors the transition from fragmentation to agency. Subtext thrives in image—the rusted-hinge voice becoming polished stone—and avoids moralizing. However, “pixelated amnesty” borders on pseudo-profundity; its mechanics remain mystical rather than grounded, slightly diluting thematic resonance despite strong emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (foreign bills), setting (decaying train), and action (symbolic dissuasion), avoiding moralizing. The central question—why paths circle back—is answered non-literally: cycles stem from greed, not destiny, and can be broken through wisdom. Final image reweights the bills from “ill-gotten hoard” to “talisman,” offering resonant closure. Yet the insight borders on aphoristic (“greed always leads to the same end”), slightly undercutting ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: truth requires shared vulnerability, not detached analysis. The “map of empathy” reweights the premise—temple inscriptions aren’t codes but mirrors of collective grief. Final image (brother’s lullaby on her skin) offers non-literal resolution: understanding dawns not through intellect but through surrendered listening. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Will she find him? Can she bear this weight?), yet the conceptual cost—permanent loss of detachment—is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: truth resides beneath surfaces, and self-knowledge requires confronting buried violence. The recurring seed and vortex accrue meaning without forced symbolism—the seed seeks truth, not food, and its silver spores cleanse perception. The ending offers a non-literal answer: mirrors show surfaces; lakes hold frozen confessions. No moralizing; resonance stems from Mira’s quiet act of pocketing the spent seed—some lost things are worth keeping—reweighting the premise without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: true connection between worlds requires embracing pain, not just mapping it. This is crystallized non-literally in the closing image—two moons, glowing scars, internal covenant—reweighting every prior symbol without moralizing. The golden-eyed figure isn’t a deus ex machina but a manifestation of Lirael’s own potential, making the insight earned. Avoids binaries by showing fear as both obstacle and mirror, and the cost (loss of old self) lingers without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the burned Fool card, the stitched skeleton, the black fruit—all accrue meaning without moralizing. The final vision reweights Lirael’s recklessness not as failure but as “fiercely gentle force,” offering a non-literal answer to the central question (Can brokenness be remade into strength?). Subtext lives in gesture—the keeper’s shard-teeth smile, Lirael’s steady legs post-transformation—and avoids binary resolutions. No overt allegory; ambiguity lingers in whether the orchard heals or consumes.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the cloth’s journey: forgotten artistry holds value beyond market appraisal. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—purpose lies in resurrecting stories, not pricing objects—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gestures (Lenny tucking the cloth away) and contrasts (dynamite blasts vs. crowd roars). Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in concrete action (the phone call). The phoenix logo’s reappraisal reweights all prior failure as meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: transition as reassembly, not destruction, reframed through botanical and magnetic metaphors. The final image—the sapling swaying in a scentless breeze—offers a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting all prior glyphs as living narrative. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete action (seed → tendril → bloom). Ambiguity lingers (What lies beyond?), but the cost—abandoning cold equations for story—is conceptually undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through action: identity isn’t fixed but forged in contradiction. The final image—a fish taking flight—answers the central question non-literally, reweighting “routine” as sacred when infused with wonder. No moralizing; insight arises from the creel’s hum, the feather in brass, the child’s starfish dissolving. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the librarian’s quiet reciprocity: “Thank you.”

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from object (pearl), action (placing it in spiral), and setting (caves as tomb-to-cathedral). Subtext lives in silence—the unspoken confessions, the hum beneath rocks—and avoids moralizing. The ending reweights “doomsday preparedness” from survivalist isolation to communal hope, answering the central question (Can abandoned hopes be reclaimed?) through image, not assertion. No tidy binaries; regret and connection coexist.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: rivers as vessels of memory and movement replace abstract guilt. The final chalk word “Begin” offers non-literal resolution—forgiveness as ongoing current, not destination—reweighting all prior graffiti without moralizing. Subtext thrives in stick-figure hearts and clogged drains; wisdom is collective, not authorial. Ambiguity lingers (will she forgive herself?), but the emotional aftereffect—raw solace—is concrete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: truth resides not in spoken language but in the liminal spaces between seconds, thoughts, and breaths. The unspoken words appear only when held to light and read through stillness—a quiet rebuke to forced articulation. Subtext thrives in the watch’s reversal and the cipher’s loop, suggesting wisdom requires surrender to nonlinearity. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from concrete images, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from object and action: perforated destiny interrogates whether meaning requires grandeur or can reside in quiet renunciation. The final image—violin to stardust, child’s laugh echoing—offers a non-literal answer: some dreams must fracture to seed possibility elsewhere. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers without confusion, anchored in Lira’s specific, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty as resistance to oblivion, crafted through labor, not fate. The final line—“stillness was never truly still… waiting for the next artist”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (painting protection symbols, humming a lullaby) and recurring images (aurora, emerald, pool) that accrue weight. No platitudes; wisdom arises from concrete ritual and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the scallop shell’s worn edges, the hairpin’s unblemished return, the act of climbing. The ending offers a non-literal answer—contentment as ongoing practice—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the held breath before Elara’s smile) and gesture (pressing the hairpin into Lirael’s palm). The cycle of rebirth reframes loss as potential, but avoids false equivalence; Elara’s error carries consequence, yet repair is possible.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through objects and action: doubt as filter, not enemy, is shown via cloak weight and chime removal, not stated until Elias’s line—which avoids moralizing by being earned through prior sensory work. The final image (mirror filled with ghost-laughter, walking into wind-chimes) reweights the premise non-literally: truth is chordal, not singular. Ambiguity lingers (Is the ghost real? Does clarity last?), but resonance is undeniable. No false equivalence; Mira’s guilt is validated, not excused.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the stone-ripple motif: knowledge as something woven, not delivered. The final line reweights the entire premise—not disappearing but becoming—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in Elara’s silence and Lira’s trembling realization, avoiding diagnostic labels. The ambiguity lingers (“what could be”) while remaining coherent within the story’s metaphysical rules.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the paradox of motionless navigation, resolved not through moralizing but through Kael’s embodied realization that alignment replaces control. The recurring figure-eight reweights prior obsession with stasis into acceptance of cyclical renewal. Subtext thrives in silence—the ancestors’ voices echo but don’t instruct—and the final image (walking while trusting the pulse) offers non-literal resolution. Avoids platitudes by grounding wisdom in specific sensory experience (arrowhead’s hum, bird wings).

    Theme emerges organically from Kael’s actions: the rejection of automated creativity in favor of intimate, imperfect beauty. The final image—roses replacing impossible flora—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in the keystone’s transformation and the spire’s “brilliant dimness,” avoiding abstraction. However, the phrase “sacred in the simple” borders on prompt-like articulation, slightly undercutting subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: grief as a language of light and sound, not silence. The core concept (“luminous vows”) integrates through action—Elias witnesses sound become color—rather than exposition. Final image offers non-literal answer: love persists as perceptible resonance. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Is the library real? Does Lila wait?), yet emotional truth feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning arises not from decoding entropy but from resonant attention. The coins, static, and spiral reframe “purpose” as harmonic participation, not destination. Final image offers non-literal answer—the wavelength as symphony—repricing the prophecy without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (What is rebirth? Who harmonizes?), but resonance is earned through concrete particulars: tower as receiver, moon as transmitter, the levitating coins.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: sacrifice isn’t just loss but giving form to the formless. The final image—Elias walking into night with the weighted page—offers a non-literal answer to Lira’s question (“What’s on the other side?”): not void, but named fear.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: brittle devotion isn’t stated but shown in Elias’s refusal to abandon the bell despite failure history. The final line—“a fragile, flawed, earnestly naive kind of faith”—resists moralizing, offering instead a resonant reconfiguration: faith as ongoing labor, not perfection. Subtext thrives in silence (Marla’s softened expression) and image (drip as heartbeat). Ambiguity lingers—the rift may reopen—but the cost of hope feels earned, not sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as active, shared labor, not passive hoarding. The sapphire liqueur shifts from relic to symbol of poisoned idealism, then to catalyst for renewal. Final image—photographs lighting the path—offers non-literal answer: stories outlive stone.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of parental legacies and the starlings’ dance, never moralized. The final formula—blending calculus and verse—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: synthesis requires collision, not compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: identity isn’t fixed but chosen through confrontation with one’s fears. The brain’s redefinition—from “duplicate” to “choice”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to ego death. Subtext thrives in action (Kael’s calm slicing pretense) rather than dialogue. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the “uncertain” stabilized sky, honoring complexity without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—innovation requires yielding to mystery—emerges through the seed’s transformation, not exposition. The spiral motif reweights from cryptic mark to engraved key, reframing “escape” as symbiotic growth.

Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the blooming corpse flower’s unseen stench.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: tending the unspoken as an act of love against silence. The leaf blower symphony reframes grief as generative labor. Final image—tears amid purring machine and shimmering voices—offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality through concrete struggle. Slight deduction: “unspoken” concept borders on abstract label without deeper interrogation of its limits.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from Mara’s arc: uncertainty as home, not threat. Final image reweights all prior material—the mist, the blurred edges, the stolen key—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (waiting), gesture (tossing pendant), and charged objects (lantern revealing hidden paths).

    Theme emerges through particulars: transience vs. completion, guardianship without ownership. The hourglass shifts from vessel of lost time to loom weaving timelines—resonant, not stated. Final constellation offers non-literal answer: some journeys end so others may begin. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers (merging erases boundaries but grants peace). Subtext thrives in whispers, static, and dissolving wood.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Clara’s weaving: rational enchantment as synthesis, not compromise. The final image—thread glowing in pocket as guide—answers the central question non-literally: truth lies in process, not product. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (“unsettling, yes. But calm, too”). However, the phrase “rational enchantment” appears as label twice, slightly undercutting subtext—though the lattice’s transformation earns the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the chain’s rough edges versus starlight’s fluid geometry reframes “grounding” as dynamic adaptation. No moralizing—the final image (students floating in dark, aligning metal with constellations) offers non-literal answer: belonging requires embracing instability.

The final realization—that cables “etch the unremembered into the ocean’s skin”—reweights prior imagery without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (clutching the codex) and silence (no dialogue). Ambiguity lingers: she finds a signal, not her brother, honoring complexity over sentimentality. The gold’s dimming signifies fulfilled purpose, not triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)

Subtext thrives in silence (Elias’s non-answer to OBS-7) and charged objects. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the digital ghost isn’t erased but embraced as guide, reweighting the premise that bureaucratic death can be transcended through lived contradiction. No moralizing; resonance lives in “ink and porcelain” intertwined.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)

The diamond’s song lingers not as recovered speech but as internal resonance, reframing extinction as continuity. No moralizing; the final line offers a non-literal answer to the central question (Can lost tongues be reclaimed?) by shifting from recovery to embodiment. Ambiguity remains—was the song real or imagined?—but the emotional aftereffect is concrete.

    Theme emerges through the arrowhead’s evolution—from anchor to key—and the garden’s refusal to “forgive” shame. The final spiral symbol reweights “harmony untamed” not as escape but as active, costly participation.

No moralizing; insight arises through Lira’s realization that “breaking free wasn’t about destruction… but letting go.” The final image—orchard answering her lullaby—offers non-literal resolution that reweights every prior detail (metal peaches, humming grass). Ambiguity lingers (what replaces the statues?), but resonance is earned through concrete particulars, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the bottle as vessel for collective grief, the arcade as liminal space between nations and eras. Subtext thrives in silence—soldiers’ lowered guns speak louder than treaties. Final image offers non-literal answer: healing lives in small rebellions that “link absences.” Avoids moralizing; complexity endures (border remains), yet resonance lingers via humming machines and dawn’s “promise.”

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: longing isn’t a thing to capture but a force to embrace. This reframing arises from concrete particulars—light photography, palette mechanics, archipelago whispers—not moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: secrets as both prison and potential, silence as costly. The locket’s dissolution reframes the hair from relic to revelation, arguing that truth heals even when it destabilizes. No moralizing—the insight arises from Elias’s sensory experience (whispers settling into his mind).

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as both shield and prison. The tapestry needle and net aren’t symbols but tools that enact the central question—when does protecting someone become harming them? Final image offers non-literal answer: listening replaces mending, implying engagement over repair. No moralizing; resonance arises from the key’s paradox (“door never locked”) and the hum replacing hush—complexity preserved without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: goggles revealing ice-veins, encrypted diary, cracked lenses catching light—all reweight “joy beneath anguish” without moralizing.

No pseudo-profundity; wisdom arises from concrete choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through action: mapping as communion with hidden truths, not conquest. The hopscotch board—a child’s game—becomes a cosmic key, reframing discovery as humility before mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: repair as harmony amid chaos, time as malleable memory. The final ticking clock offers a non-literal answer—time isn’t fixed but can be realigned through patience and legacy—without moralizing. Recurring images (gears, mirrors, light) accrue meaning: the mismatched-coat reflection becomes a vessel for self-acceptance. Avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in brass cogs and frost, not abstraction. The “rhythm of repair” reframes brokenness as potential, not failure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (watering bell), method (chalked messages), and core concept (nebula as promise). The final image—bell chiming in the nebula—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: trust and collective care sustain hope. Subtext operates through gesture (settlers bringing banners, ropes, devices) and implication (Elara’s silence as faith in others). The story avoids moralizing; instead, “hope was not a solitary pursuit” arises from concrete actions, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: flaws as conduits for grace, endings as lullabies. The puppet’s crack (“let the light in”) evolves from aphorism to enacted truth when golden light leaks from its fractures during the song. No moralizing—the final image of clocks softening into sighs reweights the entire premise without stating it. Ambiguity lingers (is this apocalypse or transcendence?), but the emotional aftereffect—peace across disparate lives—is concrete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the tension between imposed order (blueprint) and organic decay (warping walls, weeping trees). The “graceless beauty” of snapped branches and tilted stones suggests redemption through imperfect care, not control. Final image—nut cracked but intact, paths resetting—offers non-literal answer: survival lies in cyclical, flawed stewardship. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether the curse is just or merely inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: polymers, river confluences, and musical dissonance all refract the core question—can separation nourish connection? The ending offers a non-literal answer via the released chrysalis vanishing downstream, reweighting prior images without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries; grief remains “loosened,” not cured. However, the phrase “symphony wasn’t perfect, but it was alive” edges toward thematic assertion, slightly marring subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: stories begin not in grand voids but in fragile, specific residues. The final image—the dissolving note leaving golden dust—offers a non-literal answer to Elara’s quest without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, objects, and implication (“glimmering parole” as potential, not product). Avoids binaries; embraces ambiguity (the man’s story remains unwritten, yet its possibility validates her work).

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of taste, memory, and labor: healing isn’t deletion but transformation, like cooking. The final broth—bitterness softened by “ghost of forgiveness”—offers a non-literal answer to whether remorse can be tempered. No moralizing; resonance arises from onions mellowed by laughter-memory and salt-stiff aprons. The concept of emotionally contagious regret reframes collective trauma as something that can be diluted through shared bearing, not locked away.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: bridges form not from wood but from shared language and listening. The final image—a mosaic of tongues inviting collective stewardship of stories—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (child’s drawing, blacksmith’s offer) and object (weight’s arc as reconciliation). Avoids abstraction by rooting “silos” in the literal grain elevator and clock tower, making the metaphor tactile rather than rhetorical.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: abandoned dreams as recoverable through technological empathy, not excavation. The mosaic mirror reweights the premise—fractures as pathways, not flaws—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in the woman’s whispered memory and Kael’s trembling hands. However, the final line (“rewiring reality itself”) veers toward pseudo-profundity, slightly undercutting the earned resonance of the charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: vigilance resides not in grand archives but in marginalia and thresholds. The serpent-key-lock motif evolves from doodle to physical key, reweighting “forgotten combinations” from abstraction to responsibility. No moralizing—the insight arises through Lira’s tactile engagement with the manuscript and grotto. The final line (“The world was full of doors, and Lira now held the key”) offers resonant, non-literal closure without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: music as empathy made tangible, silence as not absence but potential. The final image—travelers feeling a hum “no ear could hear but every heart could feel”—offers a non-literal answer to Elara’s quest without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: cosmic balance isn’t grand design but quiet correlation of silence and stone. The queen’s diagonal path—“even in brokenness, there’s direction”—answers the central question without moralizing. Final image (sapling with mirror-leaves) reweights the premise: the covenant lives in reflection, not decree. Subtext thrives in gesture (thumb tracing dent) and silence (the nexus’s hum), avoiding allegory or prompt-like thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the diary’s entries and Lirael’s method: empathy requires attuning to others’ frequencies. Avoids moralizing; the grandmother’s line (“silence is... everything unsaid”) reframes prior action without stating a thesis. Final realization (“path to empathy... willingness to tune”) risks slight abstraction but is anchored by concrete image (carrying diary to window). Ambiguity lingers—can silence truly be bridged?—but thematic complexity isn’t fully tested against counterforces.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Lira’s struggle: wisdom as patient attunement, not forceful intervention. The corpse flower—traditionally a symbol of decay—becomes a beacon of harmony, reweighting its cultural meaning. Final image avoids moralizing; instead, “chaos and serenity are kin” arises from observed transformation, not assertion. Doodles and scent motifs accumulate subtext without over-explanation, though “undercurrent of wisdom” occasionally verges on label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object, setting, and action: resilience as adaptive memory, not engineered control. The final image—Lira flying home as fruit rains onto strengthened vines—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: ecosystems endure not by resisting chaos but by echoing and storing it. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (the fused pedestal, golden leaves). The “symphony” metaphor in the last line resonates because it’s grounded in prior sensory work (humming propellers, thrumming air, whirling silence), avoiding abstraction. Ambiguity lingers—what happens if humans return?—but the thematic stance is clear and unforced.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of human systems and unintended consequences: architecture + weather + error = emergent hunger. Subtext thrives in silence, vibration, and wind that “responds” to movement—never stated outright. The ending offers a non-literal answer: foresight isn’t enough when environments evolve beyond models. No moralizing; resonance stems from the patch’s warmth against cold revelation and the final line’s chilling implication that the machine now watches back.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: awe as necessity, not luxury, refracted through synesthesia and artistry. Subtext thrives in gesture—Lira’s threadbare gloves, Veyra’s dropped chisel—and the final line (“oscillating between repose and revelation”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether wonder can thaw cold hearts. Avoids moralizing; instead, truth is shown as color made manifest. No false equivalence—skepticism yields to earned revelation without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the flute’s shift from mirror to door, driftwood runes evolving from direction to surrender. Subtext lives in silence, ash-moths, and snapped reeds—not moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer: insight comes not from replaying failure but releasing it. Resists tidy binaries; failure isn’t erased but metabolized, with lingering ambiguity about what “unmaking” truly costs.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of intellect and feeling, crystallized in the final realization: “emotions weren’t variables; they were wildfires.” The halo fragment reweights from tool to mirror, transforming the central metaphor without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars: relics as seeds, encounters as soil. No moralizing—insight arises when Kail touches the rune-etched bark, realizing Veyra’s absence was cultivation. The sapling’s growth reweights “germinate the past” from nonsense to lived truth. Ambiguity lingers (Who is the woman? What grows next?), but the cost—Kail’s lost innocence—is undeniable in his lighter, steadier grip on the pendant.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—projection vs. absorption, the danger of seeking validation—emerges through concrete particulars: the prism as distorting lens, frost as ephemeral archive, quartz as mirror. The ending offers a non-literal answer: truth isn’t extracted but reflected, and peace comes from relinquishing proof. No moralizing; resonance arises from Mara’s silent departure and the arbor’s enduring secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—sacrifice as connective thread across silence—emerges organically from cloth, beads, and loom. The ending offers a non-literal answer: sound returns not through presence but through absence, via woven silence. Subtext operates in image (“cloth draped over branches”) and implication (children’s laughter echoing her name). Avoids moralizing; embraces complexity—Mara’s success requires her erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: resilience arises not from magic but from quiet endurance of unendurable pain. The silk’s transformation—from traded curiosity to vessel of planetary soul—reweights its meaning without moralizing.

The final image—sea glass warm in pocket, singing—reweights the entire premise without moralizing, transforming loss into luminous ache. Subtext thrives in silence (stone stacks replacing words) and avoids binaries; the sea remains indifferent, yet meaning persists. No platitudes; wisdom arises from specific, tactile experience.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: ancient tools vs. algorithmic modernity, stewardship as active choice. The final image—lighthouse standing tall—answers the central question non-literally: small acts matter amid chaos. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (wick, shadows, laughter). Ambiguity lingers (what *is* the oily darkness?), but complexity feels earned, not forced.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through iridescence as metaphor for fragile, refracted truth—not stated but embodied in the wing’s disappearance and Lin’s resolve. The final image reweights everything: stories aren’t possessed but shared in fleeting light. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether this gift is burden or grace. Central question (“why some lives become vessels”) finds non-literal answer in communal resonance, not individual destiny.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: sorrow isn’t erased but transmuted into light through ritual attention. The final image—Elias walking deeper as roots glow—offers a non-literal answer: maintenance *is* meaning. No moralizing; resonance accrues through particulars (sextant gears = dream fragments, bark = etched memory). However, the epiphany (“even in decay, there was beauty”) edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting the otherwise implicit development.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme (“memory as communal fabric”) emerges through particulars: molten-gold plums, fragmented lullaby, soil-streaked hands—not abstraction. Final image reweights premise: “woven dawns” shifts from lost practice to active verb (“knitting the realm together”). Avoids moralizing; resonance in “seed in winter” metaphor. Counter-readings possible: is hope fragile or resilient? But no false equivalence—Lira’s labor affirms memory’s necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: wisdom resides in mistakes, and visibility is a choice, not an obligation. The blank book and mirrors reframe loss not as absence but as potential—subtext carried through image, not exposition. The mother’s letter (“admit you’re lost”) avoids moralizing by being diegetic and specific. Final resonance lies in Eleanor’s quiet endurance, which reweights the entire premise without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.4)

The final insight—that absolution is process, not destination—arises from concrete experience, not assertion, and reweights the premise: decay contains the blueprint for renewal. Subtext thrives in silence (the bread’s disappearance, the woman’s departure) and avoids binaries; the world is neither saved nor lost, but tended. No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the earned resonance of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning is conjured through attentive labor, not inherent permanence. The luminous vows symbolize human promises that sustain culture, and their fragility mirrors memory itself. The ending offers a non-literal answer—reconstruction, not preservation, is the act of devotion—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in action (measuring light) rather than exposition, though the “edge of oblivion” phrasing borders on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: “hush” as currency, the fob’s anchor destroying the recorder, the cracked watch still ticking. The ending reweights silence—not as cowardice but as costly integrity—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld (father’s fate) and embodied (Lira’s shaking hands). Avoids binaries: trust is fragile, silence is gold, but both exact prices. Final image resonates non-literally: time continues, legacy endures, unease comforts.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: the tension between measurable reality and sentient ecology resolves not with moralizing but through the compass’s shift from person to place—a non-literal answer to “why some carry weather.” The final image (lavender and regret) reweights prior material: trees aren’t voting on bloom/wither but on bearing or releasing collective pain. Subtext thrives in silence (Lira’s warning, Kael’s spit) and avoids binaries—skepticism isn’t wrong, just incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: art as excavation, memory as both prison and key. The cobalt streak on canvas, the lock-as-mouth, and the shadow-door coalesce into a non-literal answer—truth isn’t behind a door but in the act of making one visible. No moralizing; the grandmother’s whisper resonates without explanation. The final image—Elias sketching, finally seen—reweights all prior silence as necessary compression before release, embracing ambiguity (Is the door real? Does it matter?) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: candor and meaning persist not in perfect records but in fragile, human acts of preservation. The orb’s “formless” mist yielding a laugh—not words—subverts archival longing with emotional truth. Final line (“Truth, even when bitter, was nourishment”) avoids moralizing by grounding insight in Elara’s embodied ascent and the quill’s glow, offering resonant, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire quest.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: truth as audible wonder, accessible only through disciplined silence. The iceberg’s transformation into music offers a non-literal answer to the central question—how to combat hollow noise—without moralizing. Final lines (“like the ringing of a bell… like the whisper of the clouds”) reprice the premise: wonder must be released, not hoarded. Subtext thrives in absence—words are unnecessary because the bells articulate what language cannot. No thematic echo or pseudo-profundity mars the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through action: containment vs. integration, order vs. organic mess. The desert rose—a hybrid of natural beauty and engineered survival—mirrors Clara-7’s arc. Final lines reprice “static” from flaw to song, offering a non-literal answer: wholeness includes fracture. No moralizing; resonance arises from the orb’s dissolution into her palm and the farm’s rebirth, avoiding binary resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—listening as an act of recovery and witness—emerges organically from Clara’s method and the mailbox’s function. Subtext lives in silence (locked letters, blurred photo) and communal memory. The ending reweights the premise: history isn’t just preserved but activated through attention. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from the locket’s inscription fulfilled not by force but by care. Slight deduction for near-tidy resolution—everyone agrees on the story without dissent.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.0)

No moralizing—resonance lives in image (“origami wing crumbling to dust”) and action. Subtext thrives in gaps: between breaths, heartbeats, reflections. Final line (“the world remained quiet”) offers non-literal answer to the central question: can stillness alter fate? Yes—but only through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—truth vs. protective fiction—emerges through concrete particulars: adjusted dates, borrowed sugar, undeciphered symbols.

Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether independence equals connection or solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges from particulars: the treaty as prayer, treason as calibrated grace, the thorn as penance. The ending offers a non-literal answer—peace isn’t signed but offered, like a key with no apparent lock—and reweights all prior images: the aurora’s approval means nothing; only the act matters. Resists moralizing; complexity abides in the queen’s unreconciled death and heirs’ unresolved choice. Final resonance arises from concrete ritual (hair-thread binding, blood seal), not abstraction—making forgiveness tactile, not theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: echoes as vessels for unresolved human pain, truth revealed through patient listening.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through action: truth isn’t abstract but a dangerous excavation with tangible cost. The orchard’s paradox—life in sterility—mirrors Mara’s arc: debunker forced to accept an invisible reality. Final image (“shredded letters in her bag”) reframes truth as burden, not trophy, rejecting “comfortable lies” without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (trees “grasping,” diamond “biting through her coat”), though the “curse as consequence” idea edges close to on-the-nose in Crane’s letters.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Kael’s actions: humanity’s salvation lies in embracing fragility, not mastering chaos. The final image—portico glowing as storm ebbs—offers a non-literal answer: thresholds require both destruction and receptivity.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through object-as-metaphor: the music box literalizes how art preserves ephemera. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid—the old woman’s crumpled face speaks louder than dialogue. Final stanza (“to prove the dead aren’t truly gone”) risks moralizing but is undercut by its own self-editing, showing theme as struggle, not decree.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from action: patience isn’t preached but sculpted through filings, moonlight, and failed haste. The final line (“horizon was wider”) offers a non-literal answer—patience expands possibility—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (elders’ snow-dusted robes, acolyte’s puzzled frown). Avoids binaries: impatience isn’t evil, just unproductive. Minor deduction: “sculpted patience from impatience” borders on thematic echo, though it’s character-voiced, not authorial.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as both weapon and chain, interrogating how institutions bury truth. The lantern’s dual role—as abolitionist beacon and manipulative tool—resists tidy morals, embracing ambiguity (Eliza’s courage vs. Cole’s corruption). Final image reweights prior material: Mara’s “fierce, unyielding” smile repurposes the lantern’s light for justice, not entanglement, offering a non-literal answer about agency. No moralizing; resonance stems from concrete particulars (corroded hinges, red-ink scrawls).

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of brokenness and precision—redemption isn’t declared but demonstrated through craft. The clockwork heart reweights the premise: regret can be forged into something functional, even beautiful.

Avoids moralizing; the ending offers a resonant image, not a lesson, inviting reflection without prescribing answers.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: desire as algorithmic force that bends reality when seen, not solved. The bell’s hum—a vibration, not a ring—offers non-literal closure, reweighting yearning from private obsession to world-altering resonance. No moralizing; awe blooms irreverently in Lira’s grin. Recurring objects (arrow tip, kaleidoscope) accrue meaning through use, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—truth versus institutional erasure—emerges through action: deleted files, encrypted logs, the patch as relic. The recurring numbers shift from pattern to key, reweighting meaning at closure. Subtext thrives in silence (Hale’s darting eyes, erased questions) and implication (“They’re using it to delete people”). Avoids moralizing; the final image—Lira racing toward the edge—resonates without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: empathy as active courage, not passive feeling. The final line—“courage wasn’t in the absence of fear, but in the choice to act anyway”—is earned through concrete particulars (sailor’s terror, mother’s clutch), not moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the parasol’s fragility against ice, trawling as metaphor for sifting grief, the “fold” reconceived as readiness rather than waiting. The ending offers a non-literal answer—peace arrives not through escape but through responsive action—without moralizing.

Avoids moralizing while embracing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: wisdom requires honest witnessing, not just preservation. The “strangely honest” line walker embodies this—truth as both burden and method.

The ending offers no moral but a resonant image: balance restored through mutual vulnerability, with the echo safe “for now”—a non-literal answer to how fragile knowledge endures.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through arcs—vines, pipes, wings—as metaphors for resilience and reconfiguration. The central question (“Can pain become beauty?”) is answered non-literally in the final image: a dove in flight against vines, labeled only with “enough.” No moralizing; subtext lives in gesture (keeping the feather) and repetition (arcs across photos, sketches, nature). Ambiguity lingers without confusion—collective healing is shown, not preached.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars—the crystal’s refractions, ivy’s climb, dust arrangements—avoiding abstraction.

However, the phrase “tidal longing” edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting the otherwise concrete resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of preservation and release: the sage who mends lenses must finally let go. The falling leaf—a motif of transience—reappears as method and metaphor, culminating in Elias’s leap as an embrace of impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: shadows retreating at noon isn’t metaphor but literal behavior tied to celestial mechanics. The ending reweights the premise—not disappearance but condensation into a backward-time gateway—offering a non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through the tooth/fountain ritual: forgiveness as reconfiguration of brokenness, not erasure. The final line—“the garden itself had decided to forgive them”—resonates non-literally, reweighting the maze from antagonist to witness. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from concrete action (setting teeth) rather than epiphany. Ambiguity lingers (What of the changeling? The drowned man?), but the core question—can fractured truths be mended?—is answered through image, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: grafting orchids, arranging stones, embedding moss in amber. No moralizing—insight arises through action (“healing isn’t about erasing the past but letting it breathe”).

Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the “honeyed hush” that frames vulnerability as strength.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)

The seashell’s spiral reweights earlier imagery from relic to key, embodying the idea that hope is process, not artifact. No platitudes; ambiguity lingers (will she succeed?), yet the emotional aftereffect is earned through specific action.

    Theme—magic as communal memory, not solitary art—emerges through golden threads weaving ancestral dances and honeyed offerings, culminating in creatures relearning steps.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: broken systems can yield beauty through redirected flows, not nostalgia. The final equation—“written in light”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.

    Theme emerges organically from object and action: the drilled coin, black sand, and broken wing all become metaphors for scarred resilience. The final insight—“carrying the weight... turning it into something that could grow”—is earned through tactile work, not stated.

The final image—petals clinging “as gentle as a promise”—offers non-literal resolution: healing requires neither rejecting nor replicating the past, but refining it. No moralizing; insight arises from the gear’s flare and the ghost’s warmth. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld: the Enclave’s unspoken trauma haunts every line, yet Lumin’s revelation avoids false equivalence—violence is unequivocally rejected, gentleness affirmed.

    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: gravestones, ribbons, poems, butterflies. The ending offers a non-literal answer—grief as threshold—not moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, scent, and shadow; the greenhouse becomes a metaphor only through lived experience. Avoids sentimentality by grounding transcendence in craft (carving, weaving).

    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (pendulum), setting (ridge), and action (whispering the inscription). The final image—sealed cracks, steady swing—offers a non-literal answer: balance is maintained not by control but by participation in cycles of small corrections.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: possibility thrives within constraint, not despite it. This is embodied in Lira’s method (“data without imagination is a corpse”) and proven when the thaw validates grounded imagination. The final image—burning journals while shadows dance like the written future—offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Subtext lives in the kingfisher’s dive (“to dive is to know”) and the spire as clock, avoiding overt allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from pruning as an act of memory curation, not stated moralizing. The final bud’s future-memories offer a non-literal answer: beauty requires active rejection of inherited pain.

    Theme emerges through particulars: the lacquer box’s riddle (“the answer is you”) reframes wonder as participatory, not passive. Subtext operates in Clara’s coffee quip and the drones’ “pollinating doubt”—curiosity as essential infrastructure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through action: obstacles become instruments via relentless dubbing. No moralizing—the insight lives in “mosaic of planks, kelp, and fruit.” Central question (“Can chaos be harmonized?”) is answered non-literally by the orchard’s stillness humming with ghost notes.

It’s a seed.” Subtext thrives in what’s withheld—the negotiators’ identities, the delayed war—avoiding moralizing.

Final image (“some darknesses, once faced, become light”) offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. Motifs (owl stamp, spiral, moonlight) accrue meaning through use, not declaration.

Final line (“backlash of regrets… reminding her she was alive”) risks abstraction but earns it through accumulated sensory weight.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: empathy as bearing others’ pain because you’ve known your own. The baseball and lake avoid overt symbolism by functioning causally—J.T. leaves it to provoke reckoning, the lake forces confrontation.
