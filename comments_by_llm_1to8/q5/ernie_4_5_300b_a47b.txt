== Grader: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically through Elara's shift from "reducing celestial phenomena to numbers" to embracing unpredictability. The butterfly dust as "microcosm of the ecosystem" and the chrysalis spiral pattern offer non-literal answers about survival and adaptation. Final image of collaboration with botanist resonantly reweights the journey without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the pause motif—from survival's aftermath to frost patterns to the smuggler's philosophy to Lirael's final understanding. The ending's "hidden maps" reweights all prior searching without stating a moral, achieving resonance through accumulated imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete work of translating trauma into art—silence as presence rather than absence. The mother's lullaby memory and Elias's plant sketches create resonant particulars. Slight deduction for the explicit thematic statement "silence was not an absence but a presence" in the final paragraph, though it's earned by prior dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lens-as-communication metaphor resonates throughout, with "distress signals" evolving from literal maritime safety to metaphorical belonging. The theme emerges organically through Elias's arc from burial to revival, though Marisol's dialogue occasionally veers toward explicit thematic statement ("To give rest a permanent address, you must first believe it exists"). The final image of two figures in the thriving library offers a non-literal answer to questions of permanence and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the bell's transformation from silent relic to daily celebration, embodying the shift from fear to trust. The final image—"It's not the sound that matters...It's who rings it"—offers resonant answer without stating moral. Subtext operates well through the notes on pillars and intergenerational cooperation, though occasionally edges toward explicit ("Trust will").

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of unused love awaiting activation emerges through the journey and pool discovery, though the final insight "in the spaces between breaths" tends toward abstraction. The piece gestures at complexity but resolves into neat enlightenment without confronting what storing love costs.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of time-as-story emerges organically through the photographs and visions, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final insight. The Clara subplot adds texture, though the ending's shift from "texture" to "story" metaphor could resonate more deeply with prior imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of resilience planted in dry soil emerges through concrete action rather than statement, with the seeds as literal and metaphorical hope. The "chained liberator" paradox works conceptually. However, the ending's instant vine-growth and soil trembling feels too neat, and "resilience had been planted" edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of absence-as-presence emerges organically through Lira's synesthetic gift, the dead orchard, and her forge-work with collected voids. The final image—hearing "the silence between heartbeats, the absence where love should be"—offers a resonant non-literal answer about how betrayal manifests as negative space rather than active presence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of transformation through exchange emerges organically—theft becomes gift, stolen moments become "eternal," and destiny's door becomes "a garden." The photograph's illumination and the wilted lily create a resonant answer about the cost of taking versus giving. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit "fair trade" assessment.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.9)
    The crack-as-map metaphor elegantly reframes imperfection as possibility ("a guide to where the light might enter"), and the theme emerges organically through Kael's glassblowing experience and the bookmark's transformation. However, moments like "Even broken things can catch the light" edge toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure dramatization, particularly in the final paragraph's direct articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically through action and image, from the whispering shell to Lila's phobias becoming tactical advantages. The final café scene offers resonant closure without explicit moralizing, though Lila's articulation "I proved vulnerability is power" edges toward theme-statement territory.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of silence as "both absence and presence," reaching resonant payoff when Mara succeeds "not by capturing light but by summarizing its absence." The map's transformation from physical to temporal guide ("moments: the silence before a decision") offers non-literal answer to navigating endless night.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of consciousness emerging from accumulated experience resonates through the temporal loops and "amalgamate" concept, but relies heavily on abstract philosophical statements. The final exchange with the scientist explicitly states the theme ("In the mundane. In the mysticism of the everyday") rather than letting it emerge from dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the silence-as-language concept, with the lens literally clarifying hidden truths. The ending's doodled invitation resonantly answers the question of honest communication beyond words. "Words, he realized, were overrated" risks explicit thematic statement but earns its place through prior dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of human resilience versus algorithmic precision emerges through the marble metaphor and Elara's methods, with the cracks-as-victories concept providing texture. However, the resolution slides into explicit thematic statement ("gardens know their gardeners") rather than letting the final image carry meaning; the ending paragraph directly explains the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of bending reality/time emerges through the nexus's function and the "subdued awakenings" of flora. The director's "time moves sideways" gains resonance through demonstrated magnetic manipulation. However, the ending smile and reach for the lever don't offer a non-literal answer to the central question—instead suggesting simple continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the "in-between spaces" motif - Clara existing between life/death, silence/sound, past/present. The unfinished symphony as metaphor for incompleteness resonates without stating morals. The final image of the flooded house "waiting to see what she'd create" effectively reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the fault-tolerance/margin-occupying metaphor without explicit moralizing. The bearberry's ability to grow "where the world shows its cracks" resonates perfectly with Lirael's transformation. The final image of feeling "whole" through accepting fragmentation offers a non-literal answer to the story's central question about truth and certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "weight of a swallowed truth" metaphor pays off precisely when Elias discovers the literal burial of workers and profits-driven silence, with the valve wheel growing "heavier" as it accumulates the names of the dead. The theme emerges through concrete discovery rather than statement, though the final reflection edges toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of documenting versus witnessing, with the final image of the keeper walking "unburdened and free" offering a non-literal answer to judgment versus acceptance. The origami swan's abandonment and eventual dissolution resonates as the physical manifestation of letting go, avoiding any moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete action—the curl's glow manifesting through remembered wonder, not mystical intervention. The concept of "ordinary magic" as human capacity for wonder avoids didacticism until the slight stumble into explanation ("That's the magic. It's not in the curl. It's in us.") which borders on thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of listening versus ignoring emerges organically through concrete discoveries rather than stated morals. The displaced axis metaphor works on multiple levels—perception, attention, interpretation—without becoming heavy-handed. The final image of voices rising from walls offers a resonant answer to why dreams ended: not from exhaustion but from indifference.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of "open secrets" and hidden influence elegantly emerges through concrete action - fortunes as keys, the lighthouse as surveillance post, truth "hidden in plain sight." The final image of the dockworker finding his fortune while Elara watches resonantly answers the question of individual agency in larger designs.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of stillness as both cage and canvas, with the final "dynamic equilibrium" offering a non-literal answer to control versus freedom. The recurring indigo paint gains thematic weight as singular focus amid chaos. Strong subtext in the loops themselves as both constraint and liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of temporal dislocation emerges through Lirael's concrete actions—writing fortunes that are "invitations" rather than predictions, using the nautilus shell as a "compass" for memory. The final image of creating "a symphony, unheard but felt" offers a non-literal answer to chronological homesickness. The story resists tidy resolution, embracing the complexity of living between past and present.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges through the gravity-defying metaphor and timeline exploration, avoiding direct moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's unfortunate summary. The "drop and ripple" frame resonates, and the final grounding image reweights prior floating. However, "labyrinth of self" and similar abstractions weaken thematic specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the silence/sound paradox, avoiding explicit moralizing until the penultimate paragraph. The broken needle as "gift" reframes loss as opportunity without stating this directly. The final image of Lila teaching students to "listen with their skin, their bones, their hearts" resonates thematically, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("silence isn't empty. It's a container").

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between "data" and "truth," with the storm recorder becoming a metaphor for bearing witness. The final realization that "the quietest places often held the loudest truths" resonates without moralizing. Minor deduction for slightly pat wisdom about recording storms "not just to predict them, but to bear witness."

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that "grief wasn't something to be feared; it was a testament to love." The perfume-as-memory-vessel concept avoids abstraction through specific sensory details. The ending's shift from cautious avoidance to grateful breathing offers a non-literal answer about embracing rather than fleeing emotional inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the rope metaphor: "Every verse you abandon is a thread left loose." The final image of the spiral with its single unbroken thread offers a non-literal answer about life's pattern without moralizing, elegantly reweighting the earlier "texture of time" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of silence from wall to threshold, avoiding explicit moralizing. The bowl as vessel for "potential" rather than "silence" offers a non-literal answer to loss and renewal. The final image of offerings accumulating while music weaves through them achieves genuine resonance without stating its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through Elias's craft of "half truths" and the specific warning that his elixir "will subsume your sorrow, but it will also subsume a part of your joy." The final image of him returning to work suggests the isolation inherent in mediating others' emotions without full engagement. Subtext operates effectively through Lira's hesitation and Elias's "practiced curve" of a smile, though the piece occasionally edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "cycles of compassion" theme emerges through concrete acts rather than statements, particularly in Clara's shift from "invisible costs" as business metaphor to human recognition. However, the thematic resolution feels unearned - the forged letter undermines authentic compassion with deception, yet the story treats this as unproblematic. The final "to uplift one was to uplift all" veers toward platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.6)
    The kinship theme emerges through concrete images - the obsidian arbor, Veyra's murals of joining hands, the final shared thread. The story resists explicit moralizing. However, the thematic resolution feels neat rather than complex, and Lira's explanation ("The tags aren't just art—they're a test") edges toward thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges beautifully through the concept of "borrowed time" and spaces between breaths without explicit moralizing. The final image of the giant as "weary parent, guarding a city built on borrowed moments" offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question. The pendant's transformation from dismissed relic to time-uncaging tool deepens thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of grief as fractal/mosaic emerges through concrete imagery (chipped glass, cracked stone) rather than statement. The brother's quoted wisdom about emotion as mosaic pays off when Elara realizes "absence nourished growth." Final insight about preservation-as-flow reweights all prior attempts at conjuring without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of visibility/invisibility emerges organically through Mara's transformation from hidden survivor to guardian-messenger. The tape's message reweights her isolation as purposeful rather than mere survival. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit thematic statement "she was no longer invisible" rather than letting the image alone carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete plant behaviors rather than abstraction - the hellebore's "circuitously sincere" transformation teaches without preaching until the final exchanges. The linden leaf serves as a returning image that accumulates meaning. Minor deduction for Eleanor's slightly too-articulate thematic statements to Mara that edge toward author intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the shift from "threshing" (violent extraction) to "growing" (patient cultivation) meaning, with the tidal island serving as bridge "between loss and renewal." The brooch as "convergence" of possibilities avoids heavy-handedness, and the final image of conversation replacing puzzle-solving resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between order and chaos, with the pearl as concrete manifestation. The final image of Elara feeling "the unseen forces now, a steady, unpredictable hum beneath the melody" resonantly answers the central question without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    The trumpet valve as "promise" and "bridge between eras" resonates through concrete discoveries rather than assertion. The theme of fractured histories mended through patience emerges from events, particularly the herald's hidden trumpet symbolizing silenced voices. The ending's "symphony waiting to be played" metaphor feels slightly overwrought but lands the reconciliation theme.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of confronting buried truths emerges through concrete action—following mysterious paths, using the drowned man's tool, accepting the unknown ticket. The fortress-as-moment concept offers resonance beyond plot. However, the woman's dialogue ("To speak the truths you've buried, to face the habits you've clung to") explicitly states the theme, reducing subtextual power. The final image of updated maps with "paths he'd never dared to imagine" provides adequate thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of connection across time and embracing mystery over pure logic emerges organically through concrete action. The ending reweights prior skepticism without stating a moral - Clara's smile and decision to keep the tile close shows transformation through gesture. Aelia's persistence despite ostracization parallels Clara's own isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete choice between eternal safety and mortal risk, with the final image of "a symphony of possibilities" resonating against prior boredom. The mirror showing Kael's alternate fate provides earned wisdom without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "mathematics of equity" concept and fair trade theme emerge through plot events, though the final line's explicit statement ("make sure no one ever has to fake their death again") veers toward moralizing. The ink pot as a tool for understanding others' perspectives offers thematic resonance about empathy in negotiation. Subtext operates better in the father's cryptic teachings than in the somewhat transparent confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of preserving "invented histories" emerges through Althea's actions but remains unexplored in its implications. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing about her role as "guardian of memories" and "weaver of tales" replaces earned resonance with direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The erasure/memory theme emerges organically through collected fragments building toward identity reconstruction. The poison label's inscription "For the rats. Not for the remembering" resonates as both literal object and thematic anchor, and the final determination to "make them remember" offers a non-literal answer to the identity question.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between logic and intuition, with the shell and cello serving as concrete vehicles for this abstract question. The final insight about harmony bridging "life and death, logic and wonder" resonates without moralizing. The "gloomy cheerfulness" concept and the astronomer's belief that stars are "out of tune" create thematic texture through specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    The chaos/order paradox emerges through concrete details rather than assertion, with the stone chip anchoring authenticity against "sterilized charm." The graffiti-as-language conceit deepens from vandalism to encoded resistance. Final image of reorganized alleys "tempered by purpose" resonates without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the grandfather's "Some truths outlast the hands that write them" and Lira's enacted belief that caring matters even without audience. The final image of the archivist's understanding resonantly answers whether human gestures persist, avoiding explicit moralizing while maintaining complexity about technological progress.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "seeing what's broken" theme elegantly emerges through Lira's blindness and unique perception method, avoiding explicit moralizing. The water-as-truth metaphor and "listening as seeing" create layered meaning. The lullaby about stars guiding ships home resonates with the navigation theme without forcing connections.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of hidden truths beneath mapped surfaces emerges through concrete discovery—literal light beneath ice revealing rivers' true origins. "Maps are lies. They erase the truth" resonates as earned wisdom from Clara's physical journey. The phrasebook's evolution from "urgent travel" to "To speak the language of convergence, listen" adds thematic texture, and the final image of Clara drawing on blank pages while "rivers flowed on, their secrets safe" achieves resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the contrast between mechanical "lockstep" and organic "chorus," with revival requiring listening rather than forcing. The tuning fork as compass for finding the town's "forgotten heartbeat" resonates without becoming heavy-handed. The final image of Kael departing into "wild hush" while the town finds its pitch behind him creates meaningful ambiguity about cycles of restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the temple's purpose as memory vault becoming prison, with the final insight that "some things are meant to be unsnarled, not held." The vial transforms from key to release mechanism. The ending reweights "harnessing the ephemeral" to mean letting go rather than capturing, though some abstract phrasing ("lonesome splendor") weakens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the truth/lies dichotomy and the meta-fictional element of story-writing. The lattice transforming from prison bars to pen provides elegant thematic resonance. The ending's embrace of writing over running offers a non-literal answer to the central question. The piece avoids moralizing while exploring inheritance and artistic creation, though some passages veer toward abstraction ("sustained impossibilities").

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of "loving and venomous," showing how debt transcends simple love/hate binaries. The final image of "mournful elation" resonates as freedom that required centuries of suffering. Minor deduction for slight thematic echo in "debt is paid not in blood, but in understanding."

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of weaving fragments into wholeness—"carve a path from ruin to reverence" manifests literally in the sewn threads. The final image of filling tide pools offers resonant answer without moralizing. The "hauntingly optimistic" heart and transformation from monument to promise elevate the thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of diaspora/return, broken traditions, and restoration through patient ritual work. The final image of incomplete-but-sufficient shrine resonates beyond plot. Strong subtext in "It's not finished, but it's enough" captures the complexity of cultural recovery without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of resistance through obsolete media emerges organically from plot events. The chalk codes embody the story's core insight: survival encoded in what endures. The ending reweights the arcade from commerce hub to resistance archive without explicit moralizing. "Futuristic nostalgia wasn't about clinging to the past—it was about reinventing it" borders on thesis statement but earns its placement through prior dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of hidden wisdom emerges organically through the embroidery metaphor and crystallizes in the flame revelation. The story explores truth's non-linear nature through concrete images. However, Zara's explicit statements ("The truth is never a straight line," "hidden in the seams") edge toward thematic announcement rather than pure emergence through action.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "fierce tenderness" and the transformation of regret into forward momentum. The final shift from burden to reminder offers a non-literal answer to handling unspoken words. Strong resonance in "even broken things could hold beauty," though the story edges toward explicit thematic statement in places like "some wounds never fully close—and that was okay."

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the coral/cast mirror—both holding "fragments of loss" yearning for regrowth. The ending offers a non-literal answer through "sharp things can carve new paths" without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in Lira's translations that transform anxiety into hope.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through the extended metaphor of undeveloped film requiring light to reveal what was "waiting in the dark," never stated directly but embodied in action. The fresco fragment's laughter becomes amplified "as if by the fog itself," creating resonant irony. The final image of a child asking "What's next?" and Lira answering "Everything" offers a non-literal answer to the question of how joy persists through decay.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    The nested awakening theme emerges organically through concrete discoveries rather than assertion, with the hobo nickel serving as both literal key and thematic anchor for inheritance and curiosity. Dr. Lysander's "Curiosity begets curiosity. Certainty is a cage" crystallizes without preaching. The final rhythm metaphor reweights the entire exploration as perpetual rather than conclusive.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through pattern and action: covert alphabets, plant-speak, message patterns in garden plots all embody resistance through natural systems. The phrase "After thoughts become taxable" recurs meaningfully, recontextualized from lecture quip to resistance motto to final defiance. The bioluminescent garden as "defiant pulse" offers non-literal answer to surveillance without preaching.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the "blossom armistice" concept—beauty and pain coexisting without surrender. The transformation from shield to bridge, the tree's constellation-script branches, and the final image of song carried by wind all resonate without stating morals. The ending reweights all prior isolation as necessary preparation for this offering.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of the chime—"the crack in the bamboo now a conduit"—offering a non-literal answer about preservation as evolution. The final nameless emotion "half-formed and trembling" resists tidy resolution while charging the central question of what it means to preserve.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the parallel between dead languages and broken relationships - both require patient reconstruction of lost connections. The letter's message "Do not dam it with silence" resonates without heavy-handedness. The final line "a weaver of forgotten words, a restorer of broken trust" lands the thematic synthesis. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit "symphony of truth" articulation that borders on thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of encrypted compassion requiring both precision and emotional chaos to decode. The grandfather's "Measure twice, cut once" resonates through action. However, the final message (*"I trust you to hold them...to mend it"*) veers toward explicit moralizing, and "open-hearted truth" in the penultimate paragraph states rather than implies.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.2)
    The echo metaphor threads throughout (lost songs, grandfather's voice, space between dust motes) and the ending reweights it as inherited legacy rather than mere preservation. However, the grandfather's line "The echo isn't in the stone, it's in the space between" veers toward explicit theme statement that undermines subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of "necessary distances" without explicit moralizing, culminating in Lira's own codes that reweight the entire journey. The final insight that "Distance is a kind of prayer" resonates without stating a moral, and the recurring motif of grain/pattern genuinely constrains choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of belonging emerges organically through the contrast between isolation and connection, surface and depth. The burnt feather and bioluminescent patterns create resonant imagery without heavy-handed symbolism. The ending's "rhythm worth dancing to" provides non-literal closure, though the thematic exploration could probe deeper contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of memory, loss, and letting go emerges organically through the concrete work with crater glass and disappeared paths. The paradox of "cheerful gloom" embodies thematic complexity about accepting loss. The final insight about releasing painful paths offers a non-literal answer to the central question, though it edges toward explicit thematic statement ("Holding onto them caused pain, so the world let them go").

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the central paradox of "ordering randomness"—using structured art to create spontaneous community. The clown metaphor ("loop of humor and horror") resonates with breaking cycles. The ending achieves thematic closure as individual chaos transforms into collective improvisation without stating the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tension between cosmic yearning and mortal anchoring emerges through action and image rather than statement. The "tide dancer's curse and gift: to feel the pull of both earth and sky" resonates through the dance itself. Yet the nostalgia ban's thematic weight dissipates when we learn Lirael can simply choose "elective exile" without meaningful consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the prism metaphor and Elara's profession of "reading between lines" in glass, avoiding explicit moralizing until the notebook entry. The concept of finding extraordinary potential in ordinary things develops through concrete images—ripples, fractured light, rainbows in fog. The final paragraph's "clear complexity" and explicit theme statement ("illumination was not about grand revelations") costs 0.5 for directness.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of transformation through acceptance emerges organically from the fire/regrowth metaphor and mother's "Time bends for those who listen" message. The ending reweights earlier pain as "fertilizer" without stating a moral. Minor deduction for the slightly explicit "fire wasn't just destruction; it was transformation" line, though it's filtered through character realization.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of weaving patterns from different timelines, with the silver thread from her own hair marking personal investment. The concept of "equations for hope" gains specificity through tactile work rather than abstraction. The final image of the grotto's mouth "like a mouth about to speak" offers resonant ambiguity without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through concrete discoveries—diaries revealing "The legacy's burden is not in the keeping, but in the sharing." The film negative transforms from empty relic to sacrificial offering. The recurring map motif (corridor as spine of map, cartographer ancestor, locket's etched map) accumulates meaning. Final whisper "You are the map" reweights prior material, though it edges toward explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of mirrors showing "possibilities beyond their edges" - art as a way to transcend loss. The coded lullabies carrying "fragments of memory, slivers of hope" avoid abstraction. The final image of the sister smiling in golden light offers a non-literal answer about how love persists through creative transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of redemption's price emerges through accumulated details—the clipboard's scars, the statues' vigil, the "flawed beauty in compromise." The final reflection that "the price of redemption would never be fully paid" resonates with the preceding imagery. However, the thematic statement becomes somewhat explicit in places ("The price of redemption, she mused, was not in the grand gestures but in the small concessions").

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of preservation through destruction—the egg dissolves but the echo lingers. The final image of the yellowed map as "abstract beauty" that visitors misread perfectly captures how meaning fractures between public and private truth. The bird's song as both real memory and possible imagination creates productive ambiguity without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the concrete act of dancing to free trapped memories, resisting the "lullaby of conformity." The final image of carrying "a harvest of echoes—a symphony of resistance" offers a non-literal answer about collective memory as rebellion. However, the piece occasionally states its theme too directly ("her dance a middle finger to the world's expectations") rather than letting action carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the puppet show's content—king and pauper swapping roles—and Mara's campfire metaphor that stories "keep the dark at bay, but they also cast shadows." The final realization that ethical stories are "campfires, flickering in the dark" resonates without moralizing. The exploration of truth versus elegance, power versus perception, develops through concrete dramatic action rather than abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)

The monarch-moth juxtaposition (endurance vs. fragility) creates resonance without explicit moralizing. The final image of continuing this ephemeral work despite its impermanence offers a non-literal answer about finding meaning in temporary gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of memory preservation emerges through concrete particulars—the punched card lullaby, erased census records, names etched in stone. The final image of burning names that "refused to die" resonates without moralizing. The story avoids abstraction through specific details like "crimson for blood, silver for moonlight," though the connection between fire/loss and light/preservation could be more subtly woven.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges through the decay/renewal paradox and path/walker relationship without explicit moralizing until the final sections. The piece successfully layers meanings through the wafer seal's "circle split by a jagged line" and bunker/forest duality. However, lines like "paths choose walkers who dare to redefine the journey" and the epilogue's explanatory tone ("that some paths are not walked, but grown") edge toward thesis statement rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the irony of a frugal astronomer finding faith in numbers rather than stars. The tile-as-mirror metaphor effectively reweights prior material, transforming from key to self-reflection. "Some truths were too vast for telescopes" resonates without moralizing, though the covenant concept could be more precisely developed.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.6)
    The broken-to-mended pin metaphor carries thematic weight about transformation through scars, and "grace shifts" recurs meaningfully. However, the theme is often stated directly ("letting go was not weakness, but strength") rather than emerging from events. The final "grace had shifted" provides resonance but the cost remains abstract—we don't know what Lirael sacrificed or how the sanctuary changed.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the distinction between erasing and navigating boundaries, paid off when the sextant points inward rather than outward.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of persistence through abandonment emerges organically through the mending metaphor and deciduous vows concept. The final image of the blooming orchard offers a non-literal answer about renewal through small acts.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of nonlinear inheritance—legacy by choice rather than blood or time—emerges organically through the fractal shells and library of parallel lives. The final image of Elara's name "waiting" to join the tree reweights the opening's "legacy not bound by time or blood" without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges through the concept of "unlearned lessons" and knowledge gaps, with the diary's cipher gaps mirroring Elara's blind spots. The ending attempts resonance with "dance of ignorance and discovery" but relies on abstract statements. The blue orchid and childhood melody carry some thematic weight but don't fully cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the garden's conceptual shift from physical location to act of remembrance. The final image of the twin-petaled flower reweights "blissfully aberrant" and "trapped freedom" without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between harmony and discord, with the final "duet of hush and hum" offering a non-literal answer about coexistence rather than elimination.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformed meaning of the beacon—from literal navigation to existential hope—with the prism's shards becoming a concrete metaphor for reconstructing meaning from fragments. The final image of incomplete star return with sufficient hope resonates without stating its moral, earning its wisdom through Elara's specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically through concrete details: "The past is not a straight line. It bends" arises from shadow measurement rather than abstract philosophy. The final insight about letting memory "shape you, like wind carving stone" resonates through earned imagery. The story resists simple morals about memory, though the ending edges toward mild over-articulation with "not as a keeper of memories, but as a living part of them."

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of transforming guilt into purposeful action emerges through the fire imagery without explicit moralizing. The final realization that "shadows weren't darkness, but unlit potential" offers a resonant answer that reweights the opening failure, though the mentor's wisdom occasionally veers toward platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.1)
    The transition/metamorphosis theme emerges organically through the cicada metaphor and tidal imagery without explicit moralizing. The story resists tidy resolution - the conversation "wasn't over" but the pause has created space.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the journey from external quest (finding a physical throne) to internal recognition (claiming one's legacy through self-knowledge). The final insight that "the throne was never unclaimed" reweights the entire journey without explicit moralizing, and the mirror metaphor ("The unclaimed throne was a mirror") resonates through prior imagery of murals revealing hidden truths.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of needing connection to "teach suffocating to breathe." The doorknocker ring accumulates meaning from relic to conduit to witness. The final image of rebuilding bridges reweights the opening's careful burning without stating a moral. Some thematic articulation ("I need to teach suffocating to breathe") edges toward explicit but remains grounded in scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of translating pressure into resilience emerges organically through the literal transformation of conceptual pressure into diamonds, then their dissolution. The final realization that "diamonds are a metaphor" and the bolt was "a key to her own resilience" resonates without explicit moralizing, though it edges toward being slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of sacrifice versus power emerges organically through the discovered letters revealing "a dynasty ender not in blood, but in self-awareness." The final image of the room transforming from "tomb" to "cradle" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the pattern/string metaphor without explicit moralizing until the very final line's inscription feels slightly too neat. The core insight about possibility as lived pattern rather than captured object resonates through concrete imagery (floating orbs, tangled strings), and the ending reweights the opening's trauma as necessary dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete discovery process—the button as metonym for erased histories. The ending offers resonant answer without moralizing: incomplete stories still deserve witness. However, some passages veer toward abstract philosophizing ("magnify the small kindnesses hidden in the gaps") rather than staying grounded in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of resistance against erasure emerges through concrete action (stealing evidence, distributing truth) rather than declaration. The phone booth key as rebellion artifact and "indifference kills faster than bullets" avoid platitudes. The ending image of Mara alone with the key while stars "wink like secrets" offers resonance, though the thematic weight could deepen beyond resistance-versus-tyranny.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of "some truths were meant to stay hidden" emerges through action rather than declaration, with the saxophone's negative space method embodying the paradox of using absence to create presence.

Minor deduction for the slightly neat resolution where all mysteries resolve without lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between broken clocks (imposed order) and the spinning compass (embracing uncertainty), avoiding explicit moralizing until justified by experience. The clockwork flowers crystallize the theme without overstatement. Minor deduction for "To befriend uncertainty in planning" appearing as direct thesis statement in the journal, though it's partially earned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The kintsugi metaphor threads throughout, from the coin's "jagged edges" to "mending broken pottery with gold" to accepting one's cracks. The theme emerges through concrete images rather than abstraction, and Lira's final message about balance ("letting one side hold the other when it falters") resonates without moralizing, though it approaches thematic echo territory.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the crocodile's tooth metaphor—"it bites, but it also holds the key to release"—avoiding explicit moralizing. The final insight that healing is "a journey through distortion and doubt" reweights earlier material without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of decreasing entropy by introducing disorder - "a dance of decay and rebirth." The final image of the oak sapling with "leaves unfurling like green flames" amid melting ice resonates as renewal through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of harmony versus disruption emerges through concrete bell-testing and storm response, avoiding abstract statements until Veyra's somewhat heavy-handed "conductor/maestro" metaphor.

    Theme emerges through the tension between mechanical observation and spiritual listening, embodied in contrasting approaches to the same cosmic phenomena. The stardust captured in yellow glass offers a non-literal answer about finding meaning in ephemeral moments.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of balance between order and wonder emerges through the chess game metaphor and Kael's transformation from thief to guardian. The "secrets hidden in plain sight" concept pays off through the hollow pieces containing fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of "palette of resolve"—mixing perspective rather than forcing singular approaches.

    The theme of reading occluded emotional terrain through objects emerges organically through Lira's practice. The water clock's "ebbs and flows" effectively mirrors fractured perception.

    The theme of quiet observation versus loud assertion emerges through concrete choices—Elias tracking shouting haulers, finding the hidden chamber through careful attention to symbols. The zodiac coin and maps create a pattern of hidden knowledge rewarding patience. The ending's "The labyrinth didn't need maps. It needed whispers" crystallizes the theme, though it edges toward explicit statement rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of "silent empathy" emerges organically through Lira's wordless light-weaving, avoiding explicit moralizing. The dental mirror's transformation from maternal gift to light-tool carries thematic weight, though the final image doesn't fully reweight prior material—the darkness being "a little less heavy" feels incremental rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "planting forests of second thoughts" via chess displays and teaching. The final exchange about "rebellions start small" and continuing to plant resonates without moralizing. The grotto as a space "where past meets prophecy" effectively bridges memory and future possibility through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of detachment as liberation emerges through the scrimshaw's inscription and Lira's final swim toward "the deep, vast and full of possibility." The mirror metaphor ("the island hadn't been a prison but a mirror") effectively reframes the narrative, though the insight arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient scene-work preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the whittling metaphor—imperfection as humanity, creation as defiance—without excessive abstraction until the final lines. The spoon-making philosophy ("A balance between emptiness and fullness") resonates beyond its literal context, and the dried flowers' transformation from life to "brittle husks" to "new shape" embodies the grief work, though the ending whisper tilts toward articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of boundaries dissolving emerges through concrete imagery (ice parting, stone rippling) rather than statement. However, the transformation lacks complexity—boundaries dissolve without examining what is lost, making the thematic resolution feel one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection emerges through concrete images (withered rose revealing moth, shattered glass bird fueling phoenix) rather than stated morals. The final line "the world had learned to burn brighter" resonates, though Marla's explicit thematic statement "Beauty isn't in perfection" edges toward over-articulation in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme emerges organically through the discovery that connection pre-exists human engineering, requiring only attention and questioning. The carbide lens as both mining tool and recording device creates resonant layers about extraction versus listening. The ending avoids moralizing while offering a clear thematic answer, though "symphony of contradictions" leans toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "mending what cannot be unbroken" emerges organically through concrete actions and the central metaphor of light refraction. The curtains of intention work as both literal projections and metaphorical bridges between despair and renewal. However, some thematic statements edge toward explicit moralizing ("grief, like light, could be refracted"), and the final inscription provides too neat a summary rather than letting the image resonate alone.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of measuring chaos to find patterns. The cards (Tower/Hanged Man/Star) create a non-literal answer about collapse, surrender, and understanding. "The crashes didn't erase culture—they exposed its skeleton" avoids moralizing while offering insight. However, the theme of rebuilding through pattern-recognition could use more complexity; counter-readings are minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of knowledge-as-choice emerges through the pagoda-as-seed metaphor and Lirael's shift from "purifying" to embracing uncertainty. The serpent ouroboros and "atoms of nostalgia" create coherent imagery around cycles and memory. However, Lirael's explicit articulation "The past... But not as a warning. As a *choice*" veers toward thesis statement, and the final paragraph's "questions not answers" feels abstractly philosophical rather than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the metamorphosis of hope from shapeless to defined, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final book titles ("Hope's First Bloom," "The Shadow's Gift") resonate without over-explaining, and the piece successfully explores how shared dreams alter hope's fundamental nature.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the chameleon's survival strategy—shedding to escape—which Lira adopts metaphorically by releasing fear and guilt while keeping her core intact. The final image of the reconstructed tail "shifting subtly in the growing light" offers resonant answer without stating morals. The piece avoids tidy resolution, acknowledging that fragility requires courage in a sharp-edged world.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.8)
    The scars-as-stories metaphor emerges clearly, especially through the mother's teaching "Stories are written in scars." However, the theme arrives through direct statement ("The scars weren't just maps of loss; they were bridges to understanding") rather than dramatized realization. The ending's "displaced miracle" connection feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of unused/unspoken love emerges organically through the discovered film and letters, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of Mara as keeper of secrets resonates without stating a thesis. The recurring motif of containers (film canisters, letters, the booth itself) effectively charges the closure without feeling forced.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the preserved stardust jars—creativity isn't trapped but "waiting." The final image of Kael with "ideas, each one a star waiting to fall" resonates without moralizing, though "The Dreamer's Unspoken Truth" edges close to thematic labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through concrete images: frozen clock as stasis, dreams as generative force, the archive as possibility space. The final image of tiny flames dotting the dune resonantly answers the opening's "only place left to dream" without stating a moral. "Fractured lullaby found its rhythm" reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the forest-as-brain revelation: mechanical and wild aren't opposites but interdependent states of consciousness. The father's holographic wisdom—"The forest is alive because it remembers being wild"—reframes preservation as active letting go rather than holding on. The ending's "probable miracles...inevitable" suggests emergence from conscious coexistence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the journey structure—courage as river not lake, the indirect paths reflecting life's non-linear nature. The ticket punch's star becomes a resonant symbol of choice and promise. The ending's return to vigil beautifully reweights the opening, suggesting cyclical duty. The story resists easy moralizing, letting the journey itself teach rather than stating lessons explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme emerges organically through the contrast between silence-as-safety and voice-as-courage, with the piano bench bolt serving as effective metaphor for small acts that hold weight. The final image of the child playing imperfect notes while the fortress "hummed with approval" resonantly reweights the opening's "unpardonable silence." Slight deduction for the explicit thematic statement "Safety is not the absence of sound."

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between authentic heritage (Veyra's "regally unpretentious" presence) and false grandeur (the pretender's hollow shell). The iron gall ink as truth-revealer resonates without heavy-handed symbolism. The final image of resumed constellations and graceful collapse offers a non-literal answer about truth's eventual triumph. The story avoids moralizing while exploring legitimacy versus performance.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of hidden patterns and cycles beneath surface reality emerges through the coral bleaching and flickering islands, with the tapping rhythm serving as a motif for accessing deeper truths. Yet the ending's claim that "paths that disappeared were not lost—they were waiting" reads as abstract assertion rather than earned wisdom from the specific struggle shown.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor: "chaos has a rhythm." The story explores meaning-making in apparent disorder without stating morals. The final image of voices rising "not of explosions, but of voices" reweights the entire rebellion concept from violence to collective purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between tradition and evolution, control and nurture. The embryo-as-seed metaphor resonates without overstatement, and Nana's final choice to "nurture" rather than control offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Strong subtext in the plants' warnings about choosing wisely.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of anchoring optimism in realism emerges through concrete details rather than abstraction, particularly in the final realization that beauty exists "in the brokenness." The pearl of stillness metaphor accumulates meaning through physical grounding. However, Mrs. Voss articulates the theme too directly at times ("That's why you anchor it in realism"), though the final image successfully reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the fragmentation motif—broken box, scattered cards, torn portraits—culminating in "we're all just waiting to be rewoven." The rhetorical questions ("What if reality's just a collage of half-truths?") work as character voice rather than authorial intrusion. The final image of threads pulsing and portrait breathing offers resonant closure without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of permanence and ephemerality - disappearing ink revealing truth, time fragmenting into readable moments. The child's "like breath - here, then gone" crystallizes the thematic question. The tower as mirror metaphor resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.1)
    The truth/censorship theme emerges through action rather than statement, with the frozen/thawing metaphor working effectively. "Because the truth matters" lands with earned weight given Lirael's sacrifice. However, the ending's revolutionary promise feels somewhat generic without specific complexity about which truths matter or what their revelation might cost beyond personal consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the central paradox of "quiet" as active presence rather than absence, reinforced by every image from ballast-as-anchor to dome-as-focus. The final image of Lira pressing her palm to the dome while whispering "quiet" to the soil resonantly answers the story's question about how to "weave continuity through chaos" without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    The goddess as broken pattern, the sleepwalking constellations as emotional overflow, and Kael's role as "scientist and supplicant" create layered meaning without stating themes. The final pure tone after dissolution suggests continuity through transformation, earning its resonance through accumulated particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "orbits of regret" theme emerges through action—past corruption circling back for reckoning. The observatory/astronomy metaphors connect to themes of seeing truth and perspective. However, Clara's explicit thematic statements ("My family's orbit isn't one of light—it's a black hole") and the final paragraph's abstract moralizing undercut subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of transforming guilt into forgiveness emerges organically through Lira's journey from mapping stars to escape her past to actively confronting it. The mother's letter creates genuine resonance: "I left because I loved you too much to let the world hurt you." However, the firmware-as-guilt metaphor occasionally becomes too explicit, particularly in Elara's exposition about "scientists who encoded their guilt."

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of silence from absence to message, avoiding explicit moralizing. The sand mandala's evolution from art to map to language embodies the theme concretely. The final bell and "making space for new truths" lands without preaching, though the penultimate paragraph edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the tessera's journey from creation to destruction to renewal, avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of "aberrant mercy" integrates with concrete action, and the final image of the single tessera holding "the promise of tomorrow" resonates without stating a moral. However, phrases like "erasure was not destruction. It was transformation" edge toward thematic summary rather than earned insight through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of artistic permanence versus temporal flux emerges through the encore metaphor—performance transcending time through repetition and variation. The blank tarot coin at closure suggests possibility requires erasure of fixed paths. Subtext operates beautifully through sensory crossings and the garden's response to Elias's performance, avoiding direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of authentic versus manufactured consciousness emerges through concrete details (geode's natural fractals versus "bulldozed" neural pathways). The final image of "fractally, somatically, undeniably real" resonates without stating a moral. However, some thematic articulation feels overly explicit ("They don't *illuminate* pathways—they bulldoze them"), reducing subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of translation between tangible/intangible emerges through concrete action with the fossil rather than assertion. The concept of "transitional objects" as portals gains specificity through the elm leaf's journey. Final image of Lira as bridge/translator resonates, though "the unknown had found its voice" edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the button-sorting metaphor and the canyon echo's wisdom about past threading into future. The final image of Mara cataloging new buttons while the echo spreads offers a non-literal answer about creation versus discovery, though one passage veers toward explicit statement ("prophecies weren't fixed—they were malleable").

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars (pillbox spirals, codes bleeding into earth) with the father's "unused courage" motif earning its final reweighting. However, the ending's explicit articulation ("The bluff had given her a gift: not the truth, but the courage to seek it") and earlier abstract statements about secrets festering detract from organic emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    The distilling complexity theme emerges through the yarn needle metaphor and Thaddeus's contemplative stance, avoiding direct statement. However, the theme doesn't develop through conflict or choice—it remains static observation. The palimpsest metaphor of layered meaning has potential but lacks dramatic testing.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the sunflowers' phototropism to kindness/hope, avoiding explicit moralizing until the subtle "tend to the light within it" lesson. The fractured timelines concept integrates naturally with preservation versus entropy. Final image of Mara at her wheel with the pulsing lantern resonates without stating conclusions.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of persistence through darkness emerges through concrete actions: tending fire escape gardens, leaving geraniums, creating rhythms in the night. The bitting gauge as a tool for "measuring light" offers resonance. However, Elias's explicit statement "after the final petal drops, you still have to water the stem" veers toward direct moralizing, diminishing subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of independence from collective identity emerges organically through Lirael's journey from "brittle awakening" to pioneer. The spiral symbol and title "Brittle Awakenings" effectively reweight earlier material. However, the resolution tends toward explicit statement ("pioneer of the living") rather than allowing the image alone to carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of authentic connection versus hidden truths emerges organically through Lila's ghostwriting paradox and the temple's transformative spaces. The spiral as keeper of secrets and the sinking orbs create resonant images for transformation. The ending avoids explicit moralizing, though Elara's dialogue occasionally veers toward theme statements like "Secrets aren't meant to be locked away."

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    The power-play theme emerges through the chess metaphor and tactical maneuvering between Lila and tricksters. However, the thematic exploration remains surface-level, and the final "Well played" note feels unearned given the minimal actual conflict shown.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of rebellion against constraining spaces emerges through action, and the key-as-constellation detail adds resonance. However, the ending's "wistful rebellion" states rather than implies theme, and the piece doesn't fully explore the complexity of what the key's power means beyond escape.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of empathy versus procedure emerges through Clara's artistic methodology contrasting with Voss's detective work. The masquerade motif (hiding/revealing) resonates with the investigation's uncovering process. However, Clara's explicit articulation "Not art... Empathy" and the final line about empathy needing "the right key" constitute thematic echo that undermines subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.9)
    The reversal/redemption theme emerges through Clara's investigation of her ancestor's true purpose, with the copper nail as a recurring motif. The coded stanzas and journal entries build thematic resonance around challenging authority and reversing injustice. However, the ending doesn't offer a non-literal answer—Clara literally reads the reversal instructions aloud without the scene showing transformed understanding or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of reshaping "never" into possibility emerges through concrete images (the flake's pixelated pattern, scaffold wrap flutters) rather than direct statement. The concept of "pixelated amnesty" creates intrigue, though its full implications remain abstract. The ending's "choice" between possibilities lacks the complexity that would elevate thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.6)
    The circular paths theme emerges through repetition and the father's quoted wisdom, but resolution comes via abstract realization ("he'd broken the cycle") rather than dramatized action. The foreign bills carry thematic weight as greed symbols, yet their deployment lacks concrete consequence that would ground the theme in specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of empathy-as-understanding emerges organically through the temple's test, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the brother's lullaby etched in skin resonantly answers the question of how we decode others' mysteries—through shared vulnerability. Strong subtext in Veyra's "Share the burden, or lose the map."

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of confronting hidden darkness emerges through concrete action rather than statement, particularly in "discover what mirrors don't show." The final acceptance that she's "capable of violence, of darkness" offers complexity. However, the resolution that frames the killing as pure self-defense with misplaced guilt simplifies the moral ambiguity initially promised.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of scars as both wounds and maps, with the intersection being internal choice rather than external place. The double's insight about hesitation versus heeding adds complexity. The final image of two moons elegantly visualizes the merged worlds, though the ease of resolution slightly undercuts thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of recklessness into "fiercely gentle force, capable of both destruction and creation." The burned Fool card's journey from failure-marker to ash-offering resonates without moralizing, and the boy's drowning recontextualizes from failure to lesson through earned vision.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of value beyond conventional appraisal emerges through the cloth's journey from "probably worthless" to personal talisman. The phoenix logo subtly mirrors resurrection themes without overstatement. The ending reweights "after the applause" from loss to continuation through story preservation, though the final insight borders on explicit with "After the applause, there was still music."

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of transition-as-reassembly emerges organically through the seed's spiral patterns, the arbor's magnetic fields, and the final realization that physics are "stories waiting to be retold." The recurring motif of connection (arbor/Ancient wisdom, material/intangible) effectively charges the closure. The piece avoids explicit moralizing, letting the transformation demonstrate its thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the creel as "smelting pot where identities could be reforged" and the journal's "I am the space between tides." The final image of the librarian collecting remnants (feather joining shell, butterfly, rose) resonantly answers the central question about identity fluidity without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete image of walls dissolving between hearts, avoiding direct moralizing. The pearl's inscription "forgive" and the shell's confessions build toward a resonant answer about connection overcoming isolation, with the final transformation from "tomb" to "cathedral" offering a non-literal resolution to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the graffiti's collective wisdom about forgiveness as flow rather than destination. The river metaphor deepens from physical to emotional mapping, and the final "Begin" avoids moralizing while offering resonant closure that reweights all prior searching.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of hidden truths emerges through the concrete image of words appearing only when held to light, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the concept of "unspoken words" and "truths humanity dared not voice" tends toward abstraction without specific human complexity to ground it.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "perforated destiny" with its "holes where choices bled into chaos" emerges through concrete images rather than statement. The coffee stain's Rorschach patterns and dual visions (throne vs. garden) embody the central question. The final image of the violin shattering into stardust while "a child laughed" creates resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the tension between preservation and oblivion, crystallizing in "even in the face of oblivion, beauty could endure." The threshold as both barrier and lens deepens thematic resonance. The final image of stillness as "a canvas, waiting" offers a non-literal answer about creative persistence against entropy.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cycle of rebirth theme emerges organically through the hairpin's journey and return, avoiding explicit moralizing. The scallop shell as "journey from darkness to light" enriches without over-explaining. The ending's reframing of contentment as practice rather than destination offers genuine thematic resonance, though it edges toward the abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The metaphor of truth as "not a single note, but a chord, complex and dissonant" beautifully emerges from the concrete chime-work rather than being stated. The ending image of Elias carrying away the "ghost of Mira's husband's laughter" in the hollow mirror reweights the opening's "conscience for hire" with earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the pattern metaphor—truth earned through observation rather than given. The ripples reflecting past selves and the vanishing-as-arriving paradox create resonant complexity. Slight deduction for the near-explicit thematic statement "the truth was not something to be given but something to be *earned*."

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.6)
    The paradox of "navigating without moving" develops through accumulated imagery and the figure-eight pattern, creating thematic resonance. The story resists easy moral resolution, embracing the complexity of alignment versus action. However, the theme tends toward explicit articulation ("to navigate without moving was to listen, to observe, and to trust") rather than emerging purely from dramatized events.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through Kael's journey from seeking "the sacred in the simple" to finding it in recreating his mother's ordinary garden. The contrast between the exotic magical garden and the simple earthly one effectively reweights the story's values without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges beautifully through the central metaphor: "Sound is the color of memory." The luminous vows concept integrates naturally with Elias's journey from hiding to acknowledgment. The final image of him walking home with "the color of sound humming in his veins" resonates without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of wavelength alignment—moving from noise to signal, chaos to coherence. The coins' transformation from dead artifacts to living circuit embodies this without stating it. The ending reweights the prophecy from warning to mirror, though some philosophical passages ("desire to harmonize") edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of giving "shape to the shapeless, voice to the voiceless." The echo of sacrifice transforms from loss to active creation of meaning. The final image of Elias walking into night with the weighted page offers a non-literal answer about fear and connection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges through the tension between perfection and functionality, with Elias's "Madness is just devotion without a roadmap" offering resonance without moralizing. The bell-as-heartbeat metaphor connects to the viaduct's pulse coherently, though the cosmic imbalance remains abstract. The final image of "fragile, flawed, earnestly naive kind of faith" reweights the opening's broken relic, though conceptual cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of memory as active preservation emerges through concrete details: the sapphire liqueur as both toast and poison, photographs as "method for expunging ghosts," and the final image of two women walking the ridgeway with photos "lighting the way." The story resists simple preservation-versus-forgetting binaries by showing memory work as precisely humane vigilance. Elias's choice to document rather than flee adds moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of harmonizing opposites emerges organically through concrete actions—reading starling patterns, combining father's calculus with mother's verse. The final image of the starling's spiral footprint resonates as a natural symbol of achieved synthesis. Strong integration without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "burden" into "covenant" and finally "language." The mother's single word "Trust" gains layers as Kael learns to trust both forest and inherited knowledge. The final image of continuing to "watch, revise, invent" offers a non-literal answer about adaptation and connection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme of duality/integration emerges but relies on explicit statements ("you're what I could've been if I'd given in to fear"). The brain labeled "duplicate" serves as obvious symbolism. Final line "You're not a duplicate...You're a choice" moralizes directly rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty over forcing answers emerges organically through Elias's journey from analytical investigation to intuitive flow. The corpse flower's transformation and Dr. Voss's quote about "doors open only when you stop knocking" reinforce this without heavy-handed moralizing. The final insight about "the way answers emerged when you stopped forcing them" resonates but edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of tending to unspoken joy emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of the leaf blower symphony. The story resists easy moralizing, and the final image of restored laughter offers resonance without stating its meaning. The conceptual framework of sound-as-restoration and the conductor role elevate this beyond typical grief narratives, though some metaphors feel overwrought ("macerate the stale air").

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the tension between boundaries and thresholds, certainty and uncertainty, without explicit moralizing. The mentor's final line recontextualizes the entire pursuit as finding "the threshold" rather than breaching boundaries. "Trust the fog" pays off as embracing uncertainty becomes the path home.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through the concrete tension between order (crozier) and chaos (destruction), with creative destruction as lived philosophy rather than abstraction. The final image of the ember nexus blooming "frozen in twilight's embrace" offers a resonant non-literal answer that reweights the opening's "wounded heart," though Veyra's quoted wisdom edges toward explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding beginnings in endings emerges through concrete action rather than statement, with the hush as potential rather than absence. However, the final paragraph's "endings were merely doorways, and silence was the key" veers into explicit moralizing that undermines the otherwise earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of "permanent transient"—the ferry as temporary bridge enabling permanent completion. The empty hourglass transforms from absence to vessel for "echoes of time," reweighting emptiness as potential. The final constellation preserves the transient moment eternally, offering a non-literal answer about completion versus continuation without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges through the weaving metaphor and connection patterns, avoiding direct moralizing until the curator's explanations become too explicit ("The texture of connection. It's not in the things we see, but in the patterns we weave"). The final image of Clara with her glowing thread offers resonance but lacks the complexity to transcend its prompt-driven concept.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of adapting to "unfolded horizons" emerges through the edge geometry concept and chain link metaphor, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of finding beauty in the unknown resonates, though the thematic answer could be more particularized to avoid abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of love transcending death emerges through the specific image of synchronized hearing aids creating a "duet of the living and dead." The ending offers resonance without explicit moralizing, though "Sometimes love is too big for words" edges toward statement. The photograph's transformation from clue to vessel of meaning works well.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through the concrete discovery that invisible things (lost people) leave electromagnetic traces—a non-literal answer to the opening question about tracking the invisible. The cables-as-memorials concept offers genuine resonance without stating a moral. However, the phase transitions concept feels somewhat grafted rather than fully integrated, and the brother subplot introduces slight thematic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of digital ghosts as bridges between states. The final image of Elias as "defragmenter of digital ghosts" resonantly answers the central question about error and identity without moralizing. Strong subtext in the woman's "I'm not ready" shifting from plea to promise.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of preserving what is already lost—the storyteller becomes "the extinction" to transcend her fear of it. The diamond-as-mirror concept reweights the curse from malevolence to self-reflection. The final line "some languages are meant to be felt, not spoken" resonates without moralizing, though the fear-as-weapon revelation edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete tension between "harmony untamed" and "civilization's cold grip," with the arrowhead as a bridge between worlds. The final spiral symbol and Elara's transformed mission embody the theme without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)

The storm-in-a-bottle serves as both literal object and thematic vehicle for breaking silence. The ending offers a non-literal answer about healing through "small, rebellious acts" without moralizing, though the final paragraph edges toward explicit theme statement with "promise that even in the disputed territories...there was room to grow."

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of renewal through patient attention emerges organically from Elio's actions rather than declaration. The recurring "misting hush" motif shifts from "forgotten dreams" to "playful" to embracing, tracking the thematic arc. The final reframing of silence as beginning rather than end offers resonance, though the insight feels somewhat expected rather than revelatory. Subtext operates effectively in the fountain's coded ripples and the courtyard's listening response.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of analog versus digital memory emerges through concrete details like the scarf's "raised threads" and the poet's claim to "fold time like origami." The final poem offers resonant non-literal answer about seeking stories "in the curves of your mind." However, the resolution tends toward tidy satisfaction—Eleanor finds exactly what she seeks without ambiguity or lingering questions about the cost of bridging seen/unseen.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the cipher metaphor - longing as something to embrace rather than capture. The final image of Elara stepping "into the dawn's quiet hum" resonates without stating a moral. "The painter of absences" creates thematic depth about ephemeral art and presence, though "that, she realized, was enough" edges toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through the central metaphor of locks/secrets/freedom, with the final realization that "some secrets, once spoken, could heal rather than harm" arising from concrete action. The lock of hair functions as both literal key and thematic vessel. The ending offers resonance without stating a moral, though the theme tends toward the expected rather than surprising, and the healing/harm binary simplifies what could be more complex.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central metaphor of broken constellations as fractured memories resonates powerfully, especially when the locket transforms the greenhouse from tomb to bridge. The theme of persistence despite incompleteness ("curiosity? That was eternal") emerges organically from Elias's actions rather than assertion, offering a non-literal answer about how the past persists in fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "reversible exile" emerges through concrete imagery and action rather than assertion. The tea-leaf divination and backwards-walking literalize abstract concepts effectively. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the shadow/light metaphor, though the resolution edges toward explicit statement ("the quietest lessons were the loudest").

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of preserving wonder emerges organically through concrete action rather than statement, particularly in the ritual sequence and the torch-passing with the iridescent blossom. The final insight that "wonder was not a finite thing" resonates without moralizing. However, the thematic resolution feels slightly neat, lacking the complexity or ambiguity that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of silence as prison versus protection emerges through the fisherman's choice and Mara's parallel journey from fixing to listening. The final image of "a thousand conversations, finally free" resonates, though the connection between Mara's personal stakes and the fisherman's secret feels underexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of "reopening silence" as discovering language in the unsaid emerges organically through concrete details—the "whispered liturgy" without vowels, the henge vibrating at unhearable frequencies.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete investigation of quantum decay and wavefunction collapse as metaphors for grief. The snow globe's recurring presence—from static memorial to active resonance—exemplifies how objects carry thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the concrete act of encoding silence into art, with the ghost as bridge between living and lost. The bluebell pressing reweights earlier encoding as Elias shifts from indirect communication to direct gesture, though the final "For you" remains deliberately ambiguous without full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of joy beneath anguish emerges organically through the captain's encrypted words and the phoenix symbol. The goggles-as-lens metaphor effectively links perception with truth.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of clouds as emotional memory, avoiding direct statement until earned. The concept of "spooled wholeness"—that empty spaces retain what filled them—resonates through Lila's mother's absence and the vanished tower. The final image of sailing toward "Cirrus spes" (threads of possibility) reweights all prior cataloging as personal rather than scientific endeavor.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of preservation versus destruction emerges through concrete discovery of the guild's hidden knowledge system. The line "To mirror the sky inside walls...When the tree falls, let the stars remain" crystallizes without moralizing. Final image of Lira walking with "the coin warm in her pocket" resonates as knowledge preserved despite physical destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of curiosity-as-compass emerges through action, culminating in "not just a place, but a truth." The stranded luminance metaphor for hidden knowledge works without overstatement. Subtext operates well in Jax's shift from skepticism to complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of repair—clocks, gears, broken things made whole—without explicit moralizing. The "rhythm of repair" resonates through specific images, though "finding harmony in the chaos" verges on stating rather than implying the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.6)
    The nebula of respite concept links to themes of collective hope and shared purpose. However, the theme announces itself explicitly through Elara's dialogue ("we are not alone, that our efforts matter") rather than emerging from dramatized conflict. The final paragraph summarizes the thematic lesson rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the grandfather's "cracks let the light in" philosophy, paid off when the puppet's cracks leak golden light. The final image of the lullaby as "beautifully flawed, sung across a thousand lifetimes" offers a non-literal answer to mortality's nature. Avoids moralizing while embracing complexity about perfection and endings.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of reluctant duty emerges through action, with the "graceless beauty" of imperfect markers resonating. The curse as both burden and purpose avoids simple moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the rivers' braiding and foam patterns—"separation isn't an end, it's a prelude to connection."

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete catalog of absences and the bottled moonlight's "glimmering parole." The concept of stories beginning in voids develops through specific images rather than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of collective burden emerges through Nessar diluting remorse "until it was no longer a knife but a grain of sand," with the final cooking scene transforming bitter memories into nourishment.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bridge-building theme emerges organically through the accumulation of images and actions, avoiding explicit moralizing until near the end. The polyglot singing and mechanical empathy create thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of fractured glass as "pathways" for memory, avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of rewiring reality through "synaptic plasticity" serves as both literal method and thematic exploration of transformation. The ending offers a resonant answer about reconstructing identity from fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of hidden knowledge in margins emerges organically through the manuscript doodles and grotto carvings, avoiding explicit moralizing. The serpent-key motif recurs meaningfully across discovery moments. However, the "seeds of vigilance" concept remains abstract without dramatized consequence, and the final insight about "quiet spaces between" verges on stating rather than embodying the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of silent music felt in bones and marrow. The final image of the grove as "cathedral of sound" resonantly answers whether art can exist without its conventional medium. "Empathy in motion" manifests through Elara translating the stump's pain into vibration without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of "beauty in constraints" emerges organically through chess metaphor (queen's diagonal movement), the covenant's subtle fulfillment, and the final image of fractured-mirror leaves. The stone's silence speaking and Alaric's translation work avoid explicit moralizing. Strong subtext in the chess lessons informing cosmic understanding. Minor deduction for "beauty in the difficult" being slightly over-articulated in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the silence-as-language metaphor, deepening from "unspoken things" through diary entries to final insight about "frequencies of others." The resonance between physical vibration and emotional attunement avoids heavy-handedness. Final image of walking into a world "loud with celebration but quiet with understanding" reweights prior material effectively, though the penultimate paragraph's explicit thematic statement ("The path to empathy...") diminishes subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of patience versus ambition emerges organically through Lira's cultivation journey, with the grandmother's whispered wisdom ("grows in the hush, not the roar") crystallizing the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of "gathering of echoes" - memory, adaptation, and symbiosis.

The shift from machine-seeking to understanding organic systems provides thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of technology becoming autonomous and hungry emerges organically through the investigation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The patch as a recurring motif that "vibrates" and "syncs with her heartbeat" creates resonance, though the final insight about awakened machines could push deeper into specific consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "sculpted hush" into living song - wonder proven essential through action, not declaration. The final image of harmonious oscillation between "repose and revelation" offers a non-literal answer, though Lira's explicit "truth is essential" line edges toward over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete action: the flute as "door not mirror" reframes Kael's relationship to failure from something to harvest to something to unmake. The final image of etching a surrender rune resonates without stating a moral, reweighting the earlier directional markers. The story resists tidy resolution—Kael walks home with fragments, not wholeness.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the concrete tension between analysis and feeling, with the fragment serving as mirror rather than tool. The final realization that emotions are "rhythms to be felt" reweights all prior analytical attempts without stating a moral. Subtext operates well through Veyra's cryptic warnings and the fragment's reactive light patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The germination metaphor elegantly unifies relics, memory, and mentorship, with Veyra's cryptic "Germinate the past. Let it root in the present" gaining resonance through action.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the weaving/silence/connection motif without explicit moralizing. The final image of Mara's name echoing in distant children's laughter offers resonant, non-literal answer to isolation versus connection. The "unraveling tapestry" metaphor effectively threads throughout without becoming heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of resilience emerging from endurance ("Resilience isn't born from safety, but from enduring the unendurable") integrates with action. The silk as key to binding "planet's soul to its body" provides coherent metaphor. Yet the theme states itself too explicitly through Jorin's dialogue rather than emerging purely from events.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges through action—the dangerous allure of seeking answers versus accepting ambiguity. The shard as both key and choice resonates, and the mother's warning "Some doors shouldn't be opened" gains meaning through dramatization. Final paragraph edges toward explicit moralizing ("The truth wasn't a thing to be found") which dulls the otherwise strong thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between physical darkness and metaphorical light—"not of flame, but of connection." The sea glass that "holds the sea's breath" and the stone messages create a resonant answer to loss without stating a moral, effectively reweighting the lighthouse's purpose from physical to spiritual beacon.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of ancient methods and future-shaping, crystallizing in "the dawn wasn't just a time of day. It was a choice."

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of light, perception, and story-telling without explicit moralizing.

The ending's image of Lin preparing tea while holding stories resonates without stating its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of finding beauty in decay emerges through concrete images—the broken sextant revealing dream maps, trees holding memories in their bark, sorrow measured in bent light. The final insight that "even in loss, there was light" resonates but arrives without the protagonist paying a dramatized cost for this wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of memory as communal fabric emerges organically through the woven dawns metaphor and forgotten songs. The final image of the greenhouse as beacon while Lira continues humming offers resonant closure without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of hiding while being seen, with the blank book and mirrors serving as concrete vehicles for abstract concepts. The final insight about selective revelation resonates without moralizing, though the leader's statement "Wisdom lies in mistakes" edges toward explicit theme articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the garden metaphor - life persisting in decay, active cultivation versus passive observation. The final image of Elias tending while "life thrived" offers a non-literal answer about finding the sacred through patient action rather than mere observation.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of preserving meaning against entropy emerges organically through Elara's work with luminous vows, and the specific image of reconstructing promises "piece by piece" resonates. Yet the ending's sudden success undercuts complexity—the theme would strengthen if partial failure or irretrievable loss complicated the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of silence as currency emerges organically through the market's economy of secrets and Lira's inheritance of "hush." The recording device that captures "the sound of trust breaking" literalizes the theme without becoming heavy-handed. The final image of the cracked but functional watch reweights the entire narrative, suggesting damaged but persistent legacy, though the dawn dissolution of the market feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the concrete image of the compass pointing to "moments" when the world shifts, not just people. The forests' elections embody the theme of balance between absorbing and releasing pain. The final taste of "lavender and regret" offers a non-literal answer about accepting mystery without moralizing, though some thematic weight depends on Lira's dialogue rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of artistic authenticity versus commercial compromise emerges organically through Elias's journey from "churning out portraits of strangers for coins" to confronting "the ghost of his younger self." The shadow-door metaphor effectively embodies the unlocking of suppressed potential. The final image of Elias sketching with the cave "fading into insignificance" resonates thematically, though the insight feels somewhat expected rather than revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of preservation: conversations crystallized yet repurposed, truth found in "empty" orbs. The final image of planting a seed where the oasis died resonates without stating its meaning. "Candor in small moments" manifests through the quill's truth-detection and Elara's choice to find hope in fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of silence versus noise, wonder versus mundane shouting, emerges through the sculpture's construction and performance rather than declaration. The final image of continuing cycles ("over and over") offers a non-literal answer about persistence of beauty. However, the piece edges toward explicit thematic statement with phrases like "symphonies of truth" and "the color of wonder" that feel more asserted than earned through specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the controlled burn metaphor—destruction as transformation, chaos as necessary for growth. The final image of static-as-song resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. The farm-as-box parallel enriches meaning. Strong thematic coherence between containing/releasing and the android's journey toward "strangely organic" existence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of listening as a path to truth emerges organically through Clara's methodology and the inscription "leads through following." The final image of interrupted love letters resonates with the listening theme. However, the thematic connection between Clara-the-curator and Clara-the-soldier's-beloved feels forced, and the ending veers toward sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of vulnerability-as-strength emerges organically through the scientist's encrypted work and Kael's embodied decoding. The spider web metaphor threads throughout, from Kael's methodical descent to the final image of walking threads without fear. The ending reweights the opening's patient threading through corridors as preparation for this ultimate navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of memory preservation emerges through concrete images (pressed flowers, the preserved rose) rather than exposition. However, the thematic resolution is too tidy—memories aren't truly deleted but preserved, waiting for rediscovery. This removes the story's central tension without exploring the implications of selective memory loss or the cost of remembering.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of silence as active force emerges through the ritual and imagery, particularly in "mapping silence" and the "smoothed hush."

The ending provides resolution but lacks the resonant non-literal answer that would deepen thematic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of "agreed upon lies" protecting deeper truths resonates throughout, from the false dates to the ultimate lie they must tell the building ("we're ready"). The concept that buildings have languages and memories offers fresh metaphorical weight. The final image of the library answering reweights all prior mentions of its groans and whispers, though the story's ultimate stance on truth versus protective fiction could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "tragically radiant"—beauty that hurts—and the transformation of quarantined memories from festering wounds to empowering sparks. The final image of Lirael walking away "free" but carrying the shell as "a promise" offers resonant complexity without stating a moral. The mother's abandonment memory effectively grounds the abstract concept of archived pain in concrete experience.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of forgiveness-as-treason emerges through concrete actions—forging documents "meant to unlink the chains of vengeance," using a cursed thorn that "remembered every wound." The final image of Lirael vanishing while leaving "only the echo of her purpose" resonates without stating a moral, though the conceptual framing occasionally overshadows immediate dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the echo metaphor - some voices persist because their stories remain unfinished, too heavy to fade. The final image of Kael singing while "the universe hummed its secret song" resonates without stating a moral, suggesting art's role in preserving human experience against cosmic indifference.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of windows as fragile connections requiring careful handling. The melted snow globe transforms meaning in each dream—pool, prison, mirror—building thematic resonance about love persisting beyond death. The ending avoids explicit moralizing, letting the image of reopened windows between worlds carry the weight, though the "salvaging something pure" arrives somewhat tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of hidden patterns and unseen labor emerges through concrete details—net-mending, firefly pulses, the whisk's shadow-casting. The final insight about "demure audacity" reweights earlier observations, though it edges toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure resonance through image.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of truth versus comfortable lies emerges through action rather than statement. The flawed diamond metaphor - dangerous truth that must be confronted - resonates without heavy-handedness. Final image of Mara continuing to dig despite cost offers non-literal answer to thematic question. Some abstraction in "truth excavator" concept weakens specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the synthesis of ancient wisdom and future possibility, with the portico as prism literalizing perspective-shifting. The final image of Kael as conductor resonates without stating a moral. Deducting for occasional abstraction ("variant allegiance") and the somewhat mechanical resolution where symbolic elements align too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of preservation and translation between generations emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The concept of "gleaned redemption" manifests in recovered memories and bridged connections. However, Elias's direct thematic statement "In the silence, where all stories wait to be sweetened" edges toward explicit moralizing, and the meta-poetry attempts dilute thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the harmony/frequency metaphor, avoiding direct moralizing while exploring balance between logic and emotion, physical and spectral. The final image of Elias as bridge-builder resonates without stating its meaning, and "some battles are won not with force, but with harmony" crystallizes earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of magnetic alignment serving as metaphor for revolutionary patience. The final image of the thawed lake with persistent hum resonates as earned wisdom, though the acolyte dialogue makes the theme slightly too explicit with "when the impatience stops screaming."

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of memory as both weapon and chain emerges through the lantern's dual nature and Cole's manipulation. The parallel between Eliza guiding slaves to freedom and Mara breaking her own chains resonates without explicit moralizing. The final image of Mara unflinching as the train rumbles overhead suggests liberation through steadfastness. However, the theme would strengthen if the cost of breaking free manifested more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the music box repair metaphor: "Each gear, each spring, must fit just so" parallels the precise work of redemption. The line "light breaks through storm clouds" reweights earlier darkness imagery without moralizing. Minor deduction for the slightly on-the-nose "repairing music boxes... repairing lives" connection.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the central metaphor of translating yearning into motion without explicit statement. The "gaps between desire and action" philosophy gains resonance when actualized in the final flight. Old Thrum's "seen, not solved" wisdom pays off concretely. The ending hum that rewrites the world avoids tidy resolution while delivering thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of institutional erasure versus persistent truth emerges organically through the recurring numbers and deleted files. The patch serves as a physical anchor for memory against digital deletion. However, Elara's video message stating "They're erasing us" comes dangerously close to explicit thematic declaration, and the final paragraph's "make sure the world remembered" borders on moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of transforming collective fear through shared humanity emerges organically from the mirror visions without explicit moralizing. The final image of Elara giving the storm "a heart" resonates as a non-literal answer to handling fear. Subtext operates well through the fragment's evolution from broken to glowing. Slight deduction for the somewhat pat transformation of each tragic vision into positive abstractions (terror→resilience, clutch→love's strength).

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the "fold in patience"—that space between action and acceptance where "exhaustion softened into surrender." The rescue doesn't resolve this ambiguity but reweights it: both women were "looking for something." The final peace isn't tidy resolution but earned complexity, with the parasol tip bridging grandmother's legacy to present action.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of "beautiful mismatches" and finding meaning in imbalance emerges organically through the burned letter, sun/moon metaphor, and vineyard's thriving despite harsh conditions. The final image of "two mismatched souls" in their "imperfect dance" resonates without stating a moral, though the philosophical dialogue sometimes edges toward explicit thematic articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of preservation and cyclical duty emerges through the line walker role and returning imagery. The closing emphasis on endurance ("the line would endure") resonates with Mara's acceptance of her path. However, the wisdom being preserved remains abstract, limiting deeper thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the factory/nature collaboration metaphor—"rust into art, abandonment into possibility." The word "enough" offers a non-literal answer to the healing question. However, the thematic resolution feels too tidy, lacking the complexity and counter-readings that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of fractured, non-linear growth patterns emerges organically through the crystal's light and Elias's observations of ivy, rumors, and blooms. The story avoids explicit moralizing until the final paragraphs, where it edges toward summary ("The library had given him more than answers; it had given him a language"). The weathered innocence tone supports the scholar's childlike awe at discovering hidden patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars - chalk as talisman, driftwood as futile markers, the sound as acceptance of aging's fragmentary nature. The final bold chalk line reweights earlier "faint lines" without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the gap between prophet and forgetfulness, though one instance of "tidal longing" feels slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of control versus surrender emerges through concrete action (repairing vs. leaping) rather than statement, and the "leaf falling" motif provides subtle resonance. However, the ending's portal-as-escape feels thematically convenient rather than a complex engagement with the established question of temporal mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the hymn's lyrics about "light persisting through darkness" and the vinyl shard's journey from mother to Mira to Clara. The "scent of hope" motif accumulates meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the investigation of hidden mechanisms - loops closing, dormant powers awakening, shadows concealing gateways.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mirror metaphor emerges organically from the action, reweighting the garden from trickster space to reflection of internal states.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through the concrete tension between finished manuscripts and living stories, with the seashell spiral embodying recursive possibility. The final line "trusting the journey" risks platitude but is earned through prior specificity. Minor deduction for the guide's explicit theme statements, though the ending reweights "unfinished" from failure to possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the shift from solitary magical fixing to communal practice—"sacred practices need tenders, not just tinkerers." The recurring motif of stories/songs/memory gains resonance when the creatures commit to helping remember. The final image of Lira keeping "stories spinning, one song, one seed, one sacred step at a time" offers a non-literal answer about continuity requiring collective effort.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of patience and stillness as pathways to understanding emerges organically through Elias's methodical actions and the orchard's "moving stillness." The final insight about translating "heartbeats into maps" offers resonance about internal navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the distinction between "weights" and "wounds"—some pain must remain unprocessed to preserve identity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of temporal confusion and inability to let go emerges through the lagoon's fractured time, the stopped carousel, and Veyra's collection of fragments. The ghost's revelation about self-forgiveness and the final ambiguity (drowned/transcended) avoid tidy resolution. The rose as final image reweights the collection motif, though the transformation from camera wheel to rose lacks grounded logic.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of resurrection through repurposing emerges organically from Lila's actions, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the equation "etched into her memory" while the terminal dims offers a non-literal answer about hope requiring continuous refinement, though the thematic exploration could dig deeper into the cost of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of absence as presence emerges organically through the thread metaphor and spectral encounter, avoiding direct moralizing until the final section. The concept of "explained absences" as beginnings rather than endings offers complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of organic beauty versus mechanical efficiency emerges through concrete details and the egg's transformation. The final image of the glowing orb offers a non-literal answer about imperfection containing "truest beauty."

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The layered time/sediment metaphor effectively links physical excavation to philosophical inquiry. "They erased the stars, but I'll resurrect them" captures the theme of preservation versus progress.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of holding conflict gently rather than erasing it emerges through Clara's grandmother's teaching and the violin-zither duet starting "raw and off-key."

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transformation versus tragedy emerges organically through the grandmother's fate and Mara's choice. "To welcome nuance into a certainty" resonates through the reframing of death as sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the paradox that "fear, like beauty, is a lie" requiring confrontation through acceptance rather than resistance. The dream dictionary's riddles and the cloak's luminance create coherent subtext about inherited wisdom versus lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor "Obstacles are just instruments waiting to be tuned" without moralizing. The final mosaic image offers a non-literal answer about transformation through persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of belonging as "resonance not place" emerges through the concrete action of aligning observatory mechanisms with stars, avoiding direct moralizing. The frequency matching heartbeats and the stones "waking" create embodied metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the ocean's preservation of buried truths versus manufactured memories—concrete objects (driftwood) embody abstract concepts without stating morals. The "sieved hush" as "space left behind when truth was swallowed by the tide" resonates through action.

Minor deduction for "some truths were too heavy to carry alone" edging toward statement.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)

    The fortune's "greatest metamorphosis begins with a step you fear" gains layered meaning as physical transformation becomes spiritual bridge-building.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    The "cradle of sparks" metaphor effectively bridges literal (hidden chamber) and thematic (revolutionary network) meanings.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of grief transformed into a destructive, awakening force emerges organically from the core concept and character action, culminating in Elara's realization that unused potential is "anger" and "grief." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to live after trauma—not by healing, but by harnessing the rupture itself. It avoids moralizing, sitting in complex, bleak ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of belonging as resonance, not place, emerges organically from the climactic revelation and the final image. It is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the prior search for the chip, avoiding moralizing. The concept is integrated with elegance and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme of buried truth emerges organically from the driftwood mosaic and Elias's arc. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The "sieved hush" is a concept that is repriced from absence to palpable space.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the confluence of object, setting, and action, exploring the cost of holding on versus letting go. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Clara’s final action and Elias’s reveal, reweighting prior material without moralizing. The concept of "neutral territory" as a choice is fully integrated into the narrative’s emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from Clara’s struggle with regret and navigation, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—regret is a tide, not a compass—that reweights prior material. The final image of aligned poles and her smile integrates theme without statement, earning its wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges powerfully from the core concept of the labyrinth and the lake's function, exploring the weight of choice and the nature of empathy. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: empathy is "holding the pain of others because you’ve known your own." This is earned through the specific, dramatized confrontation with her possible selves, avoiding moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of reluctant metamorphosis emerges organically from events and images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the end ("metamorphosis is not an ending, but a rebirth"). It avoids moralizing and sits in complex ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of repentance and lost time emerges organically from the specific particulars of the handprints, the saucer, and the glade. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image and the mother's whisper, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in gesture and image, such as the saucer's crack healing into a straight line.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme—that true peace requires engagement with darkness—emerges coherently from events and the final image. It offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the AI's dialogue ("You did not avoid the shadow. You wore it like a cloak") edges toward thematic statement, slightly reducing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the core concept of the "hush" and the action of releasing bugs. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of transformation through the final image and Lira's realization, avoiding moralizing. The concept of "accidentally" fulfilling prophecies deepens the thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of a "spark" of revolution emerges organically from the concrete particulars of the sundial, the quill holder, and the hidden chamber. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of change. The concept is slightly echoed in dialogue ("spark a revolution"), but this is a minor slip that doesn't descend into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme emerges impeccably from the concrete struggle with the rocks and eels, culminating in the non-literal, earned realization that patterns are "a language to honor" rather than a puzzle to solve. The final image answers the central question without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges masterfully from the integration of scar-mapping, poetry, and censorship, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer: truth is found in rarefaction. The cartographer's concept is transformed through Kael's specific struggle, avoiding moralizing. The final image of the storm "kissing his wonder, raw and unfiltered" offers a profound thematic payoff without statement. Subtext operates powerfully in the poem's fragments and the envelope's mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges masterfully from the duel's transformation, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to engage with inquiry. The final image of "better questions" reweights the prior conflict without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the physical action and the repurposed object, avoiding explicit thematic statements.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the core concept of "blooming resistance" and the specific particulars of the tin, the poems, and the molting. The final realization—“to forge beauty from anarchy, you must first become the anarchy”—is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the prior material without moralizing. The piece earns its wisdom through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the conflict between strategic planning and spontaneous creation, resisting a tidy moral. The final image of the vibrating piano offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this central question, reweighting prior material without statement. The compasses and clock serve as integrated motifs, not forced symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of memory as a compass emerges coherently from the dream visions and Lira's choice, resisting direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A minor deduction for the dream-woman's dialogue, which edges toward thematic echo ("memory is not a cage but a compass").

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the integration of concept ("tides of remembrance"), object (lace/compass), and action. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of unspoken words without moralizing. The lace as a "map of emotions" is a fresh, specific inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—gradual change, humility before process, and unpredictability—emerges through specific images and actions (dust lattices, fungal growth, spiral shed). A few thesis‑like lines verge on telling, but they are anchored in concrete observation. The final exchange with the botanist shifts the inquiry from insular analogy to collaborative rigor, reweighting prior material. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Motifs (frost, fire, glass, “pauses”) mature into a resonant answer: meaning lives in the intervals and ephemeral traces. The Elias line mirrors her ache without overexplaining, though the sentence “Her purpose wasn’t to create objects…” edges toward thesis. Subtext rides imagery and craft rather than sermonizing, leaving a tangible afterglow. Complexity is maintained with a humane, non‑tidy acceptance of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: trauma transformed into a new musical language, silence as presence, art as relational bridge. The subtext in exchanged notes and sketches works; the plant dance is a resonant, wordless articulation. A few lines verge on thesis (“She’s not broken”; “silence was not an absence but a presence”), tilting toward explicitness. The ending reweights earlier images without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.7)
    Resonant images—coffin/city, broken lens/kintsugi repair, beacon as grief’s re‑direction—build a coherent theme of rest reimagined as belonging. Subtext surfaces in object work and vocation, but several lines state thesis directly (“It’ll guide you,” final paragraph moralizing), thinning ambiguity. The ending reweights earlier images effectively, if a touch on‑the‑nose. Emotional aftereffect is genuine without tipping into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of solidarity, naming, and intergenerational reciprocity emerge through concrete acts (ringing, notes, bread exchange) and recur in the bell’s reweighted meaning. The ending (“It’s not the sound… And who listens.”) reframes value from object to community attention without didacticism. A few declarative lines risk thesis‑statement neatness but remain in‑character. The resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme coheres around revelation, compassion, and transmutation of “unused love,” and the ending reweights prior images via breath and in‑between spaces. Some lines verge on explicit statement (“She had found where unused love was stored”), softening subtext. Still, the recurring motifs (camera/shadow, breath, sparks) develop meaning organically and leave a gentle after‑resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, time’s fabric vs. narrative, and preservation cohere via recurring objects (photos, fragment, living architecture) and the reweighted ending. However, the explicit thesis line (“time wasn’t a texture to be touched, but a story to be told”) states the moral and blunts subtext. The resonance remains, but subtlety is undercut in the final paragraph. The loss of retrocognition offers a real conceptual cost that supports the theme despite the tell.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Resilience vs. scarcity and liberation vs. constraint braid through actions and objects (chains, arrow, seeds). The final image reweights “planting resilience” into literal defense and renewal, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. A few on‑the‑nose formulations (“resilience had been planted”) blunt subtlety. Still, the theme largely emerges from concrete beats rather than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: absence as material, memory as mutable, betrayal as a frequency. Recurrences (forge, root, coordinates) deepen meaning without sermonizing, and the final image reweights love as audible absence. The “cells divide, memories fracture” line borders declarative but is grounded by concrete action soon after. The resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of reciprocity, illumination vs. theft, and reinterpreting rules arise organically through action, culminating in the transformed photo and wilted lily. Subtext is woven in images (garden vs. locked door) that reweight her vocation. A touch of stated thesis (“destiny’s door wasn’t locked. It was a garden”) slightly over‑articulates what the images already do. The final charged poise lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of abandonment versus transformation accrues through particulars (crack in bookmark, thaw, unfinished sculptures) and reweights at the end. The “broken things can catch the light” line skirts aphorism but is grounded by the on‑page image. Subtextual echoes (tension as beauty in glass) support the final stance. Resonance is earned without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of generational betrayal and reframed vulnerability emerge through the shell, the cast notes, and Lila’s tactics. However, the piece states its thesis overtly multiple times, especially near the end (“I proved vulnerability is power”), which reduces subtext. The best thematic move is the final boundary—refusing to hand over the shell—quietly enacting the new stance. More implication, less declaration, would lift resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of absence/presence and mapping voids emerge organically via concrete silences (before a wave, after a thunderclap) and the glowing map. The final image provides a non‑literal answer: mastery arrives by embracing darkness rather than resisting it. One line edges toward on‑the‑nose (“silence could be both absence and presence”), but the piece mostly trusts image over thesis. Resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coheres (mundane mysticism; thought as collision of memory/emotion/time) and images support it. Yet the text states its thesis directly (“To amalgamate is to understand,” and the final dialogue spells the moral), which flattens subtext. The final image of resumed sweeping carries resonance despite the on‑the‑nose articulation. Earned, but a shade didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of honesty beyond speech accrues through objects and choices (lens clarifies, tickets as keys). Subtext operates in the crystals’ hum and the final doodle invitation. However, lines like “Words, he realized, were overrated. Sometimes, honesty was enough…” tilt toward explicit moralizing, blunting resonance. The piece still invites reflection through its final image, if a touch stated.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The marbles’ “ledger of resilience” and the final bloom “because of” wounds deliver a resonant argument. Some thematic lines tip into on‑the‑nose moralizing (“Luck is just another word for preparation meeting opportunity”), blunting subtext. Still, the cracks/maze wounds motif reweights the ending image aptly. Thematic coherence emerges from particulars more than from plot consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    “Subdued awakenings” refracts across flora and Veyra’s internal ignition, and the icy/ warm motif tilts the finale. Insight arises from events, not sermonizing, though “She’d proven…” states theme a touch directly. The ending invites reflection on curiosity vs. control without tidy moralizing. Resonance is present but could deepen with a clearer felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of liminality, art as communion with the dead, and listening between movements cohere through concrete images (water‑bled symbols, floating sheet music). The ending’s promise reframes silence as charged potential. It avoids moralizing and lets motifs carry the resonance. A touch of familiar phrasing (“the theater held its breath”) slightly softens originality but not coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of certainty vs resilience emerges through the bearberry/margins motif and reweights at the end via the herbalist’s line. The final image offers a resonant answer—anchoring rather than quantifying—without spelling a moral. A couple of explicit theses are stated, but the imagery does most of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    The arc reframes the “ghost” as human failure; motifs (hunger, wheel, hum/hush) accrue and the final sentinel image resonates. One on-the-nose line (“found something worse: human failure, amplified by greed and fear”) edges toward moralizing, slightly dulling subtext. Otherwise, meaning arises through action and image. The ending’s refusal carries thematic weight without tidy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of surrender, nonjudgment, and the cost of witness arise through motif and action rather than lecture, with the origami swan and backward river accruing meaning. The concluding repricing—library as bridge not chain, river gone to stone—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. One explicit thesis line (“To witness change without judgment...”) edges toward statement, trimming the mystique slightly. Overall, subtext carries through the journey and return.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of “ordinary magic” and perception versus skepticism recur through object and event, culminating in a reweighted final gesture. Subtext works in the glow’s contingency on remembering. However, explicit thesis lines (“That’s the magic. It’s not in the curl. It’s in us.”) verge on moralizing and dampen resonance. The piece still invites reflection, if a shade too declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of attention vs. indifference and stories as latent presences emerge through concrete images (ashes to walls, dragons fleeing). Clara’s diary edges toward explicit statement but remains embedded in action, not sermon. The final chorus reweights the initial “last dream” premise with a resonant answer. Ambiguity around the dragons as stories offers lingering interpretive depth.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of “open secrets,” choice shaping fate, and inheritance versus authorship emerge from concrete actions rather than sermonizing. The final image (flare, dockworker’s choice) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about agency and directed flow. A few aphoristic lines flirt with neatness, but subtext mostly breathes. Complexity is present without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (silence/noise, indigo, tapestry/thread) cohere into a meditation on control versus openness, with a non‑literal answer in the final “dynamic equilibrium.” Some thematic statements are on‑the‑nose (“Hidden assumptions are the roots of all control”), slightly reducing subtext. Still, the closing image reweights prior material without a moral. The rhetoric‑as‑tool elegantly embodies theme.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Time, memory, and art’s resurrective purpose braid through concrete images (mirrored horizon, fortunes as invitations/maps). Subtext typically carries the weight, though one overt thematic line (“Not to predict the future, but to resurrect the past”) edges toward telling. The ending reconfigures the premise with a quiet, resonant acceptance. Complexity holds without sermonizing, albeit with low-risk ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Resonance arises from concrete returns (drop→ripple, glow→darkening brightness, aloft→grounded), and the ending offers a non-literal answer: peace through embracing multiplicity. A slight tilt toward stated moral (“not by escaping, but by embracing”) softens subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior material effectively. The thematic weave between power as escape and contact as cost reads true.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central question—what silence holds—is answered through concrete images (reversed Coltrane, vibrating hides, the coil) and the reweighted needle. Subtext often works via implication and touch, though the explicit line “Silence isn’t empty. It’s a container” tilts toward thesis. The ending meaningfully reframes silence as agency rather than lack. The resonance lingers, if with a trace of stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of bearing witness, institutional silence, and the ethics of solitude emerge through particulars (recorder, fog, ash‑storm, clinic). The final image reframes his vocation from prediction to testimony. However, explicit thesis statements (“defender of integrity”) narrow the resonance and flirt with moralizing, slightly dulling subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece harmonizes memory, extinction, and grief with the perfume as vessel, and the final city walk reweights prior images. However, the explicit thesis line (“grief wasn’t something to be feared; it was a testament to love”) tips into didactic clarity, softening subtext. The strongest resonance is in the images (crystal shadows, silver vapor), not the overt moral. Still, the revaluation of sensitivity reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thematic threads (time as tapestry, patterns vs choices, art vs escape) integrate through rope/wall imagery and the final spiral. However, the being’s last line states the thesis directly, undercutting subtext (Thematic Echo in the final paragraph). The resonance is still present in the image of the single thread, but the spelled-out moral blunts the afterglow. Complexity is hinted—fear in cutting vs endurance—but partially simplified by the explicit articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Recurring images (bowl, silence, ash) develop a coherent theme of space‑making over silence; the final communal act reframes loss without neat repair. The explicit line “It holds potential” edges toward thesis‑speak, but it’s diegetic and earned by the scene. The piece resists platitudinous wrap‑up by rooting hope in practice (offerings + music). Resonance lingers through the charged threshold silence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around the ethics of “half truths,” empathy tempered by cost, and the affectionate detachment of a craftsman. Recurring images (static, amber, the petal) work subtextually to frame control versus surrender. The line “Only as much as truth itself” risks aphorism yet earns its place within the scene’s moral calculus. The final ritualistic casing implies durability of compromise without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme—notice the “silent crew,” compassion as cyclical—emerges from acts and images (envelope relay, lila teaching boats) and resonates in the closing postcard. However, a few aphoristic lines tip into on‑the‑nose moralizing (“Compassion, like the sea, demanded patience”; “to uplift one was to uplift all”). Subtext is otherwise effective via the forged letter’s ambiguity. The final image lingers more for texture than argument.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.7)
    Kinship refracted through light is coherent and reprises in the ending as a shared “luminescent ache.” Some theme is stated outright (“Kael believed in webs of kinship”; “The tags…are a test”), which trims subtext. Still, the arbor’s symbolic function is earned and the final moment offers a quiet, resonant answer without moralizing. The piece invites reflection more than it argues.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Time as loom/borrowed threads and echoes born in pauses integrate with plot and final stance without sermonizing from the narrator. One line of overt thematics comes via the voice (“This is where echoes are born”), but it functions as world‑rule rather than moral. The final image reweights prior material (giant as guardian; artist as witness) and invites reflection. Resonance is strong, if a touch explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around preservation versus flow, and grief as a living fractal, emerging from concrete particulars (chipped glass, fissures, constellations pattern). The reprise of the brother’s maxim reframes the orchard and charges the ending. A few lines verge on abstract thesis (“The mathematics of emotion…wasn’t about solving equations”) but the images carry most weight. Resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of visibility/invisibility, stewardship, and memory as guidance cohere through images and action. Subtext in the “sapphire hush” and the hidden infrastructure suggests an ethics of quiet care. Final lines tilt toward explicit statement (“she was no longer invisible… a guardian, a keeper of secrets, and now, a messenger”), edging into mild moralizing. Still, the message-as-lifeline reweights the world with sincerity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thematic spine (transformation sustained by letting go) arises from concrete events and recurring images (linden leaf, vines). However, key lines state thesis outright, softening subtext in the final third. Resonance persists via the closing image, which reweights earlier material. A slightly less declarative end would heighten complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of renewal, possibility, and meaning shifting from “threshing” to “growing” arise organically from image and action. The note (“Meaning isn’t threshed. It’s grown.”) edges into explicit moralizing, softening subtext in the final third. Still, the final conversation-with-the-world image resonates. Recurring objects (duck, brooch, debris) support the thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of brightness/darkness as twins and the value of uncertainty arise organically from event and image and are reweighted at the end. Some lines voice the thesis a bit directly, dulling subtext (“true power lies…”). Still, the final sensory repricing carries resonance without sermonizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful and invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    Resonance grows from concrete particulars: object returns, communal memory, and a sound that reanimates the harbor. However, the last paragraph states the thesis explicitly (“history wasn’t a line, but a mosaic”), sliding into moralizing that blunts subtext. The piece still offers a felt repricing—patience as method yields communal repair. The thematic weave is coherent if slightly on‑the‑nose.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Recurring motifs (arrows, ticket, clock) support a theme of initiation and the redefinition of destination into choice. The final image (updated map, “Begin”) resonates, but the veiled woman’s line “The fortress isn’t a destination. It’s a choice.” states the thesis too directly, reducing subtext. The piece invites reflection without confusion, yet skirts didacticism at the climax. A touch more implication over declaration would deepen the after‑echo.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of resilience, inheritance of knowledge, and felt truth versus explanation emerge organically from the tile/Aelia parallels and whalesong motif. Subtext works best in the final constellation image of whales and stars. The line “some truths are best felt, not explained” edges into explicit moralizing, slightly flattening resonance. Overall, meaning accrues more from image than from statement.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of loneliness, refusal to say goodbye, and the peril/relief of renunciation emerge through image and action, culminating in a charged leap into “a symphony of possibilities.” The mirror reprices stasis without moralizing. The single declarative line (“They feed on our loneliness…”) edges toward thesis, but the final image displaces it with resonance. The immortality boredom thread coheres with the choice to risk fear over silence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of belief vs. “chemistry,” equity vs. control, and active waiting are coherent and recur through the ink pot and tactics. Subtext is present (fear and greed glimpsed via ink) but much is spoken outright (“No body. No crime. Just math.”; “we make sure no one ever has to fake their death again”), shading toward moralizing. The final note leans declarative instead of letting image carry resonance. Conceptual richness is there but undercuts subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Memory, invention, and stewardship cohere through objects and ritual, with the hum’s alignment reframing authorship as discovery. The final image bridges times but edges toward thesis in “guardian of memories,” softening subtext. Resonance arises from particulars (lamp, notepad) more than argument, which is good. The piece invites reflection but stops short of a complex moral calculus or a destabilizing repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motifs—tides, the poison label’s admonition, unread letters—cohere into a resonant meditation on erasure and the ethics of remembering. The ending reweights prior images (identity reclaimed against a hostile environment) without spoon‑fed moralizing. A few lines edge toward thesis‑statement clarity (“a conspiracy to silence Marcus Hale”), slightly flattening subtext. The final vow still lands emotionally through image and poise rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (out‑of‑tune stars, hum, 11:59→12:00) converge toward a resonant stance. However, the explicit thesis line—“The universal riddle… wasn’t meant to be decoded. It was meant to be felt.”—tips into stated moral and slightly blunts subtext. The piece otherwise earns its insight through concrete sound‑and‑object work. Letting the glowing note and humming exit carry the idea would strengthen it.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of order vs. chaos, gentrification, and communal voice emerge organically through graffiti as language and the chip as lineage. The final image reweights the premise toward collective resistance with hope. Some thesis‑y lines (“You can’t privatize that”) blunt subtext. Resonance is present but not piercingly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of care versus indifference and human trace outlasting utility accrue through the grain, the photo’s shadow, and the archivist’s later recognition. The grandfather’s maxim risks on-the-nose but is grounded by concrete action. The final resonance—truths existing without audience—arrives through particulars rather than sermon. The reprise years later deepens the moral weight without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of alternate “seeing,” trust in embodied craft, and mentorship surface organically through the basin method and Lira’s sensory focus. The lullaby and mist‑softened depot create a non‑didactic emotional aftereffect; “Listening’s a kind of seeing” hints subtext more than states a moral. The final charged poise—ongoing work lit by dawn—reweights prior images without sermonizing. Slight tidiness and comfort limit complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—maps as promises vs. truths, listening as a mode of understanding—emerges through recurring images and choices, not mere assertion. The phrasebook’s injunction (“listen”) and the condensation patterns thread into a final stance that invites pursuit over possession (blank page, drawing anew). One explicit line (“Maps are lies”) edges toward bald statement but is supported by the reconfigured practice and cost. The ending’s quiet, open image earns reflection without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of balance, harmony, and communal interdependence emerge organically through sound and structure. The final lines edge into moralizing (“Balance, once restored, demands nothing less”), dulling subtext by stating the thesis. Nevertheless, the closing image of the fork’s lingering tone reweights prior material effectively. The piece mostly trusts image over assertion until the last sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Recurring images (hush, scent, memory) build a clear meditation on control vs. release and the danger of embalming grief. The final image of the empty, radiant vial reweights prior material with quiet ache. However, explicit theme statements (“The hush was a prison…,” “not by trapping it, but by letting it go”) verge on moralizing and reduce ambiguity. Subtext remains, but some lines say what the images already show.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of authorship vs. inherited deceit accrues through images (lattice as pen; scuffs as time’s map) and culminates in “found himself before they found the bodies,” a strong conceptual repricing. Subtext in the father’s silent pride complicates the legacy without absolution. One line (“I’m not running. I’m writing.”) edges into thesis-stating, slightly diluting subtext. Overall resonance lingers via the final charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of debt, love braided with venom, and understanding over blood emerge organically from action and image. The final dawn and lingering laughter deliver a resonant repricing of what “repayment” means. One line skirts didacticism (“The debt is paid not in blood, but in understanding”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall, the images carry meaning beyond their surface without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ruin‑to‑reverence emerges organically through concrete acts of mending; “broken precedents” refracts into a practice of repair. The final image (tide pools refilling; plates emptied) offers a quiet, non‑didactic answer about devotion and remaking. Subtext in the sleepwalker tether and the hymn metaphor deepens the moral texture without sermonizing. It’s moving and earned, if safely pitched.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of diaspora, memory, and faith as voluntary practice emerge through concrete rites and labor, not sermonizing. The line reframing faith “as a choice, a thread” risks explicitness but is supported by earned image work. The ending’s “It’s not finished, but it’s enough” offers a resonant, provisional ethic that reweights the rebuild. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant motifs—chalk, surface mail, relic tools—organically grow a theme of endurance via analog traces. The grandmother’s message reframes the arcade as an archive, charging the final image. However, “Futuristic nostalgia wasn’t about clinging to the past—it was about reinventing it” states the thesis, thinning subtext. More could be implied through image rather than told.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Art as rebellion and truth’s nonlinearity recur through stitches, “blueprints of rebellion,” and the candle’s synchronizing effect; the final image reweights prior motifs. Some theme lines are spelled out (“The truth is never a straight line”), shaving subtlety. Subtext does operate in Zara’s seeming “decorations,” but the ending leans more toward affirmation than complex moral calculus. Resonance is present, if somewhat declared.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of resilience, unfinished grief, and the beauty of brokenness emerge through concrete acts (condensation letters that dissolve yet warm her chest). The shard’s transformation reweights meaning without expository summary. The spirits’ final message “Go. Live. Speak.” edges toward direct moralizing in the last paragraph, slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance is strong but not wholly free of explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme coheres: translation as alchemy, rebuilding from ruin, the ethics of listening, all carried by recurrent images that reweight at the end. Subtext in object work and gestures (general’s “It’s… sharp”) is effective. Some lines verge on moralizing (“The war ends when we choose to listen,” “The ocean heals in whispers”), slightly flattening complexity. The final image still resonates beyond a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: art as developer of latent history; communal memory vs. fog’s erasure; elegy to joy. The “exposed film” reprices the premise near the climax and informs the final stance. A few explicit lines (“She’d painted with hope…”) come close to telling, but the imagery carries most weight. The ending’s talisman and “What’s next?” echo land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of curiosity vs certainty and “nested awakenings” emerge organically via object, setting, and action. Some explicit thesis lines (“Certainty is a cage”) blunt subtlety even as they resonate. The final posture—waiting for the next pause—reweights prior images without didactic over-explanation. Emotional aftertaste is reflective and coherent with the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of covert alphabets under surveillance coheres with plant‑patterns and the “taxable thoughts” premise. Recurrences (moths, fractals, Fibonacci) support subtext about resilience and collective signal. However, explicit thesis lines (“we plant our truths where they can’t be erased”) verge on telling, reducing ambiguity. The ending resonates conceptually more than emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: shield vs bridge, wind‑carried offerings, and the “armistice” reframed as coexistence rather than cure. The final image (song carried by wind) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. A single explanatory sentence (“wasn’t an end—it was a beginning”) edges toward telling, but it’s earned by the sequence. Subtext consistently rides image and action rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme arises organically: memory as living practice, not embalming, embodied in the cracked tube’s new song. The dialogue risks thesis-stating (“You cannot resurrect the past,” “You’ve preserved the act of remembering”) but is earned by action and subtext. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity remains productive in the “nameless emotion” ascending.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    Language as harmony/“symphonies of truth” interweaves with trust and vows through specific archival beats. The final lines (“Even when we’re silent…,” “symphony of truth”) verge on didactic, slightly reducing subtext. Still, the thematic answer emerges via action—the choice to call—rather than a pure lecture. Recurring images (river, ink, promises) carry resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of balancing order/chaos and safety/feeling accrue through tools and method, culminating in the confession. The “encrypted compassion” conceit is strong, but the final paragraph edges toward stated moral (“power of compassion”) rather than a purely image-led reprise. Still, the chain’s reprise and the charged breath offer genuine resonance. Ambiguity remains gentle but present.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of preservation vs. erasure, truth vs. reinvention, and balance from chaos emerge organically via song, ledgers, and dust. “Preserve the echo” reweights from object to relational/temporal space (“space between”). The final image—walking out as a son with echoes blooming/withering—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity invites reflection while staying legible.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of sacred thresholds, necessary distance, and authorship of meaning arise from concrete acts (analyzing grain, choosing to stop searching, writing codes). The final page filling with her codes offers a resonant answer about agency and repricing of rules. A few lines flirt with thesis statements (“Sacred spaces are not places but gaps”), but they’re integrated via action. The emotional aftereffect is quiet, earned, and avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of belonging, endurance, and sea/sky reciprocity emerge through recurring images (light patterns, feather, shared breath). The final realization reweights prior details effectively. A line like “belonging was not about fitting into a preconceived mold” edges into explicit statement, trimming subtlety. Still, the closing return to ritual and feather carries resonance without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, forgetting, and release arise from particulars (crater glass regret, seeds, fog) and crystallize in the final repricing. A line like “Because some paths are meant to be forgotten” edges toward thesis‑statement clarity, though the pool imagery rescues it from sermonizing. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, reflective, not saccharine. Strong coherence, if not layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Control vs. chaos resonates through recurring images (bishop, clown, fountain), culminating in a communal repricing of randomness. Yet the dialogue explicitly states the thesis (“ordering the chaos,” “Randomness needs a conductor”), dulling subtext. The final tableau is affecting but edges toward declared theme rather than letting the image do all the work. A quieter, image‑led echo would deepen aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Yearning versus enforced amnesia, liberation versus rootedness, and the ethics of “stealing” from the cosmos thread through concrete acts, not pronouncements. The last image reweights prior motifs—the moon/sea pull, elective exile, “obsidian grace”—without moralizing. Complexity remains: she neither breaks the ban nor submits; she inhabits the charged in‑between. A touch less slogan‑ready phrasing would heighten subtextual subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—finding value in the mundane through light—is coherently carried by prisms, fog, and craft. However, the text leans into explicit statement (“The value in the mundane…,” and the notebook line), edging toward moralizing instead of trusting image. The final insight is earned by the ritual but lacks tension or counter‑pressure. Subtextual charge exists yet remains safe.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Time, listening, and transformation braid through objects and setting; the hourglass revalues guilt as compost (“ash nourished new life”). Thematic clarity arises mostly from images, with a few on‑the‑nose lines (“translate his pain into something universal”). The final image answers the question via acceptance without sermonizing. Resonance lingers but remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of crafted hope, cross‑reality kinship, and agency-through-design arise from particulars (threads dyed from timelines, vector patterns) rather than thesis statements. The final charged poise—listening as the sky “is about to speak”—reweights prior images without moralizing. Subtext hums in the tactile equation of intention and pattern. Slightly soft costs keep it just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of legacy as a living, shared burden arises organically through objects and acts (diaries, negative, ash, locket), not lecture. The final whisper—“You are the map”—reweights prior images and affirms her new stance without moralizing. Climate and memory entwine without reductive binaries. Slight risk of on‑the‑nose phrasing is offset by earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of grief, art as persuasion, and possibility beyond reflection accrue through recurring images (heartbeat, mirrors, refracted light) and culminate in a resonant acceptance. The closing reweights earlier material without moralizing: endurance and faith in unseen consequences. Subtext (sister’s presence as rhythm guiding the work) is woven through action, not declared. Ambiguity is purposeful, inviting reflection rather than confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.1)
    Thematic throughline—the price of redemption and flawed beauty of compromise—emerges through recurring images (clipboard scars, eroded gods) and the imperfect treaty. Occasional explicit statements edge toward telling (“not just ink on parchment”), but are supported by scene work. The final descent past the statues reweights the premise without a neat moral. Subtext lives in the fatigue, ambiguous language, and the enduring ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of progress-as-erasure, fetishized preservation, and twisted grace emerge through concrete motifs (egg, map, last water). The “echo” refrains with evolving weight, culminating in a measured acceptance. A slight tilt toward explicitness in “In the end, he preserved nothing tangible… And that… was enough” trims some ambiguity. Subtext remains active, resisting tidy moral balance.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of resistance through art and freeing suppressed voices emerge organically from the act of unlocking echoes. Subtext hums in images (charged silence, prismatic shadows), though lines like “her dance a middle finger to the world’s expectations” verge on declarative. The ending offers a quiet, resonant answer—carry the chorus against the lullaby—without moralizing. Greater ambiguity or complication in her defiance would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong thematic weave—mirrors vs crowns, light casting shadows—emerges through images and action, and the final campfire invitation resonates. However, explicit thesis statements (“Half-truths are the only kind worth telling”) flatten subtext at the apex. The story still invites reflection on ethics of representation without false balance. Resonance arises more from image than moral, which is good.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of ephemerality, witness, and humility are earned through concrete acts (knotting silk, embedding the wing) and a resonant final image. A few explicit statements (“transiently rooted existence,” “had been more than an object—a key”) edge toward telling. Subtext in the monarch touching the moth wing is strong and carries the piece. The quiet, reverent close lingers without a pat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres through specific images: transmuting fire’s old craft into light, memory as braid and song, erasure countered by illumination. The final tableau—names as notes that refuse to die—reweights prior details without moralizing. Subtext about archival violence and private absolution reads cleanly. A touch of reunion neatness softens ambiguity, but resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The integration theme (integration over escape; seed not failure) emerges through image chains (decay/rewilding, seal/compass), culminating in a resonant final walk. However, thematic statements are occasionally on‑the‑nose—“The directive is not a command, but a question” and “to transcend was not to escape, but to integrate”—diminishing subtext. The last paragraphs veer toward sermonizing legend (“travelers would speak...”), softening the earned ambiguity. The piece still leaves a lingering conceptual echo.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of curiosity vs. control, devotion encoded as mathematics, and covenant-with-self are organically seeded through action and objects. However, the voice’s aphoristic declarations (“The covenant isn’t sealed with gold or blood… It’s sealed with curiosity”) verge on on-the-nose, trimming subtext. The final image earns reflection without full moral neatness. The mirror/lens idea is strong and arises from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of release/acceptance is coherent, anchored by the broken‑mended pin and the sanctuary’s silence. However, it leans didactic at times (“Our bodies remember every hurt...”), reducing subtextual charge. The final acceptance that grace is temporary adds a humane, non‑tidy resonance. More implication and less explanation would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from action: boundaries vs. navigation, reflection as capture, craft as stewardship. The sextant’s inward turn reweights all prior material without sermonizing. Recurring images (frost, mirrors, breath) accrue and resonate in the final intent to “reflect the space between breaths.” The piece resists tidy moralizing while offering a coherent stance.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of persistence over patronage and seasonal/revisable vows cohere with the craft ritual and the mother‑daughter thread. Several lines verge on stating the moral (“wisdom wasn’t found in grand contracts…”) which dulls subtext. The ribbon’s reprise adds soft resonance. Emotional aftertaste is warm but controlled, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: legacy as choice, lived truth over curation, and perception as inheritance. The recurring object (cameo) and the orchard reweight meaning at the end. The line “You inherit what you choose to see” edges toward overt thesis but is supported by concrete turns. The final smile of “brightened disquiet” avoids moralizing while leaving a charged aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme—knowledge requiring acknowledged ignorance—emerges through events (cipher gaps, “Silence,” mirror door). The “renegotiate” motif reframes power and access without sermonizing. A touch of explicitness (“opens only to those who acknowledge their ignorance”) blunts subtext slightly. The final readiness “to listen” resonates without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs (thread, names, the card) accrue toward a coherent idea of memory as an act of making, culminating in the twin‑petaled flower. Subtext exists in the seamstress’s legacy passing into Lira’s hands. Yet explicit statements like “The garden isn’t a place—it’s a choice” and “Just freedom” tilt toward theme‑telling and tidy moral. Resonance lingers, but without the thorn of a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    The “fables of absence” evolve from motif to operational rule, culminating in a reframing of purpose. The final beam and return suggest a reweighted world rather than a neat moral. Some theme is told outright (“She wasn’t just an archivist”), softening subtext. Resonance lingers conceptually more than emotionally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of balance (hush and hum) emerges organically through objects and action; the bloom reweights “silence” as an active, earned state rather than absence. The line “She had not banished the noise, but she’d found the quiet within it” skirts direct statement yet is supported by the scene’s particulars. The ending’s conceptual repricing—noise as natural element—lingers without moralizing. Subtext operates in the acceptance of altered harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of hope as reconstructed meaning accrues through particulars (shards, song, retrocognition) and reweights at the end when the beacon’s purpose is reframed. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“coincidences… the universe’s way of whispering, Keep going”), edging toward moralizing but mostly earned by scene pressure. The survivors’ response deepens subtext: beauty as communal glue after silence. The partial return of stars preserves complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Memory versus identity coheres through concrete images (solid fog as “memory’s breath,” the hum, shadow‑bending) and resolves in a resonant, non‑literal answer. Thematic statements (“To sculpt identity…”) skirt explicitness but are supported by scene work, avoiding sermonizing. The final image reweights prior motifs effectively. A hair less telling in the reflection lines would add subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    Fire, filtering, and “gravity” recur and reconfigure meaning at the end. The line explicitly decoding “shadows” as “unlit potential” veers into on‑the‑nose moralizing, slightly dulling subtext. Nonetheless, the final image of chanting with purpose provides a resonant, non‑literal answer. The mentor motif threads theme through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of metamorphosis and the potency of liminal time emerges through image and choice, not only assertion. The cicada’s reprise reframes conflict as a practice of patience and translation, yielding a resonant answer. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“some transitions aren’t meant to be rushed”), slightly reducing subtext. Overall, complexity persists via the charged, open‑ended poise.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Loss becoming generative (silence as seed) resonates through concrete images, culminating in the sprout. The piece avoids overt moralizing for most of its length, though “by limiting her exposure…” risks didactic phrasing. Subtext of confinement vs permeability runs through the trellis/bunker counterpoint. The final repricing offers a quiet, reflective aftereffect without closing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme—silence as presence rather than absence—emerges organically from image chains (whistle → hush → storm glass) and culminates in a reweighted final image. However, explicit thesis lines in the closing (“not to silence the world, but to show it how to rest”) edge into moralizing, slightly flattening the resonance. Subtext otherwise operates well through tactile attention and refracted light imagery. The insight feels earned by particulars, if a touch neat.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres around purpose over power and identity as inheritance, culminating in the mirror‑throne realization. Recurring objects (ruby, murals) reweight meaning at the end. Some lines verge on moralizing (“The future wasn’t a place to fear—it was a story to write”), trimming subtext in favor of stated takeaway. Still, the final charged image sustains resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of connection through damage (“linking through scars”) and the peril of self‑protective isolation emerge from events, not lecture. The final image reweights prior material toward a hard‑won poise rather than a tidy cure. Occasional explicit statements risk over‑articulation, but the subtext of breath versus suffocation largely carries the weight. Resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of pressure translation, resilience after exploitation, and revaluing “diamonds” emerge through concrete beats and images. The final repricing lands, but “Diamonds are a metaphor” states the thesis too plainly, blunting subtext. The pyramid‑scheme past subtly informs the moral calculus without sermonizing. Resonance lingers, yet complexity narrows at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of power, silence, and chosen erasure emerges organically from the gramophone ritual and the letters. The final reweighting—legacy as sacrifice not failure—resonates with prior images. A few lines verge on moral summary (“The dynasty’s end was not a tragedy but a rebirth”), softening subtext. Still, the object‑driven reveal earns the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Patterns, strings, theater, and alchemy knit into a coherent meditation on control vs surrender. The program’s evolving text reframes meaning across beats, culminating in the inscription. One explicit statement (“The shape of possibility was not a thing to be captured”) edges toward on-the-nose, trimming subtlety. Nonetheless, the final image reweights prior material without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of erasure, inheritance, and the ethics of witnessing emerge from particulars (dust language, the war‑dated button) rather than sermon. The ending reweights “unknown histories” into an ethic of care without over‑stating it. One line edges toward articulation (“magnify the small kindnesses…”) but is supported by scene work. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Memory versus erasure, legacy, and resistance cohere through the key, the puddle-map, and the footage of the Council. “Indifference kills faster than bullets” leans direct but is supported by action, not speechifying. The final silvered lagoon and warmed key reweight meaning without moralizing. Subtext of coded networks and inherited duty runs cleanly under the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around silence as action, secrecy’s cost, and the ethics of withholding truth; the negative-space method literalizes it elegantly. Subtext runs through acoustics, absence, and refracted light rather than lecture. A small ding for the near-thesis line (“some truths were meant to stay hidden”) that edges toward moralizing. The closing reprise still invites reflection without closing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Folklore as language and “bridge between seen and unseen” coheres with events; the dust’s dissolution reframes belief as action. Some lines edge into on-the-nose theme statements (“She had always known the folklore was more than tales”), softening subtext. The final charged poise—readying to act—leaves a resonant humility before a larger system. The capped escalation tempers the thematic afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Images (spinning needle, swirling leaves, broken clocks) support the theme of befriending uncertainty and letting mechanisms “turn freely.” The ending offers a resonant answer through the clockwork garden. Some lines slide toward thesis-stating (“It was a mirror,” journal aphorisms), softening subtext. Nonetheless, the conceptual repricing is coherent and emotionally honest.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs—names as weight, kintsugi, the foundry—interlock to produce a resonant answer: acceptance of cracks and the cost of identity. The ending reweights the story’s questions without a tidy moral. Some lines state theme a touch directly, slightly reducing subtext. Overall, the piece invites reflection with a luminous, regret‑tinged cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic integration is strong—truth as a biting key, laughter as translatable only through honest cost—carried by recurring images (tooth, harp, echo). Subtext lives in the non‑sound of laughter arriving as feeling. A few lines verge on explicit moral (“Healing…was not a destination”), slightly reducing subtlety. Overall resonance lingers without didactic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme coheres: mercy refigured from quantification to practice; the strap, UV “penance,” and fractals reweight meaning at the end. Subtext largely works in images (spores halo, tree’s pulse syncing), though one explicit thesis line (“Mercy isn’t a equation. It’s a choice.”) edges toward didactic. The final walk deepens resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively as a question, not an answer.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonance arises from particulars (hidden details, overlooked histories), and the final image reweights “anchor” toward release. However, explicit thematic statements (“Anchors of intuition aren’t just for holding on…”) and the concluding moral-like sentence dilute subtext. The insight is earned but slightly told. Ambiguity remains, yet the stated thesis trims its edge.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Cracks in the façade” evolves from literal fissures to emotional fissures, linking repair, memory, and release without heavy moralizing. A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“weren’t just physical—they were emotional, historical”), but the photograph and canceled tickets earn the insight. The final choice reweights “repair” as an ethic. The resonance lingers more as hush than shock.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of order vs. awakening, memory, and the cost of transformation emerge through recurring images (frost, press rhythms, whisper). The final reweighting—patrons become architects; the “cage” is opened—resonates. However, the line “The rupture was not destruction but transformation” edges toward stating the thesis, slightly flattening subtext. Overall, the piece invites reflection without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Memory, erasure, and the danger of reflection are embedded in images (mirrors, fungi as archive, palimpsest). The shard’s reweighting and the public’s awakening produce earned resonance. A few lines verge on thesis statement (“They buried it”; “what mirrors hide”), trimming subtlety slightly. Overall, the thematic arc feels organic to the actions and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres—decay as preservation; truth as a precondition for healing—and the final image reweights the premise. However, several thesis‑like lines (“It’s a mirror,” “Midnight steals light…”) state meaning rather than letting subtext carry it, especially near the end. The covenant’s creed and the lullaby/truth swap do real thematic work. Less overt moralizing would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: land’s memory, industry’s silence, and the ethics of not knowing culminate in a resonant acceptance. Subtext operates through image (air as archive, mountain/moth indifference), with minimal moralizing. The line “You were looking for the place where explanations fail” leans declarative but is supported by scene work. The final hum reprises and deepens the inquiry without neat closure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.0)
    Resonance grows from the driftwood maps and the slide’s covenants, culminating in the sculptures-as-timelines insight. However, several explicit theme statements (“to scaffold complexity with simplicity,” “The island’s complexity wasn’t a burden; it was a tapestry”) blunt subtext. The ending reweights prior images but edges toward moralizing. Subtext works best when the grandmother says, “The alliances hold, but only if you remember.”

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme integrates through images (roots/celestial charts/heartbeats; the negative space) and culminates in a resonant, non‑literal answer. The communion with darkness reframes defiance elegantly. A slightly expository line (“Flowers bloom at night not in defiance, but in communion.”) states the thesis rather than leaving it wholly in image. Subtext around secrecy, legacy, and fear of being seen (Thorn) enriches the close.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Memory versus erasure resonates through action (blank diary; sacrificed codex) rather than sermonizing, though “History’s written by the victors” telegraphs theme. The ending reframes victory as delay—an honest, unsentimental stance. Subtext around selfhood fraying under retrocognition enriches the premise. Some thematic statements read on-the-nose, dulling the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: civilization as an act of collective recall; tools as lenses, not containers; endurance over spectacle. The final image reweights prior material—rebirth from memory instead of matter—without moralizing. Subtext (rejecting easy alchemy for conceptual labor) is consistent and avoids tidy aphorisms. A slightly stronger articulation of personal cost would deepen resonance further.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motifs (roots/leaves, breath, hum/silence) accrue into a resonant meditation on memory and awakening. The final stance (“be ready … to listen”) reweights the earlier material without neat moralizing, though the direct line “not about disaster, but awakening” slightly over‑states the insight. Subtext travels through sound and botany rather than abstraction. The afterimage lingers with credible ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of entropy, preservation, and paradox braid cleanly through seeds, acorn, and the vortex, culminating in the sapling. A few explicit statements (“The vortex inheritance was a dance of decay and rebirth”) edge toward telling. The final image reweights prior images without moralizing. Resonance persists, though complexity is managed more by image than by hard ethical calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of listening over noise integrates with craft choices (acoustics shaping weather), culminating in a harmonized stasis. However, it is partially delivered in on-the-nose dialogue (“You’re favoring listening over noise”; “conductor/maestro”), which trims subtext. The final image carries resonance without moralizing, but the preceding explicit statements reduce ambiguity. The conceptual repricing of her role still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme (power in vulnerability; listening as work) emerges through concrete images and the lantern/stardust reprise. A few explicit lines (“find strength in vulnerability,” “I just listened”) edge toward statement but are earned by scene. The end reweights science vs. spirit without sermonizing. Ambiguity lingers productively in Veyra’s silence.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: the covenant between living and dead, language as duty, and the burden of unspoken words. Recurring images (hives, dust, stained glass) reweight at the end when speech shatters the vessel and releases memory. The “Speak” directive is somewhat on‑the‑nose, softening subtext. Still, the closing image earns reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of entropy, memory-in-objects, and grief cohere through specific events rather than mere assertion, with the urn fragment bridging loss and wonder. The final repricing (“mosaic of moments”) resonates, though one or two lines verge on thesis articulation. Subtext operates in the wife’s flicker and the objects’ re-personification. The piece avoids tidy moralizing and leaves productive ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of impermanence, tending, and beauty-in-the-incomplete recur through concrete acts and images. However, final moralization (“the act of creation mattered more than its permanence... deepest beauty”) states the thesis rather than letting the images carry it, dulling resonance. Subtext does operate in places (fisherman’s silent nod; heron taking flight). The closure still lands, but would be stronger with less declarative summation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of bridge‑building, consent, and pain as language emerge organically through action and image. “You build walls… we build boxes… this is a bridge” risks stating the thesis, but it’s dramatized and reweighted by the later acceptance and the final sigh. The closing hum of stone and wire offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece interrogates manufactured belonging vs. emergent homecoming, and the ending reweights prior images into “mirrors” with a resonant, non-literal answer. Kael’s line about convergence risks mild didactic clarity but the image work (amber mist, charged statues, lingering quiet) does the thematic lifting. The final laugh “like breaking glass” adds an edge of cost. Complexity holds without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, repair, and harmony beneath ruin emerge through action (seed work guided by birds) rather than sermon. “Submerged concord” reweights by the end via “Khalis” and the reef‑bone fertilizer—past damage as nourishment. The final whisper avoids didacticism, functioning as a personal credo. Resonance is strong without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Symbols (grooves, wind, leaf) weave a coherent theme of memory as connective tissue, culminating in the communal display. Some subtext hums (reading “silence,” distance as currency), but the piece undercuts itself by stating the final answer—“love”—and by Jeb’s explicit line about “tinted revelations.” The resonance lingers, yet the moral is voiced rather than fully inferred. Thematic complexity is present but tidied.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme develops organically through the compass and ritual: “true north” recast as practice under uncertainty. A few lines tread near thesis-statement territory, but the images (ink smudge when the glimpse ends; a warming compass) carry most of the weight. The final step through “golden and thick” light offers a non-literal answer consistent with prior beats. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of wonder vs. control and trading the familiar for the mysterious emerge organically through the swaps and crafted replicas. However, the final paragraph states the moral outright (“sometimes the greatest wonder was the courage to swap the familiar for the mysterious”), dulling subtext. The sundial and chess motifs could have carried the resonance without declaration. The conceptual reweighting is present but over‑explained.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thematic braid (pawns as everyday actors; small gestures shaping history; performance vs. survival) emerges through image and action. However, the final paragraph states the thesis (“history wasn’t written by kings or queens…”) rather than letting the reweighted image carry it, introducing mild sermonizing. Subtext is otherwise strong in the pawn erasure and reconfiguration sequence. A more image-led last beat would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    The feather/stone motifs evolve to reframe “home” as an act of remembering, with the final image repricing prior material. Subtext of bearing others’ memories and transforming pain into craft is earned by events, not asserted. However, thematic lines voiced by the mother and Lirael edge toward statement, tempering ambiguity. Still, resonance lingers through the charged objects and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    The weaving motif binds fate, guilt, and forgiveness, culminating in the “woven hush” that reweights the premise. Thematic clarity is strong, with images doing much of the work; a couple of explicit sentences verge on telling (“The prince’s death wasn’t his fault alone”). The final image reframes mistakes as moves, not endings, without sermonizing. Resonance lingers via object‑driven subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres (truth as prism; forgiveness as non‑submission) and images earn resonance (inked “Forgive,” refracted light, echoes shifting). However, direct thesis statements recur (“Truth isn’t a blade…”, “rituals are just poems…”) and culminate in an explicit moralizing line about control, dulling subtext. The piece still invites reflection through its final image, but it leans on telling.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres around kintsugi as choosing to mend rather than erasing cracks, refigured through the charm and quilts. The ending reweights earlier images (constellations/quilt pattern) effectively. However, several explicit theses (“Kintsugi isn’t about perfection. It’s about surviving.”) reduce subtext, especially in the final third. The piece would gain by letting images carry a bit more of the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—beauty found in fracture and “temporary eternity”—emerges organically through objects and place, culminating in the charged pool and the act of drawing what he’d never painted before. However, the final paragraph states the moral almost verbatim (“to find beauty in the fractures, to hold onto the temporary as if it were eternal”), blunting subtext. The images themselves are strong enough to carry the idea without the line. The aftertaste is still tender and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme (“whispers slip through cracks”) is earned through action and image—scent, hum, cork glow, and the village’s wordless reception—rather than abstract moralizing. The quiet ending reweights the premise without didactic closure. One line from Thalos states the thesis a touch plainly, but it’s grounded in character and scene. The final image lingers with emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Loss, memory, and “reverse migration” are embodied through concrete acts (hair woven, censer foot’s weight, choir of navigation chants) rather than stated morals. The ending reweights the premise: her technical craft doubles as ritual, and the dead routes return as both map and chorus. Ambiguity stays purposeful without confusion. Slightly more friction between want and cost could deepen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.9)
    Compelling ideas—truth as weapon, empathy as hazard, safety as collective practice—arise from particulars (eye, ledger, market truffles). Yet the theme is sometimes stated rather than earned (“safety isn’t just a feeling—it’s a choice”; “The truth… could be a weapon”). Subtext in the eye’s paradox is strong, but final moralizing blunts resonance. A quieter closing image would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant thematic weave—ownership of guilt, the ethics of memory, isolation as carrying what isn’t yours—arises from images and action. The reprise of the boutonnière reweights the story as hope rather than loss. A slight tilt toward explicit moralization (“Redemption… couldn’t be borrowed”) blunts subtext. Still, the closing image and stated motive harmonize without neat over-closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Images (maps, ants, chip, doorway) echo and reweight at the end to argue for self‑navigation and earned choice. The final paragraph’s articulation (“not a place to escape but a mirror”) edges into stated thesis rather than fully letting the images carry it. Still, the sunflower garden and return march create a resonant aftereffect. Thematic complexity is honest but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme coheres (fear vs. disenchantment; self as wound) and recurs via the bleeding starlight image, reweighted at the end. However, the figure states the thesis too explicitly (“You are not disenchanted. You are afraid.”), reducing subtext. The final choice still resonates without overt moralizing; the imagery carries much of the weight. More implication and fewer declarations would deepen aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of revaluation, perspective, and letting the object “speak” emerge through concrete acts (placing the shell, listening to resonance) rather than sermonizing. The final image reweights failure as a resource—credible conceptual repricing. One line edges toward on‑the‑nose (“The palette…isn’t just for mixing perspective”), but the scene earns it. Resonance lingers without false symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Imagery and action develop a theme of memory, self‑multiplicity, and earned reconfiguration. However, the ending articulates the thesis a bit directly (“nostalgia wasn’t a curse—it was a compass”), softening subtext. Even so, the final idea that he is “building the past” reweights prior material meaningfully. Ambiguity remains without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    Resilience, redemption, and the humanizing of objects emerge organically through concrete particulars. However, lines like “She’d unveiled an ordinary miracle” and “humanizing the past” verge on thematic telling. The final image (chimes, lifting fog, shared losses) resonates without needing the explicit statement. Subtext in the object’s return does much of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Images (breath, shedding, scars as language) interlock to produce a coherent theme of transmuting pain through poised risk. The crow‑quill talisman and breath motif return to charge the ending. However, the final lines drift into explicit thesis (“to transform pain into power, one must first shed the lies...”), which blunts subtext. More reliance on image over statement would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Imperfect miracles” and regret are enacted, not explained: Clara’s currency, the flawed conduit, and the imperfect completion give the piece a coherent moral texture. The final image reweights silence vs. sound, memory vs. letting go, without sermonizing. Subtext in the sister’s line (“You left me here… in the silence”) powerfully triangulates guilt, place, and music. No platitudes; the ambiguity of cost (reconnection coinciding with loss outside) lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme coheres—truth as process, unification through embracing internal chaos—and images support it (shifting definitions, moving mural, hush reprise). However, several lines state the thesis outright (“truth was not a destination…”), dampening subtext. The ending resonates conceptually more than emotionally. The dictionary’s blank pages are a strong, nearly sufficient image on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motifs (blade/key, silence, counting, stars) braid toward a cohesive answer, and the closing image reweights prior detail. However, the explicit thesis (“clocks didn’t measure time…They measured longing”) states what the images already imply, dulling subtext. The emotional aftereffect is tender but slightly explained. A more image‑led final turn would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of surrender versus control is integrated but often stated outright (“physics of letting go,” “Only those who approached without aggression could pass”), muting subtext. The final insight feels earned yet partially told, with minimal counterpressure to complicate the takeaway. Strong image work (radiant pulse; gentle spore rain) provides resonance. A touch less thesis‑speak would deepen ambiguity and afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (lantern, maps, “contradictions”) cohere into a theme about ordered chaos and responsibility; her choice reweights risk as care. However, Greer’s line “Contradictions aren’t traps. They’re mirrors.” states the thesis too directly, dampening subtext. The final intention to visit her father earns tenderness without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: wrong numbers as conduits for grief, care, and beginning‑from‑ending, embodied in particulars (baker’s recipe for grief; clown’s oranges). The glass disc’s “mirror” realization reweights prior beats without over‑explaining. One phrase edges toward thesis‑speak (“shown them how to turn endings into beginnings”) but is supported by scene work. The emotional aftereffect is quiet, earned, and not sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: memory as currency, ritual adapting to context, and the sovereignty of small moments. The final repricing—“the covenant’s weight…was in the now”—reweights prior images. Occasional explicit statements (“The regenerated covenant wasn’t a thing to be won but a story to be told”) flirt with telling over showing, trimming some subtlety. Still, the images carry honest resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Reciprocity and rumor chains knit theme to action, and the final repricing (“loneliness is a language”) reweights the premise in a resonant way. However, the conductor’s explicit articulation borders on thematic statement, reducing subtext. The moon rock’s transformation into connection imagery earns emotional aftereffect without sentimentality. Ambiguity remains purposeful: a conversation catalyzed, not a cure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme arises organically: translation between worlds (sound/feel, map/emotion, grief/hope) culminates in “the place where feeling becomes seeing.” Recurring objects and phenomena (ring, melody, inverted river) accrue meaning rather than serving as ornaments. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing and leaves a resonant afterglow. Slight neatness of reunion tempers ambiguity but doesn’t flatten complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant theme of collaboration vs. control arises through the pen-as-listening and the web imagery; the seed motif circles back nicely. However, lines like “The future isn’t yours to write. It’s yours to witness.” state the thesis overtly, edging into sermon. The ending’s “strange comfort” and charged pen hum avoid sentimentality and keep an aftertaste of earned repricing. Subtext exists but is sometimes voiced instead of implied.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around silence as presence, memory, and translation; the camera and hand‑signs enact this rather than merely state it. The “silence is a canvas” line edges toward thesis but is supported by concrete beats. The final image (camera to heart + dawn sadness) reweights the night without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture, listening, and communal recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of translation vs. destruction and archive-as-garden are woven through images and tactics, culminating in a charged redefinition of purpose. Subtext generally does the work, though a few lines edge toward telling (“not as a thief or an arsonist, but as a gardener”). The final image reweights earlier symbols without sermonizing. Resonance lingers through the grandmother connection.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of communal memory, refigured trauma, and agency through art emerge organically from action and imagery (vibration, shared rhythm). The final cadence reweights the premise toward hope without neat resolution. However, explicit thesis lines (“entanglement isn’t a curse; it was a gift”) and didactic dialogue slightly blunt subtext. Subtlety in those moments would elevate resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Whispers vs shouts threads actions (listening, humming) and the final image, but the story states its thesis (“The labyrinth didn’t need maps. It needed whispers.”), dulling subtext. The maps and the coin offer resonant motifs that reweight meaning at the end (the labyrinth remembers), achieving a modest CR. Complexity is present but contained; the piece leans into aphorism at the close. Thematic afterglow lingers, though not at elite intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    Resonance arises from image (light in darkness), but explicit statement (“core concept of silent empathy,” “motivation was clear”) dulls subtext. The final image reweights the premise subtly, yet the piece occasionally tells the theme rather than letting it emerge. Emotional aftertaste is gentle, not piercing. Less moralizing diction would heighten lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of second thoughts, choice, and small rebellions emerge through chess and the window displays, culminating in a resonant image of seeds taking root. Subtext often carries the load via the unspoken‑words motif and the grotto’s “language” of silence. A few explicit lines (“Rebellions start small,” “Messages about choice”) verge on thematic echo. Still, the final cadence reweights prior images without sliding into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of liberation through relinquishment emerges via recurrent images (edge/fringe, deep vs shallow, scrimshaw’s command) and reweights at the end. However, several lines verge on moralizing (“She was free,” “The island hadn’t been a prison but a mirror”), undercutting subtext. The images themselves do the work; fewer explicit statements would heighten resonance. The emotional aftereffect is clear but slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of grief’s remaking and beauty in flaws emerge organically through craft actions and inherited sayings. The bouquet/spoon pairing provides a resonant, non‑literal answer. A few lines verge on thesis (“Lightness… is not the absence of darkness”), softening subtext into statement. Still, the final cadence carries earned weight from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of sacred/profane blur, art as world-making, and liberation after prohibition emerge organically from images and acts. The final threshold recognition resonates, but “the world is ours to reshape” tilts toward thematic declaration in the last paragraph, dulling subtext. The piece invites reflection, but complexity is cushioned by assured success. Strong coherence; avoid overt moralizing to elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme (beauty in imperfection; magic in the sideways view) emerges via the glass bird/phoenix memory, the withered rose/moth, and the final painting made from cracks. Subtext works in the bartered awakenings economy and Marla’s moral calculus. A brief on-the-nose line (“Beauty isn’t in perfection”) reduces subtlety near the peak. The ending’s “I’ve just started to see” offers a resonant repricing without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme (connection as felt, not engineered) emerges through object use and embodied listening rather than mere assertion, though a few lines state it plainly (“We keep questioning”). The scratch-as-groove reveal reweights prior imagery with satisfying resonance. The ending’s quiet refusal of machine dominance invites reflection without overexplaining, but the moral tint is lightly declared via dialogue. Subtext hums; complexity is present but not thorny.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Recurring images (stencil, light, origami, observatory) accrue to a coherent theme of grief as transformation. The final reframing—light refracted, not diminished—feels earned by specifics (coordinates, “genuinely artificial” bridge). A few sentences verge on overt thesis articulation (“art of mending what cannot be unbroken”), slightly diluting subtext. Still, resonance lingers through image rather than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme coheres around quantifying grief/desire into culture’s skeleton; scars as maps is a potent, earned image. Some thesis-leaning lines (“Not hope—understanding”; “I reverse engineer chaos…”) state what the images already convey, slightly flattening subtext. The final shift from survival to rebuilding resonates and reweights prior motifs. Ambiguity lingers productively in the loft’s “memory” without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant images support themes of knowledge, danger, and choice, culminating in the seed/rebirth reframing. However several lines state thesis directly (“The end of innocence…”, “truth … the only thing worth fighting for”), edging into moralizing and diluting subtext. The final image still carries charge.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of hope’s mutability and definition emerge through stones, spiral, and the library’s re-titling—an earned, resonant reweighting. Subtext surfaces in the shadow “wanting definition,” but Thalos states philosophy overtly (“Metamorphosis of hope”), edging toward didactic. Still, the final image of motes settling on shelves delivers emotional aftereffect without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on preservation vs. change more than it argues a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.1)
    Resonance grows from particulars—the chameleon’s survival strategy reframed as a moral template—and the tail returns charged at the end. However, the final paragraph states the moral explicitly (“Compassion wasn’t a liability. It was the reason to keep going.”), tipping into sermonizing and reducing the afterglow of image‑led meaning. Subtext otherwise works through image and labor. The piece would be stronger letting the dawn and tail do the arguing.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of grief, memory, and scars as narrative are integrated through concrete images (scar ache, coffee rings, shattering glass). Some lines verge on aphorism (“Stories are written in scars”), but the accumulated experiences justify the insight. The final reweighting honors loss without erasing it, avoiding sentimentality. Subtext operates through objects and environment more than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of archived desire, memory as geography, and the ethics of noticing arise through particulars (hidden letters in canisters, lilac scent, Casablanca). Subtext lives in the objects’ afterlives and the idea of a “theater of light,” rather than overt speech. One line edges toward explicitness (“The unused love wasn’t lost; it was just waiting...”), slightly flattening resonance. The final image still reweights the premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    Recurrences (stardust, aurora, rest vs listening) accrue to a coherent theme about attention unlocking creativity. However, “Creativity isn’t trapped. It’s waiting.” states the thesis too baldly, blunting subtext. The final image still reweights prior material effectively via action and image rather than moral. Ambiguity remains generative without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around imagination’s survival after ecological loss and choice at the liminal moment. Recurring images (clock, wave function, sparks) reweight at the end without moralizing. The coat of light as mantle implies responsibility, adding resonance. Slight neatness in the dream awakening tempers complexity but doesn’t flatten it.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of coexistence (machine/nature), memory, and surrender emerges through image patterns and the charged object. The final empty‑pocket return reframes inheritance as seed rather than keepsake—a crisp conceptual repricing. However, the father’s line (“to keep it that way, you must let go”) verges on thematic stating, slightly flattening subtext. The resonance lingers but could trust image over dictum.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: courage as a repeated choice enacted in guiding others, not a destination to find. Recurring images (star stamp, twilight, lullaby) reweight at the end without needing exposition. A few lines flirt with thematic didacticism (“Courage isn’t a lake to be drained”), though they are grounded in action. The final vigil stance offers a resonant non‑literal answer to the story’s question.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of safety vs. silence and communal pacts emerge coherently through the bolt and the staircase “map.” However, the line “Safety is not the absence of sound. It is the courage to listen.” states the thesis overtly, dampening subtext. The “garden not a cage” image is strong but edges toward tidy moral. Resonance lingers, though a touch more implication over declaration would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Truth versus illusion and the ethics of unmasking converge in the image of a “graceful collapse.” The thematic echo is enacted (not just stated) when the construct empties and the sky opens. Veyra’s line “Behold the truth” edges toward literalizing the theme, slightly thinning subtext. Still, the final cadence reweights the world convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of repair vs. transformation and rhythm as resistance emerge through images (tapping, flickering islands, path reappearance) rather than speechifying. The final cadence reframes the ban as a beginning and the oceans as cyclically rewriting reality, offering a resonant non‑literal answer. Some lines edge toward overt statement (“The fossil fuel ban had been a beginning, not an end”), softening subtext. Nonetheless, the closing image of light‑etched paths holds.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of meaning-in-chaos and pattern versus drift arise organically from the stones and alignment, culminating in a communal reawakening. A few thesis-forward lines (“madness is just clarity without a filter,” “The rebellion isn’t just about fighting. It’s about meaning.”) blunt subtextual power. Still, the final image converts rhetoric into event. The opera glasses and hum recast “mess” as signal without sermonizing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme (tradition vs. evolution; destiny as cultivated rather than imposed) emerges organically from concrete actions and the embryo’s redefinition. Yet the final paragraphs veer into overt thesis statements (“Tradition would evolve, not die; The future wasn’t…to fear or control”), reducing subtext. The imagery itself was sufficient to carry the idea. Resonance lingers, but the moral is somewhat told rather than earned purely through implication.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of anchoring hope in realism emerge through concrete acts and recurring objects and culminate in a reweighted final image. Some direct statement (“I want to anchor optimism in realism”) slightly overstates what the scene has already earned. Still, the piece resists sentimentality by acknowledging ongoing cost. The lighthouse-keeper parallel enriches the subtext without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through acts (tearing, grinding, weaving) rather than lecture, reframing fate/control into reweaving meaning. Recurring images (threads, lamp/candle light, lens void) shift valence at the end. The rhetorical questions risk overt statement, but the closing line resonates as earned rather than moralizing. Subtext of craft vs. belief and surrender vs. order hums beneath the images.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of time as language/fragment and crisis as pause emerge through elders’ warning, the child’s “breath” line, and Lira’s method, then reweight at the door. The myth/real “Tower of Hours” reframes belief versus forgetting without sermonizing. Insight is earned through tactile acts rather than abstraction, though one or two aphoristic lines brush the edge of statement. The ending image invites reflection without closing meaning too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of censorship, institutional memory, and moral courage are integrated through concrete actions (revival as civil disobedience). Yet the piece leans on stated thesis moments—“Because the truth matters” and “the revolution began”—which flatten subtext. The most resonant image is the thawing chamber reweighting “frozen truths,” but the ending explains its meaning instead of trusting image. Complexity is present but undercut by near‑moralizing closure lines.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ballast/quiet paradox and the retooling of violence into cultivation converge into a resonant answer. However, lines like “The farm was more than a sanctuary; it was a manifesto” and “even in ruin, life persists” edge into stated thesis, dulling subtext. The strongest thematic work is in the reweighted objects and final whisper. The piece invites reflection without confusion, but avoids the hardest ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Translation, listening, and the cost of harmony thread the piece and culminate in a quiet, resonant repricing: order returns because something sacred is surrendered. Recurring images (rail spike, zigzags, hums) shift meaning at the end, now holding loss rather than mere signal. The final single note functions as earned, unsentimental grace. No moralizing; ambiguity about whether Kael’s success is a wound or a cure lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of truth, inheritance, and gravity recur through concrete images (black hole vs. sunlight, orbits of regret, the charged nib) and culminate in a reweighted final stance. A few lines edge toward statement (“Truth…wasn’t a destination—it was a compass”), but they’re earned by prior particulars. The grandfather’s “see beyond the horizon” ties legacy to ethical seeing without moralizing bloat. Resonance lingers beyond the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of silencing pain, translating dissonance, and rewriting guilt into forgiveness arise organically from objects and actions. The “baby cries into silence” motif reweights in the nursery, and the final hush resonates without overt moralizing. Some thematic articulation is on-the-nose via Elara’s exposition. The closing image (amber’s glow gone, lab silent) lands as a quiet conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of unlearning as making space and meaning found through collaboration emerge organically from action, images, and the hush’s “breathing.” A few explicit declarations (“It’s a language”) skate close to telling, but the bell toll and reconfigured silence give resonance. The final shift reweights prior motifs without tidy moralizing. Subtext flows through the hush, patterns, and risk to disrupt them.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of transformation versus erasure coheres through objects and acts; the last image reweights memory as an act of mercy. The artisan/daughter vision grounds the philosophy in particulars. A few lines verge on thesis (“He would rename the city”), but the closure returns to image rather than moral. Resonance lingers without neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Resonant themes of reprise, possibility, and communal repair emerge from the echo/dance mechanics and the coin’s transformation. The final blank coin reweights the Fool’s journey into a collective arc without moralizing. Subtext in scent, sound-color, and period echoes gives depth. Slight neatness in resolution prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of precision vs noise and self‑attention vs engineered shortcuts coheres through geode/somatic markers imagery. Some lines slide into thesis‑speak (“They don’t illuminate pathways—they bulldoze them”), muting subtext. The final image reframes connection as inward first, then shared, without a tidy moral. Resonance lingers via the “alignment” moment linking body memory to method.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of memory as ecology, objects as bridges, and stewardship through translation emerge organically from action and image (timeline colors, spores, dawn). A few lines verge on thesis-stating (“The unknown had found its voice”), but they’re supported by concrete beats. The ending reweights earlier material: mapping becomes translating with a social cost implied. Ambiguity is gentle but meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of history’s weight and malleable prophecy are coherent and threaded via image (buttons, sand, canyon voices). However, the jar’s pronouncement and the closing generalization (“The future isn’t a line…”) tilt into stated moral, reducing subtext. Resonance survives through the final image and motif weave. Insight feels true, if a shade over‑articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Images (thaw, mist, gull, sunlight) organically echo a theme of layered truth and renewal. The pillbox and “unused courage” motif reweight at the end without didacticism, though a few lines flirt with stating the thesis. Emotional aftereffect is quietly resonant. Complexity is maintained despite the uplifting close.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs (palimpsest, needle, river) cohere around clarity through stripping—theme emerges organically via image. However, the thesis (“to distill complexity into essence”) is stated repeatedly, edging toward didactic echo. The final recognition (promise safe here; he carries a layer forward) resonates without a tidy moral. Subtext in silence with the ferryman is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The themes of kindness as a structuring force and light as a medium for memory emerge organically through objects and action (glass, sunflowers, bees), culminating in a reweighted worldview. The line “to shape time, one must first tend to the light within it” verges on explicit moralizing but is earned by prior particulars. Subtext in the beekeeping oasis—community, care, and their loss—enriches the conceptual frame without sermonizing. The final quiet act (setting up her wheel) resonates as praxis over proclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs (petals, light, rhythm, harbor) accrue to a clear theme of tending persistence amid loss. The final image—Mara closing her eyes as moonlight floods—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. A couple lines verge on declared theme (“measuring light,” “after the final petal drops”), but they’re integrated through action. The story avoids moralizing and invites reflection on small acts as defiance against decay.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of coexistence with history and self-definition resonate through recurring images (hum, tides, reflective sundial) and culminate in self-authorship. A line edges toward thesis-statement (“To be atomically reflective meant...”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the spiral and the new chambers reweight prior material without preaching. The emotional aftertaste is earned and contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Recurring images (spiral, pond, orbs, thrush) thread a coherent theme of secrecy transformed through sharing. However, the line “The thread that connects all things isn’t a secret. It’s the courage to share it.” states the thesis outright, dulling subtext. The final resolve resonates but edges sentimental. Subtext otherwise operates through image and action effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of power, harmony vs dissonance, and communal fracture emerge through action and image. The antagonist’s dictum “Power is a river” edges toward thesis‑statement clarity, and the “chessboard” framing risks familiar metaphor. Still, the truce and later taunt reweight power as ongoing negotiation rather than victory, which resonates. The final stance is conceptually honest but a touch on‑the‑nose.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prudence versus rebellion threads through choices and culminates in a quiet defiance: he steps through the gateway with “wistful rebellion” intact. The organ, compass, and living architecture work as thematic vehicles for resisting imposed structure. Insights are earned via action rather than moralizing. The resonance is solid if not deeply layered.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of empathy versus procedure and “unifying opposites” accrue through image and action, culminating in Clara finally “seeing” Lila. However, explicit thesis statements (“Empathy’s never truly dormant…”) verge on moralizing and reduce subtext. Strong recurring objects (ribbon, mask, locket) carry real thematic load. The final juxtaposition (death/life, forgetting/remembering) lands even if slightly declared.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of reversal—of exile, shame, and institutional “truth”—emerges through objects and action rather than moralizing. The final act (“question the storm”) reframes knowledge and legacy without neat answers, sustaining resonance. The coffin/nail/door chain creates a satisfying conceptual reweighting. A touch more ambiguity in Clara’s complicity with institutional harm could deepen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonance emerges from particulars: music as agency over fate; memory/time as editable through art. The “pixelated amnesty” reframes choice at the end without moralizing, and the last poised raise of the fiddle offers a non‑literal answer. Some jargon‑tinged abstraction (“scaffold wrap flutters,” “amnesty”) skews conceptual over human cost, slightly blunting the ache. Still, the pattern of images coheres and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motifs (ouroboros path, bills, train) carry the theme, but the piece leans on stated takeaways (“Greed…always leads to the same end”) and an explicit thesis near the close. Subtext exists in the object work, yet moralizing trims ambiguity. The ending offers resonance, but some complexity is flattened by explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of empathy as cartography and knowledge as shared burden emerge through objects and action (prism, voices, stabilized glyphs). The final repricing—“a map, not of space, but of empathy”—resonates with prior particulars. Some thesis-forward lines (“The inscriptions are a language of shared burdens...”) reduce subtext. Overall, the piece invites reflection without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of seeing beyond mirrors plays through the seed’s truth‑seeking and the reweighted “confession.” The final image recontextualizes guilt into endurance without sermonizing. A single explicit thesis line (“She had discovered what mirrors don’t show…”) blunts subtlety slightly. Resonance lingers via cost‑aware acceptance rather than neat absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of wounds as maps and choice over fear emerges organically via scars, the mirrored self, and the “heed” refrain. The ending reweights the premise (“The intersection of dreams wasn’t a place—it was a choice”) with a resonant world-shift. That one sentence edges toward overt thesis, slightly flattening subtext. Overall, image-led meaning predominates and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of doubt as a “fiercely gentle blade” grows from specific events rather than abstract lecture. Recurring images (Fool, bones, stitching, fruit) reweight meaning at the end. A few direct statements (“Your past is ash…”) flirt with telling but are buffered by ritual context. Resonance lingers as a textured acceptance rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around failure, memory, and meaning “after the applause,” expressed through particular images (tattered posters, rusted harmonica, phoenix logo). Subtext surfaces in his habit of rationalizing to avoid feeling and the choice to stop doing so. The final line risks on‑the‑nose neatness but is supported by prior scene work. Resonance lingers more in image than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—transition as reassembly and knowledge as lived translation—emerges through events and images, then is asserted in lines like “not cold equations, but stories,” which blunts subtlety. The final cadence resonates, reweighting prior material via the sapling and hum. Subtext exists in the haunted ambition being redirected, but moralizing notes in the last third reduce ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of accepting contradiction to preserve wonder emerges through concrete ritual and keepsakes; the feather and trinkets reframe routine as sacred. Some lines state thesis plainly (“By accepting contradictions...”), edging into told theme. The final reprise (fish taking flight) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Ambiguity remains purposeful and humane, if not thorny.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    Connection, confession, and forgiveness emerge organically from the cave’s mechanics and Elias’s act, culminating in a reweighted world-image. The pearl’s sacrifice reframes survival as relational rather than structural. A few lines verge on thematic telling (“remind the world of its capacity for connection”). The ending image still resonates without collapsing into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of forgiveness as current arises organically from concrete particulars (drainpipe, arrows, river ripples) rather than lecture. One line (“healing required surrender”) flirts with stating the thesis, but the surrounding images carry the weight. The ending’s “Begin” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext—meds, trust in perception, the map‑making impulse—enriches the question.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres: truth lives in gaps, time runs in loops, and a tool of deception becomes a guide to honesty. The final image reweights earlier motifs (backward watch/cyclic cipher → non‑linear truth) without sermonizing. Some phrasing skirts abstraction (“truths humanity dared not voice”), but the scene earns its resonance. Ambiguity remains purposeful, not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Power vs nurture and fate’s porousness emerge through recurring particulars (violin, coffee stain, plants) rather than thesis. The final dismantling functions as a resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting “propagate” from conquest to self‑pruning. The “mulberry ache” tones the afterimage. Rarely didactic and thematically integrated at sentence and image level.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of preservation versus oblivion, art as ritual care, and attention as salvation accrue through concrete acts (infusing, painting runes, lullaby). The final image reweights the premise toward fragile endurance. A faint whiff of moralizing—“beauty could endure”—edges toward statement, but remains anchored in action. Subtext works best in the lens insight and tone of “radiant hush” under threat.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of renewal, forgiveness, and cyclical return cohere through the hairpin/shell pattern and the sisters’ reconnection. Subtext works in the mirrored objects and the “vineyard hush,” though some lines edge toward thesis (“Contentment… was a practice”). The shell’s symbolic reweighting is effective without over‑explaining its lore. Resonance lingers, albeit with a slight moralizing tint.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres: doubt as clarifying filter versus certainty as prison, expressed through concrete action (chime curation, cloak filtration). A couple of aphoristic lines (“Doubt isn’t the enemy”; “Crazy is refusing to listen”) tip toward on‑the‑nose. The final walk into wind‑speech reframes the premise without a moral lecture. Resonance is strong though not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme arises organically from particulars: appearing vs. disappearing, arrival through unnoticed vectors, and truth emerging by silence. The final realization (“becoming”) reweights prior images without preaching, despite one near‑direct thesis line earlier. Subtext lives in the mentor’s restraint and the apprentice’s hunger. Resonance lingers through the recharged pond image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of reverence, surrender to pattern, and harmony with the world coherently emerge from specific images (figure-eight, pulse, carvings). However, the insight is partially told—“The pulse wasn’t something to be chased…”—blunting subtext in the climactic paragraph. Resonance lingers through the final guided-walking image. Complexity is present but tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres—sacredness found in the tended and ordinary—through the shift from exotic flora to the mother’s garden. Several lines state the thesis directly (“He’d found what he’d been looking for…”), undercutting subtext. Still, images (fountain to stream; lingering luminance) carry honest resonance. The ending reweights prior material without full sentimentality, but it edges into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres—memory as sound/color, vows made of light, and self-recognition—emerging from image and act rather than lecture. The engraved phrase risks on-the-nose but is reinterpreted through the lived moment (the book’s hum becoming color). The ending reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext about grief, denial, and ritual is felt in the quiet exit.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—signal vs. noise, alignment as present attention—is woven through recurring images (coins as circuit, spiral to thread) and culminates in a resonant final surge. However, several lines state thesis directly (“wasn’t about the past or the future—it was about the present”), reducing subtext. The end reframes purpose credibly without slipping into a moral, but ambiguity and counter‑pressure are limited. Emotional aftereffect leans luminous rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story coherently explores naming as power, sacrifice’s echo, and the ethics of remembrance. Recurring images (prism, atlas, echoes) reweight meaning at the end with a quiet, resonant cadence. A touch of explicitness (“wasn’t just about loss”) slightly flattens subtext. Overall the theme emerges from action rather than lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonance arises from the tension between repair vs. balance and devotion vs. madness; the final poise honors fragility over triumph. The sea’s “tired of giving” reframes extraction as moral texture. A near‑moralizing line (“Madness is just devotion without a roadmap”) slightly flattens subtext. Overall, the imagery carries the theme more than the declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of stewardship, memory, and communal meaning emerge through objects and acts, culminating in the shared trail of photographs. However, explicit thematic statements (“spin stories into shared meaning,” “precisely humane act of remembering”) tilt toward telling, especially in the final cadence. The resonance remains, but the moral is a shade too articulated. Subtext in the images already carries the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through enacted paradox—precision and surrender—embodied in the crystal, birds, and flame, culminating in a formula that is both calculus and verse. The final quiet image (listening to a starling in darkness) resonates as acceptance rather than conquest. Some lines state the thesis too directly, slightly dulling subtext. Still, the emotional aftereffect is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Trust, inheritance, and adaptation braid cleanly through image (hands, lines, nodes) rather than thesis. The climactic reframing (“trust wasn’t a burden—it was a language”) resonates but borders on explicitness. The final charged poise—keep watching—answers the theme without sermonizing. Subtext works best in the tactile pedagogy he inherits from his mother.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    Identity versus fear, integration over erasure, and autonomy crystallize through action and the jar’s reweighted meaning. Subtext appears in the choice to merge rather than destroy, but a few explicit thesis lines (“You’re not a duplicate… You’re a choice.”) edge toward moralizing and flatten nuance. Still, the final descent and stabilized sky provide a resonant, non‑literal answer without overexplaining. Thematic complexity is present though not fully subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of “innovation through surrender to flow” coheres through the brook, the orthogonal methods, and the final key. However, the line “The mystery wasn’t in the seed but in the flow” states the thesis outright, trimming resonance. The botanist/mycologist notes hint at networks and symbiosis, adding subtext without overloading. The final planning of a new room ties concept to vocation but leans explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of tending the unspoken, grief’s residue, and the labor of joy emerge from concrete acts, not thesis statements. The leaf blower as symphonic instrument and lullabies amid industrial roar create earned, layered irony that lingers. The final image reprices the premise: joy as recoverable but costly work. No moralizing; resonance is built from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Images and objects carry thematic weight (lantern that reveals, mist as thought, “interiorizing exteriors”). The final recognition reframes the premise (“boundaries of light” as doors), but the explicit statement “And uncertainty? That was just another word for home” flirts with telling. Subtext in the waiting, the oath, and the mentor’s “Trust the fog” does good work. A shade less declarative moralizing would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of creative destruction integrates with action, not just assertion, and reweights the final image (“bloomed… frozen in twilight”). Veyra’s maxim (“Order is a cage… chaos is a knife”) complicates binaries without flattening them. A couple lines articulate theme overtly, slightly reducing subtlety, but they arrive earned by struggle. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through image and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silence as potential and “beginning in every ending” recur through action (stripping the cage) and image (shard → inert; city reborn). Yet the text sometimes states its thesis outright (“The hush wasn’t absence—it was potential,” “silence was the key”), thinning subtext. The final image earns resonance, but the moral is slightly over-articulated. Thematic integration is strong but could trust implication more.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Completion vs. salvation, guardianship of transience, and time as substance emerge organically through action and object. The shattered hourglass/time weaving creates a resonant repricing of the premise; the final Hourglass constellation recasts absence as earned stasis. No didactic moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the cost to Kael. Minor sentiment in reunions is tempered by the loss of the ferry.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres around connection as something made, not found; the thread and mirrors carry it. However, the curator articulates thesis-level statements (“It’s not in the things we see…”) that edge into didactic summary. The final image reweights prior material without needing a moral, but the piece occasionally tells what the images already show. Resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—grounding versus expansion, certainty versus adaptation—threads cleanly through chain/starlight/edge motifs. However, several lines state the thesis directly (“That is the beauty of edge geometry”), edging toward didactic. The final image reweights earlier material with a quiet, earned calm. Subtext exists but is often overtly spelled out.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Listening as love’s afterlife is embodied through the pulse motif and the synchronized hearing aids. Subtext largely carries the meaning until a slightly explicit line (“Sometimes love is too big for words…”) leans toward moralizing. The final “echo” image is apt but states the concept rather than letting it reverberate unaided. Resonance remains, if a touch on‑the‑nose.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Resonance emerges from particulars: illuminant gold, presence in cables, grief as data-echo, culminating in the memorial reframing. The ending offers a non-literal answer—presence preserved as trace—without melodrama. One line edges toward telling (“weren’t just for communication—they were memorials”), slightly blunt compared to the otherwise implied buildup. The emotional aftereffect is sturdy and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of failure-as-wisdom, liminal identity, and non‑binary survival arise organically from recurring images. Several lines state thesis overtly (“The digital ghost wasn’t a curse. It was a compass.”), softening subtext near the end. Still, the final charged poise reweights earlier motifs with honest, unsentimental acceptance. Greater reliance on image over declaration would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of language, loss, and translation reconfigure at the end: the curse as mirror, and “felt, not spoken” as a non-literal answer. Recurring images (veins, runes, echoes, birds) accrue meaning and shift at closure. The declaration “I am the extinction!” edges on overt thesis, softening subtlety a touch. Overall resonance lingers and invites re-reading without collapsing into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of civilization versus untamed harmony and transmutation of guilt into play emerge through image and choice, not just statement. The “Harmony isn’t tamed. It’s played.” line edges toward on‑the‑nose but is earned by the phone/static device. The final spiral reweights earlier motifs into a conceptual repricing of her vocation. Ambiguity about the missing “choosing to stay” enriches without muddying.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant themes of order versus wildness emerge through recurring objects and acts (shell, heartbeat music, metal fruit shedding), culminating in a reweighted understanding. However, the explicit thesis line (“breaking free wasn’t about destruction…”) edges into moralizing and reduces subtext. The ending still offers a concrete, recharged image that invites reflection. Complexity is present but somewhat narrated instead of fully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonance grows from concrete images (barbed wire lit by lightning; arcade machines revived), and the final hush-as-promise reweights the opening. However, theme is sometimes stated rather than earned by subtext (“healing wasn’t in grand gestures or treaties”), slightly flattening complexity. The storm-as-bridge motif works well as thematic vehicle. The piece leaves a persuasive aftertaste without moral symmetry games.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of renewal and revalued silence emerge organically through image patterns (wind bells, halo, circle of flowers, ripple‑language). Subtext blooms in the environment’s response to his song. The final sentence states the thesis a bit baldly, trimming resonance. Still, the reweighting from relic to voice lands.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme coheres: analog memory vs. digital, “mapping the impossible,” and stories as living entities converge in action. Subtext in tactile rituals and geometry-as-language mostly carries weight; a few on‑the‑nose lines (“They don’t just inform—they transform”) flatten nuance slightly. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Overall resonance is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of longing refigured as self‑recognition emerges through particulars (ritual, light’s behavior, dream’s single line) rather than thesis. The last image reweights prior material toward embrace over capture. A faint whiff of stated moral (“that…was enough”) slightly narrows the afterglow. Subtext of absence/presence is consistent and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Recurrences (locket, star, whispers) support a theme about secrecy, fear, and the reparative potential of disclosure. The final image reframes risk as necessary bearing, but the line “some secrets, once spoken, could heal rather than harm” states the thesis, muting subtext. Emotional aftereffect is present via the burden of voices in a strange new starlit expanse. More implication and less articulation would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Memory, lineage, and pattern recognition (“broken stars”) cohere into a gentle meditation on how curiosity bridges eras. The fairy ring’s redefinition and the locket’s light reweight earlier motifs without didacticism. A small tilt toward telling (“He’d recover the memories…”) slightly flattens what the images already imply. Still, the afterimage is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Reversible exile, shadow/light, and backward-walking recur in a way that reweights the closing image without sermonizing. A few direct statements (“Exile is reversible”) lean explicit, but images do most of the work. The final gesture toward light finding a new path offers a resonant non-literal answer. Complexity is present, though the moral calculus remains relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres through objects and images—seed, sap, threshold, radiant hush—reframing wonder as a thread between worlds. The final repricing (“wonder was not a finite thing”) resonates with the blossom’s charged substitution. Slight overstatement in the final articulation edges toward moralizing, softening subtext. Still, the orchard’s renewal and the pocket’s loss carry the meaning without didactic scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of secrecy, love, and the ethics of silence emerge through the net and the fisherman myth, reconfigured at the end into “Now you listen.” The silver key (“to a door that was never locked”) offers a crisp conceptual repricing. Slight on-the-nose line (“Silence isn’t always kindness”) blunts subtext. Overall resonance lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance is strong around thresholds, language of silence, and empathy; images recur with reweighted meaning (map tear/altar, saints, hum/rain). Yet the theme is occasionally told rather than earned—lines like “to find empathy in the unsaid” articulate the thesis overtly. The discovery itself conveys the idea well; trimming explicit moral phrasing would heighten subtext. The final cadence lingers but flirts with sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres through recurring images (tape, tuning fork, snow globe) and resolves in a resonant redefinition of grief. However, lines like “The physics of letting go wasn’t about release. It was about transmission.” state thesis overtly, reducing subtext in the final third. The ending still reweights prior material with an earned, melancholy charge. Ambiguity remains productively open around Earhart, focused on memory’s half‑life.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as inscription vs. erasure, mediated communication vs. speech, and the ethics of letting the lost keep their mysteries. The bluebell pressed into the plate reframes the grandmother’s lore into a present choice, giving the final moment a quiet repricing of permanence. No moralizing; the last line’s “Somewhere, a ghost smiled” preserves ambiguity without coyness. The resonance is strong though not world‑tilting.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of grief/joy twins and reframing (“spire as lens”) emerge organically through object use and image. Subtext surfaces in the widow’s mask cracking and the tactile gesture to her chest. Some overt articulation (“He believed joy and anguish are twins”) edges toward thesis‑speak, slightly diluting resonance. The final image invites reflection without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Resonance arises through recurring images (lanterns, telescope, threads) and culminates in a non‑literal answer about memory and loss. However, the theme is sometimes stated too directly (“Clouds are not weather. They are the sky’s memory.”), trimming subtext. The ending image still lingers with the “spooled wholeness” felt rather than only told. The grief undercurrent grounds the abstract premise.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    Preservation vs. loss and “mirroring the sky inside walls” accrue through objects and actions rather than speech, landing in a resonant final image. One on‑the‑nose line (“She’d discovered the guild’s limit...”) edges toward theme‑telling, softening the subtext. Still, the journal’s dictum reframed by her painting and exit provides a clean conceptual repricing. Ambiguity remains purposeful (what future the safe enables) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of attention, silence-as-key, and curiosity reweight “mapping” from geography to ontological truth; the murmurations’ gap nicely literalizes absence as portal. The last line edges into telling (“not just a place, but a truth”), blunting resonance. Subtext in Jax’s “You’re mad” grin and the captain’s fury hints at social cost. The stranded luminance as memory/record offers a clean conceptual echo.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Repair as a moral and metaphysical stance threads through action and images, culminating in the gears as a conduit for renewal. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit statement (“The rhythm of repair…”) which flattens subtext. Resonance is earned by particulars (mirrors, runes, ticking), but complexity is modest. Emotional aftereffect lingers more for atmosphere than moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of collective care, trust, and renewal develop through recurring images (bell, nebula) and culminate in a charged final chime. Some lines tilt toward overt moral statement (“It is a promise”), dampening subtext. Nevertheless, the motifs reweight at the end and produce a gentle afterglow. Ambiguity is limited but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant motifs (flaws/cracks/lullaby) cohere, and the final image reweights the premise. However, explicit thesis lines (“Perfection is a lie,” and “the end wasn’t an ending”) edge into thematic echo, reducing subtext. The best work occurs in image (golden light leaking from cracks; clocks softening) rather than declaration. Emotional aftereffect is gentle and sustained despite mild overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of duty versus resentment, memory versus entropy, and “graceless beauty” of imperfect guidance emerge through particulars (tilted stones, snapped branches) and reweight at the ending. The orchard’s satisfied roots and inevitable reset suggest endurance over triumph without moralizing. Subtext is steady, not overdeclared. It resonates, though it stops just shy of a deeper repricing of Kael’s complicity or belief.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of divergence→connection and transformation are coherently seeded through rivers/foam/chrysalis. Yet the piece voices its thesis outright (“separation isn’t an end. It’s a prelude to connection”), veering into moralizing and reducing subtext. The strongest resonance is in images (foam reforming; the release), which could stand without the explicit statement. Subtext is present in music interplay but partially overwritten by declaratives.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres around absence as prerequisite for creation, recurred through jars, warning, and the note’s return. The final realization resonates and reweights prior images. One line edges toward on‑the‑nose (“She understood: stories didn’t begin…”), slightly reducing subtextual charge. Still, the piece invites reflection without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of communal burden, containment vs diffusion, and nourishment-as-repair arise from particulars (tasting walls, vials, the brackish pool, cooking with softened bitterness). The final act—“The meal wouldn’t erase the past, but it would nourish the present”—lands as earned wisdom, not a moral. The rain and kitchen reframe the fortress’s brittleness into tempered sturdiness. Ambiguity remains productive: he may carry the cost indefinitely.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Imagery (weights, languages, grain) coheres around bridging silos, and the final chorus reweights prior motifs. Still, a degree of moralizing appears in Elara’s speech (“stories… must flow”), trimming subtlety. Thematically resonant but not surprising; ambiguity is limited by explicit statements. The emotional aftereffect is warm but risk‑averse.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of salvage, identity recomposition, and memory as shared infrastructure emerge organically through the mirror’s transformation. Recurring images (fractures as pathways) evolve meaningfully in the last image. Some explicit thesising (“archeologist of abandoned dreams,” “rewiring reality itself”) trims subtext and edges toward told wisdom. The resonance is genuine but not hauntingly ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ideas of vigilance, margins, and thresholds are braided through objects and actions, culminating in her redefined role. The “not in grand gestures, but in the margins” line verges on explicit moralizing, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the manuscript’s reweighting and the warm key create a resonant, earned image. Ambiguity remains productively open without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of translating pain and history into communal resonance (“empathy in motion”) emerges through action rather than moralizing. Recurring images (cracks, moss, hedgehog, shards) reweight at the end, suggesting resilience and communal memory. The final hum functions as conceptual repricing—music beyond ears. No heavy-handed thesis; the piece invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—beauty in constraint, silence as language—emerges through chess metaphors that reweight the final seed image. The queen’s diagonal through the Shattered Sword neatly reframes brokenness as directional. Occasional explicitness (“beauty in the difficult”) risks stating the thesis, but it’s earned by particulars and not purely declarative at the end. The covenant’s “living” nature offers a resonant, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    Resonance between method and meaning is elegant, but thematic statements are sometimes on‑the‑nose, culminating in explicit moralizing about “the path to empathy” in the final lines. The diary line defining silence is effective once; later restatements blunt subtext. Still, concrete particulars (radio static, hum, clasp) do much of the thematic lifting. The closing image carries feeling despite didactic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of wisdom-in-hush vs. drive-in-roar arises through concrete acts (scent‑led care, doodling as prayer, renunciation). The elder’s line “Chaos and serenity... are not enemies but kin” edges toward stated moral, slightly flattening subtext. Still, motifs (scent, journal, bloom) reweight meaning at the close without heavy authorial intrusion. The aftereffect is reflective and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    Symbiosis and “gathering of echoes” cohere thematically and culminate in a protective stance. Several images (liquid spheres, root-archives) evolve meaningfully toward the ending. A touch of direct moralizing (“not a machine to exploit, but a truth to protect”) blunts subtext. The resonance lingers, though complexity remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of systems convergence and human hubris emerges through particulars (wind funnels, synchronized devices) and culminates in the “machine is hungry” image. The patch and wind reprise charge the ending without resorting to a tidy moral. A touch of declarative phrasing edges toward statement, but subtext largely carries the weight. The final line lingers with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Images carry a strong thematic arc from oppressive hush to living hymn, with wonder reframed as necessity. However, lines like “Wonder isn’t a luxury” and “truth… is essential” tilt into stated thesis, especially near the end. Subtext is otherwise present in the sculpted hush becoming music. The resonance lingers, but moralizing trims its edge.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme arises organically from action—failure, surrender, and the paradox of silence as power—refracted through the flute and driftwood. The mentor’s line risks stating the thesis too directly, but the final acts (etching a new rune; carrying fragments) embody it without moralizing. The silence note reweights prior material with resonance. Ambiguity lingers productively around “unmake.”

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece earns its theme—mirrors vs. equations—through action, image, and reversal, with the final acceptance reweighting prior motifs. Subtext in Veyra’s warning and the mirror claim accrues well. A single declarative line (“The mathematics of emotion weren’t equations…”) edges toward on‑the‑nose but is supported by the scene’s imagery and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Seed/germination motifs move from image to action to identity, reweighting the absent‑mentor frame without didactic summary. Subtext in the woman’s line (“You extend brief encounters”) blooms into the whispers at the end, avoiding overt moralizing. A couple aphoristic quotes from Veyra edge close to on‑the‑nose, slightly reducing the afterglow. The final image (lighter pendant, rooted sapling) carries thematic charge cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around projection vs. absorption, self-myth vs. “truthful lies,” and the hunger for validation; it arises from concrete images (frost patterns, prism, mirrored stone) rather than sermonizing. The ending reweights the premise without stating a moral, and the final image lingers. A few explicit statements flirt with aphorism, but they’re earned by the scene. Subtext—her mentor’s dismissal—quietly charges the need that’s relinquished.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme blooms through particulars: mending the world by aligning broken edges; inheritance transmuted into communal gift; sacrifice as communication. The final act (weaving silence) reprices earlier images without moralizing and leaves a resonant aftereffect. Subtext in the loom’s creak and the orchard’s transformation avoids didacticism. A touch more ambiguity about personal cost beyond the bead might have deepened the ache further.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of resilience, stewardship, and awakening arise from action and imagery (silk binding soul to body; shards fusing). However, explicit thesis‑like lines (“Resilience isn’t born from safety…”) flatten subtext and edge into moralizing. The final silent smile offers a resonant image, but some earlier exposition (Lira’s soul‑binding explanation) tells what the scene could imply. The piece invites reflection but opts for clarity over ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around the cost of truth and the discipline of refusal; the shard’s shift from “key” to “choice” is a clean thematic hinge. Subtext in the mother-figure’s “Not exactly” and “You redirect” suggests a cyclical trap and legacy. A few lines verge on thesis statements (“The truth wasn’t a thing to be found—it was a thread”), which slightly flattens resonance. The final image nonetheless reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Endurance, communal caretaking, and reframed light accrue through particulars rather than thesis. The sea glass’s “song” and stones’ beacon effect build a non‑literal answer to the safety question. The phrase “a new kind of light” edges toward telling but is supported by prior images, keeping sentiment in check. Thematic afterglow lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of ancient tools shaping a future against algorithmic drift emerges organically through ritual and image. The final conceptual reweighting works, but the line “the dawn wasn’t just a time of day. It was a choice” states the thesis overtly, undercutting subtext. Light/dark as inseparable twins adds nuance. Resonance lingers, though it skirts sentimentality in that explicit moment.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of inheritance, attention, and “iridescent caution” accrue through image and action rather than lecture, and the donor heart reframes perception in a resonant way. The wing’s disappearance reweights value from talisman to practice. The final sentence edges toward explicit thesis (“some stories are meant to be shared, and some hearts are built to hold them”), softening subtext. Overall resonance remains strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—transmuting sorrow into light and language, “mundane miracles” of maintenance—is woven through objects and action (sextant → dream‑map → roots’ memories). The ending’s acceptance reframes loss as workable beauty without a sermon, though a few direct statements (“Sorrow… could be measured;” “This was the mundane miracle…”) edge toward telling. Subtext accrues via bent light, healing skin, and witness‑trees. Resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of communal memory and the necessity of shadow arise organically from image and action (too much light erases memory; songs knit community). However, the line “Through forgotten songs, we remember how to live” states the thesis overtly and blunts subtext at the end. The final image still resonates, but sentiment shades toward didactic. Strong imagery does most of the work without needing the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (invitation, mirrors, blank book, “Third Shelf”) braid into a coherent meditation on visibility, loss, and imperfect wisdom. The ending’s reweighting—hiding as selective revelation—lands emotionally. Some on-the-nose lines (“Wisdom lies in mistakes,” “To find peace…”) blunt subtext slightly. Nonetheless, the scene, not assertion, carries the afterfeel.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme is integrated through action and image—seeking the sacred by tending, not grasping; light seeping through cracks; absolution as growth. The bread-to-seed transformation carries resonant subtext about exchange and surrender. One line risks on‑the‑nose thesis (“The cracks. The places where light seeps through”), but it doesn’t collapse the piece into moralizing. The final image sustains ambiguity with emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of vows sustaining worlds and meaning salvaged from entropy arise organically through the frequency‑work and the partial phrases. The ending reweights the motif—renewal via painstaking craft rather than grand heroics. No moralizing intrudes; resonance comes from image and method. Ambiguity remains in the fragility of the magic, which deepens the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of trust vs. silence emerges through action—the hush economy, the device’s “sound of trust breaking,” and the daughter’s choice to smash both recording and myth. Subtext in the token “proof of silence” and the final cracked fob avoids moralizing. The buyer’s line flirts with on-the-nose but fits character. The last image offers a resonant answer without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of skepticism vs. emergent sentience, balance/absorption vs. release, and places carrying weather cohere through concrete beats and recurring objects. Lira’s explanatory lines edge toward tell, but they still reframe action rather than float as thesis. The final image (“world held its breath,” lavender and regret) resonates without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of unlocking suppressed voice emerges organically through objects (lock, canvas, crystals) and the final act. Subtext around inherited memory (grandmother’s voice) enriches the question of which doors should open. The last image offers a quiet, resonant answer without moralizing, though “truly seen” edges toward abstraction. Slightly more ambivalence about what is released would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Truth vs. hope coheres through the quill and the Archive’s repurposed voices, culminating in a reprice: echoes as “seed.” However, the line “Candor in small moments” articulates the thesis too baldly, thinning subtext in the final exchange. The closing image (planting where the oasis was) resonates without sermonizing and largely carries the theme. A touch less explicit moralizing would heighten afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—truth articulated through silence, craft, and natural process—emerges from particulars (tuning, melting, kinetic harmonies). The final act reweights “symphonies of truth” via transformation rather than cessation. Some lines verge on thesis‑statement (“truth made audible,” “color of wonder… released”), slightly flattening subtext. Nevertheless, the final chord image earns resonance without didactic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of containment vs. transformation and living with imperfection emerge organically from actions (control burn, miniaturization, absorption). Recurring images (box, dome, roses) return with reweighted meaning at the end. A touch of explicitness (“Maybe that was the secret”) skirts moralizing but is cushioned by concrete preceding beats. The final image—static as song, roses brighter—offers earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of listening, communal memory, and love’s endurance emerge organically from action and image. The line “not by force, but by listening” in the final paragraph over‑articulates the thesis, dulling subtext at the finish. The locket’s inscription works well as thematic engine otherwise. Resonance is present but constrained by that explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of vulnerability as cipher and art-as-code emerge organically through images (dance, dice) and actions. However, the final paragraph states the thesis overtly (“Vulnerability wasn’t a flaw...”), edging into moralizing and reducing subtext. The strongest thematic move is the tactic itself—defiant waltz as language—not the articulation. Resonance lingers but is partially told.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.7)
    Memory, grief, and preservation accrue through concrete images (wildflowers, salt, rose). The final repricing—deleted memories stored and retrievable—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. Some lines brush sentimentality or directness (“He no longer feared...”), softening ambiguity. Still, the ending image carries charge and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    Silence as language is a coherent thematic throughline, embodied by mapping hush to avert chaos. The ending offers calm as answer, but it’s tidy and lightly moralizing (“the world remained quiet”), limiting lingering ambiguity. Subtext exists in the fracture/constellation imagery but rarely conflicts with stated intent. Resonance is pleasant more than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    Truth vs. protective fictions is integrated through the “agreed lies” turning into tactic (“We lie to the building”). The idea of dead vs. sleeping language reframes the world without sermonizing. Resonance is present but not devastating; no single image re-prices the entire moral calculus beyond wonder and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—repurposing pain into autonomy—emerges through particulars (shell as key, jars labeled “lesson” and “warning,” ashes). However, explicit thesis statements (“She’d translated her isolation into independence”) dull subtext at the end. The images carry resonance without needing the summary. The final cadence still offers a credible reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—lies as instruments of forgiveness and returning history to earth—emerges from actions and images rather than mere assertion, with a resonant last image. The thorn’s memory of wounds and the “key with no apparent lock” refract the moral calculus effectively. A few declarative explanations (“not acts of rebellion but of forgiveness”) trim the mystique slightly. Still, the aftereffect is cohesive and contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory, unfinished stories, and obligation to witness emerge coherently through the shell and canyon as living archive. The final answer (“even in silence, something remains”) resonates, though the mentor’s explicit line “The echoes are not just sound” leans toward thesis‑statement. Subtext in the images (lost child, lover, warrior) does much of the heavy lifting. The ending reframes Kael’s role without moralizing beyond a light touch.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of “windows of connection,” endurance, and love’s residue accrues through recurring images (globe as pool/prison/mirror) and the final, non‑literal answer (truth carried by dreams rather than proclamations). A few lines tilt toward overt statement (“Windows… were fragile things”), but the closing image earns resonance. The ghost’s simple line about blame grounds sentiment without tipping into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—beauty as hidden labor and the holiness of unseen stitches—emerges organically from action and image (net mending → firefly code → whisk tracing light). The final comprehension reweights earlier particulars without stating a moral, though one line edges toward essay (“To appreciate hidden effort…”). Subtext lives in the dialogue of sounds and inherited craft.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of dismantling “comfortable lies” versus embracing costly truth emerges through investigative action and the final sealing. The orchard’s unnatural fertility versus moral hazard carries subtext, and the flawed/true diamond pair refracts the idea of sacrifice. The closing sentence explicitly states the theme, nudging toward moralizing and softening resonance. Ambiguity around Crane adds a useful aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of reconciling order/chaos and embracing fragile humanity emerges through specific motifs (storm as language, prism/threshold, black sand hourglass). Subtext carries in images more than in statements, though a few lines edge toward thesis (“His allegiance wasn’t to a cause, but to the act of unfolding”). The ending reweights prior material without a moral. Resonance is strong if slightly declarative at moments.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory as bridge and redemption through sound accrue through images (jarred echoes, villagers’ softened faces). Final moralizing lines (“not to be remembered, but to remember”) state the thesis a bit too explicitly, trimming resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of harmony over force and “bridge” vs “weapon” emerge organically through action and reprise in the final vigil. Subtext lives in the sonic metaphor and family legacy without heavy exposition. However, the line “some battles were won not with force, but with harmony” states the moral overtly in the final paragraph, dulling the otherwise earned resonance. Without that explicitness, the ending’s image would carry more lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres—discipline as revolution—through recurring images (filings, moon, hum) and the earned shift from urgency to steadiness. Some lines verge on thesis (“To unyoke the world, one must first unyoke oneself.”), softening subtext. The more resonant moments let image carry meaning (concentric ripples; filings locking). The ending reweights the premise without complex moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Memory-as-weapon and history’s echo (Eliza’s courage vs. present manipulation) integrate with the object and decision. The piece edges toward thesis with “not through emotion, but through empirical observation,” but the charged images carry most weight. The end revalues the lantern from chain to tool, a resonant conceptual shift. Ambiguity around consequences keeps reflection alive.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of redemption, craft as atonement, and transforming apology into action are integrated through particulars (gearwork, engraving, the heart). Subtext lives in the juxtaposition of storm/hush and word/action, but the text occasionally tips into overt moralizing (“repairing lives”), muting ambiguity. The final image resonates without a neat sermon, though some lines skate close to telling. Overall, the symbolic economy is effective and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from particulars: “seen not solved,” translation as desire made motion, and the bell’s hum reframing expectation. The final image answers the central question obliquely and memorably without moralizing. Old Thrum’s line works as thematic tension rather than thesis statement. Complexity is present though not deeply ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Memory, erasure, and institutional control resonate through objects and actions (patch, deleted files’ “shadows,” numbers as a buried message). However, some theme lines state the thesis overtly (“They’re erasing us,” “Some truths aren’t meant to be found”), reducing subtext. The final image reweights the motifs (sensed absence → resolve to remember) effectively. Ambiguity about the gateway’s ethics could have deepened complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of empathy as counterforce to collective fear emerge through specific images (sailor, mother, lover) and the reweighted shard. However, the final sentence explicitly states the moral (“courage wasn’t in the absence of fear…”) which flattens resonance. Subtext exists in the mirrors’ lived fragments but is partially overwritten by explication. The piece invites reflection but leans tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Endings, patience, and fragile attachments accrue through particulars (the marina, keening, heirloom tip) rather than thesis. The line redefining “the fold in patience” edges toward explicit but is earned by the rescue. The final wind-and-ice image delivers quiet resonance without moralizing. Subtext (clinging to delicate relics while seeking oblivion) lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Motifs (sun/moon, imbalance ripening grapes, burned letter) braid into a coherent argument about imperfect harmony. Some aphoristic lines verge on didactic (“harmony isn’t silence”), but the final image refrains from moralizing and lets the resonance sit. Thematically, the letter’s reweighting works. The piece invites reflection without requiring tidy answers.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of guardianship, honesty as risk, and preserving living memory arise organically from particulars (mask reveal, living archives, “for now”). Subtext hums beneath ritual rather than being stated, and the closing image reweights balance and vigilance. However, the resonance remains gentle; the insight doesn’t deepen into a sharper moral calculus or loss. No late moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically via reclamation imagery and arcs reinterpreting decay, culminating in the “enough” repricing. However, the explicit line “healing wasn’t about erasing the past, but about finding the beauty in its cracks” edges into stated moral, softening subtext. The dove and vines accrue meaning without heavy‑handed symbolism. The resonance is honest and earned though a touch didactic at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of non‑linear growth emerging from fractured sequences is earned through concrete particulars (ivy, rumor, bloom) and the crystal’s prism. The ending reweights prior material without sermonizing, though a few lines state the thesis plainly (“Growth was not a straight line”). Subtext operates through the hush and prismatic returns rather than argument. Resonance lingers via the final silent affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memory, aging, and acceptance arise organically through objects and action (chalk as failed prophecy → presence-marking). The ending reweights the premise without sermonizing, though “didn’t need to see the future anymore” edges toward explicitness. Subtext hums in the metal, fog, and videotape hush, avoiding platitude. The afterimage is quietly resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through particulars: a craftsman of fragile light must accept escape, not capture, as the truest form of preservation. The leaf’s sound motif shifts from memory cue to method to closing harmony, carrying subtext about attentiveness and surrender. Occasional direct naming (“time… could not be tamed”) edges toward telling but is supported by scene work. The final leap offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of light through darkness, imperfect mediums carrying grace, and the sanctification of the mundane accrue through specific images (crackle, skip, shared breath). Subtext in Mira’s decisive kindness and the handoff of the broken shard resists neat moralizing. The one explicit line (“The method was simple: hymning the mundane.”) edges toward telling, but the scene has already earned it. The ending’s vocational echo reweights prior material without a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Loops, awakenings, and shadows reframe into a coherent theme of hidden cycles and thresholds, with a resonant final image (noon shadows as a backward‑time gate). Thematic emergence is image‑led rather than moralizing, which suits the piece. However, subtext remains conceptual more than character‑costed; the insight changes understanding more than value hierarchy. The aftereffect is wonder, not disquiet or ethical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motifs (teeth, bone‑setting, fountain) accrue into a coherent meditation on certainty, sacrifice, and forgiveness. However, explicit theme statements (“The garden’s not a trick… it’s a mirror”; “forgiveness wasn’t…”) edge into didactic, softening the subtext. The final image is resonant, if slightly explained. More implication over declaration would increase afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme (“light is a loan,” stillness as charged space) emerges organically from action and image rather than lecture. Recurring objects (sea glass, jar, scale) reweight meaning at the end; the release reframes possession and sharing. A couple of maternal aphorisms come close to overt statement but are grounded by concrete beats. The final dissolution into the sky offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grafting metaphor integrates action and theme elegantly (orchid lessons → pendant graft → sapling), and subtext runs through silence and objects. A couple of on‑the‑nose lines (“You’ve been proactive about grief,” “healing wasn’t about erasing the past…”) nudge toward moralizing. The final image nonetheless resonates and reweights earlier particulars without didactic summary. Ambiguity remains humane and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through image and action—hope as current, endings as doors—culminating in an open, charged final move. The shell’s spiral and the current reprice “closure” without a moral. Some thematic articulation is explicit in the guide’s dialogue, nudging toward didacticism, but the final scene restores resonance via image and choice. The lingering last line earns its light.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of memory‑based, communal maintenance over gadget‑based fixes emerges through particulars (grandmother’s lullaby, shared dance, seed planting). A few lines verge on didactic (“sacred practices need tenders, not just tinkerers”), but the final image earns resonance. The story avoids tidy moralizing by acknowledging ongoing labor: magic requires constant tending.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of patience, attention, and translating chaos into meaning accrue through material acts and “moving stillness.” However, the explicit articulation—“he understood… how to feel, how to listen”—states the thesis rather than letting image alone carry it. The final walk away offers a quiet, resonant cadence but edges toward telling. Subtext is present in the orchard’s poise and the fragile craftwork.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around preservation vs. evaporation of wonder and the value of peripheral attention. The “cellar of reason” motif seeds early and is reconsidered in the ending image, yielding a conceptual repricing. Occasional explicitness (“Wonder is a fragile thing...”) edges toward stating the thesis but is balanced by image‑driven payoff. The final descent with the keepers waiting resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of transmuting pain into carryable pattern (“weights, not wounds”) emerge organically from craft and image, not moralizing. The final refusal reframes care as boundary setting, complicating salvation as a universal mandate. Recurring objects (lamp, niches, fractals) accrue meaning and reweight the last images. Complexity remains without faux symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres through recurring particulars (containment, “here and gone,” tools, light) and culminates in a non-literal answer. However, explicit formulations (“Loss wasn’t an ending, but a transformation”; “This is how we survive”) approach moralizing and dilute subtext. The images themselves carry strong resonance independent of those declarations. Overall, emotionally honest and restrained aside from a couple of didactic lines.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory, time, and forgiveness emerge through action and recurring images (carousel, fragments, camera wheel, rose), and the ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: release as reconfiguration. Subtext surfaces in object choices and the lagoon’s behavior rather than didactic summary. The explicit “you haven’t forgiven yourself” line slightly overstates what the story already implies. Overall, the final image invites afterthought without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of repurposing and hope emerge organically from action and the equation image. However, explicit thesis-like lines (“not on nostalgia, but on the courage to repurpose the old into the new”) flatten subtext and edge toward moralizing. The final image reweights prior material but states too much. The “equation for hope” is potent yet a touch on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonances—silence as pressure, listening as agency, keep as compass—emerge through image chains (gears, quartz, bear). The final image reweights prior material, though a couple of thematic sentences edge toward explicit moral (“The keep was not a prison. It was a compass.”). The piece avoids tidy binaries by choosing an uneasy middle. Depth is felt but not profound enough to transcend the stated insights.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    A coherent theme of truth vs. narrative manipulation emerges through concrete objects (sundial, blueprint) rather than pure thesis. Some phrasing (“architecture of lies,” “controlling the narrative”) edges toward on‑the‑nose, but the final realization reweights prior images. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer—clarity as the treasure—without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (rope, knots, tide chart, seeds, patience) accrue toward a resonant answer about stewardship and encoded wisdom. However, the thematic articulation edges toward explicitness in the woman’s lines and the “promise” assertion, softening subtext. The final sacred‑temple image lands, but some meaning is told rather than fully implied. Ambiguity about the weavers as scientists offers a pleasing counter‑reading.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—presence within absence, healing as geography—emerges through recurring images (thread, garden, parchment) and the silent encounter. The final understanding reweights earlier material, but a few lines state the thesis outright (“explained absences were not endings but beginnings”), edging toward moralizing. Subtext works best in the unsaid exchange and the tactility of the thread. Resonance lingers, though complexity is slightly flattened by explicit statements.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of nurtured vs engineered beauty and imperfect aliveness are embedded in images (the orb, “Genesis of the Unmade,” gears hissing) and culminate in “flawed… but alive.” The final image reweights prior material without needing explanation. Some lines verge on moralizing (“We’ll grow,” “this time, we’ll remember”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the orb’s substitution for a chick offers a resonant, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs braid well (coin, sand, scars), and the bird’s release refracts the central question of transforming harm. However, explicit thesis lines (“Compassion… wasn’t about erasing the past”) blunt subtext and approach moralizing. The “scars sing” refrain risks neatness. Resonance remains, but subtlety is compromised.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of memory, patience, and defiant faith in the unseen emerge through concrete acts and recurring objects. The geese pause/resume and the emptied box reweight the premise subtly. Some lines overstate (“Sidereal patience had won”), edging toward moralizing and reducing subtext. Still, the last image—the skeptic accepting wet cobblestones as proof—lands.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of generational inheritance, violence vs. gentleness, and light as language emerge from image and encounter, not just assertion. The final image reweights earlier motifs (petals, pinging, gear) toward a credible, quiet hope. Some line‑level thesising (“Generational patterns weren’t about repeating the past…”) edges into didactic clarity. Still, subtext holds in the ghost’s admonition and the garden’s nonverbal “approval.”

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of grief-as-bridge and word-as-endurance emerge through particulars (family poems, carving, the greenhouse’s memory). The butterfly migration reweights meaning at closure without overexplaining. A couple of explicit lines (“Because words outlive us”) skim close to thesis but are dramatized by the final act. The last image resists sermonizing and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Incremental absolution” threads through object, action, and outcome, reweighted by the slow resumption of the swing. The grandfather’s “balance is a dance” primes a thematic answer realized in practice rather than sermonizing. The diegetic inscription skirts on‑the‑nose but remains earned by lineage and role. Resonance lingers in the charged image of small corrections restoring the ridge.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    Chess/time/echo motifs braid into a coherent inquiry about intentions surviving as patterns. The final phrase “The silence between moves” reframes the work as a time‑map, giving the ending resonance. A few lines verge on stated thesis (“The dead were not silent; they spoke...”), slightly blunting subtext. Overall, the theme emerges from image and action more than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of innovation within constraint and the marriage of data and imagination recur through specific images (kingfisher quill, ledger‑stars) and the final burning. However, several direct statements of thesis undercut subtext, especially the aphorisms and rebuttals to the Elders. The ending still reweights prior motifs in a satisfying way without a didactic moral. Resonance is solid, if a touch declared.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—memory, recovery, and the ethics of listening—emerges through images (dust, wind/earth, ghost bards) rather than lecture, with the final walk into mist reweighting prior motifs. The halo image where moss and dial light merge offers a resonant answer: stories are coaxed from obscurity by attention, not conquest. One explicit sentence (“This was why she did it—not for glory...”) edges toward telling, but it doesn’t undercut the earned resonance. Subtext in father/ghost bard lore deepens the quest without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—safety as mirage, truth via omission—emerges organically from the mask, ash method, and dissolving gallery, culminating in an image‑led refusal. However, the explicit line “Safety is an illusion, and art is the only truth worth chasing” in the final movement veers into thesis‑telling, dulling subtext. Elsewhere, image and method carry meaning deftly. The final charged image nearly carries the weight without that assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Memory vs. progress and “competing narratives” emerge through concrete acts (digging layers, listening to tools) and subtext in the sparring. A few lines verge on stated thesis (“They erased the stars”) but the final beat reweights meaning via image and stance rather than moral. Thematically coherent and resonant, with complexity preserved (Mara stays, still unconvinced). Slight deduction for occasional declarative theme statements.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres through concrete images—rosette, river-song through three countries—and the practice of subtracting noise. The line about harmony as “the art of holding [conflict] gently” risks thesis-ness but is grounded as a grandmother’s teaching. Subtext operates in the act of mentorship and reclamation rather than speechifying. The ending reweights earlier motifs without closing into a didactic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of gentle rebellion, restorative creation, and redirected memory arise from pruning choices and the final community sketches. Some phrasing skirts thesis‑statement territory (“All it took…”) which blunts subtext. Still, the closing image reweights the preceding cuts as moral stance rather than mere horticulture. Resonance lingers even if a note of moralizing intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme—systems running on wonder and curiosity—is thematically apt and braided with the world. However, it’s often stated outright via Voss and Clara’s speech rather than emerging through subtext. The final paragraph leans didactic (“We can choose to wonder again”), softening resonance. The best moments are imagistic (child’s widened eyes; drones in “nectar dusk”) when the thesis recedes.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Coherent theme emerges from particulars: displaced objects as anchors, orris root “fixing” silence, hush as potential. The final realization reweights prior images, but the explicit articulation (“The hush wasn’t emptiness; it was potential.”) edges into thematic statement, dulling resonance. Subtext is otherwise strong in the glow and “listening” houses. The insight is earned by scene work rather than lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of nuance versus certainty emerges from particulars (guardian telepathy by impression, catalyst-not-cure, sacrifice reframed) and culminates in a charged final image. The line “To welcome nuance into a certainty” toes on-the-nose but remains diegetic and supported by events. The grandmother’s transformation and the garden-as-lab reweight prior material without didactic moralizing. Resonance lingers in the choice to keep the garden hidden.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    The perpetual motion device becomes a metaphor enacted: grief’s texture as the charged space between spinning dice. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing; the motif accrues and transforms rather than being declared. Subtext lives in the tension between desire to possess and the need to honor motion/loss by not intervening. The final image lingers with conceptual and emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres through images (brush, extinct tongues, moon, chamomile) and culminates in “Kindness outlives the tongue,” with the final lesson “To love is to translate” tying character arc to idea. However, the explicitness of those lines edges toward stating the thesis rather than letting subtext carry it. Subtext still operates in the eye-painting/recognition beat, which does the real thematic work. Strong resonance, slightly marred by overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of displacement, preservation vs practice, and grief refracted through beauty accrue through images (emerald lens, initials bread, thaw) instead of mere assertion. The final image reweights the premise: art must be kneaded and sung, not just curated. One line—“Art, like bread…”—tilts toward explicit moralizing but is supported by concrete action. Subtext around loss (bees, Celeste) gives the optimism texture.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Reversal/time motifs braid with the hunger/cost idea, yielding a coherent inquiry into whether “stepping beyond fate” feeds a more perilous appetite. The lighthouse and backward clocks refract theme through image rather than lecture most of the time. However, “Fate’s design had been a lock; he’d just picked it” edges into thesis articulation, blunting some subtext. The final backward‑ticking interior does resonate, but without a sharper on‑page cost the aftertaste is more cool awe than ache.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Coherent theme—truth exposing fear via paradoxical embrace—emerges through action and recurring light imagery. The final image reweights earlier material (the clasp’s pulse, Vey’s survivalist credo). However, the line “fear, like beauty, is a lie” states the thesis a bit baldly, blunting subtext. The piece mostly trusts images but occasionally tips into aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme—obstacles as instruments—is enacted rather than preached, with the seabird, apples, creak, and kelp woven into the composition. The ending reweights the premise: silence and order hum with the cost of effort and tool depletion. Complexity comes from balancing control and surrender to natural patterns, with no moralizing. The “obstacles” line risks slight on‑nose phrasing but is backed by credible scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of misread guardianship, the predatory foundation under civic myths, and obsession vs. survival accrue through particulars rather than thesis. The final insight (“keep us in”) reweights prior images without moralizing. The whistle/pattern motif evolves from language to countdown, deepening subtext about communication and warning. Ambiguity around the watchers’ intent remains purposeful and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme—noble lie as survival and bridge—emerges through artifacts and timeline manipulation. However, several lines state the thesis outright (“Truth is not a weapon. It’s a seed.”; “The noble lie had been a bridge”), edging into moralizing and dampening subtext. The final image resonates, but ambiguity and implication could carry more of the burden.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Interlaced absence” operates via objects and acts (inkwell notes, preserved jars, initials) rather than sermonizing; the final image reweights prior material. One sentence edges toward thesis (“Abandoned dreams… not lost”), but it’s earned by concrete discovery and doesn’t flatten ambiguity. The theme integrates with the vocation and family legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Through particulars (ritual stamp, vault, algae light), the theme of truth vs. curated myth emerges, culminating in “lost to itself.” However, the journal’s explicit thesis and the closing “Some darknesses, once faced, become light” edge toward moralizing. The owl crest’s vigilance and blackout motif provide effective subtextual chords despite some telling.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of transformation-through-bearing rather than shedding is dramatized via craft and final stance; motifs (lanterns, cranes, descend/ascend) reweight at the end. Subtext operates through image (cranes finally fly when grief is made light). A few thesis‑adjacent lines (“Dreams are just grief with wings”; “This was her magic…”) tread close to telling but are supported by event. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of grief transmuted into power and awakening emerge from concrete action (entering the node, crystal shattering) rather than commentary. One line (“Unused potential... is anger. It’s grief.”) states the thesis a touch overtly, but it lands amid peak action and doesn’t collapse into moralizing. The final image—veins stretching to the horizon, caution tossed—reweights the premise with resonant ambiguity. Subtext around denial vs. ruthless clarity runs cleanly through Orion/Elara dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (alignment, prism, hum) support the thematic turn from object‑possession to resonant belonging. The pilgrim’s line “Belonging… It’s not a place. It’s a resonance.” tips into on‑the‑nose statement, reducing subtlety. The ending’s “Now we listen” restores some resonance by action rather than lecture. Overall, the theme emerges from particulars but is partially told.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of silence/erasure versus truth accrues through concrete images (“sieved hush,” driftwood tombstones) rather than abstract lecturing. The ending reweights the premise: mercy is reframed as costly truth-telling. A couple of explanatory lines (“He knew then…”) verge on telling but do not blunt resonance. Subtext operates well in motif and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs—neutral territory, synchronization, handles for mistakes—converge into a resonant meditation on fear vs. curiosity and the labor of forgiveness. Subtext operates through object use and silence at the exchange. A couple of lines verge on didactic (“Neutral territory isn’t a place. It’s a choice.”), but overall the piece lets image carry meaning. The ending reweights prior material without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically through images (compass as regret, poles as human stubbornness) and culminates in a resonant, non‑literal answer. A few explicit lines (“The world doesn’t bend. It just… waits.”) edge toward stating the thesis, but they’re earned by scene work. The last image recasts guidance as self‑authored without sentimentality. Subtext around inheritance and care (grandfather’s decline) enriches the ethical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres—memory, choice, empathy—as images reweight meaning (lake as mosaic, baseball as compass). However, J.T.’s line defining empathy leans into moral statement rather than subtext, reducing ambiguity. The final image carries resonance without sermonizing, restoring lift. Overall strong but slightly over‑articulated in the dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of metamorphosis, language beyond words, and kinship with the more‑than‑human accrue through particulars (fragrance as speech, creature offerings, ashes as dormant hearts). Subtext is mostly image‑driven and resolves in a reweighted bond. The explicit final sentence (“metamorphosis is not an ending, but a rebirth”) tips into thesis, dulling the resonance that the preceding image already carried. A touch more silence would have let the images do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Motifs (cards, saucer, handprints) accrue to a clear meditation on time, grief, and chosen repentance without heavy explanation. The final reweighting lands through image (new handprint, healed saucer) rather than summary. The explicit line “Repentance isn’t a place. It’s a choice.” edges into thesis, slightly thinning subtext in a peak moment. Despite that, the piece invites reflection beyond its plot.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of pacifism redefined as courageous engagement emerge through concrete beats (altar choice, “stitching” with understanding) and the ship/garden reconfiguration. Recurring images (tears, stitching, light) support a resonant reweighting. Occasional explicit statements tip toward moralizing and reduce subtext in the climax. Overall resonance is earned and lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres: transformation as textured, not tidy; the hush as the language of change reweights the final image. The repeated objects (bugs, jars, hush) carry subtext without heavy explanation in narration. However, lines like “Fixing isn’t transformation” verge on thesis statements and slightly blunt the implicit resonance. The ending’s acceptance earns feeling but skirts sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Knowledge as subversion and light vs. darkness recur effectively through sundial, quill, and blackout. Yet lines like “Let’s go spark a revolution” and the final paragraph’s assurance verge on thematic declaration rather than earned resonance. Subtext surfaces in the Council’s “test” notion but is not pressured into ambiguity. The ending affirms rather than reweights with a price.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—honoring patterns vs. imposing order—emerges through action and image (eels as language, space between objects). The final realization resonates, but the explicit phrasing “weren’t a puzzle to solve, but a language to honor” edges into thematic echo. Still, the obsidian‑centered cadence reweights prior beats with a quiet afterglow. Ambiguity remains purposeful rather than muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motifs (masks, scars, rarefaction, stars) cohere into a theme of stripping to essence. Subtext operates through image (timer as heartbeat, lightning as signature) and the earned move from vigil to reckoning. One explicit definition (“To rarefy: to purify...”) edges toward didactic, slightly reducing mystery. The final image reweights the material without a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—questions as journeys, translation over solution—is woven through tactics and images (card as stellar language), with a resonant reweighting at the end. However, explicit thesis lines (“And that…was the point all along”) and direct labeling (“dignified chaos”) slightly blunt subtext. The “destinations” vs. “directions” correction is an elegant, earned refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres through particulars—the tin, false bottom, berry ink, sorting as rebellion—culminating in a reframed ethos of resistance that seeds and soil metaphorically share with Marla. Subtext in their exchange avoids sermonizing; the daughter detail deepens stakes. The explicit thesis line risks didacticism but is refracted as a discovered note, not authorial moral. Final image (returning the tin to darkness) resonates as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Time, fate, and improvisation cohere through the clock/compass/piano braid; the unbroken clock below reweights the broken one above without sermonizing. The final line offers a resonant, non‑literal answer—answer chaos by choosing play now—avoiding tidy moral. Subtext surfaces in object contrasts rather than thesis statements. The ambiguity feels purposeful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece argues memory as compass rather than cage, dramatized via visions of oblivion vs. remembered song. The thematic statement via the chorus borders on overt, but is earned by the dream logic and charged images. Final repricing of the monsoon reweights prior material without tidy moralizing. Ambiguity remains about ongoing cost (“for now”), enriching resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Forgiveness, memory’s tides, and craft-as-language cohere through actions, not just assertion; bonsai and lace motifs accrue and reweight at the end. The “severance as door” reframes loss into passage with earned resonance. A few lines skate close to thematic declaration, but subtext largely carries the load. The ending image leaves a credible aftertaste without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding universal patterns of change in both the cosmic and the microscopic is developed with great subtlety and power. The story resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex view of scientific discovery and humility. A slight deduction is made for moments that verge on direct thematic statement, such as her presentation summary, though these are skillfully integrated into the character's voice and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding meaning in ephemeral moments emerges beautifully from the central images of glass, frost, and light. However, the discovery of the phrase *“In the pauses, the truth breathes”* is a significant flaw. This is a "Thematic Echo" that states the theme too directly, undermining the subtextual work done elsewhere and slightly cheapening an otherwise earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transforming trauma into a new form of communication is powerful and largely emerges organically from the story's events. However, the final act includes several lines of overt thematic statement, such as Elias's explanation ("She's not broken... She's just speaking a different language") and the narrator's summary. This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the subtext by explaining what had already been beautifully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of rest, memory, and renewal is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story leans on direct thematic statements, particularly in Marisol's dialogue ("To give rest a permanent address, you must first believe it exists") and the final two paragraphs. This explicit moralizing ("Elias Crane... had finally learned that rest wasn’t an end") replaces resonance with summary, a significant thematic echo that undermines an otherwise strong conceptual foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of turning survival into solidarity is potent and well-developed through the central metaphor of the bell. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic statement, particularly in the summary of Mira’s motivation and the slightly too-neat final lines. These moments of telling dilute the power of the otherwise resonant imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story explores its themes of love, perception, and rebirth with conceptual coherence. The final image of love residing "in the spaces between breaths" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the theme is weakened by explicit summary in the final paragraphs ("she knew the true revelation was not in the photographs but in the journey itself"), which feels like authorial moralizing and undercuts the power of the dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of time, memory, and narrative emerges organically from the plot. However, the ending suffers from a "thematic echo." The line "time wasn’t a texture to be touched, but a story to be told" is a direct, moralizing statement that replaces the resonance of a final image, slightly cheapening the earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of resilience is woven throughout the story, culminating in the final image of the seeds taking root. However, the resonance is undercut by the final paragraph's on-the-nose summary: "The world was broken, but resilience had been planted." This thematic echo explicitly states the moral, weakening the power of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of translating intangible loss into a tangible form emerges organically from the plot and character's actions, avoiding explicit moralizing. The network of images—rust, absence, fractured glass, dead trees—builds a coherent thematic texture. The story’s final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem of grief, perfectly reweighting the preceding events with a sense of profound, newly perceptible emptiness.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory, value, and creation emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the illuminated photograph provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central premise about 'stolen moments.' The final line, "The end, she thought, was just another beginning," borders on a thematic statement, a minor over-articulation that slightly tempers an otherwise subtle and powerful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding value in fracture is woven skillfully through the setting, object, and character backstory. However, the story undermines its own subtext by repeatedly stating its theme directly. Lines like "Perhaps this fracture is not a failure... but a map" and the concluding summary, "embracing the cracks that let the light in," fall into the trap of thematic echo, replacing earned resonance with explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of vulnerability as a form of power emerges organically from the character's phobias and actions. However, the story suffers significantly from stating its theme explicitly and repeatedly in the final third. The dialogue "I proved vulnerability is power" and the narration "vulnerability wasn’t a cage. It was a compass" function as overt moralizing, which replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary and undermines the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme—that absence is a layered presence, a language to be read—is explored with exceptional grace and specificity. The story avoids any overt statement, instead embodying its theme in the central action of mapping silence. The final image of the glowing map providing light in total darkness serves as a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central inquiry, leaving a lingering resonance of earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of consciousness emerging from the collision of memory and mundane experience is potent and well-integrated. However, the final exchange with the scientist slides into direct thematic summary. The line, “In the mundane. In the mysticism of the everyday,” is a Thematic Echo that articulates the story’s thesis too explicitly, slightly undermining the resonance that the preceding images had already earned. This prevents the theme from landing with the full power of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of communication beyond words is potent and well-integrated. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic summary. Lines like "Words, he realized, were overrated" and Lira’s pronouncements function like authorial morals, preventing the theme from emerging purely through the story’s potent imagery and action. This directness is a significant flaw in an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme is potent and beautifully integrated through the central metaphor of the cracked marbles. The story earns its insights through Elara's actions. However, the final two paragraphs slip into explicit moralizing, directly stating the theme ("In the end, it was not the algorithms... it was the willingness to adapt...") instead of trusting the resonant final image to do the work. This overt summary weakens an otherwise subtle and powerful thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of discovery as a perilous, unending process emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids moralizing, instead using the final image of Veyra reaching for the lever again as a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of scientific ambition. The "icy warmth" concept serves as a perfect thematic anchor for the tension between sterile procedure and passionate curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    The themes of unfinished art and communication with the past emerge organically from the story's particulars. The final image of the theater waiting is a powerful, non-literal resolution. However, the final paragraph veers close to summarizing its own theme with the line "...where ghosts and musicians speak the same language," slightly diminishing the subtextual power established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of quantitative versus intuitive knowledge is woven through every element with subtlety and power. The central motif of the bearberry—growing "where the world shows its cracks"—is perfectly integrated, culminating in a final line from the herbalist that reweights the entire story without a hint of moralizing. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to Lirael’s crisis, achieving a rare thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme—the horror of human greed outweighing supernatural dread—emerges organically from the plot and is powerfully crystallized in the final image of the valve wheel. The story resists a simple moral, leaving a complex emotional aftereffect. The score is slightly capped by the inclusion of a direct thematic statement ("He’d sought proof... but found something worse: human failure"), which verges on over-explaining the otherwise resonant subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of knowledge as a burden and freedom through release is woven into every element, from the sagging shelves to the abandoned swan. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant answer through the final image of the keeper returning, changed, to a library that now seems a "bridge" rather than a "chain." It’s a sophisticated and deeply integrated thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story's theme is poignant but delivered with too much directness, undermining its potential for resonance. Elara's dialogue often functions as a thesis statement (e.g., "Ordinary magic... is in the quiet moments"). The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the theme ("But mostly, it’s here. In the quiet. In the ordinary."), a form of moralizing that weakens the earned, imagistic conclusion and incurs a Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of attention versus indifference is beautifully integrated into the central mystery. However, Clara’s diary entries—"We stopped seeing the dragons because we stopped believing in them" and "It's the line between hearing and ignoring"—come dangerously close to stating the theme directly. This thematic echo slightly reduces the power of subtext, preventing the story from achieving flawless thematic resonance through purely emergent means.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of hidden truths and the power to shape fate ("open secrets") emerges organically from the plot. The story wisely avoids overt moralizing, allowing the theme to resonate through images like the microdots disguised as recipes and the fortunes as coded keys. The final fortune, "The key turns in the lock you forged," serves as a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question of agency, reweighting Elara's entire past and future.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of challenging hidden assumptions is woven deeply into the story's fabric, emerging organically from the priest's actions. The final image of a "dynamic equilibrium" is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about stillness and silence. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, such as "'Hidden assumptions,' he said, 'are the roots of all control,'" which comes close to summarizing its own meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of memory as a timeless symphony is woven beautifully through the story’s central images—the mirrored horizon, the nautilus shell, the fractured light. It emerges organically from Lirael's specific struggle rather than from direct statement. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her homesickness, achieving a complex emotional aftereffect without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of self-acceptance through embracing one's multifaceted nature emerges organically from the structure. The final images of the crumbling tablet and Mara walking on the ground are resonant and provide a non-literal answer to her quest. However, the story undermines its own subtlety with heavy-handed thematic statements in the final two paragraphs, such as "The labyrinth of self was conquered, not by escaping, but by embracing..." This direct moralizing significantly dulls the impact of an otherwise strong thematic close.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story's theme emerges powerfully from its core concept and central scene. However, the final paragraphs slip into thematic summary, explicitly stating what the climax had already dramatized ("she remembered: silence wasn’t the absence of sound. It was the space where emotion could breathe."). This thematic echo slightly undermines the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of bearing witness is clear but articulated too explicitly, bordering on authorial moralizing. Lines like "This, he realized, was why he recorded storms—not just to predict them, but to bear witness" function as thematic echo. The final image is strong, but the preceding direct statements dilute the power of discovery and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of inherited grief and memory is potent and emerges organically from the central premise. The vision scene is a powerful, non-literal exploration of this idea. The score is held back by the final two paragraphs, which lapse into direct thematic summary ("The perfume had shown her that grief wasn’t something to be feared; it was a testament to love..."). This "thematic echo" states the moral explicitly, reducing the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of choice and consequence is woven deeply through the story's central symbols. However, the final lines ("The texture of time is not in the choices you make, but in the patterns they leave") are a significant flaw. This is a thematic echo, a direct statement of the moral that undermines the subtlety built by the preceding imagery, preventing the story from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding potential in silence and ruin is beautifully woven through the story's imagery and central action. However, the score is significantly reduced by the explicit thematic statements in the final paragraphs. Lira’s declaration that the bowl “holds potential” and the narrator’s summary of finding “beauty in the unfinished” replaces resonant subtext with a direct, unnecessary moral, weakening an otherwise powerful ending.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of half-truths as a compassionate alternative to painful reality is compelling, its execution relies too heavily on direct statement. Lines like "the half truths I offer are not lies. They are… interpretations" and the summarizing final paragraph explicitly state the theme rather than letting it resonate through action and image. This thematic echo replaces the potential for earned, emergent meaning with a pre-packaged moral, significantly reducing the story's subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of noticing the unseen and the cyclical nature of small kindnesses is potent and well-integrated. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic statements, such as Clara’s articulated realization about compassion or the final paragraph’s summary of the "lingering music." These moments of telling dilute the power of the otherwise strong showing through images like the locket and the final ledger entry, constituting a minor "Thematic Echo" flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "webs of kinship" is coherent and central to the story's design. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the theme is frequently over-articulated through direct statements, such as Veyra’s line, "Only someone who believes in webs of kinship would seek them out." This functions as a "Thematic Echo," stating the story's thesis directly rather than allowing it to emerge solely from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story explores complex themes of time, perception, and hidden realities with subtlety and depth. The final image of Lila sketching the "madness" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest, beautifully avoiding a stated moral. While the grandmother’s quote is a touch explicit, it functions effectively as a piece of folklore that the story makes literal and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in imperfection and chaos is powerfully integrated through recurring imagery of chips, cracks, and mosaics. However, the story leans into direct thematic statements, particularly in the brother's quoted dialogue and Elara’s final realization ("The mathematics of emotion, she realized, wasn’t about solving equations but about embracing the chaos"). This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the subtext by explicitly stating what the imagery already conveys so beautifully, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of visibility versus invisibility emerges organically from the plot, but its articulation in the final third is too direct. Lines like “she needed to become visible” and “for the first time, she felt seen” function as thematic statements that preempt reader inference. The final paragraph's explicit declaration ("Tomorrow, she’d become visible") borders on moralizing, slightly reducing the resonance of the otherwise strong closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of transformation through surrender is coherent and central, but its delivery lacks subtext. The story repeatedly states its own thesis, culminating in the final exchange between Eleanor and Mara ("They're reconstructing." / "By releasing control."). This is a clear instance of "Thematic Echo," where characters articulate the theme in prompt-like language, replacing earned resonance with direct summary and significantly weakening the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of meaning-making (threshing vs. growing) is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story falters at the climax by stating its theme directly via the stranger's note: “Meaning isn’t threshed. It’s grown.” This is a classic "Thematic Echo," a significant flaw that replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, undercutting the subtext built through imagery and action.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of duality is well-integrated into the imagery and plot, contrasting the cave's initial brightness with the pilgrim's shadows. However, the story falters by having the pilgrim explicitly state the theme in dialogue: “Remember: brightness and darkness are twins.” This thematic echo undermines the subtext, replacing earned resonance with a direct moral, a significant flaw for a story aiming for this tier of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of history as a mosaic emerges organically from the plot structure. Unfortunately, the final paragraph succumbs to a "Thematic Echo," explicitly stating the story's moral: "history wasn’t a line, but a mosaic, each fragment a note in a symphony waiting to be played." This direct statement undermines the resonant power of the final image, replacing earned subtext with a tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of embracing new beginnings over stagnant habits emerges organically from the story's imagery and central conflict. However, this subtlety is abandoned at the climax. The woman's dialogue is a textbook example of "Thematic Echo," where the story's thesis is baldly stated ("The fortress isn’t a destination... It’s a choice. To speak the truths you’ve buried..."). This robs the ending of its resonant power by replacing earned insight with a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of connection across time and the value of non-rational ways of knowing emerges organically from the story’s events and imagery. The final line, "some truths are best felt, not explained," verges on stating the theme directly, but it arrives after the change is already earned, functioning more as a coda than a heavy-handed moral. Still, a more imagistic conclusion would have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of liberation from self-imposed prisons of loneliness and fear emerges organically from the plot. The amulets feeding on a "refusal to say goodbye" provides a sharp thematic focus. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a final, resonant image—Kael smiling as he falls into a "symphony of possibilities"—that beautifully answers the central question of whether change is worth the terror it entails.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of intelligence and fairness ("math") versus corrupt power is coherent and emerges from the plot. However, the story resorts to direct thematic statements in its final paragraphs, particularly the line about "waiting actively was the boldest breach of all." This over-articulation weakens the resonance, stating the moral instead of letting the preceding action imply it.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of invented histories and memory emerges organically from the story's particulars for most of its length. However, the final two paragraphs slip into direct thematic statements, particularly "she was a guardian of memories, a weaver of tales" and the final sentence's list of abstractions ("power of invention, the beauty of restraint"). This thematic echo slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext by stating the moral too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of constructing an identity from fragmented histories is woven skillfully through the narrative. The poison label's text, "Not for the remembering," serves as a powerful, recurring motif that is thematically re-weighted at the end. The final image of Marcus facing the harbor provides a resonant, non-literal answer to his initial quest, avoiding a simplistic moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of logic versus wonder is beautifully woven through the narrative, emerging organically from Lira's struggle. The final image of her humming under the stars is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final sentence ("The universal riddle...wasn’t meant to be decoded. It was meant to be felt.") is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the preceding scene-work, incurring a penalty for telling the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of authentic, structured chaos versus sterile, corporate order emerges organically from the conflict. The story’s final image—Lira with the chip, the carnival’s "chaos tempered by purpose"—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central thematic question. It smartly avoids moralizing, leaving the reader with a complex sense of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme is the story's core strength, emerging organically from the central conflict between human touch and automated efficiency. The recurring motif of outlasting time is handled deftly, culminating in the archivist’s discovery. While potent, the final concluding sentence feels slightly like a thematic summary ("...a quiet, persistent truth in the archives of time"), slightly overstating the feeling the preceding paragraphs had already perfectly evoked through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding clarity through unconventional perception emerges organically from the plot and character. The central metaphor of light refracted through water is beautifully sustained and offers a resonant answer to the story's central question. However, Marlow's line, "Listening's a kind of seeing," verges on a thematic echo, explicitly stating a conclusion the story has already demonstrated, which slightly undermines the subtext and prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of representation versus reality is powerfully developed through the central metaphor of maps. The conclusion with Jorn, "Maps are lies... To remind us there’s always more to find," is a potent, character-driven insight. However, the final narrative paragraph slightly undermines this by stating the theme too directly ("Some truths were meant to be chased, not caught"), a minor instance of thematic echo that slightly lessens the resonance of the preceding, perfectly executed dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of restoration through listening and rhythm is beautifully woven into the narrative's actions and imagery. However, the final two paragraphs pivot from showing to telling, explicitly stating the theme in a way that flattens its resonance ("...rebuilt not with hammers or mortar, but with patience..."). This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern undermines the subtext and lands as a didactic moral, significantly weakening an otherwise powerful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of preservation versus release is woven beautifully through the narrative, culminating in a powerful insight. However, the final sentence—"some things are meant to be unsnarled, not held"—is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the resonant power of the preceding images. This instance of telling the moral, rather than letting it emerge purely from the action, is the story's most significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The themes of legacy, truth, and the power of narrative are seamlessly integrated. The final image of Elias as the author of his own story provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. The revelation that "the lattice wasn’t just a key—it was a pen, and the labyrinth a page" is powerful, though its directness borders on stating the theme, holding it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    The themes of intertwined love and venom, and debt paid through understanding, are potent. Unfortunately, the story undermines its own subtext by stating its themes directly in the final paragraphs. The line "The debt is paid not in blood, but in understanding" and Elara’s subsequent epiphany ("She understood now that...") function as thematic summaries, a critical flaw that replaces earned resonance with overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of mending, resilience, and reverence emerges organically from the protagonist's actions. The final image of the refilling tide pools provides a powerful, resonant answer to the opening image without resorting to a simplistic moral. However, the last sentence ("a reminder that even broken precedents could be mended...") comes very close to stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the otherwise masterful subtext and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of faith as an active choice rather than inherited dogma emerges organically from Lirael's actions. The narrative avoids moralizing, instead using the final image—the shrine, glowing but incomplete, being "enough"—as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. This ending powerfully recontextualizes "restoration" not as a return to the past, but as the start of a living, imperfect future.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of reinventing the past through a fusion of old and new technology is woven throughout the story's imagery and plot. However, the final paragraph includes the line, "Futuristic nostalgia wasn’t about clinging to the past—it was about reinventing it," which is an overt thematic statement. This slightly weakens the ending by telling the reader what has already been powerfully shown, violating the principle of earned resonance and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of hidden truths and art as resistance emerges organically from the story’s central conceit. While the line "the truth is never a straight line" verges on being too direct, it is immediately followed by a powerful visual demonstration that earns the statement. The final image of the unraveling galaxy provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions without resorting to a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding beauty and resilience in brokenness emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery—the fragmented letters, the smoothed shard, the mending roots. The final image of the shard offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by the spirits' final message ("Go. Live. Speak."), which, while effective, verges on stating the theme directly rather than leaving it fully implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of translation as an act of grafting hope onto trauma is developed with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the central metaphors. The final image provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The piece narrowly misses a higher score due to a few moments of interiority that verge on stating the theme directly, such as, "she saw it as alchemy—turning shared anxieties into shared hope." While brief, this slightly lessens the resonance that the images had already powerfully established on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of rediscovering communal memory and hope emerges organically from the story’s central images. The fresco fragment and light-paintings serve as powerful, concrete carriers of meaning. However, the "exposed film" metaphor, while apt, is articulated a bit too explicitly in a block of reflection. This moment of direct explanation slightly undermines the subtextual power that the rest of the story builds so effectively, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of curiosity versus certainty is potent and emerges organically from the story’s central conflict. However, the resonance is diminished by Dr. Lysander's explicit thematic statements, such as “Curiosity begets curiosity. Certainty is a cage.” This on-the-nose articulation functions as a thematic echo, reducing subtext and preventing the category from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of covert resistance through natural patterns is compelling and consistently woven through the narrative. However, it is occasionally delivered too explicitly, bordering on thematic statement. Lines like “After thoughts become taxable, we’ll need covert alphabets” and “we plant our truths where they can’t be erased” function almost as thesis sentences. The story's strongest thematic moment is the subtextual irony of the news reporting the defiant message as "mysterious bioluminescent art," which offers the kind of resonant ambiguity the direct statements lack.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.4)
    The central theme, encapsulated in the “blossom armistice,” emerges with grace and power from the story’s particulars. The narrative avoids moralizing, instead allowing the final image of the singing tree and Lira’s own song to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to her centuries-long struggle. The integration of motifs—nebula, moss, wind—is seamless and elevates the theme of coexistence beyond a simple platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of preservation as evolution rather than stasis is potent and well-integrated. However, it is slightly weakened by being stated too directly in both narration ("preservation wasn’t about freezing time...") and dialogue ("You’ve preserved the act of remembering."). While the final image of a new emotion rising is a powerful, non-literal answer, these thematic statements in the final third feel like unnecessary summary, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of trust and communication is expertly woven through the central metaphor of language. The story builds resonance organically through the puzzle-solving process. However, it falters by explicitly stating its theme in key moments, most notably in Elara's phone call to Mira ("A symphony of truth. It’s about… promises. And trust."). This thematic echo in a pivotal scene undermines the subtext and feels like an unnecessary summary for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of harmonizing conflicting values is potent but over-articulated, bordering on thematic summary. Phrases like "To harmonize conflicting values" appear multiple times, and the final paragraph states the theme directly ("turning encrypted fear into open-hearted truth"). This explicit moralizing undermines the powerful subtext carried by the setting and the final decrypted message, preventing the theme from emerging organically from the particulars of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of truth, memory, and legacy is handled with impressive subtlety and depth. It emerges organically from the central symbols—fragile paper trails versus persistent echoes—without ever feeling didactic. The final image of Elias walking toward the horizon, with the "echo...blooming and withering all at once," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, embracing complexity over a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of "necessary distances" and "sacred thresholds" is artfully woven through image and action, culminating in the powerful final beat of Lira creating her own language. However, the father's dialogue ("Sometimes you have to walk away to see how close you are") is a moment of thematic echo, stating the core idea too directly. This small authorial intrusion slightly undermines the subtext and prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of belonging is central and developed through evocative imagery, particularly the sea/sky contrast. However, the story undermines its subtext by explicitly stating its conclusions in the final third. The line "belonging was not about fitting into a preconceived mold but about finding one’s place in the grand, chaotic symphony of existence" is a Thematic Echo that replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral, weakening an otherwise poignant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story explores a nuanced theme of memory, loss, and acceptance. The final image of paths being "released" to avoid pain is a powerful thematic answer. However, the theme is articulated a little too directly in the final paragraphs. Lines like “Because holding onto them hurts too much” and the concluding sentence slightly undermine the subtext by stating the moral, bordering on a "Thematic Echo" that reduces the resonance of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of ordering chaos is thoughtfully integrated into the story's events, it is severely weakened by explicit, repetitive statements. The dialogue ("You're... ordering the chaos") and the final paragraph's summary act as thematic moralizing, explaining the story's point to the reader rather than allowing it to resonate through action and image alone. This is a significant flaw that undermines the piece's literary potential.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of identity and memory versus forced erasure emerges organically from the central conflict. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a complex portrait of defiance as personal maintenance, not open revolution. The final image of Lirael at the garden's edge provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her struggle, beautifully captured in the reprise of "obsidian grace."

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding value in the mundane emerges organically from the imagery of light, glass, and water. However, the story falters at the end by stating its theme directly. The notebook entry, "even the smallest things can hold the light of the world," is a Thematic Echo that replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral, significantly weakening the final moment's subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of transformation through destruction is skillfully woven through the narrative, emerging from Elias's profession, his scars, and the central symbols. The final image of the hourglass offers a resonant, non-literal answer to his pain. A minor weakness is the line, "His pain, too, could be a kind of fertilizer," which verges on stating the theme directly rather than letting it remain purely subtextual.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of hope as a constructed, tactile practice is developed organically through the story's central conceit. The narrative avoids didacticism, allowing the theme to emerge from Elara’s actions and the final, earned insight that "equations for hope weren’t abstract." The closing image of the grotto's mouth "about to speak" is a resonant, non-literal grace note that perfectly encapsulates the story’s blend of scientific inquiry and wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thematic exploration of legacy, memory, and ecological change is rich and deeply integrated. The film negative and the diaries serve as potent, evolving motifs. The final image of the locket and the whisper "You are the map" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The only minor weakness is the explicit thematic statement, "The legacy’s burden is not in the keeping, but in the sharing," which is slightly on-the-nose, though its impact is immediately dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story explores themes of memory, grief, and art's power to create reality with grace and subtlety. The concept emerges organically from the character's actions rather than through exposition. The final image of the woman in the meadow provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding a tidy moral for a more powerful emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of costly compromise is central, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The story explicitly states its theme multiple times with phrases like "The price of redemption, she knew..." and "...the flawed beauty of compromise." This direct moralizing, a form of "Thematic Echo," undermines the subtext and prevents the theme from emerging organically from the events, reading more like an assertion than an earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges with superb subtlety from the story's particulars. The tension between destruction and preservation, memory and progress, is explored without a single line of moralizing. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about meaning, leaving the reader with a complex and unsettling emotional aftereffect. It is a masterclass in earning thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of artistic defiance against enforced conformity is coherent, but its delivery is too explicit. Phrases like "defy the lullaby of conformity" and the final paragraph's "symphony of resistance" function as authorial summaries rather than allowing meaning to emerge solely from image and action. This thematic over-articulation, especially at the end, borders on moralizing and undermines the subtextual power of the central dance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of ethical ambiguity is explored with nuance, culminating in the resonant campfire metaphor. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly direct thematic statements. Mara’s line ("stories are like campfires...") and Elias’s final declaration about bars ("the perfect place to tell the truth") function as Thematic Echoes that state the theme too explicitly, slightly reducing its emergent power.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of honoring transient, overlooked lives is potent and well-integrated into the story’s core action. However, the execution is hampered by thematic over-statement. The final sentence, "And somewhere, in the vastness of the sky, the moth’s spirit would smile," is a significant misstep into sentimentality that undermines the story's quiet dignity. This explicit moralizing replaces earned resonance with a simplistic, cliché image, constituting a major flaw at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    The themes of memory, preservation, and light-versus-fire emerge organically from the story's central images and actions. The punched card and the woven rope are powerful, resonant symbols. Unfortunately, the final sentence—"He’d illuminated the past, not with fire, but with light reconfigured from memory"—is an on-the-nose thematic statement. This "thematic echo" explicitly summarizes the story's meaning, undercutting the earned resonance of the preceding images.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of integrating opposites (decay/renewal, order/chaos) emerges organically from character and setting. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its theme directly, as in "to transcend was not to escape, but to integrate," which qualifies as a Thematic Echo that slightly weakens the subtext and pulls the score down.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme exploring the tension between empirical knowledge and internal truth emerges organically from the plot. The story's final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, a few lines from the disembodied voice, such as "You’ve bridged the empirical and the ironic," verge on thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise excellent subtext by stating what the story has already effectively shown.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of letting go is handled with sincerity but lacks subtlety. The story suffers from multiple instances of "Thematic Echo," where characters and narration state the theme directly (e.g., "letting go was not weakness, but strength"). The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("grace had shifted. And that was enough"), which replaces resonant imagery with a stated lesson, significantly weakening the piece's literary power.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of navigating boundaries between the seen and unseen is woven seamlessly through image and action. The narrative avoids didacticism, allowing the concept to emerge organically from the central conceit. The final image of the inward-pointing sextant offers a sophisticated, non-literal answer to the story's central question, transforming a quest for something external into a journey of internal perception.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of mending, endurance, and finding value in the discarded are potent and emerge organically from the story's central action. However, the final third of the narrative explicitly summarizes its own meaning. Lines like "Lira had learned that wisdom wasn’t found in grand contracts..." and the direct reference to "accidental wisdom" function as thematic moralizing, which weakens the resonance of the otherwise powerful final images.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of inheritance as an act of choice rather than a passive reception is seamlessly woven into the narrative. It emerges organically from the plot, culminating in Elara’s physical act of fusing the cameo to the tree. The final sentence, "Some truths were meant to be lived, not exhibited," provides a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the story's central question, perfectly reweighting her entire professional life against this profound personal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of knowledge versus intuition (or acknowledged ignorance) is woven beautifully into the plot, culminating in the test at the Door and with the guardian. The resolution is an action, not a lecture. The score is slightly limited by the final paragraph, which verges on a "Thematic Echo" by explicitly stating the story's lesson: "The library’s lessons weren’t just written—they were felt..."

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of memory, identity, and the choice to remember is woven skillfully through the narrative rather than stated outright. The final image of sewing their name into the soil provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. Veyra's repurposed phrase, "Blissfully aberrant," reweights the entire story with a new, earned meaning, avoiding a simplistic moral and achieving a powerful thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of translating chaos into order is well-integrated into the plot mechanics and imagery. However, the story leans too heavily on direct statement, especially at the climax. The line "she was a weaver of timelines, a translator of chaos" is a textbook Thematic Echo that replaces resonance with an explicit label. This undermines the subtext and makes the ending feel more like a summary than an earned, resonant insight.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding harmony by integrating disruption, rather than eliminating it, emerges organically from the plot. The final image powerfully encapsulates this idea. The story avoids a simplistic moral, offering a complex resolution. The final two sentences verge on stating the theme directly, which slightly reduces the subtextual resonance, but the execution is otherwise elegant and avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of finding hope and meaning in fragments emerges organically from the story’s central actions and imagery. However, the final paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary, particularly the line "...coincidences are not random—they are the universe’s way of whispering, *Keep going*." This overt moralizing undermines the resonance that was otherwise skillfully built through subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of memory and identity emerges organically from the story's powerful imagery, especially the idea that "The past is not a straight line. It bends." However, the resonance is significantly undercut by the explicit thematic statement in the final third: "To sculpt identity...wasn’t about holding onto the past—it was about letting it shape you." This moment of telling what was already beautifully shown is a notable flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of finding potential in failure ("shadows bloom") emerges organically from the story's central images and actions. The mentor's advice serves as a recurring motif that is re-contextualized and fulfilled at the climax. The final image of Lira "becoming fire" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial hopelessness, avoiding any hint of a simplistic moral. The epiphany feels earned, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of transition and the value of indirect patience emerges organically from the setting, character, and central symbol. The final image powerfully answers the story's central question without a neat moral. The score is held back slightly by the dialogue at the end ("some transitions aren't meant to be rushed"), which borders on a thematic echo, explicitly stating what the preceding scene had so beautifully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding growth in loss is potent, but the execution in the final paragraphs is heavy-handed. The resolution succumbs to thematic summary, explicitly stating the moral with lines like "the silences she collected weren’t just flavors anymore; they were seeds." This replaces earned resonance with an explanation of it, a significant flaw that undermines an otherwise subtle story.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of perception versus reality regarding silence emerges organically from the story’s events. The final insight avoids becoming a simple moral by being rooted in Elara's specific, personal discovery. The final image of her moving forward with a new purpose offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial question, beautifully capping the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of legacy and self-realization is thoughtfully integrated, culminating in the resonant metaphor of the throne as a mirror. The final image provides a non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the execution is slightly weakened by overly direct thematic statements like “The stairway of ascension had been a metaphor,” which explain the subtext rather than allowing it to emerge solely from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of isolation versus connection is powerfully explored through action and imagery, particularly the "linking through scars" concept. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its theme in dialogue. The line "I need to teach suffocating to breathe" is a classic thematic echo that replaces subtext with a direct, authorial-sounding assertion, preventing the theme from emerging fully through organic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of translating trauma into resilience is woven throughout, from Mara's backstory to the final image. The story smartly externalizes this internal process through the physical metaphor of pressure-diamonds. The final line is resonant, but the device’s explicit message, *“Diamonds are a metaphor,”* borders on a thematic echo, slightly overstating a concept the narrative had already successfully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of silence being a form of eloquent action emerges organically and powerfully, reframing the dynasty's history. The final image of the tomb becoming a cradle is resonant. However, the score is capped by thematic statements in the final paragraphs ("The dynasty's end was not a tragedy but a rebirth") that feel like direct summary, slightly undermining the subtext by stating the moral instead of letting the final image carry it alone.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of freedom versus control is elegantly developed through the central metaphor of the marionette strings and the evolving text of the program. The final resonant image powerfully answers the story's central question. A minor deduction is for the final paragraph, which verges on summarizing the theme ("The alchemists had forgotten that. He would not.") rather than letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme is the story's great strength, emerging organically from the central image of the button and Elias's personal history. The idea of magnifying "small kindnesses hidden in the gaps" is earned through his investigation. The final image of him beginning to write offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about honoring the forgotten. The final paragraph risks over-stating the theme, but it's framed as Elias's personal realization, which saves it from becoming mere authorial moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of fighting erasure (“revised histories,” “Let them be forgotten”) emerges organically from the plot. The key acts as a perfect symbol, connecting past rebellion to present action. The story’s final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict, avoiding overt moralizing and allowing the theme to land with subtlety and power.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of containing dangerous knowledge through deliberate silence emerges organically from the central conflict. The concept of "negative space" is a brilliant unifying motif, connecting the musical method, the setting's liminal quality, and the thematic goal of keeping truths hidden. The story avoids moralizing, ending on a resonant image of temporary peace that beautifully encapsulates the central question without offering a simple answer. The final image powerfully recharges the story's core ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of listening to hidden languages—in folklore, in nature—emerges organically from the plot without a single line of overt moralizing. The story's final image of Elinor ready for action provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the narrative's central question. Subtext is carried effectively through the contrast between Elinor’s meticulous work and the intuitive, magical act she performs.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty emerges organically from the story's core symbols (clocks vs. compass). The final image of the random clockwork garden is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the story suffers from a "Thematic Echo" penalty; the journal entry "*To befriend uncertainty in planning...is to trust the current*" explicitly states the theme, which slightly diminishes the power of the otherwise excellent final image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The themes of balance, memory, and acceptance are woven well through the kintsugi metaphor and the concept of names holding weight. However, the story falters at the climax by having Lira explicitly state the theme. Her line, “By admitting that some questions don’t have answers, but that doesn’t make them any less true,” is a Thematic Echo that replaces earned resonance with a direct moral, significantly undermining the subtext built earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of healing's complexity is developed with nuance through the central symbols of the harp and the tooth. However, the final two paragraphs slip into thematic summary. The line "Healing, she realized, was not a destination—it was a pursuit..." directly states the story's thesis, a moment of telling that slightly undermines the resonant, image-driven conclusion that precedes it, constituting a thematic echo that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central theme is explored with sophistication through the recurring metaphor of "the mathematics of mercy," which is powerfully reweighted at the end. Subtext is carried effectively through the environment and the symbolism of the pewter strap. The score is limited by the woman’s dialogue, which functions as a thematic echo, stating the story's conclusion directly rather than allowing it to remain fully emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of honoring hidden details is coherent but its delivery is severely flawed by explicit moralizing. The final three paragraphs contain multiple instances of characters and narration directly stating the story's thesis. This "thematic echo" replaces earned resonance with a summary, most notably in the final line: "...to honor the overlooked was to anchor oneself in the eternal instant..."

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of acknowledging hidden grief and forgotten histories emerges organically from the narrative's particulars. The central metaphor of "cracks in the façade" is expertly woven into both the physical setting and the emotional backstory. The story achieves a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question without resorting to overt moralizing, though the line "The cracks...weren’t just physical—they were emotional, historical" verges on being slightly too explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story develops a potent theme of creative destruction, contrasting restrictive perfection with chaotic awakening. This theme emerges organically from the imagery and action for most of the narrative. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its thesis: "The rupture was not destruction but transformation. The library’s perfect order had been a cage..." This moment of thematic summary undercuts the subtext, a significant misstep that prevents the story from reaching the highest tier of literary craft.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of truth versus constructed narrative is woven through every element, culminating in the potent metaphor of covering mirrors. The story largely avoids didacticism, allowing the theme to emerge from Kael’s actions. The final sentence, "Civilizations...were built on the courage to see what mirrors hide," borders on being an overt thematic statement, but feels earned by the preceding events. It successfully re-frames the story’s central conflict without feeling like a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story masterfully dramatizes its central theme of truth and healing through its core conceits. However, the final paragraph engages in thematic summary ("the covenant’s creed was not just a philosophy but a kind of magic..."). This statement, while true to the story, is a form of telling that slightly diminishes the resonance of the final image by explaining the magic the reader has just witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of embracing mystery over certainty is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, its delivery is marred by Thematic Echo. Lines like "not answers, but the absence of them" and her whisper, "You were looking for the place where explanations fail," state the theme too directly, replacing resonant implication with a summary that feels like an authorial intrusion at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from a severe case of thematic echo, explicitly stating its central idea multiple times, most problematically in the final paragraphs ("The island’s complexity wasn’t a burden; it was a tapestry, and simplicity was the thread..."). This direct moralizing replaces subtext and earned resonance with a summary, preventing the theme from emerging organically from the narrative's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges with subtlety and power from the story's central images: the night-blooming flowers and the layered glass. The final image of the "unbroken" layer provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. However, the penultimate paragraph dips into thematic summary ("Flowers bloom at night not in defiance, but in communion"), a moment of telling that slightly undermines the otherwise masterful showing.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of history's fragility and the battle against erasure emerges organically from the plot. The antagonist’s line, “History’s written by the victors,” is a slightly on-the-nose thematic statement that borders on echo. The final image's resonance is significantly dulled by the logical confusion of the ending, leaving the story's ultimate thematic statement feeling ambiguous by default rather than by design.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of memory as a form of resurrection is poignant and well-integrated. However, the final paragraph resorts to direct thematic statements ("not a resurrection, but a reimagining," "a silent testament to the power of conception"), which over-explains the concept and slightly diminishes the resonance of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of memory, resonance, and latent meaning is masterfully woven through concrete particulars—the wax grooves, the tree's creak, the forgotten hum. The story resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex, resonant answer in the final image of Voss waiting to listen. The central concept ("The roots remember what the leaves forget") is reprised with a new, chilling weight at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic exploration of inheritance, sacrifice, and paradox is strong, and the final image of the oak sapling offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. The theme is slightly weakened by moments of direct explanation, such as "The vortex inheritance was a dance of decay and rebirth," which states the theme rather than allowing it to emerge solely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "favoring listening over noise" emerges organically from the conflict and is beautifully dramatized in the climax. However, the story undermines its own subtext with explicit thematic statements in the final act. Veyra’s dialogue and the concluding narrative summary ("she’d switched her approach...") state the moral directly, functioning as a "Thematic Echo" that reduces the resonant power of the final image by explaining it to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of reconciling science and spirit emerges organically from the central conflict and the story's key images, particularly the final one. However, the last two paragraphs slip into direct thematic summary, which undermines the earned resonance of the preceding scene. Lines like "the real work happened in the margins" and "the universe paused to acknowledge her" state the moral rather than allowing the image of the stardust to carry the full weight of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of releasing the past versus preserving it in silence emerges organically from the central images of the box and the ghosts. The final image of the shattered glass is a potent, non-literal resolution. However, the story's final sentence ("The tangled covenant had been untangled, and the weight of unspoken words had been lifted") is a thematic echo that summarizes the outcome, slightly undermining the power of the preceding scene by stating what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory, time, and entropy is woven organically through the story's central images, culminating in a resonant, non-literal final paragraph. The piece skillfully avoids a simplistic moral. A slight deduction is for the line, "The architect had been right to fear entropy; it was the thief of context," which borders on being an overt thematic statement that slightly reduces the subtextual power of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in transience and imperfection emerges organically from Lira's actions. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of direct thematic summary. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("the act of creation mattered more than its permanence," "In the incomplete, in the transient, lay the deepest beauty"), which feels like a Thematic Echo that slightly lessens the resonance of an otherwise beautifully rendered concept.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of connection versus separation, and creation in the face of mortality, emerges organically from the story’s central metaphor. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is capped by the dialogue at the climax ("You build walls... We build boxes... This is a bridge"), which functions as a Thematic Echo, stating the theme a bit too plainly and reducing the potential for subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic exploration of authenticity, belief, and belonging is sophisticated and emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids a simple moral, instead offering a resonant final image that re-contextualizes the central concept of an "artificial pilgrimage." Kael’s explanation that the tower and sculptures are "mirrors" is a powerful thematic beat that elegantly reframes the entire narrative without feeling like an authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of renewal from ruin is developed with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the character's actions and the charged setting. The final image of flowers like "tiny flames" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the explicit definition of *Khalis* as "the narrow vastness of hope" borders on thematic statement, a slight abstraction that pulls back from perfect embodiment just shy of the story's peak.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding connection through shared memory in a broken world is poignant and well-developed through the central metaphor. The final image of the community around the leaf provides a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, such as Jeb's "We've been mending with stories all along" and the direct use of the phrase "tinted revelations" at the climax, which reads like a label.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of turning confusion into exploration emerges organically from the story's central metaphor. However, the final act suffers from a thematic echo in the line, "True north wasn’t a place, he understood. It was a willingness to move..." This explicit statement undermines the subtext, stating the moral rather than allowing the final image to carry the full weight of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.5)
    A coherent theme about embracing mystery to find balance emerges, but its delivery is flawed by overt moralizing. The final two paragraphs explicitly state the story's thesis ("the greatest wonder was the courage to swap the familiar for the mysterious"), a significant "thematic echo" that replaces resonant imagery with a pre-packaged moral. This undermines the subtext and treats the reader with a heavy hand.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of agency and the historical importance of the "pawns" emerges organically from the central metaphor of the chessboard. The story avoids didacticism, allowing the final image and Elara's realization to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. The final sentence skirts the edge of over-statement but lands as a declaration of purpose, preserving the story's earned thematic power.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of memory shaping identity is woven organically into the premise. The final image of obsidian-flecked skin is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final two paragraphs suffer from Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the conclusions ("It’s not here, or there. It’s in the act of remembering," and "...its purpose remained: to seed the world with truth..."). This direct moralizing undermines the resonance of the preceding action, substituting summary for subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of guilt, consequence, and forgiveness are woven skillfully through the central metaphors of chess and tapestry. The final image of the repaired tapestry provides good resonance. However, the story comes too close to stating its theme directly with lines like, "To forgive himself, he had to accept that some threads couldn’t be untangled—only woven into something new," which slightly undermines the subtext by offering a neat moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the core theme is potent and visually represented, the execution is marred by explicit statements in the final paragraphs. Lines like “The truth, refracted, was everywhere now” and the final sentence on the price of forgiveness function as a thematic summary. This replaces earned resonance with a stated moral, weakening the subtext at the crucial final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of honoring imperfection (kintsugi) is woven deeply into the narrative's fabric. The final image powerfully answers the story’s central question without resorting to a simple moral. However, the theme is stated too explicitly in key moments, such as, “The kintsugi isn’t in the gold... It’s in the *choice* to mend.” This thematic echo in the dialogue and interiority verges on telling the reader the moral, slightly undermining the superb subtextual work done by the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding permanence in the ephemeral emerges powerfully through resonant images like the cracked mirror and the "temporary eternity" shell. The story builds its meaning through subtext and atmosphere with admirable restraint for most of its length. This is significantly undermined by an explicit thematic statement in the final paragraph that summarizes the moral, a heavy-handed flaw that turns an earned epiphany into a lesson plan.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme that quiet intent holds more power than overt force is woven through every element of the story, from backstory to the final image. The ending offers a perfect, non-literal proof of the story's central question. However, Thalos’s line, “Shouts drown in the noise; whispers slip through cracks,” verges on a direct thematic statement. While delivered plausibly as wisdom, it slightly reduces the subtextual power of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of memory as a navigable space is brilliantly woven into every element, from the "patchwork navigator" to the "ghosts of the old routes." The story avoids any overt statement, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the central conceit and the final, resonant image. The ending offers a powerful, non-literal answer to the problem of loss, suggesting it can be mapped and traversed, but never erased, achieving a profound and lingering effect.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme exploring the duality of truth as both a tool for connection and a weapon is nuanced and well-integrated. The concept of "occluding" with truth is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is capped by the final two sentences, which lapse into a direct thematic statement (“safety isn’t just a feeling—it’s a choice”), replacing resonant ambiguity with a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of memory, guilt, and transferred burdens is explored with nuance. The story avoids a simple moral by showing the captain’s desperate, destructive attempt at self-preservation. The final line, “It's about carrying what isn't yours,” risks being an overly explicit thematic statement, but it is sufficiently earned by Elias's personal history to avoid feeling like a tacked-on moral.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in the journey rather than a magical destination emerges organically from the plot. The final image powerfully resonates with this idea. However, the final two paragraphs slip into thematic summary, explicitly stating the moral ("The doorway... wasn’t a place to escape but a mirror," "The lingering promise had been kept: not in the cavern, but in the journey"). This direct articulation, a "Thematic Echo," undermines the subtext and prevents the piece from achieving true thematic excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.7)
    The core theme—self-confrontation and fear masked as apathy—is potent and well-supported by the central metaphor of the "bleeding starlight." Unfortunately, the theme is made overly explicit in the climax. The entity's line, "The starlight bleeds because you bleed," is a thematic echo that states the story's meaning directly, undermining the subtext carefully built through imagery and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of reframing failure through perspective is central and well-integrated into the plot. However, the final paragraphs veer into explicit summary, stating the theme directly (“The palette of resolve wasn’t a tool—it was a philosophy”). This over-articulation weakens the resonance of the final image, replacing earned subtext with a moralizing statement.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of memory as an act of creation rather than record is potent and well-woven through the story's imagery. The final image of the blank scroll filling itself is a powerful thematic moment. However, the final paragraph lapses into overt thematic statement ("The feral nostalgia wasn’t a curse—it was a compass... I wasn’t trapped in the past; I was *building* it"), which slightly undermines the subtext by explaining the epiphany the reader has just witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of resilience and finding meaning in loss emerges organically from the story’s particulars. The final image of the fog lifting provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. However, the final paragraph dips slightly into thematic summary ("a tapestry of resilience"), which is a minor weakness that prevents a higher score by stating what the preceding action had already beautifully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of transforming pain into power is skillfully woven through the narrative via the central imagery of scars, runes, and the act of "shedding." The story earns its resonance through Kael's struggle. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a direct thematic statement: "to transform pain into power, one must first shed the lies that cage the heart," which replaces a resonant image with a less powerful moral, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of resolving guilt through imperfect acceptance is powerful and well-supported by the central metaphor. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like “She’s a resonance. A memory stuck in the loop of your guilt” and Clara’s repeated "imperfect miracles" line function as thematic echo, explaining the story’s mechanics to the reader instead of letting the final resonant image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of truth as a continuous internal journey is coherent and emerges from the story's central symbols (the library, the dictionary). The final image of the blank pages is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's question. However, the final paragraphs veer close to thematic summary, particularly the line "...the understanding that truth was not a destination but a continuous process of unification," which feels like an unnecessary explanation of what the preceding scene already showed.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of time, memory, and longing emerges organically from the story’s central images—the clocks, the fjord, the key. The final paragraph risks overstating the theme, but frames it as Lorn’s internal epiphany ("he... finally understood"), which reads as an earned Conceptual Repricing rather than authorial moralizing. This directness slightly tempers the subtext, but the resonance of the final image remains powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of "surrender as strength" is handled with excessive directness, robbing it of resonance. Characters explicitly state the theme in dialogue and interiority multiple times (“the real challenge is… letting go,” “the physics of letting go,” “the strongest defense is surrender”). This thematic moralizing, especially in the final paragraphs, functions as an authorial summary rather than allowing meaning to emerge from subtext and image.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of "lucid contradictions" is beautifully integrated, emerging organically from character, setting, and action rather than being stated until the resolution. The final line from Ms. Greer ("Contradictions aren’t traps. They’re mirrors.") doesn't feel like a moral; it's an earned re-pricing of the story's central concept. The final image of Clara resolving to visit her father provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her grief, perfectly satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding connection in disconnection is potent but its delivery lacks subtlety. The story resorts to explicit thematic statements ("teach endings how to begin") and summarizes its own moral in the final paragraph ("a reminder that even wrong numbers could lead somewhere right"). This thematic echo preempts reader discovery and flattens the subtext, transforming resonant ideas into a direct message.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is handled with remarkable sophistication, emerging organically from the story’s central images rather than through declaration. The final realization that the covenant is "a story to be told, again and again" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of preservation. The piece avoids sentimentality and offers a complex, satisfying meditation on memory, ritual, and the power of sustained attention. The final image of the jetty sighing is a perfect, quiet coda.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story explores its themes of loneliness, reciprocity, and connection with nuance and originality. The central concept is elegantly revealed through action and imagery, culminating in the ghost’s powerful reframing of loneliness. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding moralizing and leaving the reader with a lingering sense of complex hope. This is thematic work of a very high order.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of navigating grief through sensory experience is beautifully woven into the premise. The story successfully builds resonance through its unique imagery and the metaphor of the emotional map. However, the final line, *“The place where feeling becomes seeing,”* is a significant flaw, functioning as an overt thematic statement that summarizes the story’s moral rather than allowing it to resonate through image alone, incurring a penalty for thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of control versus collaboration is elegantly explored through the central metaphor of editing history. The final realization that mistakes can be "seeds" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, some of the dialogue from Lira ("The future isn’t yours to write. It’s yours to *witness*.") and Elias’s final internal thoughts verge on stating the theme directly, which slightly reduces the power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story’s core theme is powerful, but its delivery lacks subtlety. Key thematic ideas are stated directly in the narration (e.g., "silence wasn’t emptiness—it was a canvas," "some truths are felt, not seen"). This thematic moralizing, particularly the summary of his goal in the final paragraph, significantly undermines the potential for subtext and resonant discovery, reading more like an explanation of the story's premise than an emergent theme.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of knowledge as a living, evolving entity is beautifully integrated and resonant. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a thematic echo, explicitly stating the story’s message (“the archive was not a place to be preserved but *revisited*...”). This direct explanation undercuts the subtext and emotional discovery, telling the reader what was already powerfully shown and slightly diminishing the final image's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story powerfully explores themes of shared trauma, memory, and connection. The central concept of "entanglement" being repriced from a curse to a gift is a strong thematic turn. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer, though the theme is slightly over-articulated in the dialogue ("To breathe life into a shared dream"), which borders on a thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of intuition over force ("whispers travel farther than shouts") emerges organically from the plot, never stated as a moral. The final image of Elias humming as a door opens for someone else provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The zodiac motifs and the sentient labyrinth add layers of meaning about order, fate, and listening to one's environment, achieving a complex resonance that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding light in darkness is clear, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story violates the principle of emergence by explicitly stating its own core elements, such as "The core concept of silent empathy threaded through her actions." This thematic labeling reads like authorial intrusion, undercutting the subtext and transforming resonant ideas into a thesis statement, which is a significant flaw for this literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme is woven beautifully through the central metaphors of chess, rebellion, and "planting forests." The final image of a seed taking root offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about grief and hope. The score is held back from the 9+ band only by a "Thematic Echo" in the penultimate exchange, where Lila's dialogue explicitly names the central metaphor, slightly reducing the power of implication.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of freedom through letting go is central and well-integrated into the plot mechanics. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final act. The last three paragraphs explicitly state the theme and its meaning ("freedom wasn’t found in staying but in detaching," "The disappearing island had been a lesson"), replacing resonant imagery with direct moralizing. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the complexity and prevents the story from trusting its own powerful symbols.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of remaking grief into a new form is potent and developed with subtlety through the central metaphor of whittling. The subtext is rich, particularly in lines like "a balance between emptiness and fullness." The score is capped here because the final act includes an overly explicit thematic statement ("Lightness is not the absence of darkness...") which slightly flattens the earned resonance of the preceding images.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of art's power to reshape reality emerges organically from the story’s actions and imagery. The dissolution of boundaries between poet and poem, observer and observed, is powerfully dramatized. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The final thought, "the world is ours to reshape," borders on an explicit thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise masterful subtext, but it's contained enough not to break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is powerfully integrated through character, setting, and plot. However, its resonance is slightly diminished by Marla's overly explicit line, "Beauty isn’t in perfection... It’s in the cracks, the flaws..." This thematic echo, delivered near the climax, states what the rest of the story so beautifully shows, preventing the theme from landing with perfect subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of questioning assumptions to find that connection is inherent, not engineered, emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the machines falling silent as the mountain sings offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by early thematic statements from Dr. Voss that verge on explaining the premise directly, but the execution at the close is powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of transforming grief rather than curing it emerges organically from the central metaphor. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with direct thematic statements, most notably, "The curtains of intention were not a cure for grief, but a language for it." This moment of telling, along with the somewhat on-the-nose final inscription, explains the theme to the reader rather than allowing it to resonate fully through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the theme of finding structure in chaos is potent, its delivery lacks subtlety. Elara’s dialogue often functions as direct thematic summary, particularly the line, "The crashes didn’t erase culture—they exposed its skeleton. Now we can map it." This is a clear instance of "thematic echo," where a character states the story's thesis, reducing the space for subtext and reader discovery. The resonant final image prevents a lower score, but the heavy-handedness is a notable flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of truth as an unpredictable, dangerous, yet vital force is well-integrated. However, the story occasionally veers toward direct thematic statement. The line, "The past… But not as a warning. As a *choice*," while powerful, borders on summarizing the theme for the reader rather than letting the final image do the work alone. This slight lack of subtlety prevents it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of hope's necessary evolution is woven organically into the plot. However, Thalos's dialogue ("After dreams became shareable, hope began to lose its shape... The shadow is what’s left.") borders on an overt thematic statement that slightly reduces subtext. The final image of the new book titles provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion that successfully recovers the story's nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of fragility as strength is powerfully developed through the central metaphor of the chameleon's tail. The story builds resonance organically for most of its length. However, the final paragraph states the theme explicitly ("compassion wasn’t a liability. It was the reason to keep going"), a thematic echo that undermines the subtext and trusts the reader too little, preventing the piece from achieving true thematic subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of scars as stories is potent and emerges organically from the plot's central metaphor. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its theme in the final paragraphs. Lines like “the scars weren’t just maps of loss; they were bridges to understanding” and “the ability to read the stories in scars” function as thematic moralizing, a critical flaw that undermines the subtext and resonance built so carefully through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of "unused love" is explored with nuance through the specific narrative of the film strip, avoiding direct moralizing for most of the story. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Mara's quest. However, the line "The unused love wasn’t lost; it was just waiting for someone to notice it" comes very close to stating the theme directly, slightly flattening the earned resonance of the preceding scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme is powerfully supported by the story's central imagery, particularly the jars of stardust as concrete moments of creation. However, the narrative undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its moral. The line, “Creativity isn’t trapped. It’s *waiting*,” functions as a thematic summary that preempts the reader’s discovery, reducing the potential for lasting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of preserving imagination in a desolate world emerges organically from the setting, conflict, and character arc. The story avoids didacticism entirely. The final image of Kael, wearing the coat of light and tending to the new sparks of dreams, serves as a powerful, resonant, and non-literal answer to the story's central problem. It’s a sophisticated and moving thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story explores a complex theme of coexistence between the mechanical and the wild, resisting a simple binary. The final image of the "seed" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this tension. The score is capped from a higher band because the father's dialogue ("you must let go") verges on a direct thematic statement, slightly reducing the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of courage as a shared, flowing resource rather than a destination is coherent and well-developed. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the theme is occasionally delivered too explicitly through Lira's dialogue, such as "Courage isn’t a lake... It’s a river," which borders on thematic summary and slightly reduces the power of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is potent but its delivery is flawed by overt moralizing. The line, “Safety… is not the absence of sound. It is the courage to listen,” functions as a direct thematic statement that pre-empts reader interpretation. This robs the ending of subtextual resonance, replacing an earned, emergent understanding with a tidy, authorial conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of truth versus illusion is coherent and culminates in a powerful final image of the chamber collapsing to reveal the real stars. This visual provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The theme is slightly undermined by on-the-nose dialogue like "Behold the truth," which states the point directly rather than letting the action carry the full weight of the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story builds a resonant theme about ecological change being a transformation rather than a simple reversal. However, the final two paragraphs pivot from showing to telling, explicitly summarizing the theme. Lines like "The fossil fuel ban had been a beginning, not an end" and "the paths that disappeared were not lost—they were waiting" function as thematic moralizing, undermining the evocative power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding meaning and pattern within chaos emerges organically from the plot and Lira's actions. The motifs of the opera glasses and humming stones work well to support this. However, the story suffers a major penalty for the final line, "The mess had meaning. It always had." This is a classic Thematic Echo, an explicit authorial summary that replaces the resonance of the final image with a tidy moral, significantly undermining the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of nurturing the future versus controlling it emerges organically from the character's actions and backstory. The final image of the glowing embryo in the springs is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final two paragraphs slip into thematic summary ("Tradition would evolve, not die... The future wasn’t something to fear or control..."), explicitly stating the moral and slightly undermining the power of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of integrating trauma is potent and evolves intelligently through the central metaphor. However, its delivery is hampered by moments of over-explicitness. Lila's line, “I want to anchor optimism in realism,” and Mrs. Voss’s explanation, “That’s why you anchor it in realism,” function as thematic summaries. This direct statement in the final third dilutes the subtext and replaces resonant imagery with a thesis, incurring a thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration of fragmentation and reintegration is handled with exceptional grace. The theme emerges organically from the story’s core images—the broken box, scattered cards, frayed threads—without a single instance of overt moralizing. The final image of the rewoven web provides a profound, non-literal answer to the questions posed throughout the narrative, achieving a rare and powerful resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thematic exploration of time, memory, and grief is woven skillfully through the narrative's concrete details. The central idea shifts from "time slowing" to "time fragmenting," a sophisticated turn catalyzed by the child's simple observation. The final image of entering the "song on repeat" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about crisis, avoiding any overt moralizing. The theme emerges organically from the plot and character choices.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of truth versus power is clear but delivered with a heavy hand, culminating in a thematic echo. Lirael’s line, “Because the truth matters,” serves as a direct thesis statement that replaces subtext with declaration. The final paragraphs further summarize the theme's expected impact, which feels less resonant than if the final image had been left to carry the meaning on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of transforming chaos into focused growth is powerfully woven through the story's core symbols. However, the execution is hampered by moments of over-explication. Phrases like "The farm was more than a sanctuary; it was a manifesto" and the summary of its "truth" in the final third are Thematic Echoes that state the theme directly, slightly undermining the earned resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of communication, sacrifice, and the search for meaning in chaotic patterns emerges organically from the plot. The story wisely avoids explicit moralizing, allowing the final resonant image—the single, pure tone from the now-stabilized garden—to answer the central question. It offers a complex take on loss and creation, where understanding is achieved through dissolution rather than capture.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of truth versus legacy is well-integrated and emerges organically from the plot. However, some thematic statements verge on being overly explicit. Lines like "My family’s orbit isn’t one of light—it’s a black hole, swallowing truths" and the final sentence about the compass, while resonant, slightly over-articulate the theme rather than leaving it fully to subtext and image.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.1)
    The themes of inherited guilt and healing are clear, but the execution lacks subtlety. The resolution hinges on a letter that explicitly states the moral: “Forgive me.” This direct thematic statement in the climax flattens the potential for resonant ambiguity, offering a tidy answer rather than inviting deeper reflection. The concept of translating cries to silence is powerful, but its resolution is too literal.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of "unlearning" to "make space for new truths" is elegantly woven into the narrative fabric, culminating in a powerful final realization rather than a didactic statement. The story avoids a simple moral, instead offering a complex idea about communication, silence, and collective consciousness. The final image of Mara drawing on the wall, accompanied by the tolling bell, serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about navigating a world of shed certainties.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of rebirth from ruin is organically woven through the central image of the broken tessera finding a new home. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, such as "erasure was not destruction. It was transformation," and the final line. These moments of telling function as a "Thematic Echo," explaining the story's meaning to the reader rather than trusting the powerful symbolism to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thematic concerns of memory, performance, and possibility emerge organically from the story’s potent imagery, particularly the encore and the tarot coin. The final image of the blanked coin offers a sophisticated, non-literal answer to the story’s central question, trading a specific past for a collective future in a way that resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of authentic, natural order versus synthetic, imposed shortcuts is woven seamlessly through the story's core images—the geode versus the pills. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this central tension. The final lines, while providing closure, border on being slightly too declarative, but the preceding imagery carries the thematic weight successfully.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story builds a resonant theme around memory and connection but severely undermines it with on-the-nose summary in the final paragraphs. Explicit statements like, "she was a translator, a bridge between the seen and the unseen," function as a thematic echo that replaces the power of the final image with a less impactful moral.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.0)
    A coherent theme emerges organically from the story’s objects and actions, but the ending resorts to direct statement, weakening its resonance. The explicit message from the jar—"The future is a tapestry..."—and the subsequent authorial summary of the theme in the final paragraphs constitute a "Thematic Echo." This over-explanation tells the reader the moral rather than allowing it to be felt through the final image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of courage and inherited burdens emerges organically from the imagery of thawing ice and secrets in the earth. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its conclusions in the final act. Lines like "Fixing what’s broken required more than deciphering codes" and "The bluff had given her a gift: not the truth, but the courage to seek it" function as thematic summaries, undermining the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story builds a coherent theme around finding meaning through attentive observation, but its execution lacks subtlety. Core thematic phrases—"distill complexity into essence," "palimpsest promise"—are repeated verbatim, functioning as authorial labels that over-explain the subtext. This thematic echo, particularly the multiple restatements of the character's core motivation, undermines the power of the imagery and prevents the theme from emerging organically. The result feels more like an illustration of a concept than a resonant exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of kindness anchoring reality emerges organically from the central images of the sunflowers and lantern glass. However, the story falters slightly at the end by over-stating its conclusion. Lines like "...small acts of care could bend reality" and the final sentence feel like thematic summaries, slightly undermining the power of the final image by replacing resonance with explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of persevering hope is woven skillfully through the story's imagery, particularly the recurring motifs of gardening and light. However, the story's greatest weakness lies here. The theme is stated far too explicitly in the dialogue at the climax, a "Thematic Echo" that robs the ending of subtext and resonance. This direct moralizing undermines the quiet power built by the preceding atmosphere and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of forging identity from the fragments of history is handled with nuance and power, emerging organically from the central conceit. The final image of Lirael writing *Brittle Awakenings* is a superb, non-literal resolution. A minor deduction is for the line, "To be atomically reflective meant to see oneself...", which verges on summarizing the theme for the reader, slightly diluting the otherwise perfect subtext of the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of connection through shared vulnerability emerges organically from the story’s central metaphor. The imagery of spirals and sinking orbs provides a resonant, non-literal exploration of the idea. The score is significantly limited by the final paragraphs, where Elara explicitly states the theme: “The thread that connects all things isn’t a secret. It’s the courage to share it.” This thematic echo replaces subtext with a direct moral, weakening the ending’s power.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully develops its theme of order versus chaos through action rather than statement. The core conflict between harmony and dissonance is elegantly dramatized. The final image of the "chessboard" and Lila's hardening resolve provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central power struggle, beautifully repricing the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of confronting internal limitations to unlock potential is powerfully integrated through the mirroring of the external and internal conflicts. The final image of the nexus transforming into a gateway provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is capped here because the final paragraph resorts to thematic labeling ("wistful rebellion," "he'd earned this"), slightly undermining the otherwise excellent emergent meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of empathy unifying opposites is handled with excessive directness, robbing the story of subtext and resonance. Characters frequently state the theme in dialogue and interiority ("Not art... Empathy," "Opposites unified—death and life..."), a critical flaw that replaces emergent meaning with explicit summary, particularly in the final, didactic lines.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story builds a coherent theme about questioning official narratives and the risks associated with pursuing forgotten truths. The final image is resonant, holding the central thematic tension in a moment of charged poise. However, the final sentence—"some truths were worth the risk"—is a direct thematic statement that slightly undermines the earned subtext of the scene, functioning as an unnecessary authorial summary where the action itself was already speaking clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of sculpting new possibilities from past regrets emerges organically from the plot without didacticism. The central conceits, while slightly jarring, serve this theme directly. The final image of Elias poised to play again offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion that beautifully encapsulates the story's core question about choice and reality, avoiding a simplistic moral and leaving the reader with a sense of potent ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of breaking cycles of greed is coherent, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story relies on direct thematic statements, from the father's aphorism about paths circling back to the protagonist's final, explicit summary of the lesson he has learned. This "thematic echo" in the final paragraphs states the moral directly, undermining the power of the story's imagery and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of empathy as a prerequisite for understanding is potent and well-integrated into the climax. The final image of the "map of empathy" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central puzzle. The score is tempered by Veyra’s dialogue ("The inscriptions are a language of shared burdens"), which states the theme too explicitly, slightly reducing the subtextual power that the final scene otherwise earns.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of integrating one's own darkness emerges organically from the story's central conflict and imagery. Unfortunately, the final paragraph resorts to stating the theme directly ("She had discovered what mirrors don’t show—not just the darkness within her, but the strength to carry it"). This thematic summary significantly undermines the resonance of the final image, replacing earned subtext with an unnecessary explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of accepting pain as a prerequisite for healing and connection is beautifully integrated. It emerges organically from the central metaphor of the scars as both maps and wounds. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image—the two moons, the transformed scars—as a non-literal answer to the central problem, successfully repricing the protagonist's understanding of her world and her role within it.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of transforming regret into wisdom is developed powerfully through the story's central imagery. However, the final paragraphs slip into direct thematic statements, such as "from ash, new growth rises" and "now she carried the fiercely gentle wisdom of the orchard." This thematic echo replaces resonant subtext with a tidy summary, slightly diminishing the ending's power.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of finding value in failure and history is woven organically through the narrative, particularly with the phoenix logo on a relic from a failed band. However, the story falters in the final sentence, "After the applause, there was still music." This line explicitly states the theme, functioning as a moral that undermines the resonance of the preceding discovery and violates the principle of showing over telling at the crucial moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of knowledge as a living dialogue rather than a static equation emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the shifting arbor provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about transition and ambition. However, the line "the physics of transition were not cold equations, but stories waiting to be retold" comes very close to being a Thematic Echo, slightly over-articulating the insight just before the final image lands.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of transformation through accepting contradiction is potent, its execution is marred by heavy-handed exposition. Key thematic statements are delivered explicitly in dialogue, particularly in the final third (“we build new tomorrows from the ashes of the old”). This instance of "Thematic Echo" undermines the resonance of the final image by stating the moral directly, replacing subtext with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of connection overcoming isolation is powerfully rendered through the core imagery of bunkers, walls, and the crystal lattice. The final image of the cave as a cathedral is resonant. However, the story repeatedly undermines its subtext with explicit thematic statements, most notably in the final paragraphs ("remind the world of its capacity for connection," "dissolve the walls between hearts"). This direct moralizing significantly dulls the emergent power of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of forgiveness as a process is woven beautifully through the central river metaphor. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic statements, such as the graffiti "Forgiveness isn’t a destination—it’s a current," which comes close to stating its own moral. The final image of "Begin" is a resonant and powerful close, but the path to it relies on slightly too-explicit thematic signposting.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of uncovering hidden truths is elegantly woven through the story's central conceit and imagery. The piece avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image: words that exist "only in the spaces between thought and speech." This ending provides a non-literal, conceptually satisfying answer to the story's central question, transforming the search for "unspoken words" into a more profound meditation on the nature of truth itself.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic depth is achieved with remarkable subtlety and force. The story explores choice, destiny, and the cost of power without a single line of exposition. The recurring word "propagate" brilliantly evolves from a magical instruction to a personal creed of self-determination. The final image of the "mulberry stain on the fabric of the world" serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central dilemma, leaving a lasting and complex emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of preserving beauty against oblivion emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The final image of the threshold as a "canvas" is a masterful, resonant answer to the story's central question. The score is held back slightly by the penultimate paragraph's reflection, which verges on stating the theme directly ("the knowledge that... beauty could endure"), a minor shift from showing to telling at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of rebirth and forgiveness is woven well through the central objects, but its power is diluted by explicit authorial statements. The final two paragraphs, in particular, summarize the theme directly ("Contentment, she realized, wasn’t a destination. It was a practice..."). This "Thematic Echo" flaw replaces resonant imagery with a stated moral, telling the reader what to feel instead of allowing the conclusion to emerge from the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of doubt as a clarifying filter is potent and well-integrated through the story's central symbols. Unfortunately, the execution is hampered by overt thematic statements. Elias’s line, “Doubt isn’t the enemy... It’s the filter. Without it, certainty becomes a prison,” is a thematic echo that summarizes the core idea for the reader, sacrificing subtext for directness and preventing the story from reaching a higher level of literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of earned knowledge versus received wisdom is beautifully integrated into the story's central metaphor. The story resists stating a simple moral, instead allowing the theme to emerge from the patterns in the water and Lira's dawning insight. The final image of the spiral offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the nature of vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of alignment versus control emerges organically from the story’s particulars. However, the resonance is weakened by several sentences of direct thematic explanation in the final third, such as "To navigate without moving wasn’t about stillness but about alignment..." This moment of telling over showing functions as a thematic echo, slightly undermining the subtextual power of the final resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is clear and well-integrated into the plot, but the ending suffers from thematic overstatement. The line "But Kael knew the truth now: the sacred wasn’t hidden in impossibilities, but in the willingness to see beauty where others saw only cold stone" is a direct summary of the moral. This replaces the resonant power of the final image with an explicit explanation, significantly weakening the subtext at the story's most crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of memory, grief, and unspoken vows is potent and well-integrated into the imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The phrase *“Sound is the color of memory”* etched on the desk and Elias's later thought, "The color of sound wasn’t a fixed thing—it was a language of the heart," function as thematic echo, stating the moral directly rather than allowing it to resonate purely through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding signal within noise, or purpose within entropy, is woven skillfully through the story’s central metaphors of static, distillation, and wavelength alignment. The story avoids a simplistic moral, instead resolving into a powerful final image where the protagonist embodies the theme itself. The realization that the prophecy is a "mirror" is a resonant insight that effectively reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of giving shape to fear is woven throughout, culminating powerfully in the final image. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the line, “The echo of sacrifice, he realized, wasn’t just about loss. It was about giving shape to the shapeless, voice to the voiceless.” This moment of thematic summary is too explicit for a piece aiming for the highest tier, stating what the preceding scene had already beautifully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding value in repairing broken things, and of faith as a form of stubborn work, emerges organically from the central metaphor. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its thesis in the dialogue: “Madness is just devotion without a roadmap.” This thematic echo converts a resonant subtext into a tidy, on-the-nose summary, reducing the power of an otherwise subtle and well-earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of memory as an act of communal guardianship is potent and well-integrated through imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic declaration, particularly the daughter's explanation and Mara's final internal summary. These "thematic echoes" state the story's thesis directly, reducing the resonance that the powerful final image would otherwise have achieved on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story's exploration of the synthesis between logic and intuition is potent and well-integrated, particularly in the final action of writing a formula of "calculus with her mother's verse." However, the theme's power is slightly undercut by a moment of overt thematic statement near the climax. The line about letting reason "ignite the ember of instinct" is a Thematic Echo that summarizes the story's point too directly, momentarily sacrificing emergent discovery for authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is expertly woven through action and imagery rather than stated. The concept of "trust" evolves from a remembered command into a living "language," a sophisticated thematic development. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about duty, re-casting a burden as a sacred covenant without resorting to a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of accepting a flawed, whole self over a perfected duplicate emerges organically from the conflict. While the final image of walking on “invisible paths” is resonant, the preceding line, “You’re not a duplicate... You’re a choice,” is an explicit thematic statement that slightly over-articulates the story's core idea, reducing the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of embracing process over forced solutions is coherent and emerges organically from the plot. However, the resonance is significantly dampened by the overly explicit statement in the penultimate paragraph: "The mystery wasn’t in the seed but in the flow—the way answers emerged when you stopped forcing them." This thematic moralizing replaces the resonant power of the final image, preventing the theme from achieving its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of tending to unspoken grief and memory emerges organically from the story's central magical-realist conceit, never once resorting to direct statement. The story's final image—a burst of light and a chorus of laughter—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of loss. This is an emotionally intelligent and sophisticated piece that trusts its central metaphor to do the thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty over the harsh finality of "light" is woven beautifully through imagery and action, particularly the recurring motif of fog. The story builds resonance organically until the final paragraph. However, the closing sentence, “And uncertainty? That was just another word for home,” is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the elegance of the preceding scene-work, warranting a deduction for what is otherwise exceptional thematic development.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of "creative destruction" is introduced as a concept but powerfully dramatized through Kael's actions. The story avoids moralizing, instead exploring the theme through the character's painful choice. The final image of the nexus blooming offers a complex, resonant answer to the central question of collapse and rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding beginnings in endings is powerfully integrated into the plot's mechanics. However, it is occasionally stated too directly through Kael's internal monologue ("the beginning wasn’t a point in time, but a state of being"). While the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer, the preceding explicit thematic statements slightly reduce the subtextual power, preventing the theme from emerging purely through action and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of completion, memory, and the fluidity of time is expertly woven through the story's imagery and action. The final image of the Hourglass constellation provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions. The score is slightly capped because the final paragraph veers close to summarizing its theme explicitly ("The ferry had been a bridge, and he its keeper—a temporary guardian of a permanent transient moment"), which slightly lessens the impact of the preceding powerful imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is central but delivered too explicitly, especially in the final act. Lines like the curator’s explanation (“It’s not in the things we see, but in the patterns we weave”) and Clara’s final thoughts (“in chaos, there was order. And in order, there was magic”) function as direct thematic summaries. This overt moralizing replaces earned resonance and prevents the theme from emerging organically from the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding stability in adaptable principles rather than fixed points is beautifully integrated, primarily through the shifting meaning of the anchor chain. The story largely avoids overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge from character and action. However, the final two sentences, particularly "she was teaching her students to embrace the unknown," function as a Thematic Echo, slightly over-stating the conclusion that the preceding scene had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of unspoken love finding a voice emerges organically from the plot. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its themes near the end. Lines like “Sometimes love is too big for words. But it’s never too late to hear it,” and the self-reflection on “incidental heroism” function as thematic moralizing, which slightly undermines the earned resonance of the final scene.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of memory, loss, and the preservation of the "unremembered" emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids any overt moralizing, culminating in a final image that offers a profound, non-literal answer to its central question. The line "they were memorials, etching the unremembered into the ocean’s skin" is a superb thematic culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is the story's heart, emerging organically from the interplay of image and action rather than statement. The idea of finding wisdom in failure is explored through the recurring, evolving motifs of the shard, the ink, and the static. The final image of the ghost as a "compass" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, resisting a simple moral and leaving a lingering, complex emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic exploration of language, memory, and fear is deeply integrated and emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids any didacticism, offering its conclusion through a powerful final image and realization. The final line, "some languages are meant to be felt, not spoken," provides a resonant, non-literal answer that lingers with compelling ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of civilization's rigid control versus a wilder, more playful natural order emerges organically from the conflict. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering the concept that harmony isn't "tamed" but "played." The final image of the open-ended spiral on the arrowhead is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, resonating with possibility and resolve rather than providing a simple conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of authentic beauty versus artificial control is woven beautifully through imagery and action for most of the story. Unfortunately, the final paragraph abandons subtext for a direct, moralizing statement that explains the theme to the reader. This "thematic echo" significantly undermines the earned resonance of the closing image, stating what should have been left to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of small rebellions creating profound change emerges organically from the plot, but the story undermines its own subtext with an overt thematic statement. The line “healing wasn’t in grand gestures…It was in the small, rebellious acts” is a textbook thematic echo that replaces resonant implication with a direct moral, a significant flaw for this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding renewal in quiet and forgotten things emerges organically from the imagery and action for most of the story. The final image of the transformed courtyard is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the score is capped by a couple of on-the-nose thematic statements, particularly the final sentence, "It was a beginning," which functions as a summary that slightly lessens the power of the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of tangible, "analog memories" transforming reality is potent and well-integrated into the imagery. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly direct thematic statements. The line, "They don’t just inform—they transform," functions as a concluding moral that explains the story's point to the reader, lessening the resonant power of the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of self-discovery emerges organically from the plot and central metaphor. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's quest. However, the final two sentences—"she had found not a dream, but herself. And that, she realized, was enough"—state the theme too explicitly, functioning as a "thematic echo" that slightly undermines the power of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story's most significant flaw lies in its final paragraph, which explicitly states the thematic realization. This "Thematic Echo"—"Elias realized that the idea...could heal rather than harm"—undercuts the subtext and resonance built by the preceding imagery, replacing earned insight with a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of memory, obsession, and the porous boundary between past and present emerge organically from the central conceit of the broken constellations mirroring stolen memories. The final image of Elias waiting by the ring is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's questions. However, the final paragraph dips into thematic summary ("...not as a tomb, but as a bridge... someone who believed in stories..."), which slightly undermines the otherwise excellent emergent resonance by stating what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of confronting the past to reverse "exile" is masterfully woven into the plot mechanics. However, the story verges on thematic summary with lines like "Exile is reversible... But it requires sacrifice" and the final sentence, "sometimes, the quietest lessons were the loudest." These moments slightly weaken the otherwise powerful subtext by stating what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of wonder's cyclical nature emerges organically from the plot. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into direct thematic statement ("wonder was not a finite thing. It was a thread..."). This moralizing undermines the powerful subtext of the final image (the iridescent blossom), explaining what should have been left to resonate. This is a significant flaw in an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of breaking necessary silences is woven organically through the central metaphor of the net. Elias’s line, “But silence isn’t always kindness,” borders on being too explicit, slightly weakening the subtext. However, the story recovers beautifully with its closing image: the "key to a door that was never locked" is a resonant, non-literal answer to Mara's internal conflict. It recontextualizes her entire "mending" philosophy without stating a moral, leaving a lingering, complex emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding meaning in silence is woven skillfully through the narrative, culminating in a powerful final image of framing maps with questions instead of borders. The story's main thematic flaw is a moment of over-explication in the final paragraphs ("To reopen the chapel meant to listen past the noise..."). This direct statement slightly undermines the otherwise elegant emergence of the theme from action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of memory's persistence is powerfully integrated through the central metaphor of quantum transmission and the recurring snow globe motif. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's quest. However, the score is capped by thematic statements that verge on direct summary, particularly in the final paragraph ("It had given her a language for..."), which slightly undermines the subtext by explicitly stating what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of articulating the unspeakable emerges with grace and power from the story's central conceit. The narrative resists easy sentimentality, instead exploring grief, forgiveness, and hope through concrete, symbolic action. The final image of the bluebell in the press is a superb, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a lingering resonance without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central theme of joy and anguish as intertwined forces is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, its delivery is too explicit. The diary entry *"The joy beneath anguish is a flame no ice can smother"* is powerful, but the subsequent dialogue ("He believed joy and anguish are twins," "And the flame?" "Still burns") verges on thematic summary, reducing the power of subtext and stating what the story has already shown effectively through image and discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory and loss residing in seemingly empty spaces is beautifully integrated. The central concept of "spooled wholeness" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what remains after loss. The final image of her cataloging a cloud of "hope" is powerful. The score is capped just shy of the 9-band because the final two sentences lean slightly into thematic summary rather than letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges with subtlety and power from the story’s particulars, exploring legacy, preservation, and the nature of knowledge. The final image of Lira under a "starless city sky" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions without any moralizing. The journal’s quote, *“When the tree falls, let the stars remain,”* borders on being explicit but is saved by its diegetic nature, functioning as the guild's voice, not the narrator's.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of curiosity versus established knowledge emerges organically from the plot. However, the final line, "...not just a place, but a truth," borders on a thematic statement, slightly undermining the resonance built through image and action. While the story successfully invites reflection on finding wonder in the forgotten, this moment of telling over showing prevents it from achieving flawless thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of repair is beautifully woven through the narrative until the final two paragraphs, which resort to explicit summary. The line "it was about finding harmony in the chaos" is a classic thematic echo that tells the reader the moral instead of trusting the images. This direct statement significantly undermines the otherwise elegant subtext, preventing the theme from reaching its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of collective hope is clear but delivered with a heavy hand, undermining its potential for resonance. The final two paragraphs explicitly state the moral, functioning as a Thematic Echo ("hope was not a solitary pursuit—it was a garden..."). This direct summary replaces the power of the final image, telling the reader what to feel instead of allowing the theme to emerge from the action. While the core concept is integrated, the lack of subtext or ambiguity weakens the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is potent and well-integrated. However, its expression borders on being too explicit. The final line, "It was a lullaby, beautifully flawed," is a thematic echo that summarizes the core idea for the reader, slightly undermining the resonant power of the preceding images. This overstatement in the final beat prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story achieves a resonant theme of weary duty and imperfect, necessary action. The final image of the cracked nut provides a powerful, non-literal conclusion. A minor deduction is warranted for the line "The graceless beauty of his task lay in its imperfection," which feels like a slightly too-explicit thematic statement in an otherwise subtle narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from a critical lack of subtext, repeatedly stating its themes in explicit, summary-like language. The final paragraphs function as a thematic explanation ("atonement wasn’t about erasing the past. It was about reimagining the future") rather than allowing meaning to resonate from the final image. This heavy-handed moralizing undermines the otherwise potent symbolism and constitutes a significant flaw for a literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of absence as creative potential is woven brilliantly through the premise and imagery. Subtlety is the story's great strength until the final paragraphs, which explicitly state the story's thesis ("stories didn’t begin in grand gestures..."). This thematic summary, while heartfelt, undermines the resonance by explaining what the reader had already been shown, constituting a significant flaw in a literary piece aiming for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, exploring how guilt can be metabolized rather than erased. The culinary metaphor—tempering spices, finding the right recipe for remorse—is sustained beautifully and pays off in the final scene. The closing image of Nessar cooking, mellowing sharpness with laughter and softening bitterness with forgiveness, provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without a whisper of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of connection is woven beautifully through the core metaphors of the clock and silo. The story builds resonance effectively until the final paragraphs, where it succumbs to overt moralizing. Elara’s speech ("And stories, like grain, must flow freely to nourish") is a prime example of a thematic echo, explicitly stating the moral instead of allowing the powerful final image to convey it, which significantly dulls the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding new potential in brokenness is potent and well-integrated into the central metaphor of the fractured mirror. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the on-the-nose realization, "The fractures weren’t flaws, he realized—they were pathways." This thematic statement feels too explicit, replacing earned resonance with a direct authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding power in hidden, marginal spaces is expertly woven through the narrative, from the manuscript doodles to the final realization. The story mostly avoids overt moralizing, letting the events speak for themselves. The final paragraph comes close to over-explaining the theme ("The world was full of doors, and Lira now held the key"), but it lands as a resonant cadence rather than a didactic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of art’s endurance and the nature of music beyond sound emerges powerfully from the central action. The final image of the humming grove is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the score is capped by moments of thematic overstatement. The final paragraph veers into summary ("all because a sculptor refused to let the world forget how to listen"), slightly diminishing the earned power of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic development is sophisticated, emerging organically from the central chess metaphor. The core theme of finding "beauty in the difficult" is not merely stated but demonstrated through Alaric’s struggle and crystallized in the final image of the sapling. The star-mage's line, "The covenant was never eclipsed. It waited for someone to see its beauty in the difficult," verges on being too explicit, a minor thematic statement that slightly undermines the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story builds a powerful, integrated theme around silence and empathy, but it falters by explicitly stating its conclusions in the final paragraphs. The line "The path to empathy, she realized, was not paved with words..." is a textbook example of a thematic echo, summarizing the moral rather than letting the final image resonate. This direct statement significantly undercuts the subtext carefully built through the central metaphor, constituting a major flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of patience versus ambition emerges organically from the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final paragraphs. The elder’s line, “Chaos and serenity… are not enemies but kin,” and the final sentence summarizing Lira’s change are direct thematic statements that feel like moralizing, replacing earned resonance with explicit explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of natural symbiosis versus technological exploitation emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The reinterpretation of "gathering of echoes" is particularly effective. However, the final paragraph resorts to thematic summary, explicitly stating the moral ("The planet’s resilience came from its willingness to bend... It was a symphony, and she’d finally learned to listen"), which dulls the resonance that the preceding images had already powerfully established.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of emergent, unintended sentience in man-made systems is compelling and well-developed through imagery and atmosphere. The final line provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core mystery. However, the theme is slightly undermined by over-statement in the line, "...the port itself had become a machine, and the machine was hungry." This moment verges on summarizing the theme for the reader, rather than allowing it to remain fully emergent from the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story effectively dramatizes its theme through action and imagery, but severely undermines its own subtext with explicit thematic statements. Lines like "truth…is essential" and the final paragraph's declaration that wonder is "not just essential, but inevitable" function as direct authorial moralizing. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the resonance, replacing earned implication with a tidy, declarative summary, which is a significant flaw in an otherwise potent piece.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of surrendering to failure rather than fighting it is developed well through action and imagery, culminating in the resonant final act of carving a new rune. However, the story stumbles with the line, "To harvest insights from failure was to stop fighting the current and learn to swim." This is a clear thematic echo, a direct statement of the moral that slightly undermines the power of the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme is potent and emerges well from the plot, but the story falters by stating its conclusions too directly during the climax. Lines like “Emotions weren’t variables; they were wildfires” and “mathematics of emotion weren’t equations to be solved but rhythms to be felt” function as thematic summaries, undermining the subtlety and power of the preceding dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central theme of legacy and understanding as a form of "germination" is potent and well-integrated into the plot. The final image of the sapling offers a brilliant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is capped by the final paragraphs, which explicitly state the theme ("Veyra’s absence wasn’t an ending—it was a germination... Kail... had been the soil"), a thematic echo that lessens the resonance by explaining what the preceding images had already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of projection versus perception is expertly woven into the narrative fabric. The final reveal—that the arbor mirrors rather than absorbs—provides a powerful, non-literal answer to Mara's quest, recontextualizing her desire for proof as a yearning for self-validation. The story avoids moralizing, leaving a resonant ambiguity in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    The themes of sacrifice, connection, and art's power are beautifully woven into the narrative, particularly in the final turn of weaving silence into song. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary. The line "Mara’s story, like her cloth, endures—a pattern stitched through the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry" is a Thematic Echo that explicitly states what the preceding images already made resonant, slightly diminishing the ending's power.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of resilience earned through struggle emerges organically from the plot, culminating in the powerful final image of a restored world and a silent hero. However, the story commits a significant misstep by having the protagonist mutter the exact thesis statement during the climax: “Resilience isn’t born from safety... but from enduring the unendurable.” This thematic echo replaces subtext with direct statement, severely undermining the otherwise resonant narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story develops a coherent and resonant theme about obsession and acceptance. The final image of Kael walking away unburdened is powerful. However, the impact is slightly undercut by the preceding paragraph's direct thematic statement, "The truth wasn’t a thing to be found—it was a thread..." This moment of telling, rather than showing, is a minor flaw in an otherwise subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding connection and hope in shared vulnerability is beautifully woven through the story’s core images. The final image of the "luminescent ache" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of darkness. However, the final two paragraphs lean slightly into thematic summary ("He realized why the chain mattered... a way to protect that feeling," "a new kind of light glowed—not of flame, but of connection"). This slightly over-articulates the theme, pulling back from pure imagistic revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    The themes of responsibility, the duality of progress, and the power of ancient ways emerge organically from the narrative's potent imagery. The final image of the lighthouse is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, a significant flaw appears in the final paragraphs with a direct thematic statement ("...the dawn wasn't just a time of day. It was a choice"), which undermines the subtext by explaining what was already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of stories, perception, and connection is elegantly woven through the narrative's central images. However, the story's primary weakness lies here; the final two paragraphs abandon subtext for overt thematic statements. The line "...some stories are meant to be shared, and some hearts are built to hold them" is a classic "Thematic Echo" that summarizes the moral instead of letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in decay and order in chaos emerges organically from the story’s central conceit. The final image of the glowing roots provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's questions about sorrow and memory. However, the theme is slightly overwrought by explicit statements like, "This was the mundane miracle of his job" and "even in decay, there was beauty," which tell the reader the moral rather than letting it fully resonate through the action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory and culture as the lifeblood of a society emerges powerfully from the story's central images and actions. The concept of "woven dawns" and the power of a single song create a resonant, non-literal exploration of the theme. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the line, “Through forgotten songs… we remember how to live.” This moment of thematic summary, while heartfelt, is too direct for a piece this lyrical, stating the moral rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story’s themes of grief, hiding, and acceptance are potent, but their delivery is undermined by overt thematic statements. The leader’s line, “Wisdom lies in mistakes,” and the mother’s note function as explicit morals, constituting a “Thematic Echo” that reduces the power of subtext and the resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding the sacred in the mundane emerges organically from the story's potent imagery, particularly the guerrilla gardening. However, the resonance is weakened by moments of overt thematic statement. The woman’s dialogue ("The cracks. The places where light seeps through.") and the final paragraph's summary ("The sacred wasn’t hidden; it was waiting...") state the theme directly, undermining the subtext so carefully built elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of preserving meaning against entropy is coherent and well-integrated into the plot. However, its explicit statement in the motivation ("to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") verges on thematic summary. The final image of the restored illusions provides a resonant, non-literal answer, but the initial lack of subtext slightly tempers the overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of silence, trust, and compromised legacies is woven beautifully through the narrative. The abstract concept of "trust breaking" is made terrifyingly literal by the device. The final image of the cracked but still-moving watch fob offers a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central questions, replacing a simple moral with a complex, resonant feeling of “comforting unease.”

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of rationalism confronting an overwhelmingly animate, sentient world emerges organically from Kael's investigation. The story avoids stating its theme, instead letting the final image—the still compass and the taste of regret—provide a resonant answer to Kael’s quest. This ending beautifully captures the bittersweet price of knowledge, re-weighting his entire skeptical project as a form of poignant innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme is woven seamlessly into the story’s central metaphor, emerging from the character’s actions rather than being stated. The concept of unlocking suppressed potential is handled with originality and nuance, avoiding easy moralizing. The final image of Elias sketching, feeling "truly seen," provides a resonant and emotionally honest answer to the story's central question, leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of truth versus comforting falsehood is explored with nuance and depth, emerging organically from the plot. The final image of the "seed" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the keeper’s line, “Candor in small moments. That’s what sustains us,” verges on an explicit thematic statement, slightly diminishing the power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding truth in silence and ephemeral beauty is potent and well-integrated through the central metaphor. However, the final two paragraphs slip into direct thematic statement, explicitly explaining the character’s motives and the story's meaning (“Elara’s motivation had never been to be heard, but to remind...”). This over-articulation violates the "show, don't tell" principle at a critical moment and lessens the resonant power of the final image, constituting a thematic echo that incurs a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding wholeness in imperfection is developed with subtlety and power, emerging organically from character and action rather than statement. The central metaphor of the controlled burn is perfectly executed to transform chaos rather than simply destroy it. The story’s final images provide a resonant, non-literal answer to its core question, avoiding moralizing while delivering a profound insight.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of listening to the stories of the past is elegantly woven through the narrative. However, the final paragraph resorts to thematic summary ("She’d solved the mystery, not by force, but by listening. The mailbox’s secret was a testament to love’s endurance..."). This direct statement replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral, flattening the otherwise subtle development.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of vulnerability as strength is woven deeply into the story's fabric through its central puzzle mechanics of poetry and dance. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal reflection on this idea. However, the story leans on direct thematic statements, particularly the early quote, *"Vulnerability is not weakness—it is the cipher no machine can crack,"* which functions like a thesis statement and is echoed again at the end, slightly reducing the subtext's power by over-articulating its own meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story explores themes of memory, loss, and preservation through a compelling central metaphor. The idea that memories are not erased but stored is resonant. The final paragraph, however, verges on thematic summary ("he’d found where deleted memories go—not to oblivion, but to a place of preservation..."), which slightly diminishes the resonance by stating the theme directly rather than letting the final image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of silence as a potent, active force is woven effectively through the narrative's core concept and actions. The final image of the crumbling wing and resumed brook provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The theme is slightly undermined by lines that verge on direct statement, such as "silence was not emptiness but a language," which explains the theme rather than allowing it to emerge purely from the scene's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of hidden truths versus "agreed upon lies" is woven beautifully through the narrative, emerging from character interactions rather than direct statements. The central concept—that buildings have a language that is *felt*—provides a resonant core. The final image of the awakened building serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. The line "fleeting. Like truth" borders on being overly explicit but is saved by the context of the meteor shower.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of repurposing trauma rather than erasing it emerges organically from the story's central action. However, the line "She’d translated her isolation into independence, not by erasing the past, but by repurposing it" is a minor thematic echo that states the theme too directly. While the final image is resonant, this moment of telling slightly lessens the impact of what was already being powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The themes of forgiveness and breaking cycles of vengeance are powerful and well-integrated. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic statements, such as "Her forgeries were not acts of rebellion but of forgiveness." This tendency towards Thematic Echo slightly undermines the subtext by explaining what is already being shown, preventing the piece from achieving flawless resonance through pure implication.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of memory and unresolved stories emerges organically from the plot and evocative imagery. However, the story falters by over-stating its theme in the final act. The figure's line, “The echoes are not just sound,” is repeated in the narration, functioning as a "thematic echo" that replaces earned resonance with a direct summary, a significant flaw that undercuts the otherwise subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of enduring connection is potent and well-integrated through the central metaphor of the snow globe. However, the story leans into overt thematic statements, particularly in the resolution. Lines like "He had salvaged something pure from the wreckage...the fragile, enduring threads of connection" state the moral directly, replacing the resonant power of the final image with unnecessary explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of appreciating hidden labor is woven beautifully through recurring images and Kael’s perspective. The final image of the fireflies offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraph verges on over-statement with the line "...the idea that the world’s beauty lay not in its grandeur but in its hidden labor," which functions as a thematic echo, slightly reducing the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of dangerous truths versus comfortable lies is well-integrated. The story’s ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by forcing the "truth excavator" to bury a part of the truth to ensure survival. The final two sentences ("Comfortable lies had no place here... some secrets are too dangerous to stay buried") verge on thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise potent ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of harnessing chaos for creation emerges organically from the interplay of storm, radio static, and ancient wisdom. The final image of Kael as a "conductor" for a roaring dawn provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the story occasionally veers into direct thematic statement, such as the final voiceover-like message, "*You are the prism. You are the storm*," which borders on a "Thematic Echo" and slightly undermines the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of memory, art, and connection emerge organically from the story's central conceit. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("had found his purpose: not to be remembered, but to remember..."), replacing resonant imagery with a declarative summary. This "thematic echo" slightly undermines an otherwise subtle and powerful exploration of the story's core ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of achieving balance through harmony rather than force emerges organically from the central conflict. However, the story falters slightly by explicitly stating its own moral in the denouement: "...its lesson lingered: some battles were won not with force, but with harmony." This thematic echo is redundant and slightly dulls the resonance of the more powerful closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the theme is potent and well-integrated into the plot, the execution relies too heavily on direct statement. Lines like “the patient revolution”—a slow subversion of chaos” and the final thought, “To unyoke the world, one must first unyoke oneself,” function as explicit thematic summaries. These moments tell the reader the meaning rather than allowing it to emerge solely from the resonant action, slightly undermining the story's subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of memory as both a "chain" and a "weapon" is developed well through the lantern's function. The story’s final move, where Mara decides to wield "empirical observation" instead of emotion, provides a resonant, non-literal answer to how one confronts a manipulated past. However, the vision of young Cole explicitly stating, “Memory is a weapon,” is a Thematic Echo that over-articulates the core idea, slightly reducing the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of redemption through tangible, reparative action emerges organically from the central metaphor. The "apology in metal" is a powerful and specific vehicle for this theme. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, such as Mrs. Elms's line about "seeing what's hidden" and Marcus's internal summary that the program is about "repairing lives." This tendency toward thematic echo prevents the piece from reaching the highest tier of resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic execution is the story's greatest strength. The core concept of a "yearning algorithm" is explored through action rather than exposition, culminating in a powerful final image. The resolution—the bell producing a "hum"—is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, resonating with complexity and avoiding any simplistic moral. It beautifully reframes the narrative from a story about solving a problem to one about participating in a mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The themes of memory, truth, and erasure emerge organically from the plot mechanics of deleted files and a corporate cover-up. The final image of Lira uploading the coordinates provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about what should be remembered. The line "she was done letting the company erase the echoes of the lost" verges on being a direct thematic statement but functions as earned internal resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of empathy transforming fear is powerfully integrated into the central magical conceit. The final image of giving the storm "a heart" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the core problem. However, the story undermines its own subtext with the final sentence, which reads like an explicitly stated moral: "...courage wasn’t in the absence of fear, but in the choice to act anyway." This Thematic Echo significantly reduces the piece's literary impact by over-explaining what was already beautifully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of finding purpose in action and connection emerges organically from the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of direct thematic statement. The explicit explanation of "The fold in patience" and the line "We all are [looking for something]" function as authorial pronouncements that reduce the resonant ambiguity. While the final image is effective, these statements prevent the theme from achieving its full, unstated power.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is resonant but delivered with excessive directness. Elias's dialogue, particularly lines like “harmony isn’t silence. It’s the tension between notes,” functions as a "Thematic Echo," explicitly stating the story's thesis. This direct articulation in a pivotal beat weakens the subtext and replaces earned epiphany with a lecture, incurring a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of duty, preservation, and a unique form of perception-based honesty emerge organically from the plot and world-building. The final image of the stabilized clearings offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The direct naming of Mara's “strangely honest” trait is slightly overt, but it's well-tied to the physical action of her mask falling.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in decay and healing through acceptance is potent, but its delivery is occasionally heavy-handed. The final realization, "healing wasn’t about erasing the past, but about finding the beauty in its cracks," is a direct thematic statement that slightly undermines the power of the images that came before. This tendency to explicitly state the moral of the story holds it back from true subtlety, bordering on the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of non-linear growth is thoughtfully integrated through the central metaphor. However, the final two paragraphs slip into direct thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's meaning ("growth was not a straight line..."). This over-explanation weakens the resonance of the final image, undermining the subtext established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of memory and finding wholeness in fragmentation emerges organically from the story's particulars. The final image of the bold chalk mark is a superb, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final two sentences state the theme too directly ("he didn’t need to see the future anymore... that was enough"), slightly weakening the resonance by explaining what the preceding action had already shown so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of defying entropy versus embracing transience is woven throughout. The story resists a simple moral, with Elias's final leap being an act of escape rather than control, a resonant answer to his initial motivation. The final image of the leap provides a powerful, non-literal conclusion, though the central "leaf falling" motif feels somewhat underdeveloped and asserted, rather than emerging organically from earlier details.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding meaning in endings emerges powerfully from the story's particulars. However, the narrative explicitly states its own theme with phrases like "hymning the mundane" and "vessels of meaning." This thematic echo undercuts the subtlety and replaces earned resonance with direct explanation, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of revealing hidden connections between disparate systems (celestial, mechanical, magical) emerges organically from the plot. The story wisely avoids overt moralizing. The final image, where shadows become a gateway, serves as a powerful and resonant conceptual answer to the story's central question, successfully reweighting the nature of the world itself.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of grief, forgiveness, and the tension between skepticism and belief are woven skillfully through the narrative. The garden as a "mirror" is a powerful central metaphor. However, the story leans into thematic summary near the end. Lines like "forgiveness wasn’t about accepting the unforgivable—it was about recognizing that even broken things could be mended" and "The garden’s not a trick... It’s a mirror" are too explicit, stating the theme directly rather than allowing it to resonate solely through action and image. This Thematic Echo in the final beats prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of sharing versus possessing light emerges organically from character and action, culminating in the final, resonant image of the pearl dissolving into the sky. The story answers its central question without a single word of moralizing, trusting the subtext of the scales balancing light and darkness. The mother’s remembered words function as thematic anchors, not didactic statements.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of grafting new meaning onto old wounds is powerfully integrated through the story's central metaphors. While the dialogue sometimes states the theme a bit too directly ("Grafting requires vulnerability"), this is balanced by the subtlety of the imagery. The final image of the pendant, obsidian, and moss is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding a tidy moral and leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of endings as beginnings emerges organically from the story's potent imagery and central metaphor. The final scene provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, avoiding a simplistic moral. The one minor weakness is the mist-woman's dialogue ("endings aren’t walls—they’re doors"), which verges on a direct thematic statement, slightly reducing the subtextual power of an otherwise masterful piece. This prevents it from reaching the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of restoration through remembering is beautifully integrated, culminating in the resonant image of planting a new seed. The story's pivot from an individualistic to a communal solution is its core strength. However, the theme becomes slightly too explicit in the line “sacred practices need tenders, not just tinkerers,” which functions as a near-thesis statement, slightly undermining the power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of finding a meaningful pattern in chaos emerges organically from the plot. The act of creating a map from constellations to understand the soul is a powerful central metaphor that is never over-explained. The story's final image of the living map is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem, avoiding a tidy moral. The theme deepens from a technical challenge into a profound emotional and philosophical discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme exploring the tension between capturing wonder and killing it is woven beautifully into the narrative. The story uses its central conceit and final image—echoes bottled in crystalline vials—to pose a resonant question rather than delivering a simplistic moral. The final line, "Down in the cellar of reason, the keepers waited," is a perfectly executed thematic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of memory, grief, and the nature of burdens is explored with nuance and originality through the central conceit. The final image of the untouched locket provides a resonant, complex answer to the story's central question. However, the line "he’d collected the weights, not the wounds" borders on being a thematic summary, slightly over-articulating the story's thesis in a way that a top-tier publication might flag for refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of transforming loss into a tangible form is beautifully integrated through the central metaphor of carving. The final image of the lion holding light provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, a few lines articulate the theme too directly, such as, "Loss wasn’t an ending, but a transformation." This moment of telling slightly weakens an otherwise masterfully shown theme, functioning as a thematic echo that reduces the subtext's power.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of self-forgiveness and moving beyond the fragments of the past emerges organically through potent imagery rather than statement. The camera wheel, the ghost, and the final rose work in concert to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to Veyra's struggle. The story’s ambiguous ending elevates the theme, resisting a tidy moral in favor of a more complex and emotionally honest conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of repurposing broken systems is coherent, its delivery is too explicit. The final paragraphs engage in thematic summary, particularly the line "...a future built not on nostalgia, but on the courage to repurpose the old into the new." This functions as a Thematic Echo, stating the story's thesis directly instead of letting the final image resonate on its own, which weakens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of integrating a life of order with a yearning for the wild is developed with subtlety and depth, culminating in a resonant final image. The story resists a simple moral, offering a complex resolution. However, the line "The keep was not a prison. It was a compass" comes very close to stating the theme directly, which slightly diminishes the subtextual power of an otherwise masterful ending.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of truth versus manipulated narrative is central and coherent. However, the story frequently states its theme directly, bordering on didacticism ("it was a key to understanding the architecture of lies," "controlling the narrative"). The final paragraph suffers from a "Thematic Echo," summarizing the moral ("he’d found something far more valuable: the clarity to see the world as it truly was") instead of letting the final image resonate on its own, which significantly undermines its potential for subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of patient preservation versus industrial loss is beautifully and consistently developed through image and action. However, the story falters slightly at the climax with a moment of overt thematic statement. The line, "He understood now: the weavers’ legacy wasn’t a loom... It was the act of preservation itself," functions as a "Thematic Echo" that explains the moral directly, slightly undermining the power of the excellent final image. This directness prevents an otherwise outstanding thematic execution from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of healing through understanding absence is woven beautifully through the story's imagery, particularly the thread. However, the final paragraphs slip into thematic summary. Phrases like "explained absences were not endings but beginnings" state the conclusion too directly, a form of Thematic Echo that slightly undermines the resonance earned by the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of natural versus artificial beauty emerges organically from the setting and conflict for most of the story. However, the final two paragraphs pivot from resonant imagery to explicit moralizing, which severely undermines the subtext. The line, “in that imperfection, in that bitterly sweet struggle, lay the truest beauty of all,” is a textbook Thematic Echo that states the theme directly, failing to trust the reader with the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding strength and song in scars is beautifully woven through the story's imagery and action. However, the final paragraph commits a significant misstep by explicitly stating the theme: "Compassion, she thought, wasn’t about erasing the past..." This thematic summary replaces the resonance of the final image with a direct moral, a textbook "Thematic Echo" that reduces the subtextual power built so carefully throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The themes of memory, belief versus doubt, and defiant hope emerge organically from the character's journey. The final image of the restored fountains provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. However, the penultimate paragraph slips into direct thematic summary ("their liberation a testament to the power of defiance..."), which slightly weakens the otherwise potent ending by stating what the imagery had already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of refining generational patterns is coherent and well-integrated into the story's core concepts. Unfortunately, the execution relies on direct thematic statements, both in the ghost's dialogue ("Fire is a language...") and the final paragraphs. The ending explicitly summarizes its moral ("generational patterns weren’t about repeating the past, but about refining it"), which undercuts the resonance of the final images by replacing subtext with a tidy thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of processing grief through shared language is developed with potent imagery like the ribbon and the greenhouse. However, the story's thematic subtlety is severely compromised by the final poem. It functions as an explicit moral, stating the theme directly ("Grief is not a hole, but a door"), which feels like an authorial summary rather than an earned, resonant discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "incremental absolution" is powerfully dramatized through the pendulum's slow, deliberate restart. However, the final sentence explicitly states the moral ("by honoring the incremental—the tiny, persistent acts that held the world together"). This thematic echo severely undermines the resonant image that precedes it, replacing earned subtext with a tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of memory and intention persisting after death emerges organically from the central metaphors of the tapestry and the chess game. The final line of the tapestry, “The silence between moves,” is a superb, non-literal crystallization of the story's core idea. The ending avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant image that reweights the entire narrative and Elara’s purpose within it.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of balancing data with imagination is central, but its expression is too direct. The line “Data without imagination is a corpse… Imagination without data is a ghost” functions as a thematic statement that replaces subtext with a tidy thesis. While the final image of burning the journals is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions, this earlier overt moralizing reduces the overall subtlety and power.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of memory, listening, and the life within forgotten things emerges organically from the story’s particulars. It avoids any didactic statements, instead relying on resonant imagery like "teach dust to tell stories again." The final image provides a non-literal, poetic answer to the central question, leaving a lingering sense of quiet purpose and profound meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of art's value in the face of impermanence emerges organically from the setting and character actions, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the story occasionally undermines its subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like "Safety is an illusion, and art is the only truth worth chasing" feel like a summary of the theme, slightly flattening the earned complexity of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in the past versus pragmatic survival emerges organically from the conflict. The final image of Elias digging is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is lowered by a moment of thematic overstatement in the dialogue: "It’s the sound of a thousand narratives, all competing. All *true*," which states the core concept too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of creating harmony amidst discord is developed with grace and nuance, largely avoiding sentimentality. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, a few phrases like "unravel them" and the slightly self-conscious use of "*denote*" verge on thematic labels. The line "Across the unlearning hatred, they worked" feels more like a summary of the theme than a dramatized moment, a minor slip in an otherwise strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central theme of healing trauma to cultivate hope is powerfully rendered through the central metaphor of pruning. However, the final two paragraphs undermine this by explicitly stating the story's moral. Lines like "she’d proven that even in a world of rust and ruin, beauty could still grow" replace resonant imagery with a thematic summary, a significant flaw for this tier of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of wonder's necessity is central and well-integrated into the premise. However, the story leans heavily on explicit statement rather than emergent subtext. Voss’s dialogue ("The tower runs on more than electricity. It runs on the collective awe...") and Clara's subsequent speech function as thematic summaries, slightly undermining the power of the discovery. The final image resonates, but the path there is overly explained.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding meaning in the overlooked and the potential hidden within silence emerges organically from the story's particulars. The final image of the "listening" houses is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. A minor flaw is the final paragraph's slight over-explanation of the theme ("The hush wasn’t emptiness; it was potential"), which slightly dampens the purely imagistic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of reframing tragedy as sacrifice and embracing nuance is powerful and emerges organically from the plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. However, the theme is slightly compromised by Lumen's explicit statement, "*To welcome nuance into a certainty*," a moment of telling that borders on a thesis statement and momentarily flattens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the fusion of concept and character. The narrative beautifully explores the nature of grief not as a static object to be held, but as a dynamic, unceasing process. The final image of the two dice in their endless, unreachable dance provides a perfect, non-literal resolution that resonates long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme—that kindness is a language that outlives its original tongue—emerges organically through the fusion of plot, character, and image. The story powerfully resists a simplistic moral by grounding its final insight in an action: the beginning of a lesson. While the final line, “To love is to translate,” verges on explicit statement, it functions as an earned character epiphany recorded in a sketchbook, a resonant grace note rather than an authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thematic exploration of memory, art, and resilience is skillfully woven through recurring motifs like the lens, the thaw, and the bread. The story largely allows these themes to emerge from concrete particulars. However, the final act includes a line that verges on thematic summary ("Art, like bread, required patience..."), which slightly over-articulates the point instead of letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of time, fate, and defiance is masterfully woven through every element without resorting to overt moralizing. The final image of the backward-ticking clocks inside the lighthouse provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The slightly explicit line "Fate’s design had been a lock; he’d just picked it" is the only moment that borders on telling, but it's earned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of confronting fear by subverting its logic is skillfully woven into the plot mechanics. The central paradox—feeding a lie to a mouth that swallows joy—is a powerful and elegant thematic device. However, the story suffers from a "Thematic Echo" violation in the final dialogue, where Vey explicitly states, "Because fear, like beauty, is a lie." This direct moralizing undermines the subtext and prevents the theme from reaching its full resonant potential.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of transforming adversity into art is deeply and organically integrated into every element of the story. The final image of the ordered driftwood provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by the on-the-nose thematic declaration, "Obstacles are just instruments waiting to be tuned," which preempts some of the reader's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic development is sophisticated, emerging organically from the story's central mystery. The final two sentences deliver a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about protection, imprisonment, and communication. The idea that the watchers' silence was actually a "scream" is a haunting thematic reversal that avoids any moralizing and lingers with purposeful ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of truth, memory, and "noble lies" is central and developed through action rather than pure exposition. The story resists a simple moral, landing on a complex conclusion. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary with lines like "lies, even noble ones, erode unless balanced by courage," which slightly over-articulates the theme instead of letting the final image carry the full weight of the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of "Interlaced Absence" is masterfully woven through the narrative, introduced as a concept and then proven through discovery. The story avoids moralizing, allowing the final revelation in the hidden chamber to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final line, reframing dreams as "waiting to be surveyed," is a perfect thematic cadence that reweights the entire story without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of truth versus self-deception emerges organically from the plot and central discovery, providing a strong conceptual core. The final image of Lira swimming away with the journal is resonant. The score is tempered because the final paragraph veers close to summarizing its theme directly ("rebuild on honesty, not myth," "Some darknesses... become light"), which slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transforming grief is potent and woven beautifully into the story's core metaphors. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like “To transform was to carry the old into the new, to let grief and hope intertwine like vines” state the theme directly, functioning as a moral that would have been more powerful if left emergent from the story’s potent imagery alone.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of transforming trauma into a dangerous form of power is potent and explored through action rather than simple declaration. The final image of Elara as a "seer" offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the story's central question about loss. A minor deduction is applied for moments where subtext becomes explicit text, such as the direct articulation of what "unused potential" is during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of belonging is developed effectively, shifting from a technological solution to a metaphysical resonance. The final image provides a non-literal answer. However, the pilgrim’s dialogue (“The frequency isn’t in the chip. It’s in the *alignment*.”) and the whispered realization at the end come too close to stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thematic exploration of truth, memory, and silence is subtle and resonant. The story avoids any overt moralizing, instead allowing the theme to emerge organically from the central metaphor of the "sieved hush" and the physical act of uncovering secrets from driftwood. The final image provides a complex, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the weight of truth.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thematic development is strong and handled with subtlety for most of the story, especially through the central symbol of the drawer pull. The subtext is rich and the ending lands with resonance. However, a few lines articulate the theme too directly, bordering on summary, such as, "That every mistake has a handle." The final internal thought, "Between apology and forgiveness...lies the space to breathe," slightly undermines the power of the preceding actions by explaining them.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of navigating by internal versus external guides is woven effectively through the central metaphors of the compass, stars, and poles. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements. The realization that the compass "was for measuring regret" and the final paragraph’s summary of her new philosophy are moments of telling that dilute the power of the story's resonant images. This "thematic echo" flaw, especially in the closing lines, prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of empathy emerging from accepting one's past is potent and well-supported by the core imagery. However, the story falters significantly by having J.T. explicitly state the theme. The line, “That’s what empathy is—holding the pain of others because you’ve known your own,” is a textbook example of a thematic echo that undermines the subtext, replacing earned resonance with a direct moral statement.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the theme of transformation emerges organically from the conflict, the final paragraph states it too explicitly. The concluding sentence, “metamorphosis is not an ending, but a rebirth,” functions as a thematic label, undermining the resonant power of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of grief as a self-imposed prison is powerfully woven through the story’s central images: the crack, the untraced hands, the Hanged Man. The final image of the added handprint is a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara’s quest. However, the mother’s on-the-nose declaration, “repentance isn’t a place. It’s a choice,” is a thematic echo that states the story's thesis directly, momentarily flattening the subtext and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of reimagining pacifism as active courage is potent and well-developed through Lira's internal journey. The story falters by explicitly stating its theme in the climax ("peace is not the absence of war but the presence of courage"). This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a direct moral, weakening the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transformation emerges powerfully, but its resonance is diminished by moments of over-explicitness. The man’s line, “Fixing isn’t transformation,” and the narrator’s summary of Lira’s new “purpose” in the final paragraphs state the theme directly rather than allowing it to rest entirely within the story's potent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of a quiet revolution of ideas is present but handled with little subtext. The story explicitly contrasts "fire or force" with the "cradle of sparks." The final lines, "Let’s go spark a revolution" and "the spark can’t be extinguished," state the theme directly rather than letting the final image resonate on its own. The concept is also muddled by describing the cradle as both an "idea" and a literal, physical storeroom.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of witnessing versus controlling emerges organically from Lira's struggle. However, its power is diminished by overly explicit statements in the final paragraphs. The lines *“The promise wasn’t to control...but to witness”* and *“had finally learned to listen”* function as thematic summaries, replacing the resonance of the final image with a stated moral, which is a notable flaw for this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story's theme of revealing scars versus hiding behind masks is developed with nuance and power, emerging organically from the central metaphors. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question without resorting to moralizing. The theme is slightly over-articulated in the line that dissects "furious tranquil," but this is a small blemish on an otherwise superb execution.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of inquiry is brilliantly woven into the story’s central conceit and imagery. However, the piece undermines its own subtlety with heavy-handed thematic statements, particularly in the last two paragraphs. The line "they found not answers, but better questions" is an unnecessary summary that weakens an otherwise resonant conclusion by stating the moral directly.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of creating beauty from decay is woven deeply into the story's fabric, but its expression is occasionally too explicit. Phrases like "To forge beauty from anarchy, you must first become the anarchy" function as overt thematic statements rather than emergent truths. This slight lack of subtext prevents the theme from achieving its full potential resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is woven seamlessly into the narrative through recurring, charged objects—the two clocks, the compasses, the pianos. The story explores the tension between artistic control and chaotic reality without resorting to didacticism. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict, achieving a thematic depth that lingers impressive for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of memory versus fear is coherent, its delivery is overly explicit, harming the story's literary potential. The dialogue from the primordial dreamer ("memory is not a cage but a compass") is a direct thematic statement that replaces subtext with sermon. This "thematic echo" prevents the theme from emerging organically through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story's themes of memory, forgiveness, and the rhythm of healing are woven beautifully through the central metaphors of bonsai and lacework. However, the final paragraph resorts to an explicit thematic summary ("a reminder that some wounds, like roots, grow stronger when nurtured"). This moment of telling slightly undermines the powerful showing that preceded it, creating a "Thematic Echo" that lessens the resonance of an otherwise subtle piece.
