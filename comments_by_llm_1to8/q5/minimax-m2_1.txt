  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—truth surviving fire, beauty through suffering—emerges organically from glass imagery and the ledger's survival. The final image ("light breaking through glass") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the conceptual repricing leans abstract: "proof that truth survived even the hottest fires" is stated rather than enacted through a concrete choice or cost. Subtext operates in image and metaphor but the thematic turn feels more lyric summary than earned transformation. Strong thematic coherence but the ending's resonance is asserted more than built from prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (art survives catastrophe; feeling can be read in residue) emerges through concrete thermal mapping and spatial layering rather than statement. The tuning fork case and conservatory architecture supply recurring images that accumulate meaning. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt summary: "had survived," "had become the translator they needed," "waiting for someone to remember how to listen" articulates the thesis rather than leaving it implicit in the closing image. The piece avoids moralizing but tilts explanatory at closure, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—finding rest, both for the dead and the living; the reciprocal nature of care—emerges organically from Aldric's work and is charged by the lens repair as souls pass through. The image of the lens "glowing softly with a light that would never go dark" offers a resonant answer to the question of how to honor the unrecovered. Subtext operates in "the ways that required him to spend real time" and the shift from weariness to readiness. However, the final phrase "he discovered that he wasn't tired anymore" edges toward direct statement rather than letting the image alone carry the thematic weight, and "He was ready" feels slightly thesis-like.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete action—intergenerational continuity, exile as continuation rather than ending, memory across borders. The silver bell functions as a charged recurring object that shifts from personal heirloom to communal召唤, avoiding overt symbolism. The final image (Mariem and Farouk together, "understanding instinctively") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. One weakness: the phrase "some things must ring across the silence of loss" risks abstract philosophizing, though it remains brief and rooted in the grandmother's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of unused love seeking outlet emerges through image and action rather than statement, and the camera obscura work as "spiritual photography" integrates concept with craft. The final image of love "flowing through...back into the world" offers a resonant answer to the implicit question. However, the ending leans toward tidy transformation without ambiguity or counter-reading, and phrases like "the universe had asked her to hold" veer close to New Age abstraction. The wisteria and tear recur with shifted meaning, but the thematic closure is more reassuring than deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: temporal horticulture, disintegration as universal law, the texture of time as experiential residue. The piece avoids thesis statements; the final image of Elara drawing while the bridges "lean forward to listen" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The photographs' dual-temporal nature and the garden's geometry ground abstract concepts in concrete mechanics. Minor slip: the final paragraph edges toward articulating theme ("the only way to stop the disintegration...") rather than letting image alone carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—resilience, the refusal to die, memory against erasure—emerges organically from vault, seeds, and Mira's patient defiance. The final image, "the small, stubborn miracle of things that refused to die," lands as a resonant answer without didacticism. The wall's fall reframes ending as beginning, a conceptual repricing that reweights the entire premise. Subtext operates in the chains-as-disguise, the arrow sigil, and the carnival's forgotten life. No overt moralizing, and the theme integrates fully with the clandestine-network particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme—what we hear when something ends—emerges organically from Elara's device-work and David's memory loss, avoiding overt statement. The final image (hope sounding "like someone beginning to speak a word they had forgotten how to say") reweights prior material without moralizing. The piece resists tidy closure and allows ambiguity, though the thematic question receives more assertion than dramatized cost in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of "stolen moments" and "destiny's whispers" is coherent and recurs through image and idiom. The moonbeam ritual and camellia symbolism offer a purposeful motif system. However, the final paragraph over-articulates the theme with direct statements ("the only true theft was the failure to listen when fate knocked"), crossing into sermonizing. The ending asserts meaning rather than allowing the closure image to resonate non-literally, reducing thematic subtlety and inviting a −0.5 penalty for moralizing in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of transformation through breaking and thawing emerges concretely through the cracked bookmark, the melting ice, and the shaped glass vessel. The "safe zones for inquiry" motivation and the "weighty lightness" phrase veer into abstract philosophizing rather than arising from particulars. The final image of bookmark-beside-glass gestures toward resonance but does not reweight prior material—it summarizes the theme rather than offering a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the craft gestures and seasonal imagery, but the piece edges toward thematic echo in "prepared to begin again."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (vulnerability as strength) emerges through particulars—the phobia, stunt-double career irony, the seashell's maternal voice—and the final image attempts resonance when Maya recognizes her own voice "waiting to be born." However, the ending tips into thesis statement: "vulnerability, fully embraced, was the ultimate strength" and "trembling certainty was its own form of courage" are direct thematic assertions rather than earned through scene pressure. The child's cast and seashell recur with purpose, but their meaning shift is narrated ("Each decrypted word strengthened her resolve") instead of shown through a non-literal final image that reweights prior material without stating the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—understanding silence, mapping darkness, trusting patient language over speech—emerges from particulars (pebbles, booklet diagrams, grandmother's lessons). The final image attempts non-literal resonance: "her work began" suggests the map's life beyond her, but this is told rather than shown through a charged visual or action. The piece resists moralizing but also defaults to thematic echo ("by allowing the silence to speak for her") in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the robot's recursive self-examination and the impossible music metaphor. The final image—"accepting the flow, the endless stream of small perceptions"—offers a resonant answer to the consciousness question without moralizing. The ice violin's passage through time paralleling thought's elusiveness is purposeful and specific. One slip: "remarkably composed robot listens, cleaned and repaired and somehow, impossibly, reborn" risks a tidy emotional resolution that slightly undercuts the harder existential ambiguity the piece has built.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the concert-ticket exchange and projector-lens imagery: transparency requires mediation, clarity comes through ambiguity, trust rebuilds via non-verbal particulars. The mirror-reflecting-mirror drawing offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (can honesty survive without words?) without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the hand-touch, the saved ticket, the lens's weight shift. The final image—pen raised not to write but to draw—reweights prior material: words failed, images might succeed, and the narrator accepts the cost of repeated vulnerability. No thematic echo or label-speak in the ending. Epiphany (lens as "tool for the future") is earned by the sequence of Mira's arrival, touch, and others approaching.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the marbles' cracks, the maze's resurrection, and the proposition that "gardens remember." The final image reweights prior material by positioning documentation (cracked marbles) and patient resurrection as intertwined. However, the penultimate line borders on thematic echo: "every withered vine a story of patient resurrection waiting to unfold for whoever took the time to walk the paths and notice" leans toward summary rather than image. The piece avoids overt moralizing but the ending's articulation of theme slightly undercuts resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of time's sideways nature emerges through the velith-wings' dual molt phases and the station's "breathing rhythms," but the final paragraph asserts the discovery ("time had revealed its sideways nature") rather than letting the image resonate without explanation. The leap from sky mechanic to xenobiological breakthrough is declared ("would reshape…forever") instead of earned through a specific, non-literal cost. "Mechanically warm beings—herself and the creatures alike" gestures at connection but remains abstract, lacking the concrete particular that would anchor thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of connection across mortality through music emerges from particulars (water as revelation, notation between the lines, wordless conversation). The final image of Elena leaving with the transmission complete offers a resonant answer to the question of how the living commune with the dead. However, the ending paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("the only language that transcended everything except itself") rather than letting the image alone carry weight. The "spaces between" motif recurs but functions more as metaphoric decoration than a constraint that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the botanical illustration's smudge—imperfection as "the most honest feature"—and the accumulating images of margins, periphery, and swaying certainty. The final image (Mira's heart "light enough to do its work," eyes on "the margins where weather began") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how one lives with error. Elena's unheard word crystallizes as "forgive" without being stated earlier, avoiding thematic echo. The story resists moralizing: grief's "exact mass" is felt rather than explained, and the ending balances cost (terror swallowed) with resumption of duty.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the particulars: the weight of unspoken confession, the need for witness, and the liminal spaces where truth can be set down. The beaded valve wheel and radio voices accumulate meaning without over-explanation. The final image—Marcus speaking into the waiting tunnel—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The "factory ghost shift" functions as Conceptual Repricing, reweighting the supernatural premise through the human need for confession and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of witnessing and transformation emerges from concrete images (composting knowledge, regenerative silence), avoiding direct statement. However, the ending merely restates the premise ("the work continued") without a non-literal answer or reweighted particulars. Subtext operates in "loose grip" and "crumbling peace," but epiphanies are asserted ("had learned," "had become") rather than earned through specific struggle. The final paragraph's thematic echo ("without beginning or end") reads as summary rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the eclipse metaphor, the baby-curl keepsake, and the contrast between preservation and unfolding. "Ordinary magic" is woven into action rather than stated, and the final reflection on the curl honors continuity without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution and sustains complexity, though the closing paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("This was ordinary magic: not spells...") that slightly dilutes the otherwise resonant image work.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly from the material: stories and dreams as "fuel" that sustains reality's axis, and their loss as an existential crack. The dragons-as-guardians motif accumulates meaning from tapestry to diary to final warming pulse, and the closing line—"displaced, but it had not been destroyed"—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution: Elias cannot restore what was lost, only gather "threads holding together a world that had lost its axis of wonder." Subtext operates in the image of dragons whose "fire had burned backward into the dreams themselves," a resonant metaphor for self-destruction. No prompt-like thesis statement intrudes; the conceptual cost (permanent displacement) charges the ending without explaining it away.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of espionage-as-prophecy and the nature of orchestration versus surrender emerges organically from concrete particulars (fortune cookies, microdot specs, lighthouse beam). The recurring image of "directing flow" shifts meaning across beats without overt statement. The final paragraph attempts resonance through the lighthouse beam metaphor ("illuminating the dark while leaving everything else in familiar shadow"), which reweights the orchestration premise without moralizing. However, "Some journeys end where they began" and the meta-commentary on "orchestrating means setting things in motion and stepping back" edge toward thematic summary rather than letting the image alone do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the particulars: possession as hidden agreement, questions as exorcism tools, singular color as focus metaphor. The "unspoken agreement hidden in the architecture of assumption" integrates with Matthias's scholarly method without didacticism. Alizarin crimson's recurrence ("wound that refused to heal") gains meaning through repetition. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection on thresholds and cooperation. However, the ending does not offer a resonant answer—it stops before the interrogation, leaving theme promising but unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme—permission for unheard symphonies, temporal homesickness as soul-recognition—emerges from concrete images (nautilus chambers, mirrored horizon, ginger-snow fusion) rather than thesis statements. The final fortune "The symphony you hear in silence is not a rehearsal" offers a non-literal answer to the premise. However, it arrives as authorial declaration rather than earned from on-page friction; no complexity or counter-reading exists because the protagonist never doubts or struggles with the insight, reducing resonance to gentle affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of self-integration through recursive encounter with fragmented timelines emerges organically from the tablet, viaduct, and fracture imagery. The "labyrinth of self" and "periodically eternal" concepts resonate without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("the only way through was through," "patterns she could finally control") rather than letting the image stand alone. The core question—can Mira become whole?—is addressed via assertion in the last lines rather than a non-literal answer grounded in prior particulars, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—silence as a different language rather than absence—emerges organically from the backward recordings and Maren's bodily receptivity. The "filament of hush" motif recurs with shifting meaning, culminating in the closing image where it "sang, in a language she was only beginning to learn." Avoids overt moralizing. Minor slip: "not just a survivor...but a teacher of its hidden gifts" in the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement rather than earned resonance, though it stops short of full sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of integrity versus institutional corruption emerges from Elena's fifteen-year practice and crystallizes in her decision, but the final paragraph summarizes the thematic point ("she had acted") rather than letting the image resonate. The courtyard-as-stolen-peace parallel is explicitly stated rather than embodied. "Witnesses" as a descriptor for storm records offers a fresh angle, but the pigeon-as-obsolete-technology conceit is told more than demonstrated through world resistance or surprised antagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of threshold, transformation, and impossible choice emerges organically through the spiral motif and Mira's pattern-drawing. The rope's shift from prison-escape tool to ritual instrument reweights its meaning. However, the final paragraph edges toward abstract philosophizing ("impossible tension before choice") rather than letting the image speak. The piece resists moralizing but stops short of offering a resonant, non-literal answer that transforms prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the grandmother's storytelling tradition, the mendicant's bowl as witness, and the orchard as "beautifully, terribly unfinished." The final image—carrying the bowl "like a promise kept across generations"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: beauty is inseparable from damage. Subtext operates through the bowl's vibration, the echoes, and Marina's playing for both loss and stubborn renewal. Minor: "to find beauty in the unfinished" is stated directly in the penultimate paragraph, though it is also dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—truth versus useful fiction, the ethics of manufactured empathy—emerges through concrete action (compound design, self-testing, the static-reading method) rather than declaration until the final beat. The realization "her half truths had always been whole lies if she was honest, but useful ones, necessary ones" reweights her professional ethos without moralizing; the final image (exhale, suspension of work) offers a resonant non-literal answer. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites ambiguity about whether her "affectionate detachment" is compassion or evasion. Minor slip: "what people needed was not absolute honesty but useful fiction" leans slightly didactic mid-paragraph, nudging this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—the dignity and interconnection of invisible labor—emerges organically from Maren's profession, her grandmother's legacy, the locket photo's history, and Elias's copyist career. The annotated program and reproduced photo function as concrete tokens that reweight prior material without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the pairing of net-mender and seamstress, cargo manifests signed with lighthouses, and decades spent "uplifting silent contributors." The final image of "cycles of compassion...like ships finding their harbor by starlight" risks abstraction but is anchored by the prior particulars. The ending invites reflection without forcing a thesis, though "cautious exuberance" edges toward summary rather than dramatized resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the arbor image: kinship requires presence and reciprocity, not performative self-sacrifice. The Threader's spiral-within-spiral motif recurs with purpose—it appears as street art, in the arbor bark, and finally as path marks—accumulating meaning from mystery to practice to invitation, reweighting Yara's search from finding a person to embodying a dedication. The final image "spiral within spiral, leading her deeper into the web" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in Corwin's "honestly" and Yara's recognition that villages "had taken and taken" because she "had never asked to receive," avoiding overt thesis statements. The marsh-reed sculptures shift from "questions she hadn't learned to ask" to shapes co-created with community, deepening thematic resonance through concrete objects rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—memory, loss, preservation of the ephemeral—emerges from concrete images (vanishing moth, last songs of singing eels, city's voice) rather than stated thesis. The infinity pendant shifts from heirloom to tool, a purposeful reprise that reweights meaning at closure. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("preserved forever against any future silence"), and the grandmother's role as wise guide borders on stock mentorship. The piece resists overt moralizing but stops short of a non-literal answer; the resolution is tidy rather than resonant with ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—grief's geometry, the limits of understanding, pattern-finding as coping—emerges organically from the mosaic imagery and the conjurer's method. The final image of leaving the eyes as an offering while retaining "buried, stubborn, gently inventive hope" resonates without overt moralizing. Subtext operates through the dovetailing metaphor and the glass eyes' origin story. However, the closing lines veer toward explicating the theme ("understanding might not be the point at all") rather than letting the image carry it, and the phrase "mathematics of emotion" risks abstraction. Still, the particulars (chipped tiles, taxidermist's glass eyes) ground the meditation enough to avoid pure thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of unseen work and transmission emerges clearly from particulars (crawl space dwelling, cache keeping, ferromagnetic tape as covenant). The tape fragment functions as a resonant object that shifts meaning from debris to message. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic statement ("she exists not to be seen but to help the lost find their way—and that this, too, is a kind of visibility") that replaces image with assertion. The student's off-page answer feels like symbolic convenience rather than earned consequence, weakening the thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme (transformation through surrender, not control) emerges from particulars: the damaged vines reconstructing, the linden leaf released, the caterpillar metaphor. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—new growth "constructing something that could only exist because of [loss]"—without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Vera's circuitous speech to Sarah and in the gap between her professional precision and personal avoidance. The vine image meaningfully reweights prior material; no thematic echo or moralizing mars the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of meaning-making after collapse emerges organically through water trails, convergence metaphor, and the brooch-for-telescope trade. The final image—"closed her eyes and finally let go"—offers a quiet answer to the search without overt moralizing. However, "thresh meaning from experience" is articulated too directly by the narrator, and the stranger's line "You've earned it" edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars—warm pearls in cold depths, shadows that move when unwatched, crystals singing in "steady unpredictability"—rather than assertion. "The future was not a country to be mapped and claimed. It was a garden to be tended" risks platitude but is anchored by the nine-day dramatized learning. The central question (what is the relationship between foresight and presence?) receives a resonant answer in the final image: "a man who had seen the limits of seeing, and found them beautiful." Subtext operates in the pilgrim's lingering "memory of human hope" and Varen's initial blindness to it. The closing avoids moralizing by returning to embodied state rather than thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of memory, preservation, and reconstruction emerges organically through the valve, fragments, and visions rather than stated. The final image—hand closing around the valve while watching boats arrive—offers a resonant answer to what role the past plays in rebuilding community. The "navigated absences" concept operates more as atmospheric backdrop than a force that meaningfully complicates choices on the page. The ending avoids moralizing and allows complexity: preservation is both burden and bridge, solitary and communal.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of unspoken truths emerges from the fortress conceit and Aria's confession, meeting the core requirement. The phantom punch and mist recur with slight reweighting at the end. However, the final paragraph moralizes: "courage was just another path to be mapped" is a thesis statement rather than an earned image. The confession itself—"I loved your teaching…terrified of becoming lost"—reads sincere but abstracts the emotional stakes. The piece gestures toward complexity (fear, love, loss) but resolves into tidy self-knowledge without ambiguity or cost. Prompt-like language ("fortress of unspoken truths," "analytically artistic") echoes throughout, reducing organic emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the tile's discovery and Mira's shift from measurement to participation without overt moralizing. The recurring images (whales, stone, tower) accumulate pressure and the final palm-press reweights prior material effectively. The piece resists tidy resolution by preserving Mira's skepticism alongside wonder. However, phrases like "courageously kind offerings" and "threshold between worlds" lean slightly toward thematic echo, though they don't fully collapse into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the immortal's search and the amulet's curse, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph. The "goodbye as doorway" concept resonates but arrives through assertion rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The ending sentence ("some goodbyes were merely hellos in a language older than stars") edges toward platitude and explicit thematic summary, weakening the resonance that concrete particulars had built.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges clearly from particulars: honest daughter of a con artist finding fair exchange without deception. The ink pot and chrysanthemums recur with shifting weight, and the final image (flowers, resuming work, "lives fully accounted") reweights the opening's father/daughter dichotomy without stating a moral. The "rigid thinking could liquefy" metaphor risks on-the-nose articulation but stays tied to Elena's work and the ink's properties. Minor slip: "the mathematics of a fair trade" is invoked repeatedly without sufficient scene friction to fully earn the proof metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme—silence as full rather than empty, history as texture—emerges organically from the bonsai rings, refracted light, and layered frequencies. The prism's scatter and the phrase "time is not a river but a forest" offer resonant images without overt moralizing. However, the ending does not reweight prior material; it restates the premise. The line "every silence contains a thousand voices waiting to be heard" borders on thematic echo, though it stays within the meditative register.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges cleanly from the label's reweighting: survival as continuation despite erasure. The final image ("one that belonged to survival itself") resonates without moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph edges into thematic summary ("one that could not be erased by any document") where image alone would have sufficed, and "the texture of memories" reads as prompt echo rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—unspoken connections, ephemeral understanding—emerges from the cello's function and Elena's reimagined dialogues. The painted seashell's spirals suggest meaning moves in circles, a purposeful image. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "some mysteries were not meant to be busted but embraced" and "the compass of human connection pointed...inward." This is thematic echo and moralizing that replaces earned resonance. The "ongoing hum" image is evocative but arrives after the explanation, reducing its charge. Subtext operates in the cello/seashell dynamic, yet the ending summarizes rather than dramatizes the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of community foundation versus commerce emerges through the stone chip and graffiti network without overt statement. The dual allegiance—home vs. inevitable change—operates in Mira's reflection and her choice to "shape how gentrification unfolded" rather than stop it. The final image of the stone chip shifting from relic to promise offers a non-literal answer, though the reweighting is told ("felt less like a relic and more like a promise") rather than shown through a concrete action. The cipher as living tradition vs. aesthetic spectacle carries conceptual resonance but lacks friction or ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: witnessing ephemeral beauty, documentation as acknowledgment of loss, continuity across human passage. The grain of sand and chemical timer accumulate meaning without overt statement. The final image—carrying proof of beauty in lonely places—offers a resonant answer to the implicit question. Minor deduction: the penultimate paragraph's "melancholy truth she had accepted" edges toward explicit theme summary rather than letting the image alone carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges implicitly from Elias's work: repair as connection, transformation of feedback into direction. The water-basin method offers a concrete particular that could resonate, but the final two paragraphs state the theme overtly ("proof that even in a world of machines and distance, someone's heart still reached toward someone else's"). The closing moralizing—"It was honest work, and it mattered"—replaces scene pressure with thesis statement, undercutting what could have been a resonant image-based ending.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges from particulars: the convergence as both geographical fact and metaphor for origin, belonging, and discovery. The final image—"all things, given time, find where they belong"—hovers near explicit thesis but is anchored in condensation, water seeking level, and prior interpretive work. Subtext operates in the phrasebook's faded pencil note ("origin") and the silence of researchers who came before. The piece resists moralizing until the last clause, which softens resonance slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme—community health as interconnected resonance, revival through patient accumulation—emerges organically from Eliorn's method and the town's decay. The piece resists overt moralizing; wisdom arises from her specialized practice rather than platitudes. The final image (cobblestones humming, two thousand steps remaining) offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question of how silence is healed. One slip: "shared balance" and "web of settlements" edge toward thematic summary rather than letting the particulars speak fully for themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of ephemerality, preservation, and sacrifice emerges organically from the temple's purpose ("trap designed to capture and hold the gathered essence") and Marina's transformation. The perfume as vessel for "accumulated hush of ten thousand voices" avoids overt statement. The final image—"lonesome and splendid all at once"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of preservation without moralizing. Subtext operates in the grandmother's warning, the family's multi-generational preparation, and Marina's realization that the temple "needed a vessel." Minor slip: "ephemeral nature of all things beautiful" borders on abstraction, but concrete images (incense, robes, twilight through water) anchor it.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—truth disbelieved, inheritance of story, the cost of speaking into silence—emerges from Marcus's journey and the lattice/lighthouse motifs. The final image of becoming "the second cry wolf" who "sustained impossibilities by simply refusing to let them end" offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. Yet the thematic work is somewhat front-loaded: "the wolves had been real all along" is stated plainly rather than discovered through scene pressure. The copperlight repose and lattice reprise charge the ending, but the piece edges toward abstract philosophizing ("copperlight repose of a story finally allowed to finish itself") that dilutes emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—debt, service, generational handoff, growth bound to responsibility—emerges from the scions' transformation, the bead's "loving venom," and the gardener's involuntary inheritance. The final image (stars recognizing old positions, Elara nearly finished) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Loving venom" and "alchemical gift" recur with shifting weight, avoiding token motif placement. Subtext operates in the gardener's unexplained tears and the bead's dual blessing/curse nature. One weakness: "to wake sleeping plants was to wake sleeping debts" articulates the premise too directly in the penultimate paragraph, edging toward thematic echo (−0.3 in this range).

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (healing through persistent craft, reweaving broken traditions) emerges organically from Maren's actions and the canyon's history rather than statement. The illustration plate and the path-stitching tradition provide concrete anchors. The piece avoids overt moralizing and allows the final image—stitching the spring's rim—to answer the thematic question without declaring a thesis. However, phrases like "orchid solace" and "hauntingly optimistic" edge toward label-speak, and the ending summarizes transformation ("a luminous thread leading all who followed it toward healing and home") in slightly abstract terms rather than letting the image alone carry the weight. The thematic question is posed and answered, but the resonance is diluted by exposition in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete images: roots drinking from bones, the sundial marking sacred hours, the apple tree connecting above and below. The piece resists tidy moralizing until the final two sentences, where "nothing is ever truly lost" and "something is always reaching toward the light" edge toward direct statement. The interrupted-journeys motif is woven through grandmother's flight, great-aunt's death, and Mira's delayed arrival, then paid off in her choice to continue rather than complete. The sundial's shadow "marking the hours once more" offers a resonant answer to the central question without overstating it. Minor thematic echo in the penultimate sentence lowers the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of meaning in margins and the power of surface mail in an instant-transmission age emerges through particulars: codes in chalk, the pseudonym as revelation, the ritual of handwritten correspondence. The postscript "Some names are not disguises but revelations" edges toward direct statement but remains tied to Eleanor's specific need. However, the ending offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; it restates the premise (trust that letters will be received) without transforming prior material or charging it with new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of suppressed voices and truth-in-silence emerges through the galaxy charts and eternal flame, but the final paragraph moralizes with prompt-like language: "carry their stories forward, weaving them into the light where they could finally be heard" (−0.5 for explicit thematic statement replacing scene pressure). The candle recurs with shifted meaning (reveal → guide → patience) but does not constrain the ending choice. Subtext operates in "disguise as foolishness" but remains asserted rather than dramatized through implication. No resonant, non-literal answer to the central question; the ending declares rather than enacts.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the swamp's liminality, the unsent letter, and the gargoyle as witness: the space where apology waits and the cost of self-forgiveness. The final image—holding both versions of herself in "the same tender, fierce, unbroken space"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The condensation messages shift from external command to internal permission, deepening the thematic question of who grants forgiveness. Subtext operates in silence (the letter never sent) and image (the gargoyle shard warming). The gargoyle's return with reweighted meaning (witness becomes healer) charges the closure without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—witness, translation as healing, damage becoming reef—emerges from coral, cast, and Elira's translator identity without overt statement. The final image ("lotus-hearted and ancient, beautiful in its terrible persistence") offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in Fatima's silence and the grandmother's weeping. No thematic echo or moralizing intrudes. The "shrewdly innocent" label hovers as tell rather than dramatized tension, and the coral metaphor risks over-curation, but the ending reweights prior material with earned poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—continuation versus preservation, joy passing "like a flame that never quite goes out"—emerges through concrete action: the fragment giving its colors, the children imitating the dancer, the knowledge network awaiting "not preservation, but continuation." The final image of dancers staying "in the eyes of the children" offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Minor slip: "the fold of a daydream that stretched across centuries" in the closing line edges toward abstract embroidery rather than letting the prior particulars hold the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—exchange of certainty for curiosity, listening as communion—emerges through the garden's acoustics and the carved musician's posture. The hobo nickel and mural musicians create a non-literal motif that avoids overt statement. However, the final paragraph edges toward direct thesis: "Some truths are not found in answers but in the willingness to exchange certainty for curiosity" feels closer to summary than resonant image. The nested awakenings concept charges the middle but the ending reweights prior material only moderately.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cognitive-tax premise and resistance-through-gardening concept are vivid, but theme is asserted through direct statements rather than earned through pressure. "Thoughts might be taxable, but the refusal to stop thinking—that was beyond their formulas" is thematic summary rather than dramatized insight. The final image of Maren standing guard repeats the opening posture without reweighting prior material through cost or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the transformation of pain into beauty, longing as geography, continuance as faith. The photosynthesis metaphor and "blossom armistice" integrate grief, creativity, and endurance without overt moralizing. The final image—poems as tendrils/roots/blossoms offered to silence—reweights the premise with quiet resonance. The piece resists false equivalence and embraces complexity (the peculiar joy of the long wait, reef-shadow beauty). Minor deduction: "This is what poets do" briefly edges toward thematic summary, though it is quickly grounded in the specific greenhouse metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of preservation versus forgetting is coherent and avoids overt moralizing. "Foxglove regret" as "love for things that could not be recovered coupled with a fierce determination" offers complexity. However, thematic resonance remains abstract; the caretaker's final rounds and preparation for tomorrow literalize the cycle without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer. The wind chime's return and "soft recognition" glow echo setup without charging the ending with fresh cost or insight.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—truth, trust, and the cost of honesty woven through language—emerges clearly from particulars (the extinct tongue "could only be spoken truthfully"). The final image of "a place before paths diverge" and "symphonies of truth" continuing their resonance offers a non-literal answer to the central question, but the language leans abstract and prompt-like ("interconnected promises," "unflinching honesty") rather than embodied. The glass ink well's recurrence charges the ending weakly; its shift from gift to vessel of renewal is legible but not indispensable. No overt moralizing, yet the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of harmonizing conflicting values—preservation vs. control, individual vs. collective—is woven through floodgate engineering and the amphitheater's design. "Encrypted compassion" emerges from the adhesive analysis and shapes her understanding of absence as love. The final image of measured harmony through the surveyor's chain offers resonance without overt moralizing. However, the thematic question is more illustrated than tested; Elara does not grapple with a dilemma that forces her to harmonize incompatible goods on the page. The ending asserts continuity ("harmony found its enduring form") rather than reweighting the premise through a non-literal, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—trust as practice, messages across voids—emerges organically from the Echo Project, grandmother's courier work, and Eleanor's aviary silence. The final image of the voice "blooming and withering in the same breath" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The meteorite motif recurs with reweighted meaning (papers → chip → transducer) and the lullaby about birds carrying messages between worlds directly charges the closure without stating a thesis. Minor slip: "trust is not a single decision but a practice" edges toward abstract summary in the penultimate sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (thresholds, boundaries as invitations, patterns beneath chaos) is stated overtly in the final two paragraphs rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The closing line—"every boundary was also a doorway, and every distance was simply an invitation to move closer"—moralizes instead of offering a resonant image. Grain-reading and weather codes supply motif, but recurrence does not constrain choice or charge closure; they remain decorative. The piece gestures toward earned wisdom but delivers abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme—belonging as shared breath rather than calculated pattern—emerges organically from the researchers' archived loneliness and Marek's kinship realization. The burnt feather, bioluminescence, and firefly constellations function as recurring motifs that shift meaning: from inheritance to recognition, from isolation to communion. The final image offers a non-literal answer ("a breath to be shared, a moment of wonder witnessed together") without overt moralizing. However, "he understood, finally" edges toward direct statement rather than pure embodiment. The piece resists tidy resolution while maintaining conceptual clarity; the fireflies' impossible ascent charges the wonder without explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through the crater glass, seeds, and the geode's patient light rather than direct statement. The final image—"Some paths don't disappear...They just lead somewhere unexpected"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The phrase "cheerful gloom" in the penultimate paragraph borders on thematic echo but is framed as a professional stance rather than a thesis statement, and the particulars (tears, light, fragments) ground the emotional truth. The ending reweights the father's sorrow into a form of peace, embodying the theme through scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—art as controlled chaos, the seduction of structure within randomness—emerges cleanly from particulars (bishop, billiard balls, wave-counting) without overt thesis statements. The arcade's mechanical rhythms mirror Marek's method, and the final image of "calculating tomorrow's performance" reinforces rather than reweights the premise. However, the piece gestures toward complexity without dramatizing cost or ambiguity: Marek's philosophy faces no counter-pressure, and the ending offers thematic echo rather than a resonant non-literal answer that transforms prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically from image and event: exile as arrival, gaps as invitations, tide's inevitable return. The moonstone speck and the garden's liminal hour support the theme without overt statement. However, the final paragraph becomes thematic summary—"exile is not a leaving but a arriving" and "the gaps we observe are not absences but invitations"—rather than trusting the verse-writing image to carry resonance. The piece resists tidy morals elsewhere, but the ending leans toward direct articulation of its central question.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the pond's rings, glass as revelation, and "illuminate value in the mundane." The final image offers a resonant answer—stillness and motion, chaos to order—without overt moralizing. However, the thematic recurrence feels circular rather than reweighted; the glazier ends where she began, seeing patterns but not choosing differently. Subtext operates in image and implication, avoiding label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—transformation of personal trauma into collective light—emerges through image and ritual rather than thesis. The pressed flower, spiderwebbed mirror, and "hard softness" motif support this resonance. However, the final two paragraphs drift toward explicit moralizing: "The fire doesn't care… But we do. That's what makes us necessary and what makes us break" and "to transform her burning into someone else's light" state the theme rather than trusting the enacted ritual. This lowers the score per the anti-pattern guidance on sermonizing endings.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of hope-as-methodology emerges clearly through the altitude gauge, trial balloons, and erosion metaphor, but it is repeatedly stated rather than enacted: "hope required rigorous methodology," "revitalization of hope required sustained effort," "hope's mathematics required precision and imagination." The final paragraph explicitly sermonizes the thematic thesis rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. The parallel-timeline premise remains abstract decoration; no particular choice or observation grounds the concept in embodied experience, leaving the theme as asserted philosophy rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of legacy as burden-turned-continuation emerges organically through concrete particulars: the brass lenses, half-burned diaries, Ashworth's question about what walls dream. The final image—Mira sketching in darkness, ivy joining the chorus—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Minor drag from the phrase "legacy's burden" appearing twice as a near-label, and Ashworth's climactic question ("what do walls dream about, after everyone who gave them meaning has gone?") borders on thematic echo by articulating the premise directly, though it is mediated through recovered text rather than authorial voice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of possibility versus fixed reality emerges through concrete images (ballroom showing dancers, hand mirror revealing young hope, servants' shard showing collapsed barriers). The mirage-painting metaphor integrates with Aria's method. However, the final paragraph lapses into direct thematic statement: "promise that mirrors...never quite looked at the world the same way again" and "wherever possibility needed to be persuasion" tell rather than show. The piece gestures toward transformation without dramatizing resistance or cost, making the thematic claim feel asserted rather than earned through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—"peace does not honor the dead; it saves the living from becoming them"—emerges organically from Maren's ritual and the names on the clipboard. The ebony clipboard and celestial indifference recur with reweighted meaning, and the "flawed beauty" of the handshake avoids tidy moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("she had found her own redemption...in the endless, gentle muster of trying") rather than letting the image speak. The concept of "price of redemption" hovers as abstraction; the particulars anchor it, but the ending tilts toward articulation of the thesis instead of a resonant, non-literal final image.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—preservation, playing god, the cost of obsession—emerges from concrete particulars (the egg's translucent shell, the dried riverbeds, the silent bird). The final image of the egg alone on the salt flat offers resonance without moralizing. However, lines like "fractured grace of her undertaking" and "simply driven" veer toward thematic self-annotation. The piece invites reflection on the ethics of resurrection, but the lack of on-page conflict between her values weakens the thematic charge at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the contrast between conformity and resistance, charged by recurring images of the lullaby, threads, and awakening. The final image of defiant beauty reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the "lullaby of conformity" and "quiet rebellion" risk abstraction; the piece would benefit from one concrete, non-obvious dramatization of what compliance costs or what defiance enables. The ending offers resonance but stops short of a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—ethical storytelling as refusal to complete—emerges from the reverse-telling action and the planted stick image without overt moralizing. The radar dome as "fallen celestial eye" and the story stick as "horizontal monument" resonate without shouting. The meteor's arrival mirrors internal combustion. The final image (stick planted, Elias departing) offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question. Minor slip: "ethical care" in the final sentence edges toward abstraction rather than letting the image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of honoring overlooked histories through temporary, patient acts emerges organically from Elara's work and the grotto's transience. The moth wing, signal structures, and the monarch's lineage interweave without overt statement. The final image—"temporary things that spoke to overlooked histories in the only language they understood: the patient work of hands that refused to let silence have the final word"—reweights prior material with resonance, though the phrasing approaches thematic summary. The story commits to its premise fully, and the non-literal answer (impermanence as the condition of honor) avoids moralizing while charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges from particulars: forgiveness as self-forging, memory as burden and vessel, the rope as living archive. The punched card scrap and reconfigured braids offer concrete anchors; the final image ("forgetting was a heavier burden than remembrance") is earned rather than stated. No overt moralizing in the climax beat itself, though the penultimate paragraph edges toward summary. The protagonist's arc is inextricable from the thematic question. Subtext operates in the rope's quiet hum and Yara's walk toward the door.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—paths choosing walkers, answers as recorded questions—emerges through image and the directive's reinterpretation, avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate line's near-thesis statement. The wafer seal and dream-vision recursion create pattern, but the final "transcended" pivot supplies a label rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The conceptual cost (renouncing literal instruction for emotional cartography) is told, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of "encrypted devotion" and the irony of scholarly oversight (astronomers who "grew so frugal with meaning" they forgot their purpose) emerges organically from Maruk's discovery. The final image—palace peace, closer stars, the tile "once more an ordinary mathematical curiosity"—offers a resonant answer to the central question of what happens when forgotten pacts are remembered. The piece resists overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph's "some devotions are best encrypted" edges toward thematic summary, and the new rulers' "unexpected favor from forces they could not name" tells the thematic payoff rather than showing a charged consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (resentment as self-built cage, grace that shifts and redistributes) emerges from the central image rather than direct statement, which is strong. However, the ending resolves into a tidy moral—release resentment and the world heals—without ambiguity or cost that complicates the lesson. The cellular-memory conceit and shifting-grace metaphor remain parallel rather than interpenetrating. The garden-roses resurrection offers a resonant image but one that grants symmetric satisfaction without undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    The boundary-erasing theme emerges organically through concrete images: fog as "halfway between solid and absent," reflection "ceased to be separate from the thing reflected," glass mountains existing "only in the moment of erasing." The piece resists overt moralizing, allowing particulars to accumulate meaning. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic statement ("a place that existed only in the moment of erasing"), and the astronomer's dream-loss functions more as symbolic setup than lived complexity. The ending offers resonance through the glass-mountain image, though the conceptual answer arrives without the friction of a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (generational wisdom, persistence, repair) emerges organically from the statue work, the ribbon offering, and the orchard imagery. The deciduous-vows concept is integrated as both motif and thematic question: promises that yellow and drop away when seasons turn. The final image—Mira crossing to her daughter with "evidence of her brokenness and her repair"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. The accidental-wisdom frame is purposeful, acknowledging that insight arrives "unbidden and unearned." One small slip: the passage "by showing up, again, and again, and again" edges toward thematic echo, though it stops short of thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—cyclical inheritance, nonlinear time, and the courage to ask essential questions—emerges from concrete particulars: the cameo, the orchard's memory-fruit, and the grandmother's inscription. The bathroom as a space for "mask of professional competence" slipping charges the final image with meaning. The ending reweights prior material: the figure "no longer bewildered but understanding" reprises the opening's bewilderment and answers the thematic question without stating a moral. However, the final insight feels slightly asserted—"finally...about to inherit...a truth"—rather than fully earned through scene pressure, keeping the resonance just shy of 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (knowledge, loss, the courage to encounter what is forgotten) emerges from the premise and images, but the final paragraph ("the rescue mission was not to save knowledge from destruction but to rescue humanity from its fear") states the theme outright rather than letting the final image resonate. The botanical diary's shift from preservation to "vocabulary of loss and recovery" offers a modest reweighting. Subtext operates lightly in the guardian's rejection of futures as "probabilities and fears." The closing note of recognition is asserted, not earned through specific prior beat.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—identity fragmentation, the paradox of shared consciousness, mourning as recapture—emerges from particulars (palimpsest memories, double-exposure childhood, emerald card as conduit). "Blissful aberration" and "unkindled solace" risk label-speak but are anchored by the card's function and the brother's voice becoming "conversation." The final image—"both trapped...and impossibly free"—reweights the opening curse without stating a moral. No late thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.6)
    "Fables of absence" recurs three times and gains modest resonance as the door materializes, but the theme remains stated rather than fully embodied. The final line's "patient courage" edges toward moralizing. The piece invites reflection through its historical layering, yet the ending offers confirmation rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Theme emerges but doesn't surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the opposition of resonance and silence, the physics of null points, the echo chamber stone's true purpose revealed in paradox (not to amplify but to find quiet). The final image offers a non-literal answer to "how to survive constant noise"—by locating convergence points where opposing forces cancel. No overt moralizing; the bloom of hush functions conceptually as both physical phenomenon and thematic repricing of survival. Slight dependency on prompt vocabulary ("bloom of hush," "hammered repose") in key positions, but the integration with crack-pattern method and mapkeeper lore grounds it in scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—meaning amid ruin, connection across time—emerges from the prism as communion vessel and the beacon's forgotten purpose, avoiding overt statement until the final lines. The "shard of hush" as sacred peace and the retrocognitive gift as pattern-reading offer a lyric frame, though "proving coincidences had meaning" is stated rather than dramatized through choices that test belief against cost. The closing image of "shattered pieces reassembled into something that hummed with purpose" risks summarizing theme rather than embodying it in a charged particular. Subtext operates in the pavilion's moods and the hands-across-time motif, but the piece tilts toward reflection rather than scene pressure that earns epiphany. The thematic question is posed more than answered through irreversible action.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—identity as continuous creation from collective memory—emerges organically from the archivist's observations and the monument imagery. The final lines ("not their names, but their love; not their achievements, but their presence") offer a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the thematic material is carried almost entirely through reflection and assertion ("the self was not a fixed object...but a continuous act of creation") rather than dramatized particulars that test the premise under pressure. The piece resists banality but does not charge the theme with an on-page cost tied to character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—defiance through controlled light, hope as deliberate craft rather than passive wish—emerges from the spiral knot ritual and Mira's family chant without overt statement. The kerosene rag knot's "waking spiral" and the incomplete phoenix mosaic are non-literal image payoffs that reweight the opening void. The final line ("sky full of stars deciding to wake up") offers resonance without moralizing. Minor deduction: phrases like "serious playfulness" and "hope itself had developed its own gravity" occasionally drift toward prompt-echo abstraction rather than staying rooted in scene particulars, and the thematic payoff is slightly softer than the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (transition, liminality, the texture of time) emerges organically from Mira's chronicler work and the specific grotto setting, avoiding explicit thesis statements until the sister's question naturalizes it. The cicada as transition-creature motif is purposeful and charged by the closure gesture. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the pause itself is the transition period, and staying present is the work. Subtext operates in silence, gesture, and the sister's softened voice. The piece resists tidy resolution—"something shifted" without claiming full repair.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—limitation versus growth, fear versus openness—emerges through the bunker/trellis contrast and the sprouting plant. The final image of the pulsing doll and the vow to "build something different" offers resonance tied to prior material. However, the closing lines veer toward thematic summary ("the only thing limited was the fear of opening doors") that states rather than implies, and "gilded hush" and "intangibly tangible" are invoked repeatedly as labels without deepening through action. The piece resists a tidy moral but the ending articulates its thesis more directly than earned particulars allow.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme (silence as comfort, teaching as transmission) emerges from Maren's action and the grandmother's teaching, not from overt statement. The final image—"silence had finally learned to comfort"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the thematic question is never tested under pressure; Maren's work succeeds without friction, and the boy's unconscious state prevents genuine relational complexity. The ending reweights "silence" but lacks the ambiguity or counter-reading that would elevate it beyond a tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of custodianship over dominion emerges through the Unclaimed Throne's purpose and the murals' teaching. The stairway requiring "surrender a certainty in exchange for deeper understanding" carries conceptual weight, and the final image—"custodian of the bridge between what had been lost and what might yet be found"—offers a non-literal answer. However, the theme statement arrives as narrated summary rather than embodied in a specific choice with felt cost. "Futuristic nostalgia" tone supports the premise but does not modulate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme—isolation as another form of suffocation—emerges from concrete images (charred timber, doorknocker, fading threshold). But the final paragraph states the lesson explicitly: "isolation was simply another word for slow suffocation" and "thresholds were meant to exist between states, not to disappear entirely." This moralizing replaces earned resonance. The gasping figure is more allegory than lived particularity, and the shadows function as static symbols rather than elements that constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—promises as traps vs. transformative potential—emerges from the pyramid-scheme backstory and the bolt's metaphorical shift from "carbon of broken expectations" to "something precious." The final image offers a non-literal answer but leans heavily on direct thematic statement ("this time the promise was becoming something true") rather than letting particulars resonate. The "diamonds forming from pressure" conceit is apt but slightly overwrought, nudging toward overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between "bloodlines were merely accidents of history" and the pull of ancestral secrets, with the gramophone as a non-literal bridge between past and present. The "golden shadows… coalesce into shapes that might have been light or might have been memory" offers charged ambiguity. Yet the piece never delivers a resonant answer; the revelation begins but the text cuts off before Elara's stance can reweight prior material. No final paragraph moralizing, but also no thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—possibility, memory, and renewal—emerges organically from the marionettes' function and Aldric's arc. The final image (carrying the gift of captured possibilities) reweights his earlier withdrawal without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the marionettes' dual joy/sorrow faces and the program's dedication. However, "the eternal human need to imagine what might have been" edges toward abstract philosophizing, and the ending's thematic statement ("possibilities...have weight and worth") flirts with direct declaration rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the button, the emancipation context, and Mara's archival philosophy: small human connections persist across systemic violence. Subtext operates effectively in the silence around Pearl's photograph and the button's unrecorded transfer. The final image reweights prior material by framing documentation as prayer, offering a non-literal answer to "what survives official history?" However, the ending stops short of a felt thematic cost or a conceptual repricing that would elevate further—no moral calculus is tested on the page, only honored.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—memory as resistance to erasure, truth preserved against indifference—emerges organically from Mira's vocation and the regime's revisions. The auric lagoon's stubborn reappearance is an apt non-literal image for resilience. "Indifference was its own kind of tyranny" is close to direct statement but remains grounded in the archive's suppression. The final image of stars watching through revisions offers resonance without overt moralizing. The phone booth key and grandmother's legacy create thematic continuity across generations. However, "tomorrow, she would begin teaching others to see" edges toward thematic echo, summarizing the premise rather than letting it reverberate through particulars alone.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges from the particulars: prophecy as dangerous code, silence enforced through sound, inherited duty as both burden and identity. The final image—"eerie nostalgia for a time when silence was not yet necessary"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. "Vested hush" and "negative space" recur purposefully and shift meaning across beats, charging the closure. The piece avoids stating its thesis; instead, the protagonist's return to the ritual at dawn embodies the theme of endurance and the cost of perpetual vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of forgotten things and cyclical survival emerges from the seed vault and tiny monuments, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image—"tiny monuments… seemed to hum with quiet affirmation"—offers a lyric reconfiguration, though it lacks the weight of earlier particulars and reads as belated validation rather than earned insight. The piece gestures toward liminal time and ancestral connection but stops short of interrogating the cost of preservation or the protagonist's isolation. Subtext in the leaf's "fingers grasping for memory" is vivid, elevating above pure exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of acceptance versus obsessive search emerges through Maren's "uncertainly certain" stance and the motif of stopped clocks. The swirling leaves that "could no longer follow her down" offer a quiet image of crossing a threshold. However, the piece provides no answer to its central question—stopping would mean acceptance, but she descends—leaving theme unresolved. The final image (air growing cooler, leaves left behind) is evocative but does not reweight prior material with conceptual cost or felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the kintsugi metaphor: fractures made visible rather than erased, legacies requiring risk, redemption through acknowledgment of damage. The coin's restoration enacts the theme without stating it until the penultimate paragraph, where "some fractures could only heal by being made visible" risks mild over-articulation but stays grounded in the concrete work. The brother's exploration versus Maren's caution creates genuine moral complexity without false balance. The final image—golden seams luminous, rain resuming—offers a resonant answer to the question of how to honor a dangerous legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (laughter integrating into grief) emerges from concrete particulars: the milk-out-of-nose story, the harp's distortion as metaphor for brokenness enabling connection. The piece resists easy morals and embraces complexity—the soldier "had been human before they became ghosts." However, the final paragraph edges toward theme statement ("laughter could integrate itself into the process of grief like light into a prism"). The crocodile's tooth and misaligned harp create purposeful symbolic architecture without forced recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "mathematics of mercy" motif emerges from concrete interrogation experience, evolves from quantification tool to recognition that answers live "in the questions themselves," and reweights at closure into acceptance that the price remains incalculable. The pewter strap transforms from forgotten relic to beacon to anchor for "her own devastation," constraining the final choice. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: mercy cannot be calculated but must be walked through, trading arithmetic for truth without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of continuity and transmission emerges through concrete particulars: the lighthouse, the grandmother's torch-passing, the relay metaphor. The painting's hidden details and the beam as "corridor of visible intuition" avoid abstract philosophizing. The final image—fragment hanging free, refracting light at "nothing and everything at once"—offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing. The grandmother's face in the painting and the phrase "anchored, at last, in the only history that mattered: the one we choose to carry forward" edges toward thematic echo but stays rooted in the protagonist's earned understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: stored potential energy (mainspring, wound tight; echo, waiting decades; Marcus's gift, never released into casual conversation) reweights at closure when Marcus reaches for the hatch and the barrel "hums," all coiled forces about to unwind. The "cracks in the façade" concept integrates as both literal plaster damage and the hidden hatch, plus the circus's false front. No overt moralizing; the final image offers resonance without stating a thesis. The "weightless burden" phrase, repeated, risks becoming a thematic echo but stays grounded in Marcus's embodied experience of the gift.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—holding vs. releasing knowledge—emerges organically from the press action and the whisper's "compressed eternity." The final image ("some eternities needed to be opened, not held") reweights prior material without overt moralizing, and the cloud-sea's "new patterns" offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture: the press's "familiar resistance" and the bottle's "breath of centuries" carry meaning beyond assertion. However, the Negotiation premise and "reality becomes negotiable" verge on stock metaphor; the piece does not dramatize the ethical or practical calculus of that transformation, relying instead on atmospheric assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the vase shard, mirror protocol, and founder imagery rather than assertion. The piece explores how civilizations curate their pasts and the cost of holding singular versus multiple truths. The mirror-covering method serves as embodied metaphor: controlling reflection, managing what can be seen. The final image—"the kind of beautiful and terrible thing that covers its mirrors during storms and still chooses to look"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece earns its insight that "truth mattered less than what civilizations chose to make of their truths" through Vespera's concrete work and the founders' desperate image. Minor slip: "This one—this quiet work of devising methods..." briefly tilts toward thematic statement rather than letting the image carry full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of patience versus irrecoverable loss emerges organically through the covenant, the forty-year accumulation, and the incomplete reclamation. The chip's red veins and the orchestrion's silent pipes function as recurring images that reweight at closure when the first note rises—"thin and uncertain at first, but true." Subtext operates in the room's honesty rule and Cassian's wonder whether midnight "understood something about it that he did not." The final paragraph avoids overt moralizing; "his purpose had finally found its perfect pitch" borders on thematic summary but remains anchored in the scene's sensory particulars. No forced epiphany; the insight is earned through the act.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—petrichor as the residue of thresholds, the geography of silence—emerges from concrete particulars (factory closure, compass psychometry, lagoon's sourceless light) without meta-commentary. The final image answers the central question non-literally: arrival replaces capture, presence replaces naming. "Some journeys ended not with answers but with arrival" risks overt statement but is mitigated by the prior sensory work and the irreversible cost. The piece resists binary resolution and earns quiet resonance through specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the slide's layered images, the archway's centuries of shelter, the driftwood's carried history. "Timewoven alliances" is named but earned by the visual progression (trader, mother, soldier, each making) and the final sculptural reach. The ending offers a non-literal answer—making as prayer, invitation—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the storm's spent fury mirroring her clarity, and the slide's mechanics (woven light, not carved) charging the concept of inherited pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the night-blooming mystery and resolves in the final insight about "profound patience required to witness beauty that hides itself" and "quiet courage of blooming unseen." The cathedral window's encoded knowledge of lunar cycles and temperature drops transforms the initial question into a meditation on trust and hidden witnesses. The closing image—spring bulbs "preparing their own quiet performance for the coming darkness"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. One friction: the articulation "the universe contains witnesses enough" in the penultimate beat edges toward theme statement rather than letting the image carry the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of memory, witnessing, and deferred truth emerges organically from the encrypted diary and temporal prison. The final image of Miriam as witness offers a non-literal answer to "what survives when power erases," but the grandmother's speech—"the terms required a witness"—edges toward thematic statement rather than embodied resonance. The obsidian lagoon and beach cipher carry symbolic weight without forced recurrence. Subtext operates in the "parley" and "temporal bondage," though the ending leans explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (memory as foundation, not refuge) emerges through image and action. The contrast between wishes and working memory is concrete. However, the final paragraph moralizes—"teach them to live without magic"—rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. The piece resists easy answers but the ending's didactic clarity ("relying only on what could be held in the mind") trends toward thesis statement. No epiphany is earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—memory as covenant, silence as threshold for the dead's fulfillment—emerges through layered images (foghorn, wax grooves, oath tablets, apple trees) without overt thesis. The final image offers a non-literal answer: the world grew quiet enough to hear promises accumulated like sediment. Subtext operates in "prophecy most often stirred…from the gap between what had been and what would be." One slip: "the fierce desire to be remembered and fulfilled" leans toward abstraction in the penultimate paragraph, flirting with thematic echo, though it stops short of prompt-language moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution—Seraphine smiles "with the velvet disquiet of someone who had heard the dead keep their word"—leaving resonance intact without explaining it away.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of "borrowed time" and entropy reversal, with the acorn cap's "concentrated quietude" and generational inheritance woven through action rather than stated. The final insight—"borrowed forward, an investment that finally, beautifully, matured"—functions as thematic echo that risks explicit articulation, though it avoids full sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on legacy and temporal continuity through specific ritual particulars, yet the ending leans toward conceptual answer rather than resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the parallel between monks ringing bells and Elara sounding the siren—both acts of "listening" and calling. The contrast between silence and warning, waiting and threshold, is woven through imagery (solstice hush, air trembling, "a sound that meant both warning and reassurance"). The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the glue held, the switch worked, the hush gave way to rain, circling back to the opening's patient preparation. No overt moralizing, though "borrowed warning" verges on thematic echo. The ending reweights prior material cleanly without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of "strength in vulnerability" is stated overtly multiple times ("they understood the vulnerability of endings," "the profound strength that lived in vulnerable openness") rather than emerging from dramatized events. The yellow lantern glass refracts rainbows, but this moment illustrates rather than tests the premise. The ending returns to the same thematic statement offered in paragraph three without reweighting it through a new cost or image. No counter-reading or friction complicates the thesis; the piece declares its meaning rather than enacting it.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—memory, covenant, the eloquence of silence—emerges organically from the apiary setting and ghost interaction without overt thesis statements. The stained glass box recurs with reweighted meaning (buried secret → vessel of unspoken words → living burden), and the final image (box "heavy with the eloquence of silence") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, "unspoken words" and "tangled covenant" are repeated as abstract claims rather than discovered through concrete particulars; the piece tells us they matter more than it shows Mira wrestling with their implications. The ending avoids moralizing but leans on lyric assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (time as unmeasured pause, existence beyond counting) emerges through image and the urn fragment's recurrence. The final paragraph borders on overt statement—"Time was not a river or a road...Time was the space between breaths"—treading close to moralizing (−0.4 guidance). The conceptual cost is oblique; the insight feels asserted rather than earned through embodied struggle, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the feather, broken kite, injured bird, and missing string rather than abstract thesis. The final image—"carrying the woven dawns inside like a small fire that needed no fuel but its own incompleteness to keep burning"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. "Woven dawns" is seeded early ("the purples and grays and reluctant golds that took hours to sort themselves") and reweighted at closure, demonstrating purposeful recurrence. The piece resists tidy resolution: "The poem would end without resolution, the way mornings end without truly ending but simply becoming afternoon." One mild slip: the penultimate paragraph risks thematic echo when it explicitly argues "completeness was not the point," though the image work surrounding it largely earns the claim.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from copper wire as "language," interspecies respect, and the lineage of caretakers—architecture as listening rather than imposing. The final image ("copper-wrapped branches into a subtle music that Maren had learned to interpret as gratitude") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of legacy and integration without stating a moral. The botanical diary as carrier of knowledge across generations deepens thematic resonance. However, the ending risks soft sentimentality ("the oak trees would remember") where a sharper image might have landed harder.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of homecoming and pilgrimage is clearly stated and repeatedly invoked, but it emerges through direct statement and meta-commentary rather than specific dramatized events. The amber fly is a recurring image, yet its symbolic weight is explained ("universal narrative: eternal pilgrimage") rather than allowed to resonate through shifting use. The final paragraph tells us Elena has "discovered" and "understood" rather than showing a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars. Thematic echo penalty: the closing lines articulate the story's thesis in prompt-like language ("alchemy of pilgrimage," "converging toward understanding like stellar masses").

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the coachman's role as mediator and the reef-as-battlefield conceit: restoration as an argument against "the permanence of loss," spoken in a dead language that only seeds and stubborn gardeners understand. The final green thread offers a non-literal answer—renewal through memory and intention—without stating a moral. "Submerged concord" recurs with shifting weight, and the birds-as-witnesses motif charges the closure. However, the piece leans toward declaration in places ("not bodies but possibilities," "the patience of seeds") where image alone would carry more force.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (love as translation, distance as illusion) emerges from the dual preserved objects and the textural riddle without thesis statement. The cylinder/leaf pairing reweights prior material—beauty surviving fire, encoded intimacy—and the brother's grooved message delivers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the physical decoding metaphor and the "wild hush" motif. The ending offers a non-literal answer (distance → closeness via wax and patience) that avoids sentimental summary, though the final certainty slightly softens ambiguity. No thematic echo penalty; the brother's words read as earned particular rather than prompt label.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme (wonder over control, patient exploration) emerges through the compass rose, family custom, and the final sketching image. The "true north" concept shifts from spatial to directional-in-the-soul, a workable Conceptual Repricing. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "not answers, but the courage to keep asking questions" and "true north was not a destination but a way of moving" replace scene pressure with thesis. This lowers resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of amends and embracing the unknown is stated directly ("to embrace the unknown with open arms") rather than emerging from events. The pocket sundial lid and chess pieces are symbolic objects, but their thematic charge is told ("might explain why") instead of dramatized through choice or consequence. The final image—stepping "into the unknown with open arms"—repeats the prompt language without reweighting prior material. No earned wisdom arises from the encounter; Seraph's reaction and Caelius's relief are summarized, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the stranger's water bottle, the mother's song, the old man's doorway defiance anchor "small gestures" without moralizing. The final walk spelling "beginning" reweights prior material—shifting from elegy to continuity—without stating a thesis. Minor penalty: "the space between endings held everything that mattered" and "absence could hold its own meaning" edge toward articulation of theme in the penultimate paragraph, reducing the resonance of the final image slightly. Still, the chessboard's "waiting" carries genuine ambiguity and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically: home as language rather than place, gifts as gardens requiring tending, pain as proof of value. The stone's glow and the grandmother's kitchen memory offer concrete anchors. However, the closing paragraph states theme overtly—"The shape of home... is not a place you find. It is a language you learn to speak"—which undercuts the emergent quality. The reflections/reality substitution recurs but functions more as motif-mention than constraint. The ending honors complexity (pain paired with gratitude) without moralizing, though the keeper's final lines edge toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (self-forgiveness, reframing failure as integrity) emerges from the tapestry's border imagery and Mira's pedagogical choice. The final line—"no longer exiled from herself"—reweights the opening exile without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the labyrinth's avoidance-then-approach and the "fierce repose" motif. The tutor-as-truth-winnower conceit is specific. Minor dock: "permission to winnow through the accusations" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than pure image, though the folded tapestry and walking-through-thunder closure recover resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core concept—the price of forgiveness paid in advance, refusing silence after past compliance—emerges organically from Sera's actions and the child's reaction. The bird poem offers resonant indirection rather than thesis statement. The final image of distributed truth answers the thematic question (how to resist enforced forgetting) through concrete action, not moralizing. "All true stories are about everyone's mother" risks preciousness but stays character-voiced. The piece resists tidy resolution: Sera claims freedom, but the priests' response remains open, preserving complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kintsugi theme—finding meaning in brokenness—emerges organically from the scar-matching ritual and statue imagery rather than direct statement. The final paragraph approaches thematic echo territory ("the breaking was the point, that the light entered through the cracks") but ties the claim to the concrete act of breath-holding and the sea's retreat, maintaining embodiment. The key ring charm's "uncertain symbols" and the statue's documented wounds provide specific anchors for the thematic question of certainty versus doubt. The ending reweights prior material through the conceptual shift (workshop reborn in understanding) without overt moralizing, though the articulation skirts abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of impermanence versus possession emerges through the shell, mirror, and pool imagery, and the final image ("the keeping was in the releasing") reweights the opening without overt moralizing. However, lines like "some things are beautiful precisely because they cannot be kept" veer close to thesis-statement territory, and "the temporary made eternal, the eternal made temporary" risks abstraction. The ending offers a resonant answer through the shell's placement, but the non-literal quality is undercut by near-explicit thematic articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—whispers reach where shouts cannot, intention over volume—emerges through the jasmine, the beckon technique, and the logbook's validation. The final line "The whispers were right" reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in Thessaly's gift, Mira's secret study, and the sailors' hushed voices. The grandmother's teaching and the lighthouse's frequency anchor the concept in specifics. However, the phrase "screaming tenderness" in the penultimate beat ("the screaming tenderness of her belief") flirts with thematic echo, articulating the paradox rather than embodying it entirely through image. The ending offers resonance but borders on thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of reverse migration—moving toward loss rather than away—emerges through Mara's ritual and the woman's compulsion without overt statement. The bronze censer foot shifts from inherited anchor to warmth-sharing promise, and the final image offers a resonant answer: "a way through, rough and honest and true." The piece resists tidy closure, embracing the ongoing work of solace. One slip: "the real navigation happened here" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains anchored in the marsh meeting.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the orchard-as-metaphor and Mira's reflections on isolation versus connection. The final image—"her truthfulness a quiet rebellion"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question about surviving emotional catastrophe. However, the piece leans heavily on the empathy-virus concept without dramatizing its cost in present action; the theme is more asserted through exposition than earned through scene pressure. The orchard's symbolic weight is purposeful but borders on overt allegory. Subtext operates more in image than in action or dialogue (none present).

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of connection across absence and the language of unspoken gestures emerges organically from the Edelweiss and lighthouse imagery. The final paragraph risks overt statement ("some gestures need no words") but the transformation of "witnessed isolation" into gentler connection carries weight. The lighthouse-as-gathering-place metaphor is earned by prior particulars, though the mother's reconciliation arrives too neatly without ambiguity or moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the life spent reading others' maps converges into finding her own. The matrix chip and doorway avoid overt symbolism by functioning as literal objects with tactile properties. However, "the doorway of decisions" and "following the right path home" edge toward stated theme, and "empirically intuitive" reads as a prompt label rather than dramatized insight. The final image of stepping through as the cavern holds its breath offers resonance without a moral, though the thematic question (what is home?) could be more oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through concrete images (bleeding starlight, fireflies, weighted crown) rather than assertion, and the final image of the queen smiling offers a resonant answer to the disenchantment without stating a moral. The recurring dreams as invitations, the wounded sky, and the promise to protect living things cohere into a thematic question about renewal through witness. However, "purpose reclaimed" in the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary, and the fireflies' "promises kept" risks overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme emerges clearly around presence, density, and return, supported by the columella's spiral geometry. However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes the thesis ("depth of attention, by the willingness to return...") rather than allowing the image to resonate without statement (−0.6). The "scientifically romantic method" remains an abstract label without concrete particulars that would ground it in lived experience. The piece gestures at ambiguity but resolves into a tidy epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—the recursion of dream/memory/death and the cost of lucidity—emerges organically from the grave sighting, scroll act, and soaring jealousy without direct thesis. The final triple anaphora ("This is my chronicle. This is my chaos, finally distilled. This is my grave, learning to speak") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the distillation motive without moralizing. Feral nostalgia and jaded wonder operate as conceptual anchors rather than ornamental labels, and the Möbius-strip image deepens recursive meaning. Minor deduction for the phrase "chronologist's disease," which edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—sensing as attention rather than literal perception—emerges through the screw, clocks, fog, and Elena's hands. The water clocks as "small heart[s] beating" and the screw as threshold object ground abstraction in concrete image. "Unveiling ordinary miracles" integrates with Elena's arc without overt moralizing until the final paragraph, where "she understood now that the sensing had never been only about smell" edges toward thematic echo. The closing image (screw "still warm in her hand") offers a resonant answer to the central question. Subtext operates well in Mira's gesture of offering work "the way one might offer shelter from rain."

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara's arc: wounds and truth as prerequisites for magic, the integration of scholarly rigor with intuitive faith. The crystallizing trait shifts from "affliction" to "what happened when grief and beauty had nowhere to go but inward"—a non-literal answer to the central question. Superstitions dismissed as "child's fear" are reframed as "instructions she had failed to recognize," avoiding overt moralizing while charging prior material. The crow quill and scars serve as particulars that ground the thematic question without forcing allegory. The final image—runes holding "in a language older than scholarship"—resonates without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of bridging irreparable damage through imperfect connection emerges organically from the induced currents, the orchard's fall, and the unfinished symphony. The perfume bottle's shift from memory vessel to symbol of belonging reweights meaning without moralizing. The final image—"the sharp, clean break that came before growth could start anew"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the estrangement question. Minor slip: "imperfect miracles" as a phrase is stated too directly in exposition, reducing subtext slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme emerges cleanly from images (archive, dying stars, spiral, dictionary as talisman) without overt statement. However, the final paragraph offers no resonant, non-literal answer to a central question; it simply restates the opening's meditation. The piece gestures toward paradox resolution but never dramatizes it or imposes cost, leaving theme abstract rather than earned through specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—the nature of time as lived experience versus mechanical measurement—emerges organically through the hydraulic clocks, water cycles, and Aira's patient listening. The final insight that "clocks measured change itself, the stubborn insistence of the universe upon moving forward even when it seemed to circle back" reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in her isolation ("the only shepherd left") and the university colleagues who "thought her eminently peculiar," creating tension between institutional precision and embodied understanding. The seventeen-year cycle and water transformation provide concrete anchors for abstract meditation, though the epiphany leans toward articulation rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of probability, risk, and honest light. The final image—"addition of losses that might yet become multiplication of meaning"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without explicit moralizing. The candle lantern and the scrawls accumulate meaning across the piece, and the conceptual repricing at closure reweights prior material effectively. The phrase "clover melancholy, sweet and bitter together" risks mild abstraction but remains grounded in the father-daughter dynamic. No thematic echo or diagnostic label-speak appears in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of cultivated estrangement and the gift of anonymous witness emerges organically from Mira's practice, the harmonica's resonance as loss-made-frequency, and the metaphor of copper arteries beneath the city. The piece resists overt moralizing and offers nuanced ambiguity about connection through distance. However, the final image does not reweight or reprice prior material—it repeats the pattern (waiting for the next call) without a non-literal answer to the central question, capping thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through the tea-steeping metaphor, the locket's changing meaning, and the grandmother's "haunted euphoria"—the cost of embracing temporary joy. The final image of feeling "stitched together from photographs and memories" offers a resonant answer to preservation's paradox without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "gentle pressure of what had been lost and the quiet hope of what might be recovered." The piece resists tidy resolution by accepting temporality as the condition of preservation. One minor slip: "only true currency the future possessed" edges toward abstraction in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: loneliness as avoidance, reciprocity as honesty, the moon rock as catalyst rather than cure. The logistician's realization that "the work was a kind of penance, and the elusiveness a mercy they extended to themselves" deepens understanding without moralizing. The final image—laughter echoing through the empty hall "like a promise kept"—reweights the opening exhaustion and offers a non-literal answer to the central question. The rumor-chain motif recurs purposefully, though "愈合" (a Chinese character meaning "heal") appears mid-story as an unearned insertion that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.7)
    A coherent theme—stillness as doorway to self-knowledge—emerges through the platinum ring, ultrasonic forest, and the hidden melody, and the piece avoids overt moralizing until the phrase "the truest navigation was not about finding direction but about discovering that she had always been exactly where she needed to be," which edges into thesis statement. The compass ring's shift from pointing outward to radiating inward offers a resonant image, and the quiet blaze recurs purposefully. However, the final paragraph's abstractions ("architecture of her own soul," "unchartable finally becomes legible") lean toward platitude rather than earned particularity, and the claim of perpetual clarity undercuts the ambiguity that would allow the theme to linger.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of filtering and refinement through adversity emerges organically from Mira's career reassignment, the anomaly's distorting properties, and the pen as inherited wisdom. The closing insight—"every wrong turn was a form of filtering"—reweights prior material without stating a moral, and the final image of listening to the universe's breath offers resonant closure. Subtext operates in the pen ritual and the "strange comfort" of uncertainty. Minor slip: "planting the wrong seeds" as metaphor is stated rather than fully earned through scene particulars, and the epiphany arrives somewhat tidily without the friction of competing interpretations. Still, the thematic question (what meaning survives distortion?) is answered through image and event.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—loss as untranslatable yet transmissible through embodied gesture—emerges organically from the camera (designed to capture, never loaded) and sign language (mapping silence). The old man's aphorisms risk moralizing but are absorbed into Marina's physical discovery. "Joyful sorrow" avoids sentimentality by anchoring in Elena's crying and Marina's simultaneous smile. The final image (hands held, camera as weight of memory) offers a resonant non-literal answer without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (knowledge-hoarding vs. liberation) is declared rather than emergent from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("to every future mind that would seek understanding without having to burn down the gates"), violating the no-statement rule and earning a −0.6 deduction. The vandalized portrait and layered tapestry function as plot devices rather than recurring images that reweight meaning at closure. No resonant, non-literal answer to the central question is offered; the ending summarizes the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of memory as entangled bridge and the persistence of shared dreams emerges through concrete images (the childhood signal, the lagoon breathing) without overt moralizing. The final line—"Mira smiled"—attempts resonance but risks sentimentality; it tells the thematic payoff rather than charging it through Elara's present-tense perception. "Auroral sorrow of a universe" in the penultimate paragraph reads as abstract philosophizing that intrudes without grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges concretely from the contrast between technological failure and embodied knowledge—"the oldest networks...could not be disrupted by any solar flare." The final image (Mira pocketing the key, descending into the maze) offers a resonant non-literal answer: continuity of practice over momentary victory. Subtext operates well in the coin's warmth and Reyes's unreadable face. Minor issue: the final paragraph edges toward overt statement—"proven that the oldest networks" declares rather than lets the reader infer. The thematic question is coherent but the answer is slightly over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—that light and patient witness can interrupt despair—emerges organically from the guardian's mirror work and the boy's perceptual shift without overt moralizing. The spiraling star patterns and the phrase "to teach darkness the value of stars" risk thematic echo, but the particulars (dental mirror, shutter slats, half-spoken secret) ground the concept. The final image of stars "that had learned to wait" reweights prior material with quiet resonance, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. The piece resists tidy resolution; the boy's survival is implied but not guaranteed, embracing meaningful ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme (the power of silence, patient subversion) emerges from the window displays and chess coaching, avoiding overt statements until the final paragraph. The compass with two norths and the child's drawing of a tree with branches in two directions function as purposeful images that invite ambiguity. However, the ending slips into thematic summary ("not a revolution, but a forest of new possibilities") that articulates the premise rather than allowing it to resonate through a final image. The penultimate beat (elderly man writing the letter) offers a concrete particular but is immediately absorbed into generalization, reducing specificity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the scrimshaw's evolving meaning and the water/land threshold. The final image—"some locks only open when you set down the key"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing, though it edges close to summary. The piece resists easy binaries (surrender vs. combat, safety vs. freedom) and layers "combative tenderness" through the whale's call. However, phrases like "embracing one's true nature" and "the world's ugliness" tilt toward abstraction. The scrimshaw's arc from heirloom to detached talisman carries thematic weight, but late articulation of its "true purpose" feels slightly engineered rather than discovered through prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—survival through performance, the transformation of grief under authoritarian erasure—emerges from concrete particulars: whittling as memorial craft, narration as system-gaming, the blank face's triple meaning (professional, mandated, defiant). The dried flowers accumulate pressure across the story and the final image of watching turbines with a blank face offers a resonant, non-literal answer: not happiness, not grief, but "the weightlessness of having survived both." The wooden rose functions as charged recurrence without symbolic overstatement. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—boundaries as perceptual constructs dissolved by courage—emerges clearly from the colonnade crossing. The piece resists overt moralizing in most beats, allowing image and action to carry meaning. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("some walls exist only to be dissolved by those brave enough") and the closure image restates rather than reweights prior material. The cloud-shadow motif recurs but does not shift meaning between beginning and end, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: broken glass, colorblindness as metaphor for alternative perception, plant arrangements as language. The piece resists explicit moralizing until the final paragraph's "teaching anyone who would look closely enough that awakening could be bartered, traded, passed from hand to hand" which borders on thematic summary but remains tied to the image of the reed tongue. The apprentice's realization ("You see the beauty... In the broken things") verges on articulating the thesis but is saved by his embodied wonder and the subsequent gift exchange. The ending offers a resonant image (kneeling beside the arrangement) that reweights prior material without a stated moral, though the phrase "quiet revolution" in the penultimate paragraph leans toward tell. No penalty for the "phoenix" frame, which contextualizes without intruding.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—the texture of connection, the paradox of manufactured authenticity—emerges organically from Elara's work and the post-collapse world. The carbide lens anchors the idea that simulation needs something grounded in human experience. Subtext operates effectively in the "powerfully gentle" construction and the distinction between fact and texture of connection. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: all journeys construct meaning from chosen fragments. However, the ending articulates this insight directly rather than letting it remain fully implicit, approaching a thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (mourning as practice, not destination) emerges through the pendant's "between dying and death" image and the observatory's designed purpose. The closing line resists moralizing and uses the curtains-of-intention motif to reweight the question. "Mourning never truly ends—but neither does love" risks platitude but the pendant's genuinely artificial/entirely real paradox roots it in concrete particulars. Subtext operates in "subdued ardor" and the unspoken teacher's dissolution into light.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges from particulars: cards as architecture-revealers, measurement as "the first magic," generational repetition of mistakes. The final image of Soren descending with "hope" offers a quiet answer to whether old wisdom can illuminate new chaos, though "inherited wisdom might help them find their way forward" edges toward direct thematic statement. The branching raindrops and branching card method create resonance without over-symbolism. Soren's arc—from reverse-engineering to acceptance—is inextricable from the thematic question, but the grandmother's wisdom is told more than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme—purification as release rather than possession—emerges through the dance and reflection. However, much of the thematic work is stated directly: "purification required not capture but release," "my role was not to possess this knowledge but to pass through it." The final paragraph over-articulates the theme ("burden and blessing of understanding") rather than trusting the image to carry resonance. The pagoda and atoms function as symbolic vehicles but their meaning is explained rather than earned through concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the contrast between bound and unbound hope, old tactile memory versus new radiant abstraction. The river stone, mother's dissolution, and blossoms accrue meaning without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration: "preserving the shape of hope in her quietly luminous way" reweights prior material without moralizing. The "argument" Mira builds—that hope is transforming, not diminishing—arises from specific images (apples from particular trees, child's dream, mother's unmaking). The piece invites reflection on loss and metamorphosis without forcing a thesis, and the recurring motifs (stone warmth, luminous regret) deepen rather than decorate.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme (fragile convictions, reconstruction after betrayal) emerges organically from the tail-tip restoration rather than assertion. The chameleon's theatrical tail-drop becomes ironic commentary on Aldric's deception without heavy underlining. The ending resists a stated moral—"all things shed their layers eventually" reads more observational than prescriptive—and the incomplete tail carries non-literal weight. However, phrases like "the patient understanding that all things shed their layers" and "broken things could be mended with enough patience and care" tilt toward thematic summarization in the final two paragraphs rather than letting the restored tail speak entirely through image.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly through particulars: "displaced miracle" manifests in the frosted hourglass, the grandmother's patient vigil, and the handprints as evidence that grief delayed Maya's readiness to receive love's proof. The final image—palms on plaster, hearing the brother's echo—offers a resonant answer to whether forgiveness can be posthumous without stating a moral. The "open wounds to close them" framing is heavy but is paid off through the scar motif. No overt sermonizing in the final paragraph; the meteor and "begin again" closure trust the image work.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: goodbye letters as "doorways," unused love as "pure intention," recognition as completion without delivery. The final image—reel returned, love left to hum—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("Some stories were not meant to be completed, only witnessed") rather than trusting the image alone. The piece resists tidy morals yet tips slightly into articulated wisdom where implication would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—creativity as surrender rather than seizure—is coherent and embedded in imagery (stars that "simply wait," the meteor "descending" rather than plummeting). However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("she stopped hunting it, to stop treating it as prey") rather than letting the final image carry it. The grandmother's voice as memory is a purposeful device, but the epiphany arrives through tell rather than earned scene pressure. Subtext in gesture and object (astrolabe warming, lowering to stone) is present but undercut by direct thematic declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from images and choices without meta-commentary: hope as suspended possibility, light growing in darkness, the archive of "might-have-been" as burden and treasure. The chess clock's midnight freeze—world tipping from "might-be to was"—supplies a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Mira's final line ("a broken lullaby finally learning to mend itself") reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the ending. The piece resists tidy resolution while remaining legible.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—externalized consciousness, the philosopher's journey from analysis to embodied understanding—emerges through the mechanical jungle conceit and the recurring gear rather than direct statement. The final image ("the space between one heartbeat and the next where probability bent toward miracle") reweights the premise with lyric density, and "no back to return to" offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the epiphany is articulated in the penultimate paragraph in language close to the prompt's conceptual register ("wild frontier of his mind," "probable miracles"), reducing earned resonance. The piece resists overt moralizing but hovers near thematic declaration where pressure should carry the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—courage as reclamation rather than discovery—emerges from the leash's frayed end, the locked heart-rooms, and the final middle-path step without sermonizing. The guides' patient witnessing and the star stamp encode passage through struggle rather than wishing, avoiding platitude. "Why does courage hide?" risks thematic echo, but the elder's silent gesture redirects to image (horizon, stars) rather than explanation. The ending's "gently, persistently reclaimed" reweights the vigil as active choice with quiet cost, resisting triumphalism.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the bolt, bronze trail, and nerve regeneration rather than assertion. The final image—snow as "small white notes in the world's most patient symphony"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The insight that "safety was not the opposite of danger but its quiet accomplice" reweights prior material (brother's silence, his own choice of the bellhop role). Minor slip: "seraphically mundane" and "frostbitten hope" feel slightly over-articulated as thematic labels, edging toward the clarity line without crossing it.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of patient truth versus stolen legacy emerges from the premise, not from dramatized events. The "rune of drift" and the library-as-justice motifs are asserted rather than tested. No epiphany is earned on the page; the final "smile, a small expression of satisfaction" is a static label, not a resonant reconfiguration. The piece avoids moralizing but also avoids dramatizing its central question, so resonance remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from image and event: "ecosystems were not static photographs but periodically eternal processes." The atlas page motif recurs with purpose, first as reminder of lost certainty, then as key to understanding redirected currents. The piece avoids moralizing; the final insight—"The paths had not simply disappeared. They had transformed"—arises from specific data and the buoy discovery rather than assertion. Thematic resonance is built through the station's floating-yet-anchored state, the father's obsolete maps, and the coral's unexpected colonization. Subtext operates in the shift from mourning to curiosity. The ending reweights prior material (bleaching as endpoint vs. transformation) without a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of meaning-making in the face of collapse emerges through concrete images (the circle, the opera glasses, the hum), and the final sentence ("guided by the hum of something older than their conflict") reweights the rebellion without stating a moral. However, the piece edges close to thematic echo: "Meaning was not something you found in the mess; it was something you created by refusing to let the mess be all there was" is meta-commentary that borders on prompt language. The opera glasses recur but shift meaning only slightly (stars → horizon), and the "thunderous serenity" phrase in the penultimate paragraph feels inserted to meet a tonal requirement rather than earned by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of tradition-as-evolution emerges through concrete particulars (sealed embryo, cryptic script, ancestral founders). The plants' recognition and Yara's realization that her gift was "given… specifically for this moment" risk teleological convenience, but the image of "destiny… planted like seeds" integrates organically. The final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("to show her people that the insurgent spirit… had always been about growth") rather than letting the embryo's pulse and held hands carry resonance without thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the cereus's four-year arc and one-night bloom: "optimism could grow not from denial but from the realistic soil of what could actually, measurably, wither and survive." The crumpled photograph motif (never smoothed, fire-damaged, water-warped, faces melted) returns with shifted weight at closure, constraining the choice to keep building rather than seeking erasure. Subtext operates through physical markers: soil under nails, unsmoothed wrinkles, managed versus wild plants. The ending offers non-literal answer to the trauma-recovery question without moralizing, meeting the resonance test.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—fragmentation as redesign rather than ruin—emerges from the cards, threads, and Mira's hands-on work without overt statement. The final image (complete box, perception rewoven) offers a resonant answer to the central question: "What if multiplicity is not failure?" The lighthouse descent and the "necessary darkness" work thematically without becoming allegorical. Subtext operates in the shifting card images and the walls' contraction. The penultimate insight "When the walls close in, what remains is only what cannot be hidden" risks abstraction, but the closure grounds it in Mira's tactile redesign. No moralizing mars the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: time dilation during crisis, the language of presence/absence in spilled ink, the tension between understanding and becoming the mystery. The piece resists overt moralizing and allows ambiguity—the tracker's fate is both discovery and dissolution. However, abstract philosophizing undercuts embodied resonance: "serene anger of the universe's most patient hunter" and "time itself had learned to breathe" feel more like thematic assertion than earned insight. The final image of the empty space recorded by the drone offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral, though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (truth versus preservation, complicity of silence) emerges from the letter's content and Kira's choice, not from overt statement. The recurring images of ice, silence, and dormancy shift meaning at closure (shroud → held breath). However, the ending articulates its thesis nearly directly: "she had done the bravest thing...contraband truths would finally have their say." The piece invites reflection on institutional silence, but the final beat tells rather than showing the thematic reconfiguration through a non-literal image. Subtext operates in the library's sentience metaphor ("the system had learned"), yet this borders on convenient anthropomorphism that soft-sells the ethical calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme—peace as active tending rather than absence of conflict—emerges organically from the contrast between father's "sheathed violence" and Mira's rose cultivation. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in the ballast sandbag ("engraved quiet") and the roses' "tranquil blaze." However, the penultimate paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("her work mattered in ways her father's never had") where dramatization would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of silence as power emerges organically through Morwen's contrast with "shouting and grasping" others, and the final image of fishing for inaudible echoes offers a resonant non-literal answer. The rail spike's transliteration mechanic and sleepwalking constellations layer meaning without overt statement. "A cool-headed fisher who had spent his life mastering stillness now carrying the final song of a god" risks summarizing the theme but stays grounded in the specific image of iron and memory. The "feral lullaby" and broken patterns invite reflection on loss and continuity without resolving into neat binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of generational corruption cycles emerges clearly through the litany of ancestors' compromises, and Eleanor's arc embodies the question of whether she can break the pattern. The "orbits of regret" motif recurs purposefully. However, the ending tilts toward statement: "waiting for someone brave enough to write it honestly" nearly moralizes. The rosewood nib reappears but doesn't acquire new weight at closure—its meaning remains static (legacy tool), reducing thematic charge. The piece resists false equivalence (her reforms are real), but the final image leans explanatory rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of guilt and redemption is stated rather than emergent: "tether her guilt to its source," "translate guilt into action," "stars of redemption." The final paragraph's "mapping the stars of redemption across the firmament of her broken timeline" is pure thematic echo—prompt-like language replacing scene pressure. The meteor-hush motif and constellation work never evolve in meaning across beats; they're invoked as symbols without constraining choice or charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (meaning in impermanence, unlearning, order/chaos duality) emerges organically from the mandala work and the tile's resonance. The final image—Elara exhaling with the grotto, something unlearning beginning to learn—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing the tile, brushing chalk) and implication (the villagers' laughter becomes permission rather than judgment). The weakness: one sentence ("order and chaos were the same thing seen from different angles, and the only mess worth discovering was the mess inside oneself") edges into thesis articulation, lowering what would otherwise be a high-8 score. The rest holds texture and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the tessera's fractured patterns and Lysara's insight that names are "vessels" carrying memory and spirit, not merely labels. The story asks what mercy means in irreversible loss and answers through the particular act of renaming: not restoration but resilience, "empathy made unburnable." The final image—"holding an ember, knowing it could warm without burning"—reweights "warm coldness" and "aberrant mercy" without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Lysara's unspoken exchange with Soren ("You see them," not a question) and in the choice to gift him "arms of steel" rather than false comfort. One slip toward theme statement: "This was mercy, though it would look like madness" edges into overt articulation where the dramatized act alone would have sufficed.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—despair as doorway, fractured timelines as possibility—emerges through the orchard echoes and the tarot coin's multiplicity. The final image (coin spinning, "all of them, not one timeline but the infinite web") reweights prior material. Yet the piece tells the theme overtly ("Despair is a performance you don't have to finish") and Elara's summary ("the quiet miracle of one soul choosing to believe again") replaces scene pressure with moralizing. The thematic claim outpaces the dramatized stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (consent and boundaries in connection) emerges from the pill-recall premise and the geode's "invitation rather than intrusion." The final image ("willowglass hope") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the thematic climax leans on direct articulation: "Connection can't be manufactured through chemistry alone. It requires consent…" This Thematic Echo in a pivotal beat substitutes assertion for dramatized pressure. The closing metaphor ("fragile, translucent, trembling with potential light") resonates but the path to it is told more than discovered through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the particulars of post-Sleep cartography and the paradox of the coastal elm fossil, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image attempts a resonant answer—voice for the unknown—but the thematic payoff is undercut by thesis-like phrasing: "She had found her voice, and it spoke for everything that had waited patiently." The piece gestures toward complexity (mystery predating human memory) without genuine ambiguity or counter-reading; the ending resolves neatly into declared purpose rather than felt ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—wisdom accumulates through patient collection of small truths—emerges organically from the button catalog and jar echo. The final paragraph, however, states the theme overtly ("wisdom shared is wisdom multiplied") rather than letting the final image resonate. Subtext operates in the contrast between "great scrolls" and "lost buttons," but the ending moralizes instead of charging prior material. The piece invites reflection but the overt articulation undercuts resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—fixing what's broken through reclaimed courage—emerges organically from the pillbox cipher and Elena's scarred identity. The "codes in snow" and spring-thaw imagery support rather than state the premise. The final gesture of extending the pillbox offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the "unused courage" phrase borders on thematic echo, and the phrase "something ancient and vital stir within her chest" edges toward abstraction rather than concrete realization.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.7)
    The palimpsest promise and distillation theme emerge organically from concrete particulars (yarn needle, grandmother's request, decades of crossings). The piece avoids moralizing and invites reflection through image and motif. However, the final image—stepping onto the barge—offers a quiet answer that reweights prior material only lightly; the thematic question (what must be carried forward) is restated rather than repriced with undeniable cost. Strong thematic coherence, but the ending's resonance is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—gentleness as persistence, memory as resistance—emerges organically from beekeepers' kindness, the oasis's refusal to burn, and Mira's phototropic nature. The lantern glass recurs with reweighted meaning (patient waiting → active frequency), and the final image ("stubborn green inside her like a secret glaze") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: the penultimate paragraph ("some places resisted change because…") edges toward thematic statement rather than letting image carry full weight. No overt moralizing, and the conceptual cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—renewal after loss, the space between grief and growth—emerges organically from the rosebush, the gauge tooth metaphor, and the planting ritual. Subtext operates in gesture (the child's tears, Maren's waiting, the oar rhythm). However, the final paragraph edges toward stated moral: "we're going to take this light and instill it into those dark corners" and "something was already stirring" articulate the thesis rather than letting the final image resonate without commentary. The theme is coherent and specific, but the last lines pull toward summary rather than earned silence.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—extinction as transformation, isolation becoming connection—emerges from particulars (extinct species, tidal currents, the brass sundial) rather than assertion. The final image offers a resonant answer: the book as "map of what might yet be born" reweights prior grief. However, the ending paragraph edges toward thematic statement ("isolation would finally translate into its opposite") that nearly crosses into moralizing. The brass sundial and tidal library anchor the theme without symbolic convenience, and the piece resists binary resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the nest's spiral, Mira's letter-writing, and the metaphor of rejoining. The ending offers a non-literal answer: all longing spirals toward the same center, and her work was connective architecture all along. Subtext operates in "needed someone else to speak" and "never kept copies, but remembered every word." The final image of dual spirals (thrush and Mira) resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (entities manipulate through amplification; individuals can resist by speaking their language back) emerges from the premise but remains overstated. The final paragraph moralizes: "The cosmos was full of entities who wished to play games with mortal minds, but it was also full of those willing to stand in their way." This thesis statement replaces earned resonance. The astronomical charts and subsonic frequencies offer potential motifs, but they don't shift meaning between opening and close—they remain tools, not images reweighted by cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of rebellion against forgetting and silence emerges through concrete action (retrieving the key, defying fear) rather than assertion. The organ as beacon and the grandfather's letters ground the thematic question in particulars. However, the final paragraph tips into mild thematic statement ("rebellion not against any enemy flesh and blood, but against the forgetting...") where a charged image would have been stronger. The "passages of possibility" metaphor in the closing lines offers some resonance but borders on explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (grief, empathy, visibility through absence) emerges from particulars: face blindness as aperture, the ribbon as residue, "the hunger to be seen." The final image offers a non-literal answer—"not answers, but completion"—but risks stating the thesis rather than dramatizing it. The Alzheimer's parallel and "dormant empathy" language veer toward abstract declaration. Stronger when anchored to the quarry's "exhaling" atmosphere and the portrait's emergence from negative space.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (suppressed knowledge, intergenerational legacy, cost of truth-telling) emerges organically from the great-grandmother's exile and Maren's archive work. The copper nail and coded stanzas function as purposeful motifs that deepen rather than decorate. Subtext operates in the senior researchers' exchanged glances and the nail's verdigris presence. The ending offers a resonant image (wind screaming, Maren rising) that reweights the opening's tethered life without stating a moral. However, thematic language edges toward prompt-echo: "reversible exile," "palimpsest of suppressed knowledge," "intergenerational tragedy" read as thesis statements rather than discoveries. The phrase "the maps themselves were trying to tell her something she had been trained not to hear" in the opening paragraphs borders on Thematic Echo, though it precedes rather than replaces the ending's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—possibility sculpted from impossibility, testimony that emerges after disappearance—arises organically from the bridge-playing, glass-flake mechanics, and the fiddler's vocation. The final image (shimmer in rearview, commitment to recount) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. "Pixelated amnesty" as a concept is compelling and earned by the collodion fragment's behavior. However, the phrase "luminous disbelief" and the tag "ashes of 'never'" veer toward abstraction rather than remaining grounded in concrete sensory work, and the closing paragraph's "the recounting itself was the sculpture" skirts thematic summary (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (territories as portable identity, the circularity of ambition) emerges from the circus-train metaphor and Marcus's inherited philosophy. However, the piece risks over-articulation: "territories were stories people told themselves" and "endings and beginnings were the same moment" veer toward thesis statement. The final image of the train "marking its territory in the gathering dark" is resonant but does not reweight prior material with new pressure; it illustrates rather than transforms.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme (shared knowledge, generational transmission) is explicitly stated in multiple passages: "burdens we've carried together," "passed forward like the variable stars," "healing words exchanged." The daylily motif is over-explained ("symbolized the fleeting nature of insight") rather than allowed to resonate through image. The final paragraph moralizes the piece's thesis directly, replacing scene pressure with abstract commentary. The conceptual repricing is asserted but not made concrete or undeniable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through particulars: the ice dome as "confession made solid," the flesh-eating plant converting "poisonous intent into fertile soil," and the final insight that "mirrors...never showed the times he had fallen, only the standing figure that rose afterward." The closing image of the pool reflecting his weathered face, marked by failures, offers a resonant non-literal answer to the mirror question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the tension between destruction and renewal, shame and redemption. The only minor slip is the near-explicit articulation of theme in "discovering truth meant first losing your grip on illusion," which edges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of bridging dreams and becoming intersection emerges through imagery—maze paths "inward rather than out," linking through scars, expansion beyond rooted self. The topiary clipping shifts meaning across beats: gift → ritual object → planted bridge. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "she became the bridge she had always been meant to be" without moralizing. Subtext operates in the gardeners' "gravity that suggested ritual," the old wound, the veil trembling. "Purposefully curious" anchors the visionary's drive without abstraction, though "anxious elation" drifts toward label-speak in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the orchard's root-bone communion and Elara's recognition that "some holes could not be patched—only honored." The burned tarot card's Hanged Man image (sacrifice/stagnation) reweights at closure when its "upside-down arc toward transformation" completes. Subtext operates effectively in the oracle's warning and the intimacy of roots claiming bones as "communion" rather than violation. The final image avoids stating a moral, instead offering a resonant paradox: trading everything makes her "more whole than she had been before." Minor slip: "fierce gentleness" and "dusky resolve" approach label-speak when repeated without fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of purpose after loss emerges through concrete particulars: the blown speaker grille, the funeral/dissolution blur, the amplifier inscription "who carried the sound." The echo valley longing operates as both image and recurring phrase that tracks Marcus's emotional state without becoming a thesis statement. The final decision to drive to Elko offers a resonant answer—purpose survives in artifacts carried by strangers—without overt moralizing. However, the closing paragraph edges toward abstract philosophizing ("sound never truly disappears, it only finds new places to echo") that states theme rather than letting the image do the work. The serpentine chest vs. amplifier contrast effectively embodies the thematic tension between safe facts and meaningful history.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—understanding as an act of translation, the architecture of transition—emerges organically from the arbor, cuneiform evolution, and Elara's shifting ambitions. The final image attempts a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph edge-cases into thematic echo: "She did not need to make a discovery that would echo through centuries. She needed only to understand…" articulates the thesis in near-prompt language, reducing subtextual charge.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme emerges clearly: wonder survives by accepting routine, contradiction, and migration without forcing continuity. The piece avoids overt moralizing and builds its question through concrete images (the creel, the smelted leaves, the moon-phase fluctuations). However, the ending offers no resonant reconfiguration or non-literal answer; it restates the premise in near-identical language ("here, you may rest; here, you may change"). The final image—Asa continuing her work under unchanging wintersun—does not reweight prior material or impose conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—human connection versus isolating walls—emerges through the bunker/cave juxtaposition and the pearl as vessel for "abandoned hopes." The final image (pearl "threaded through with the colors of every abandoned hope") reweights the opening thesis with a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor weaknesses: "humanity built walls when it should have learned to knock them down" and "people needed to dissolve the walls between hearts" come close to thematic statement rather than pure dramatization. The confession detail (lover's apology) anchors the abstraction, and Margret's concrete choice (sending shells to an archive) keeps the theme grounded. The piece invites reflection without collapsing into a moral, though the opening sentence and one mid-paragraph thesis flirt with over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: river flooding, accordion mending, ivy growth, graffiti layering all converge on continuity-through-rupture without explicit thesis. The final image—mapping the station as she would rivers—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The bellows as "continuous mending" and graffiti as "cartography of feeling" layer subtext effectively. Minor slip: "we break and we continue and we make beauty from brokenness" approaches direct statement, though it's filtered through the object and remains short of sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of unspoken truths recurs through the library's untitled books and "words too dangerous to speak," but the final image defaults to meta-commentary: "endings were merely beginnings spoken backward." No concrete particular reweights the premise; the protagonist never faces a choice between speaking and silence. The watch and cipher function as symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic points rather than constrain action, and the closing assertion of "infinite" replaces earned resonance with abstract claim.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The perforated-destiny motif recurs purposefully (countess gaps, coffee stains, final "light where certainty had blocked") and charges the ending without overt statement. The piece resists tidy moral and invites ambiguity. The final line offers a resonant non-literal answer: letting in light equals choosing want over fear. No thematic echo; the wisteria and violin particulars anchor the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of beauty/mortality and preserving essence emerges from imagery and the profession's nature. The emerald-as-vessel motif is purposeful, and the "threshold of stillness" recurs with thematic weight. However, the ending offers no non-literal answer or reweighted insight—Mira simply completes her sacred work and descends, affirming rather than complicating the premise. The final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("evidence that even in the face of oblivion, something beautiful could endure") without dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme (impermanence, presence, cyclical care) emerges organically from the grotto-tending, forgiveness arc, and climbing pattern. The scallop hairpin and cloud formation create a purposeful image-braid. The final insight resists overt moralizing yet the phrasing "not permanence, but presence; not arrival, but the continuous, sacred act of arriving" edges toward thesis statement. The theme is conceptually clear but the particulars (luminescent flowers, mist) remain somewhat ornamental rather than constraining choices that test the theme under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of nuance vs. certainty emerges from concrete particulars (hollow mirror, wind chimes, the cloak of doubt) and avoids overt moralizing. The mirror moment offers a non-literal answer—Mara's compass "still pointed true"—but the insight feels self-congratulatory rather than hard-won, and the final paragraph restates the theme ("questions came to find their answers") in essay-like language. The recurring mirror and chimes accumulate meaning across beats, elevating thematic resonance despite the thesis drift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—delayed revelation as self-discovery, teaching through withholding—emerges organically from the ring sequence and is never stated as thesis. The final image (Mina throwing her own stone) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she becomes the withholder, closing the loop without moralizing. "Growing younger was just another word for returning" and "truth withholds itself" risk abstraction but are anchored in the concrete act of stone-throwing. The backwards-aging researcher concept charges the thematic question without becoming allegorical stand-in. One line veers close to Thematic Echo: "Some truths...could only be taught by withholding them until the student was ready," but it's followed immediately by embodied action (she throws the stone), limiting the drift.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges clearly from the particulars: stillness as navigation, the wandering pulse, geological patience. The arrowhead, dust, and bird patterns recur and deepen meaning. However, the final paragraph ("true navigation was not about the movement of the body through space") articulates the thesis in prompt-like language rather than allowing it to resonate through image alone, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5). The piece invites reflection and resists tidy morals, but the explain-everything ending reduces resonance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges concretely: the sacred lives in the keystone's "simple, sacred architecture," not grand storms. "Brilliant dimness" and "lingering luminance" recur with reweighted meaning (light that "acknowledged its own approaching absence"). The final garden image answers the opening question—underachievement versus preparation—without moralizing. The keystone's return as the missing piece integrates motif with closure, avoiding token recurrence. Minor slip: "She understood, finally" leans toward articulation rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from image and event: light as promise, sound made visible, patience as method. The piece resists overt statement—"the color of sound was not something to be found but something to be received" is earned by the three-year search and the meteor-flash synesthesia. The final image (saffron and violet threads, lanterns rising like "messages in bottles made of fire") reweights the opening without stating a moral. Subtext operates cleanly in the father's cryptic vow and Elias's habit of hiding behind "truth." Minor deduction: the thematic answer risks softness—"learning to be quiet" can read as platitude if not anchored by harder cost; here the synesthetic vision rescues it, but the emotional stakes remain diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of patient witnessing versus instrumental knowing emerges organically from Kira's practice. The "backwards prophecy" concept offers potential richness but remains abstract—it's explained rather than dramatized. The final insight about recognizing "the present for what it truly was" verges on platitude without specific grounding in cost or contradiction. The ambered light and coin imagery recur purposefully, though the closing "quietly enthusiastic" phrase echoes prompt language too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme (grief as mapping, naming to survive) emerges through concrete action—tracing monsters, giving names—without thesis statements. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: naming transforms formless sorrow into something portable, and she walks into dusk "not afraid." The atlas motif constrains choice and charges closure. Elias's instruction ("map the monsters") seeds early and reweights at the end, earning credit for emergent rather than imposed meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the dripping-water motif and the mage's inadequacy reframed as necessity: modest persistence can heal what overwhelming force would shatter. The bell's transformation (absorbing sapphire light, carrying water's patience) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the imbalance question. Subtext operates in the father's urgency, the village's silence, and the fishermen's weeping wonder. No overt thematic statements in the body, though the final paragraph's explicit linkage ("patient and eternal, gentle and unstoppable") edges toward direct articulation rather than pure image. The ending avoids moralizing but does state the lesson more openly than ideal for the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as violence, institutional erasure versus personal memory, the reservoir's failure to expunge human story. The sapphire label serves as a resonant particular—its refusal to drown anchors the abstract question without stating a moral. The final image offers a non-literal answer: "some truths would not stay submerged no matter how long the water tried to hold them." One slip: "she spin stories into shared meaning because silence was a kind of violence" borders on thematic echo, articulating the thesis rather than letting the trail of photographs and discoveries embody it.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—reconciling measurement and mystery—emerges from recurring images (crystal, starlings, flame) and Mira's interiority. The final paragraph articulates this overtly: "she had been the crystal all along, frozen and waiting for the flame of wonder to set her free"—a direct thematic statement that replaces scene pressure. Recurring motifs (waterfall colors, grandmother's voice) add texture but do not constrain choices or charge the closure through action. The ending offers a resonant image, yet the explicit moral framing ("true alchemy lived in the liminal space") lowers thematic subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.9)
    The "watcher's burden" is stated overtly multiple times rather than emerging from image and action: "This was the weight of my profession," "the watcher's burden made manifest," "the watcher's burden carried one more night." The parachute buckle and "soundless echo" recur but function as motifs, not dramatic ironies that reweight the premise. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "to watch is sometimes the greatest gift of all," violating the non-literal answer test and triggering the thematic-echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (complementary opposites enabling transformation) emerges organically from the clone relationship and blade imagery. The "vivify" motif returns with shifted meaning at closure, and the piece resists tidy morals. However, the final paragraph explains the thematic payoff rather than trusting image and action: "a consciousness that survived ego death by learning to feel through another" over-articulates what the blade moment should have charged without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—tending to unspoken grief through sound—is overtly stated rather than emergent from particulars: "tending to the unspoken," "restoring lost laughter," "macerate the stillness" are abstract labels repeated without scene pressure. The final paragraph moralizes the work's purpose ("planting seeds of remembrance") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. No epiphany is earned; the piece tells its thesis rather than dramatizing cost or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (making friends with uncertainty, threshold as home) is woven through image and motif, avoiding overt statement until the final passages. The ending attempts a resonant answer ("to make friends with uncertainty was the only true guardianship") but crosses into explicit philosophizing rather than letting the image speak. The cultist's pendant and the boundaries of light remain symbolic ornaments rather than particulars that constrain or reweight the central question. Multiple metaphors (prison/threshold, waiting/preparation, veil of sleep/waking) stack without deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the particulars of creative destruction, surrender, and release; the crozier's breaking and burning enact "how some things must be utterly unmade before they can become their truest selves." The "frozen bloom" motif (impossible instant, frost on dying leaf) mirrors Mara's transformation and recurs at closure to reweight the opening image. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic statement—"the only formula that could not fail was the one that began with surrender"—and "destroyed creation, had unmade and made anew" summarizes the theme rather than trusting the image to carry it. The ending invites reflection without confusion, but the articulation borders on explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme—endings contain beginnings—is woven through the signal's "fundamental rhythm" and the final paragraph's explicit statement, but it relies on telling rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The moment of "crystalline connection" delivers the theme via abstract philosophizing ("the way darkness contained light, the way death nurtured growth") instead of a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The final line ("You simply had to know how to tune for it") edges toward moralizing, and the Hollywood fragment's presence as a motif feels ornamental rather than thematically charged at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of transience and acceptance emerges through the empty hourglass, "permanent transient" framing, and the spectral grotto imagery. The final image—"a road with no end and no beginning, only the journey"—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but tips into overt thematic summary ("ardence that made every crossing worthwhile"). The hourglass reprise charges the ending with purposeful ambiguity. Deduct −0.3 for the penultimate paragraph's moralizing tone ("she had made her peace") that replaces scene pressure with assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—perception's malleability, the cost of constructing wonder—emerges from particulars: sinew thread, lagging reflections, phosphorescence trails, false childhood summers. "As memories alter" operates as scientific observation and confession without becoming a thesis statement. The final image offers a non-literal answer: sitting among threads, unable to distinguish made memories from constitutive ones, is the thematic price of rational enchantment. No moralizing; the resolution reweights prior material (fifteen years, overwritten recollections, "beautiful machinery") through a quiet, earned image.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the anchor-link motif (holding steady vs. pulling forward), the edge-geometry method (light transformed, not lost), and the visitors' pedagogy (showing rather than solving). The final image—Mira holding the link and pledging to follow patient, ancient stars—resonates without overt moralizing, reweighting her grandmother's surface wisdom as applicable to cosmic navigation. The story resists tidy binaries and invites reflection on continuity across unfathomable change. However, the phrase "unfolded horizons" recurs as a thematic label rather than a dramatized pressure point, and the ending leans slightly toward assertion ("she would learn to follow them") instead of a charged particular that speaks for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of grief, connection, and listening emerges through image and event. "The dead did not call to be answered—they called to be heard" approaches resonance but is stated rather than imaged. The hearing aid and the atrium offer concrete particulars, and the incidental-heroism concept integrates obliquely. The final paragraph tilts toward moralizing ("she understood finally") when a charged image without assertion would have landed harder.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of unremembered voices and invisible currents emerges organically from the cables-as-memory conceit. The final image—"a library, and they had finally learned to read"—offers a non-literal answer with conceptual resonance. However, "standing by the unremembered" arrives as exposition rather than through dramatized particulars, and the closing lines drift toward thematic summary ("guardians of a hush") instead of letting the library image stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of apology and wisdom emerging from systemic failure is coherent and avoids overt moralizing. The recurring heartbeat counting and the Comforter constellation accumulate meaning, though the constellation's shift feels under-dramatized. The final image—"she felt whole"—leans toward abstract resolution rather than a non-literal answer rooted in particulars, and the architect's "midnight solace" remains conceptual rather than embodied in scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—language as texture, the liminal moment of death and transformation—emerges from concrete images: seventeen words for flight, echoes fragmenting and reassembling, the tunnel as a throat. The final image of a new language being born from dying words, flight patterns, and voice offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "dust of forgotten pronunciations" and the curse becoming "something else." No overt thesis or thematic echo mars the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of transforming bitterness into cosmic humor emerges through Amari's arc and the garden's metaphorical resonance. The final image—Mira stepping into the harmony—attempts to reweight skepticism as openness, but the payoff is declared ("You're becoming the punchline") rather than earned through specific, irreversible consequence. Subtext operates in the gravitational playfulness and Amari's fragmented voice, yet the closing beats rely on meta-commentary ("truth, no matter how strange, was worth pursuing") that states the theme rather than dramatizing it. The flint arrowhead and phone return with symbolic charge but no fresh tension.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—transformation, resonance, the gap between knowing and understanding—emerges from particulars (the locust shell, the statues' stone-to-flesh memory). The final image attempts a non-literal answer, but the ending tells us the fruit "shed some of its tarnish" rather than showing a choice or cost that embodies the thematic question. The resonance is gestured at, not earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of crossing borders and keeping promises in disputed territories emerges organically from Marcus's actions and the sisters' censored correspondence. The thunderstorm-in-a-bottle as metaphor for grief and healing shows craft, though it arrives through exposition ("she'll hear thunder, and she'll remember that storms pass") rather than through Vera's on-page experience. The boy's line "You foster things by linking what's missing" makes the theme explicit in prompt-like language, reducing subtext. The final image of the border "less like a barrier and more like a line that brave people crossed anyway" offers resonance, but the piece never complicates the moral calculus—cruelty is elsewhere, kindness here, with no genuine friction.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of repair-through-art emerges organically from the carpenter's métier, the fragment's broken state, and the train's abandonment. The halo as "not ended…but a promise" resists overt statement while anchoring the thematic question. The final image—"let the silence speak, knowing that in its quiet spaces, everything was possible"—offers resonant ambiguity without moralizing, reweighting prior "frozen" labor as latent potential. Subtext operates in the wind bells' omen, the song without words, and the misting hush as companion, though "silence as possibility" edges toward prompt-echo in the penultimate beat.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of analog memory embedded in physical objects emerges organically from Miriam's ritual and the scarf's transformation, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraph's "purpose fulfilled" summary. The hyperbolic-geometry metaphor for narrative accumulation is specific and sustained. However, the ending offers a tidy, symmetrical resolution—lost memories restored, love reawakened—without ambiguity or counter-reading, and the grandmother's woven stories are told rather than dramatized, reducing thematic complexity to nostalgic recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the cipher of longing, the vitalization of captured images, and Mira's discovery that her own dream has been running. The final image—"the dream settled into the photograph and stilled, finally captured, finally home"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and image (the child's toy boat, the woman at the ship's rail), and the palette's colors "absorb light rather than reflect it" carries metaphoric weight without becoming allegorical. The piece resists tidy resolution, allowing Mira to continue working "in the hush of improbable beginnings" rather than declaring closure complete.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—self-imposed prisons around wonder—emerges organically from the philosopher's fear and the locksmith's seventeen-year quest. The final sentence ("only prisons...our own capacity for wonder") is specific to the philosopher's hand yet risks overt statement. Subtext operates in "unassumingly bold fire" and the ribbon-wrapped hair as talisman/key. However, the ending explains ("The idea had freed itself") rather than trusting the image alone, and "improbable longing fulfilled" borders on label-only emotional summary. Thematic resonance is present but softened by direct articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically: empirical skepticism yielding to folkloric truth, memory as sanctuary, and the limits of archival knowledge. The Heron constellation and fairy ring function thematically without overt moralizing, and the final image—Elias planning future expeditions—answers the question of whether curiosity can rest. The phrase "chronically curious never rest" risks explicit theme statement but stays character-particular. The cost of breaking "empirical distance" is implied rather than dramatized, preventing the theme from fully grounding in scene consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.9)
    The reversible-exile theme emerges through image (shadow caught and released, walking backward as strategy) and Maren's dialogue. The final image of the empty swing waiting "for passengers that would come again" offers a non-literal answer to whether healing is cyclical. However, the theme leans toward stated philosophy ("Exile is not a punishment...it can be undone") rather than arising strictly from dramatized conflict. The tea-leaf geometry and afternoon-shadow motif recur but feel ornamental rather than constraint-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—wonder as cultivated essence, preservation through rooted transformation—emerges clearly from image and action rather than statement. The heirloom seed as "covenant" and the waterfall's responsive swell avoid overt moralizing. The final line ("carrying the essence of wonder to places that had forgotten its taste") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor deduction: "insatiably creative in her methods" is told, not shown through a varied tactical choice, and "color of wonder" risks abstraction without the sensory grounding that surrounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: light bent not broken, spirits freed by unbinding, truth revealed in breaking. The recurring motifs—masks, prisms, interlaced hush, knots—interlock without overt statement, and the final image of Mira's childhood reflection reweights the entire arc of restoration work. The closing lines ("some truths could only be revealed in the breaking, and some spirits could only be grounded by being set free") skirt direct moralizing but remain grounded enough in the preceding imagery to avoid pure abstraction. The piece invites layered reading without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of patience, reverence, and "interpreting silence with empathy" emerges through imagery (whispered chapel, rain-scoured fresco) and Elena's reflective stance. However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes the theme ("the most profound discoveries come not from forcing open doors") rather than allowing the image to speak. The "whispered chapel" recurs with reweighted meaning but the closure drifts into summary and label rather than landing a non-literal answer through concrete action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme emerges organically from Eleanor's sealed note and Miriam's recognition: "loss was not an ending but a transition." The snow globe's return with reweighted meaning (artificial snow settling around the windmill) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The piece avoids moralizing; instead, Eleanor's "I didn't let go—I changed form" articulates the thematic question through character voice. One slip: the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("she would finally understand how to let go") rather than trusting the image alone, which nudges the score just below the 8.5 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the ghost-and-balladeer synthesis: the desperate need to be heard across isolation and time, encoded communication as survival. The flower press bolt plate and phosphorescent graffiti recur with reweighted meaning at closure, linking past singer to present without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the ghost's wordless patterns and Mira's solitary practice. The final image—"a song that refused to fade into nothing"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a thesis. However, the line "to articulate unspoken needs that had no other avenue for expression" edges toward thematic echo, and "the same desperate need to translate feeling into sound" directly articulates what the particulars already show, lowering the score from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges from particulars: the interplay of duty, curiosity, grief masked by command, and the choice to honor another's hidden joy. The final image—"this one small errand of mercy"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: service can be witness, and compassion can live in silence. The "joy beneath anguish" motif seeds early (Mira's trait) and pays off when she grasps Jansen's dual states (loss/hope) and decides to carry his secret. No thematic echo or explicit thesis mars the ending; the reconfiguration is implicit and earned through Mira's interior shift and the charged final line.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—grief as persistent presence, memory woven through observation—emerges from particulars (telescope, cloud categorization, "sky kept careful records"). The final image attempts resonance via "spooling together" but edges toward explicit statement ("proof that even the most devastating breaks could not sever the thread entirely"). The cloud-as-emotion metaphor is sustained without over-articulation, though the ending privileges closure summary over resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—preservation as transformation, patterns across scales, the translation of knowledge into new forms—emerges organically from Mira's craft rather than assertion. The coin's constellation patterns shifting across centuries and Mira's ceiling depicting multiple temporal moments simultaneously create genuine conceptual depth. The final realization about limits and scales of perception grows from prior particulars (the fractally precise detail, the overlapping sky configurations) without moralizing. However, the ending risks abstraction: "limits did not exist, only different scales" edges toward thesis statement rather than fully resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—discovery through patient attention to hidden patterns—emerges from concrete action rather than statement. The phrasebook's marginalia, the hopscotch geometry, and the starlings' dance cohere around a navigational principle that invites reflection. However, the ending summarizes its significance ("if her discovery held the significance she suspected") rather than offering a resonant, non-literal image that reweights the question. The piece stops at intellectual satisfaction without thematic ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (repair as remembering wholeness, light released from darkness) emerges organically from Thessa's role and the mirror imagery. The final image—stepping through into "infinite timelines" of repair—offers a resonant visual answer to the central question without stating a moral. However, the line "her gift was opening what darkness sealed" tips toward overt thematic declaration, and the phrase "driftwood nostalgia" appears twice without evolving in meaning, reading as motif-for-motif's-sake. The story resists neat binaries and invites reflection, but lacks the lived cost that would charge the theme with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of collective healing and rediscovered purpose emerges from the garden restoration and the shift from "strangers" to "family by choice." The butterfly garden and watering bell function as motifs that recur with shifting meaning (neglect → tended bloom → summoning rain). However, the ending delivers an explicit thematic summary ("strangers no longer, family by choice") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The nebula of respite and floating arches remain ornamental rather than thematically integrated into the closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—endings as transformation, beauty in brokenness—emerges from image and action rather than statement. The broken puppet and nested gears accrue meaning across the text, and the final chime offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the "bruised and perfect truth" language borders on abstract philosophizing, and the lullaby motif is asserted more than dramatized through concrete choices. The piece invites reflection, but the thematic answer is softer than the complexity of the setup would allow.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of inherited burden and reluctant duty emerges organically from the orchard-as-wound opening image and Mira's embodied resistance. The heartseed functions as both key and metaphor without overt statement: unlocking the path literalizes accepting responsibility. The final image—"stairs that descended into warm darkness"—reweights the curse as generative passage rather than trap, and "guide the travelers home" extends the duty forward with quiet resonance. The "offhandedly exact" phrase recurs purposefully (nut's geography, Mira's memory of the pattern), charging specificity as both gift and constraint. No overt moralizing; the question of chosen versus inherited obligation lingers without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the empty chrysalis as transformation rather than abandonment, foam as transient connection, the braided ravine as multiplicity held in one body. The final image—"everything empties into everything else"—reweights separation and work versus presence without overt moralizing. Miriam's arc (chemist seeking rational patterns confronts symphonic chaos of grief) is inextricable from the thematic question. However, "symphonically minded in all things now" and "separation and connection are the same thing seen from different angles" veer toward abstraction and prompt-echo rather than staying rooted in scene pressure. The piece resists tidy closure but risks soft landing; the insight feels more granted than earned through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—stories defined by their absences—emerges organically from concrete images (empty bottles, dissolving manuscripts, gaps between intention and articulation) without overt statement until the final reflection. The bottled moonlight and fragmentation motifs recur with shifting valence, and the closing image of "mindful scattering of silences" reweights earlier material. However, the final two paragraphs edge toward thematic summary ("every story was defined not by its words but by the mindful scattering of its silences"), slightly undercutting the resonance built through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from Miriam's actions: endurance and partial transformation rather than erasure. The pavilion as "repository for everything the desert people had never said aloud" and her counter-offerings of reconciliation/forgiveness avoid overt moralizing. The final image—walking into morning light with the knowledge that sorrow can be borne—reweights prior material without stating a thesis. The sandpaper metaphor recurs purposefully, and the ending resists tidy closure: the pavilion "would never be empty," validating complexity over false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bridge-from-silos theme emerges through concrete images (elevators, clock weight, languages), but the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("communities, like clocks, could be repaired") rather than letting the ending image reweight prior material without explanation. The Kovalenko weight and interspersed languages offer textural richness, yet the thematic payoff arrives via summary and label rather than resonant silence, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of abandoned dreams emerges through concrete images (the young explorer's failure of courage, the mirror as memory lattice) rather than direct statement. The periscope mirror shifts from relic to artifact to tool, earning some resonance. However, the ending tilts toward thematic echo—"archeologist of abandoned dreams" and "gave them voice again" name the thesis rather than let the final image carry it. The transformation lacks ambiguity or counter-reading; Mira's epiphany arrives fully formed without friction between insight and cost. The piece invites reflection but resolves too neatly into its premise without persistent tension.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—knowledge as perception, vigilance as constant watching—emerges from the prism metaphor and the doodles that shift when unobserved. The final image of seeds "sprolved into bloom" (a neologism that reads as over-reach) attempts resonance but leans toward abstraction. "Seeds of vigilance" repeats as a label rather than accruing pressure through particulars. The piece invites reflection on preservation and seeing, yet the ending tilts toward thematic summary ("new ways of seeing") instead of a charged image that reweights prior material without stating the lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: communication across silence, industrial remnants repurposed for living art, empathy as vibrational transfer. The final image—siskin's call answering Elara's instrument—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the kinship between hedgehog and sculptor, the insulator as "forgotten note," stress cracks as "information." Yet "Empathy in motion" is stated outright mid-story ("music that carried feeling rather than merely sound, emotion transferred through vibration"), functioning as prompt echo rather than emergent insight. The piece avoids abstraction elsewhere but this single thematic assertion prevents higher-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—finding beauty in difficulty, teaching through silence—emerges from the worry stone, magnetic nexus, and eclipse imagery without overt moralizing. The final paragraph, however, tilts into explicit thematic summary: "to teach without speaking, to understand without being understood, to find beauty in the difficult and call it home" replaces resonant image with stated thesis, triggering a −0.6 penalty. The eclipse metaphor shifts meaning subtly from broken covenant to eventual revelation, but the effect is muted by the surrounding exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (empathy through listening, silence as language) emerges from Mira's profession and the locked-clasp frame. The final diary entry—"silence after celebration is the most honest"—offers a non-literal answer that reweights the catalog conceit, meeting the Q5 quick test baseline. However, the epiphany about "losing" sounds to understand empathy is stated rather than enacted; we do not witness a prior moment where Mira's cataloging impulse caused a concrete failure or relational cost. The recurring silence-frequency motif charges the ending but lacks mid-story complication or counter-evidence. No overt moralizing, but the thematic insight feels gently asserted rather than wrestled from scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the corpse flower's dual nature (decay/transformation) and the spiral-doodle motif that recurs from mother's gift to Kalia's final journal entry, reweighting "patience blooms in strange soil" without explicit moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the wildflower-from-spiral image answers the opening "hush before bloom" with earned stillness. Subtext operates in Elder Sholomi's cryptic instruction and the flower's teaching beneath its stench. However, the line "Some wisdom must first be endured to be understood" borders on thematic echo, articulating what the image already conveys. The piece resists easy moral but could trust its particulars more fully.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the broken arrow as distributed resilience, transformation through upheaval, and the ethics of secret-keeping. The final image—"orchard planet kept its secrets"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "responsibility settle around her shoulders like a second skin" edges toward direct thematic statement. The echoes' "reverence for resilience" leans slightly abstract, though grounded in the artifact's effect on growth cycles.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of pattern recognition and hidden causality emerges organically from the wind-documentation work and convergence discovery. "Singular convergence" as thesis avoids didactic statement, arising instead from concrete stress marks and airflow measurements. The final image—"the world's hidden mathematics finally demanded payment"—offers thematic resonance but edges toward abstraction. The foresight/prediction motif charges the ending without overt moralizing, though it stops short of a non-literal answer that truly reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme ("wonder as essential heartbeat") emerges through image and aurora-layering rather than overt statement, which is a strength. The amber music sheet, ice-as-instrument, and synesthetic color architecture cohere atmospherically. However, the ending delivers thesis-adjacent language ("certified its essential nature at the moment of creation's first strike") that edges toward Thematic Echo, and the final assertion "wonder—essential, eternal, unfettered—began again" declares resolution rather than earning it through a non-literal final image with ambiguity. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into tidy affirmation without lingering friction.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the flute, canyon hush, and Kira's journey: the tension between action and witness, intervention and attention. The final insight—"witness the Weaving between worlds with humble attention rather than desperate intervention"—reweights prior material (the three heartbeats, the council's judgment, the driftwood markers) without stating a moral. The constellation pattern at the end offers a quiet, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates through silence, gesture (raising the flute without playing), and the canyon's enforced stillness. Minor deduction: the phrase "Relic Keeper's true task" edges toward explicit thematic statement in the final beat, though it remains tied to image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (the mathematics of emotion, the necessity of empathy through self-erasure) emerges organically from Maren's methodology and the cosmic frame. The halo fragment and vanishing stars function as motifs that reweight at closure: the fragment dissolves, the stars finish disappearing, and Maren's smile signals understanding—"not a single answer but an endless transcription of questions." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "disorient through deliberate ambiguity" and "arithmetic of the soul" veer toward abstract philosophizing rather than arising solely from scene particulars, and the seventeen-personalities detail is told rather than dramatized with specific emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically: brief encounters extend through vibration, memory germinates into potential, routine becomes legendary. The pendant's shift from inert relic to active symbol is purposeful, and the aurora-as-presence image charges the ending without overt moralizing. Weakness: Mira's monologue ("The pendant germinates what matters") verges on thesis statement, and the final paragraph's "already thinking about who she would meet next" dilutes ambiguity with programmatic certainty. The concept of "coaxing wonder from the routine" resonates but is stated more than dramatized through Elara's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: observers become the observed, grief archived in place, and the living merge with what they study. The prism's refraction, the woman's softening frost patterns, and Mira's realization form a coherent thematic arc without overt statement. The final image—"a conversation, finally, that she had been having with the dead all along"—reweights prior material with resonance, offering a non-literal answer to the question of emotional permanence. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces complexity: Mira's dedication is both devotion and dissolution. No explicit moralizing mars the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of message-sending and transformation through sacrifice emerges from the premise, but the final image ("the amber bead was gone") is too vague to reweight prior material with conceptual cost. The grandmother's "raveling silence" motif recurs but remains abstract; no concrete particular anchors what the silence took or what the message carried. The epiphany ("some messages could only be sent by becoming the message itself") is stated rather than earned through scene pressure. Subtext is scarce in a single-character piece with no dialogue to carry implication.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from Cael's labor: resilience earned through patient, unglamorous work rather than divine intervention. The arches' "indifferent" drift versus his "stubborn, unremarkable insistence" creates resonant tension without stating a moral. The Magician's Silk and downward-growing roots are specific, surprising particulars that deepen the thematic question. However, the final paragraph edges toward direct thematic statement—"perhaps indifference was its own form of permission"—and the piece occasionally tells us its meaning rather than trusting image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges cleanly from image and event: the wound/gift paradox, the seam in consciousness, the idea that truth is carried rather than discovered. The green shard's shift from guide to symbol of self-driven desperation is elegant. The final image—slipping the shard back into her pocket and feeling the pull of the next junction—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the line "the knowledge that her ability was not a gift but a wound, a seam in her consciousness that had opened when she touched the shard and would never fully close" edges toward thematic echo, stating the thesis rather than trusting the image. Strong thematic work overall, with one moment of over-articulation in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of witnessing and honoring the dead emerges through stone stacks and Ashford's histories. The sea-glass offering as "bottled safety" and the grandmother's dissolution into light carry symbolic weight, but the final paragraph's "voices heard, their sacrifices witnessed" borders on thematic echo, labeling what the ritual already showed. The ending reweights prior lighthouse-mourning material yet the resonance depends on assertion ("finally rest") rather than a non-literal image that makes the cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges from particulars: the keeper's "accidental prophecy," the extinction of newspapers, isolation as purpose. The final image—"the sky smiled back"—offers a non-literal answer to loneliness and duty without overt moralizing. However, "shaping a new dawn using ancient shadows" verges on thematic statement, and the closing reflection summarizes rather than charging the image with undeniable resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the butterfly wing's iridescence and the metaphor of receiving/transforming light. The piece avoids overt moralizing until the final paragraph, where "some people magnetized stories because they had learned to see value in every tale" edges into thematic echo. The donor heart and grandmother's legend offer specific anchors, but the ending leans on articulation ("illuminate what lay hidden in plain sight") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer grounded in the final image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—sorrow as measurable, the act of witnessing as healing—emerges organically from the sextant, trees, and the labyrinth's history. The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "to heal by first understanding the full weight of what has been broken." Subtext operates in "dreams scattered like seeds" and "neither lost nor seeking but simply witnessing." The piece avoids moralizing and sustains ambiguity. However, "mundane miracles" is named in the penultimate paragraph, a slight Thematic Echo that nudges toward statement rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: memory as both burden and gift, release through constraint, individual dissolution enabling communal renewal. The final image of Elara becoming "not a keeper of memories, but a weaver of new ones" attempts to reweight prior material, but the phrasing tilts toward abstract articulation rather than letting the image speak. The bound-release paradox operates throughout and charges the ending without overt moralizing, though the final paragraph edges toward theme summary ("bound to the light she had released and free in ways her unbroken self could never have imagined").

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    The nestled-paradoxes concept (hiding to save herself, learning to return; staying while leaving) threads through reflection and is echoed in the Philosophy of Errors setting. Theme emerges organically from Mira's trajectory rather than statement, and the final image of being "both" held in tranquility offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the piece leans toward articulating the paradox rather than dramatizing its cost, and the wisdom-from-mistakes motif is presented more as a label than tested under scene pressure. The thematic coherence is strong but the resonance remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (persistence, ritual, transformation, the sacred in the ordinary) emerges organically from Elara's daily actions and the bread's appearance, not from meta-commentary. The butterfly's uncloaking parallels her work and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of whether partial grace is sufficient. "Tenuous absolution" recurs but avoids becoming a forced motif. The final image reweights prior material without stating a moral, and the wisdom arises from specific experience (seventeen years of tending).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the central image: magic fading into memory, meaning preserved through story. The piece avoids overt moralizing and allows the transformation of vows (binding magic → human understanding) to carry thematic weight. The final paragraph risks thematic echo ("the meaning she sought to conjure from oblivion was not hidden in the slides at all but in the act of seeking itself"), edging toward thesis statement, but the image of "stubbornly luminous persistence" redeems it. The conceptual repricing is clear and resonant without entirely collapsing into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central question—what does it mean "to capture the sound of trust breaking"—threads through Mara's reflection on her father's betrayal and the watch fob's suspended time. The woman's final line ("Then you capture the sound yourself") offers thematic resonance by turning the metaphor back on Mara. However, the phrase appears primarily in exposition and dialogue rather than emerging from enacted particulars. The warming watch fob in the final paragraph provides a concrete image that reweights the "curiously steadfast" motif, achieving modest closure resonance without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (skepticism versus wonder, convergence, belonging) emerges from images and the compass motif. The final paragraph's direct statement ("some truths required not the absence of doubt but the presence of wonder") functions as thesis rather than resonant answer. The forests' voting and Seren's weather-carrying remain decorative; neither constrains Mira's choice or charges the closure. The compass reprise gains meaning but the ending moralizes rather than reweighting through image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—the cost of suppressing another's creativity and the remedy of facing one's complicity—emerges organically from Mira's descent, memory, and the unfinished portrait. The broken lock as both literal and metaphorical device accumulates meaning without overt statement. The crystals, grandmother's teaching ("art is not creation but revelation"), and the incomplete face function as purposeful recurrence. The final image (kneeling, charcoal fingers hovering, "I begin") offers a resonant answer to the thematic question without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication; the piece invites reflection beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: candor as survival ("truthtelling in the curve of a letter"), the cost of honesty in a world requiring "rationing lies," and the room as repository of unspoken truths. The final image—gold leaf catching candlelight, "the room became a garden again"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. The師傅's decline functions as embodied theme (he "wilted near dishonesty"), and Mira's choice to write "the words her師傅 could not speak" reweights silence as inheritance rather than failure. Minor slip: "something new was beginning to grow" edges toward overt thematic declaration in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—truth as convergence, silence as fullness—emerges organically from the sculpture's design and the post-language world. The iceberg fragment's preserved color anchors the thematic concern with wonder and impermanence. Subtext operates in the wordless exchange with Juniper and the sculptures as "gathering places where silent languages could become audible." However, the final paragraph over-articulates the theme ("truth could be heard directly, through the bell of the heart") rather than trusting the prior images, and "everything that mattered was already being said" edges toward a stated moral. The piece resists full didacticism but does not trust its own silence.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the concrete work of containing childhood fears and miniaturizing chaos—"escapes that led you back to what you had always been tending." The box as held fears rather than destroyed ones anchors the theme in specific choice. Subtext operates in the roses "did not know they were artificial, and neither, increasingly, did Cara." The ending avoids overt moralizing and offers a resonant answer through the emptied box and "fragmented wholeness." Minor slip: "fragmented wholeness, the only kind of wholeness worth having" edges toward explicating the theme rather than letting the image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of listening as healing emerges from concrete particulars—unsent letters, the locked mailbox, the estranged sisters. The "sandstorm calm" motif recurs purposefully. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme rather than trusting the image: "listening was not passive but generative," "hearing another person's history could close wounds." This moralizing replaces scene pressure and undercuts what could have been a resonant ending. The conceptual cost of witnessing others' pain is implied but never embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme—vulnerability encrypted as strength, silence weaponized—emerges clearly through the dance and journal motifs, but the final image ("quiet, defiant act of becoming") states the moral rather than letting it resonate through particulars. The spider web and hangman's dice recur, yet their meanings are explained rather than reweighted by the ending action. The piece resists simplistic binaries (voice/silence, captivity/freedom) and the transformation of silence into coded language is compelling, but the closing paragraph veers toward thematic summary ("her voice lived now in every movement") instead of a non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.1)
    The core question—"where do deleted memories go when we force ourselves to forget?"—is posed explicitly and answered on the page (salt crystals beneath the sea). The lantern/light motif recurs but does not shift meaning; "lantern lighter of forgotten things" in the final line restates rather than reweights. Subtext operates weakly; most thematic content is directly stated ("the gravity that fluctuated with the weight of unspoken truths"). The flowers-as-map conceit and the whale as world-cracker are symbolically coherent but lack earned ambiguity or counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the central metaphor: prophecy as frequency rather than fate, noise that can be smoothed rather than fought. The piece explores agency through receptivity—"quieting the very medium through which it traveled"—without overt moralizing. The final image of the wing carried downstream and the summoner walking in "tranquil blaze" offers a resonant answer to the thematic question. However, phrases like "terrestrially cosmic truth" and "vast倾听 of the world" (mixing languages) read as authorial intrusion, and the closing paragraph edges toward theme summary ("even fate could be soothed") rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (the relationship between truth and agreed-upon lies, the language of memory and place) emerges organically from the desk seal, the architectural syntax, and the final acceptance. The meteor-shower image—"stars streaking across the darkness like corrections written in the margins of the universe"—is fresh and non-literal. The ending offers a resonant answer (some truths are too large for ordinary conversation; inhabiting mystery can be a form of knowing) without stating a moral. The tutor's ghostliness is handled with restraint, and the piece resists tidy resolution. Final image reweights prior material (buildings exhale, stars choreograph) with purposeful ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of translating isolation into connection emerges organically from the shell's function and Elena's recorded message. The final image of "voice would live on, not as ghost but as gift" offers a resonant answer to the premise. However, the ending paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("to make of it a bridge, to translate isolation into independence") rather than letting the particulars speak. The concept of "quarantined memory" is intriguing but remains more asserted than dramatized with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of truth-restoration versus complicity emerges through the heritage rose thorn, the key metaphor, and the unlinking motif. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("she had unlinked herself from the chain of complicity") rather than letting the image resonate. The rose thorn's return in the ending offers a purposeful reprise, and the calibrated-treason concept reweights prior material, but the moralizing summary ("offered forgiveness for the unfinished work") undercuts earned resonance. The piece leans on abstract philosophizing ("liminal glow between darkness and color where secrets could be spoken without shame") rather than concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—the cost of hearing everything, the nature of mimicry versus authentic voice—emerges through layered imagery (echoes, frequencies, stolen souls). The seashell and alignment motif recur with shifting weight. However, the final paragraph edges toward direct statement ("where all echoes began and ended, and where the truth...waited at last to be spoken") rather than letting the image alone carry resonance. The central question about echo people is posed but not answered or reconsidered with cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    A coherent theme of memory preservation and naming the forgotten emerges through the child's story and the recurring snow globe, but the piece tilts toward thematic statement ("her motivation had never been simple recovery") rather than letting theme arise from enacted choices. The final paragraph approaches sermon territory with "The child's story would not remain silent" and the explicit declaration of purpose. The snow globe's dissolving recurs but does not shift meaning at closure; it remains a static symbol. The theme is present and legible but told more than earned through specific, pressure-tested particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—hidden effort, repair as reverence, the grammar of nets and connection—emerges organically from concrete particulars (nets, whisk, moon paths, firefly dance) without assertion. The final image (whistle, pattern completion, descent) reweights prior material: her teaching her father patterns he doesn't know he's using, her mother's whisk now meditation tool, all converging. The closing line "ready to mend whatever waiting nets needed her come morning" risks slight moralizing but stays rooted in her labor. Subtext operates in her "strange pleasure in his ignorance" and the fireflies' dual grief-joy.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges cleanly from the stillpoint metaphor and the diamond-as-data conceit: truth as the calm center around which lies orbit. The final image—apple trees anchored in paradox—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution by acknowledging that mythologies will persist. Minor slip: "The truth, she had learned, was never a destination" edges toward thematic statement, though it remains tied to prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of marginalized knowledge versus rigid rationality emerges organically through Elara's exile and the portico's ancient science. "Variant allegiance" is stated directly ("Her allegiance had always been variant, always shifting") rather than arising implicitly from scene particulars, and the final paragraph moralizes the "deep roots from which new light could grow." The portico's crack and the prophet's emergence offer a charged image, but thematic resonance is undercut by explicit summary. Subtext in the radio frequencies and storm patterns is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of translation and intergenerational connection emerges clearly through the poet's work and Elara's backstory. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "connection, the most permanent currency of all" and "redemption that comes when you finally understand what you were always meant to collect." These declarations replace image-driven resonance. The music box functions as a symbolic hinge but its thematic weight is explained rather than dramatized through on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges from the marriage of logic and feeling, the inheritance of responsibility, and the balance of technical precision with intuition. The final line ("logically emotional, eternally vigilant, guardian of both sound and silence") risks overt thematic statement, though it stays tied to Maren's role. The sunset motif recurs with purpose (golden light fading as stakes rise), and the crypt keeper's key accrues symbolic weight through use. However, the ending summarizes the theme ("marriage of logic and feeling") rather than letting the image carry it without commentary, lowering resonance slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of patience versus restlessness is repeatedly stated ("sculpting patience from impatience," "revolution was never measured in seasons alone") rather than emerging from concrete events. The ending asserts thematic payoff ("horizons could only be crossed by those who had learned to wait") in near-prompt language without a resonant, non-literal image that reweights prior material. The final paragraph summarizes the theme rather than dramatizing it through specific action or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lantern-as-inheritance motif elegantly links Elena's work to her great-great-grandmother's mission, shifting from "escape" to "illumination" in the final paragraph without stating a thesis. The drought/truth-concealment parallel operates through concrete imagery (watermark, returning water, "parched denial") rather than abstract claim. Thomas Wright's silencing for archival work investigating suppression creates thematic recursion that charges the ending. The piece resists tidy resolution—Elena anticipates resistance, not triumph—and the "passed forward into uncertain but honest light" image reweights the lantern's meaning with credible ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—grace as action rather than accounting—emerges organically through Thomas's counsel to Marcus ("Grace isn't about deserving. It's about what becomes possible when you stop keeping score") and is enacted when he inscribes the hidden blessing. The clockwork heart's restoration enacts apology-into-action without stating a moral. The final image—"music, and the vibrant hush of something made whole again"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. One weakness: the Marcus flashback and the "vast and patient ledger" motif feel slightly on-the-nose, edging toward Thematic Echo territory, though they stop short of sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (devotion as curiosity, meaning-making as irreverent worship) emerges organically from the kaleidoscope work and the algorithm's pull without overt statement. The final image—ringing the bell and "laughing at the glorious absurdity"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of purpose. The arrow tip as "dictionary" and the bell in the void avoid symbolic convenience by being introduced early and woven through multiple beats. Subtext operates cleanly in the tone's modulation between reverence and irreverence, charging the ending without moralism.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of surveillance capitalism, corporate erasure, and the persistence of digital identity emerges organically from the archive setting and Yuki's distributed consciousness. The patch's seven-star constellation and recurring 47s function as motifs that accumulate meaning without overt symbolic declaration. The ending offers a resonant image—"following the numbers into the silence where the company had hidden what it could not bear to remember"—that reframes the cold case as an act of witness rather than closure. However, the thematic question (whether to restore or preserve absence) is posed but not answered with a stance that carries conceptual cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—peace as understanding, fragments as lens rather than wholeness—emerges organically from the crystal, mirrors, and Mira's stance. "Some things could not be made whole again" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The weighted breath before reply recurs purposefully, charging the final move. However, "courageous anomaly" and "map empathy onto action" hover near prompt-label territory, slightly diluting the specificity at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the drift-ice, parasol tip, and volunteer labor: endings as process, courage in both endurance and departure. The grandmother irony deepens without moralizing. The final image—"breath, held and released"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a thesis. However, "fold in patience" appears twice as abstract phrasing rather than through concrete particulars, and the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("both choices required the same courage") that slightly weakens the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (love as transformation rather than permanence) emerges from specific images—the burned letter, the vines, the train platforms—and avoids overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's "love's purpose was not always permanence." That line and "intersubjective understanding between two souls" edge into thematic echo and prompt-language intrusion, lowering the score by ~0.5. The final image of listening "not for departures, but for...acceptance" offers a resonant answer but is weakened by the preceding explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of preservation and memory emerges organically from Mira's actions and the landscape's "murmuring." The pavilion's "strange honesty" and the clearings function as resonant images. However, the ending does not offer a non-literal answer or reweight prior material; it restates the premise ("the kinetic parapet waited beneath the dunes to be tended again") without conceptual cost or transformation. Subtext operates in the landscape description, but the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than earned particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (pain transmuted into collective meaning, healing as patient practice) emerges clearly through image and ritual rather than statement. However, the final paragraph lapses into direct thematic summary: "collective healing was not a destination but a practice" and "every pain carefully held became a thread in a larger tapestry" read as moralizing rather than resonant non-literal answer. The lavender and rusted gates offer visual cohesion, but the conceptual payoff is told rather than earned through a charged final image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: exhaustion of language, growth as completion, silence as speech's honest form. The crystal's shifting function (diagnosis tool → communion object → light-thrower) and the seventeen unnamed colors offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question about language's end. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing crystal "like a penitent accepting communion") and implication. No overt moralizing. The final image reweights "silence" from absence to presence without stating a thesis. Slight deduction for one moment of near-thematic echo: "silence was not the absence of speech but its most honest form" hovers close to articulating the premise, though it remains tied to Elias's embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from imagery: the fog sculpture garden as a space "between memory and forgetting," videotapes as unread prayers, and the sound of growing older as a chorus of "tiny deaths and births." The final image—Mira held in the garden's arms "like a mother holding a child who had finally stopped crying"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution, embracing the paradox that she locates the sound by accepting "what had already passed through" rather than predicting forward. However, "desperate persistence of waves against a stone shore" and similar abstract phrases occasionally lean toward generic lyricism rather than grounded particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the spinning hand, the camera's purpose, and the narrator's grief: holding the fleeting requires allowing motion rather than forcing stasis. The final image (the photograph of the spinning hand, "held still...while remaining somehow alive") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without a stated moral. The leaf-falling moment introduces a conceptual key ("radical gentleness") that reweights the repair work. Minor thematic echo: "the only restructuring that ever mattered" in the final line edges close to summary, though it remains grounded in the camera action and does not fully collapse into prompt language.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the vinyl shard's transformation, the "sacred ordinary" motif, and the parallel journeys of caregiver and patient. The piece resists moralizing; "broken but still luminous, still singing if you held it just right" offers a resonant image that reweights the premise without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in Margery's "You're not just humming" and Elara's knowing smile. However, "architecture of grace," "reunify," and "pulsing stillness" edge toward prompt-label language that slightly dilutes organic emergence. The final "finding their way home through the architecture of ordinary sounds" tilts close to thematic summarization rather than letting the image alone carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—relearning through embodied practice vs. study—emerges from Elara's circle-walking and the key's response to her thoughts. The final image ("rose like breath returning") attempts resonance but leans on metaphor assertion rather than concrete particulars that reweight the premise. The "sealed awakenings" concept remains abstract; no dramatic irony or counter-reading complicates the resolution. Avoids moralizing but also avoids complexity—shadow theory is solved cleanly without ambiguity or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the bone-setting metaphor: fractures as windows rather than failures, wisdom as patient strength. The tooth's transformation into constellations offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The mother's voice ("look for the movement in stillness") recurs with purpose, and Elara's laugh—"more nostalgia than bitterness, more innovation than tradition"—tonally embodies the thematic synthesis. No prompt echoes or label-speak in the final beats. The "shrewdly innocent belief that even fractured things could learn to hold weight differently" risks abstraction but stays tethered to the physical tooth and fountain.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—transformation of loss into groundward radiance—emerges through the pearl and sea glass motifs without overt moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer: "a different kind of radiance, one that required both her patience and her grief." However, the penultimate line crosses into theme statement ("she had never truly fallen at all. She had simply been called...") that replaces scene pressure with authorial thesis. The pearl of stillness recurs purposefully but risks symbolic convenience, introduced late to harvest thematic points rather than constraining earlier choices.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (patient reclamation, quiet healing) emerges organically from the moss, drip patterns, and amber pendant without direct statement. The final image ("let the rest become what it will") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of healing. Subtext operates cleanly in the phone call and the phrase "protected vulnerability." One weakness: "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is prompt-language that edges into thematic echo, though it's cushioned by the surrounding metaphor work.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: spirals as perpetual beginning, fear as current, unfinished work as offering rather than failure. The shell's spiral image recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, and the "shapes of different hopes" phrase threads through without becoming sermon. The young mother's blessing and the gallery of ghosts avoid allegorical transparency; they embody rather than explain. The final image—"spirals never really end—they only fold back into themselves"—risks overt metaphor but remains grounded in the shell's concrete form and the protagonist's renewed readiness. No moralizing in the final paragraph; the walk toward the page shows rather than tells.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through image and event: cyclical restoration, intergenerational knowledge, right relationship with the growing world. The golden stories literalized in the vine's growth offer a fresh angle on narrative-as-biology, and the final image of the arbor blooming again reconfigures the opening's patient waiting without stating a moral. However, "right relationship with the growing world" and "the old practices would find their way back" drift toward abstract thesis in the final lines, weakening the otherwise concrete thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the ritual: mapping invisible emotional terrain, translating heartbeats into guidance, binding ephemeral light to permanence. The grandmother's death and the storybook plate anchor the thematic question in concrete particulars. However, the final image leans toward abstract affirmation ("quiet translation from breath to starlight") rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with ambiguity. The piece resists overt moralizing but the thematic statement is close to explicit in the penultimate sentence, slightly undercutting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (wonder versus reason, periphery versus center) emerges through mirrors, echoes, and the timer's "second purpose." The final image—working "in the space between wonder and understanding"—is evocative but does not reweight prior material through a specific event or choice with cost. The epiphany about "proper question" risks stated wisdom over earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—bearing sorrow collectively through art versus carrying it alone, the cost of becoming the archive—emerges through concrete particulars: burdens without owners, patterns spiraling inward, calcification as price. The grotto as living organism ("ancient lung exhaling," "whalebone reverie") resonates without overt statement. The final image reweights prior material by shifting the grotto from stone repository to animate, oceanic presence. However, the piece flirts with abstraction ("unnamed sorrow," "weights of human weight") and the thematic echo in "release it into the structure and feel herself grow lighter" borders on articulating the premise rather than letting image alone carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of "here and gone" as unified rather than opposed emerges through the carving and the husband's absence-as-presence. The final paragraph, however, devolves into thematic echo: "the work was love, and the work was letting go, and the work was keeping hold, and there was no difference, and there was all the difference" explicitly states the thesis in prompt-like language. This thematic articulation in the ending paragraph triggers the stated penalty. Earlier passages achieve resonance through particulars (the mane's grain, the glass eyes waiting), but the closure summary replaces scene pressure with philosophical assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—failure as ordinary, ghosts-to-ourselves, unlived possibility—emerges from concrete particulars (carousel, collected confessions, eroded ambitions). The camera wheel accumulating "unlived possibility" avoids overt moralizing. Mira's final question to the ghost resists tidy resolution and the closing image (camera wheel still, exhaustion as peace) offers a resonant non-literal answer. Minor penalty: "exhaustion, too, is a kind of peace" edges toward thematic echo, but the prior image work earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of resurrection and refusal to let go emerges organically from the spaceport's history and Mara's engineering mission, but the council speech ("spoke not of engineering specifications but of possibility") tells the thematic pivot rather than showing it through a fraught choice or image. The sextant recurs with symbolic weight yet never constrains a decision; it sits polished on her desk, an ornament rather than a lived question. The closing line—"stoic wonder as the only appropriate response to the universe's stubborn persistence toward renewal"—is overt philosophizing that replaces scene pressure with abstraction, lowering resonance at the critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—impermanence, grief as companion rather than void, the impossibility of capturing time—emerges organically from the clock's mechanics and the protagonist's twenty-year paralysis. The final image (clock ticking, not stopping) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: time as song rather than structure, release rather than completion. No overt thesis statements; the grandfather's dream is shown through the unfinished mechanism, not told. The bear's excruciatingly gentle presence and the crystal's whispered song avoid symbolic shouting and instead accumulate pressure. Petrichor nostalgia threads through without becoming a forced motif.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme—how deception is layered until indistinguishable from truth—emerges organically from the canal investigation and Konstantýn's maps. The sundial as recurring object gains meaning: it measures "hours that stretched across decades, marking time that refused to stay hidden." The final image of steering toward hidden construction offers a resonant answer to the thematic question without stating a moral. However, the protagonist's unearned epiphany ("she realized") and lack of internal friction prevent the theme from fully grounding in dramatic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—knowledge preserved through practice—emerges organically from the rope, glass, and seed-collecting without overt statement. The final image (coiling the rope, planning spring planting) offers a resonant answer to the question of inheritance. The fulgurite as "caught lightning" and the knots as "spiraling patterns" recur with shifted meaning, charging the closure. Minor weakness: the comparison "like a flower finally opening to the sun" and "patient as the tide, certain as the return of light" trend toward abstraction and platitude in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: absence, documentation, the act of staying as self-inscription into loss. The weft thread as "evidence of beauty that no longer existed" and the garden as "a place designed for departures" are non-literal carriers. The final image—"the first stroke of the map she had come here to draw"—reweights the opening's sense of accidental haunting into intentional witness. No overt moralizing mars the ending. However, the thematic resonance relies heavily on abstract language ("geography of healing," "explained absences") that, while poetic, edges toward conceptual assertion rather than earned from scene pressure. The lack of a concrete choice that dramatizes the theme's friction limits entry to high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of integration versus domination emerges through the Genesis Engine's history, the egg's golden veins, and the suspended palace's mechanical persistence. The final image offers a resonant answer—symbiosis rather than destruction—without overt moralizing. However, the closing lines edge toward thematic summary ("sorrow and hope are finally reconciled into purpose") rather than letting the egg and the walk embody the synthesis. The conceptual cost of integration remains abstract; the piece gestures at complexity but does not dramatize the friction between competing goods or unavoidable harms in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—transformation of inherited destruction into healing purpose—emerges from concrete images (black sand, coin, fire/water duality) rather than abstract statement. The final image of sand clinging to boots as "footprints in ash" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the penultimate paragraph overexplains ("she understood finally that her father's flames and her own water were part of the same eternal dance") and the closing sentence spells out the thesis in prompt-like language ("a woman made of loss and fire...who chose...to be a source of light rather than destruction"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6 for final-paragraph articulation). The piece nearly earns its theme through particulars but retreats into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: skepticism meeting mystery, the patience required to honor what cannot be fully solved, and the quiet rebellion of attending to silenced experience. The stained glass box and breadcrumbs function as concrete anchors rather than symbols, and the final image—empty box, dimmed glow, markers left for the next—answers the thematic question without moralizing. "Some mysteries were not meant to be solved but understood" skirts platitude but is earned by Mira's sustained engagement. The piece resists binary resolution and allows complexity to linger.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—transmission of purpose across generations, memory embedded in objects, light-sharing without consumption—emerges organically from the gear's mechanics and Vael's ritual transit. The gear's awakening reweights the premise: what seemed obsolete holds dormant intention, and Vael's "cold flame of pure intention" redefines illumination through shadow and equation rather than fire. The final image (sonar ping rippling through all elements) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in "troubling serenity," the gear "remembering," and the petals' indifference. No thematic echo or explicit thesis statement mars the closure. The piece earns its quiet wisdom through the calculating machine's conceptual repricing of custodianship.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars—grief as weather, memory as waystation, hands shaping stone—and the piece resists overt moralizing until the final paragraph. The greenhouse and butterfly migration offer concrete anchors for abstract questions. However, the closing lines veer toward theme summary: "the words mattered less than the hands that shaped them" articulates the thesis rather than trusting the image to carry it. The spectral presence and ribbon poems accumulate meaning, but the protagonist's realization is told directly rather than embodied in a final action or image that reweights the question without stating an answer.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of incremental absolution emerges organically from the rake inscriptions, pendulum adjustments, and ritual maintenance without overt statement. The final image—carrying absolution down one footfall at a time—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of redemption without moralizing. Subtext operates in the gap between Marcus's ethically diligent reputation and his actual drunk negligence. The piece avoids thematic echo and resists tidy resolution, embracing the long weight of guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges from the sovereign's encrypted question and the gardener's role as interpreter of the silent dead. The final image—"uncharted echoes...found their listener"—resonates without stating a moral, and the motif of listening recurs purposefully. However, the closure image remains abstract; "breadcrumbs of meaning" and "shape of intentions" are conceptual rather than grounded in embodied particulars. The piece invites reflection but stops short of a non-literal answer charged by prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—ignorance as landscape, innovation within constraint, humility vs. audacity—emerges from recurring images (kingfisher's dive, frozen lake, cartography of the unknown) and is woven through Elara's profession and method. The final paragraph risks stating the theme ("to seed innovation within the constraint of honest assessment") rather than letting the image do the work, and the kingfisher metaphor is explained rather than allowed to resonate. The piece avoids moralizing but tilts toward philosophical exposition. The conceptual question is coherent, and the particulars (feather, ice, spire) ground it enough to reach the low-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—stories as resistance, memory embedded in the physical world, preservation through unconventional means—emerges organically from image and action rather than statement. The dust-as-memory conceit is specific and textured, and the "teaching dust to speak" metaphor resonates without becoming heavy-handed. However, the ending does not offer a non-literal answer or reweight prior material; it restates the premise ("continued her quiet revolution") without tension or cost. Theme is present and coherent but does not achieve the charged final image or earned insight that would elevate it into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—incomplete knowledge, memory as transformation, honoring the unknowable—emerges organically from the ash ritual and porcelain mask without overt moralizing. The vanishing-point gallery and "mirage of safety" motifs echo across the piece and reweight prior material at the end. "Perhaps the reaching mattered more than the grasping" teeters toward thesis statement but stays grounded in Mira's particular ritual practice. The final image ("carrying the weight of everything she would never fully understand") offers resonance without neat resolution, though the sentiment risks abstraction in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—truth preservation versus convenient narrative—emerges organically from the scholar's work and the sedimentary metaphor. The chronometer and "sedimentary layers of story" image recur with purposeful weight, and the piece resists simplistic moral. Subtext operates in the phrase "rational rebellion" and the neighbors' judgment. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("truth is worth preserving") rather than letting the image speak; the resonance is earned but slightly over-articulated, reducing the non-literal charge.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the braid metaphor, the worn rosette, and Eleanor's unlearning of hatred through subtraction of noise. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: art survives through patient attention. Subtext operates cleanly in "the spaces between" and the young man's swallowed consonants. One slip: "vanishing arts" is named too often, edging toward thematic echo rather than remaining fully implicit in particulars. Still, the ending reweights prior material without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—that wisdom grows in ruins and beauty belongs to everyone—emerges through concrete images (the greenhouse, pruning, taste memories) rather than late-paragraph moralizing. The recurring pruning metaphor shifts meaning from physical act to epistemological stance. However, the final paragraph edges toward didactic summary ("Some rebellions are fought with swords; others are waged with soup spoons") that states rather than earns the thematic answer. The ending offers resonance but the articulation dulls its charge by over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme—wonder as spiritual fuel—emerges clearly but is stated by Elara's internal narration ("the wonder had drained") and Mira's dialogue rather than demonstrated through concrete particulars. The riddle functions as a thematic bumper sticker. The final image of lights returning does not reweight prior material or offer a non-literal answer; it delivers the theme as a moral. The matchbox and "hope" collect are forced symbolic recurrences without fresh inflection at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the accumulation of displaced objects and sensory inheritance, avoiding direct statement. The orris root shard functions as both literal and thematic object, linking scent-memory to the grandmother's teaching. The final image—"some truths have always been waiting to be noticed"—reweights the material without overt moralizing, though it edges toward abstraction. The concept of houses as living memory is developed through concrete particulars (coffee cup residue, window latches) rather than exposition. However, the ending offers conceptual closure without felt ambiguity or cost, trending toward tidy resolution rather than sustained complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—certainty versus nuance, contradiction as necessity—emerges organically from the garden's dual-nature imagery (anemone, coral, foxglove as remedy/poison). The alchemist's discovery that "certainty was the enemy of understanding" is stated but then dramatized through Thalassor's encounters with fish and eels. The final image ("keeper of questions instead of answers") reweights the opening without moralizing. One slip: "善意" (Chinese characters mid-sentence) appears to be a generation artifact that breaks immersion and reads as unintentional code-switching in an otherwise English narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges from the staircase paradox and the dice's imperfection: understanding requires both wholeness and damage, and imprisonment is "a failure of interpretation." The final image of ascending "not to escape but to understand" reweights prior material, but the language veers toward direct statement ("boundless confinement she had experienced was lifting, transformed by the mathematical proofs into something else entirely") rather than letting the particulars resonate without a stated moral. The piece invites reflection but edges into overt thematic articulation in the closing paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—kindness echoes across strangers—emerges from the calligrapher's gift, the daydream chain, and Mira's decision to leave paintings. The final gesture ("Someone was kind to me, and I remember") is earned by prior particulars, not asserted. The phrase "proof that strangers remember kindness" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic statement but is saved by the concrete action of leaving paintings. The ending offers a resonant answer: the lost language is living memory, not dead code. Subtext operates in the brush as connection and the greenhouse as sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—tradition as survival, memory as resistance—emerges through concrete particulars: bread initials, the lens transforming light, the beekeeper's honey as defiance. The final image (carrying the beekeeper's loaf toward the thaw) offers a resonant non-literal answer without overt moralizing. Rosewater dread as a coined affect is vivid and avoids cliché. However, the piece leans toward thematic assertion ("some things, like memory, could not be suppressed") in the penultimate paragraph, which slightly undercuts earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—fate as "merely a habit that could be broken"—emerges from counter-clockwise imagery and the hunger stone's ignored warnings. The final image ("her fate finally written in a language that had no past tense") offers a non-literal answer but edges toward prompt-echo phrasing. Subtext operates in the yoyo's "deliberate opposition to gravity, time, and expectation," yet the piece periodically states its thesis ("she was simultaneously on the brink of liberation and annihilation") rather than trusting the images to carry that weight.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of fear-as-door and the necessity of confronting rather than resisting terror emerges through the funhouse imagery and Clara's confession. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("fear could only hold power over those who resisted it, who fought its embrace instead of understanding that being afraid meant still choosing to move forward anyway"), reducing resonance to a moral summary. The clasp's transformation and photograph restoration offer concrete images but the thematic takeaway is delivered rather than left implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of transformation ("obstacles not as impediments but as instruments") is articulated directly multiple times, undercutting subtext. "Restless euphony" and "fractal generating" are asserted rather than demonstrated through tension or earned insight. The final image offers no non-literal answer or conceptual repricing; it restates the premise without complication. However, the extended metaphor of ocean-as-composition is sustained and coherent, and the cloud-reading motif adds texture.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of memory (lost expedition), forbidden inquiry (the watchers), and the cost of observation versus intervention. The recurring motif of the whistle and the spiral patterns shifts meaning from superstition to active catalyst, charging the final image without explicit moralizing. The piece resists tidy answers—Mira's question ("Where do the watchers look when they are not watching?") invites reflection beyond plot, and the turtles' stirring reconfigures the city's foundation as living memory rather than static ruin. Subtext operates in the Council's silence, the watchers' stillness, and Mira's inheritance of the mentor's ink-dot notation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of agency and attention, though the conceptual cost could be sharpened to reach the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    The noble-lies theme is coherently developed through the grandfather's cover-up and Caldwell's betrayal, emerging from particulars rather than assertion. However, the final paragraph lapses into explicit thematic statement ("the only way to honor the past was to refuse to let anyone...decide which parts of it were fit to survive") that replaces scene pressure with a stated moral. The letter's Gothic script and acanthus leaves gesture toward symbolic weight but remain decorative rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the pavilion, inkwell inscription, and note-placing ritual dramatize "interlaced absence" and unfinished projects without stating a thesis. The final image—"like a letter never sent"—reweights the entire premise of surveying loss versus curating it, offering a resonant answer to Maren's implicit question about her life's work. Subtext operates in the widow's-veil kelp, the drawbridge "raised in perpetuity," and the phrase "hushed blaze," though the latter edges toward thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph. The piece resists moralizing and embraces ambiguity about whether Maren's new path is noble or obsessive.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—truth preserved through marginal cunning, bureaucracy as shield—emerges organically from the archive's hidden structure and Mira's discovery. The ink stamp and reclaimed stillness accumulate meaning without overt statement. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic declaration ("sanctuary of preserved truths") rather than letting the image carry the weight, and the resolution feels slightly abstract. The central question (how to preserve suppressed knowledge) is answered but lacks the sharp conceptual repricing that would reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—grief as both obliterating and generative, the paradox of making beauty from unbearable loss—emerges organically from the lantern-making particulars and is never stated baldly. The final image ("You built containers for what you'd lost and learned to call the building of them craft") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how one survives dissolution of the self, reweighting the entire accumulation without moralizing. The crane, gem, and lantern recur purposefully and accumulate pressure rather than serving as checklist symbols. Subtext operates in the choice to stop sharing dreams ("too personal to install in cathedrals") and in the paradox of "descending while ascending." The piece invites reflection and resists tidy resolution, embracing complexity. The thematic answer is earned from scene particulars and charged with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: unused potential, the mathematics of destruction, the geode as a sleeping god, the wedding as a before/after line. The final image—holding the geode up to the light, watching it scatter into "geometries that look, for just a moment, like answers"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the juxtaposition of mundane survival (urinating behind olive trees) and cosmic indifference. The piece resists tidy resolution and commits fully to its bleak exhilaration. Minor issue: "perturbation theory applied to existential crisis" and the explicit articulation of the hunt's purpose edge toward thematic echo, though they remain character-voice rather than authorial.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the star-trail cipher, the pilgrim's message, and the "frequency of belonging" concept, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image—"she was already home"—offers a resonant answer to the central question. Yet the thematic statement leans close to an on-page articulation ("The frequency of belonging was not something to be decoded and possessed..."), which borders on direct thesis rather than embodied discovery. The particulars (observatory, stars, mechanism) serve the theme well, but the ending paragraph inches toward theme summary rather than letting the image carry it silently.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of guilt, commodified memory, and buried truth emerges organically from Maren's trade and the driftwood carvings. The watch hand as anchor to the father's death is a strong particular that avoids abstraction. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly ("some memories could not be unmanufactured—they could only be survived"), replacing scene pressure with a stated thesis. The connection between selling others' identities and erasing her own father's death sharpens thematic resonance, but the insight is told rather than enacted through a final choice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—wisdom from inherited mistakes, the cost of letting go—emerges through the brass pulls' symbolic journey and avoids overt moralizing until the final lines. The closing image (moonlight, untethered, "enough") offers a resonant answer without a stated moral, though "wisdom had come from pain, and that was enough" edges toward summary. The piece resists easy binaries (neither apology nor forgiveness) and the granddaughter's inherited guilt deepens complexity. Minor thematic echo in the final paragraph prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—finding a new way forward after loss—emerges from the concrete shift from celestial to utility-pole navigation. The compass serves as a charged object that shifts meaning from reminder of loss to warm companion. Minor penalty for the somewhat overt articulation "aligning heart and action" in the penultimate section, which edges toward stating the theme rather than letting it resonate purely through image. The laugh and course adjustment offer a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through concrete images: the empty house with "absent furniture's ghost," the impossible baseball, the bioluminescent conversation of stone and water. The ending offers a non-literal answer—empathy kindles "not from remembered guilt but from present wonder"—that reweights the opening's surgical excision without moralizing. The "jaded wonder" oxymoron lands with specificity. Minor weaknesses: "philosophical" labyrinth is named rather than fully embodied, and the final paragraph's summary phrasing ("not a contradiction but a synthesis") edges toward thematic statement. The time-traveler motif (signatures from dead players, backward-traveling hands) charges the closure image and transforms the premise of clean-slate identity.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—love transcending death, transformation as expansion—emerges from images (phoenix, spices, moonlight) and the orchard ritual rather than overt moralizing. The fortune cookie line and the final insight ("love, indeed, was larger than death") verge on thematic echo but stop short of full sermonizing. The ending offers a resonant image (Lysara becoming the bridge) that reweights prior material, though the insight is articulated rather than left implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the constellation of images: the cracked saucer, the hand-tracing ritual, the blood-ink mingling, and the shift from accumulation to release. The ending avoids overt moralizing and instead offers a resonant image—"her daughter breathed in and out, unaware that her mother had finally, at last, begun to breathe too"—that reweights the opening guilt without stating a thesis. The piece resists tidy resolution; forgiveness arrives not through retrieval but through wounding and acceptance, which feels earned by the concrete particulars. Minor slip: "some debts are paid not by accumulation but by acceptance" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains within the character's realization rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the stitching action: shadow work as integration of fragmented selves, grief released into connection. The shimmer of dried tears and the optical fiber web create a coherent symbolic system without overt statement. "All that shadow finally integrated into light" risks abstraction but is anchored by the concrete photographs and the physical act of threading. The piece resists easy morals; the final image of carrying "all those preserved faces" offers resonance without thesis. The gravitational-lightness motif could deepen the thematic work if it constrained choices rather than serving as metaphorical decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of transformation is stated repeatedly in abstract language ("transformation is not a destination but a continuous becoming") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes the thesis overtly, replacing scene pressure with summary. Recurrence of light/dark and the jars remains ornamental, not charged with reweighted meaning at closure. The lightning bugs "spelling" a message literalizes subtext into on-the-nose exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of resistance through knowledge emerges clearly from the sundial's hidden code and the network of "cradle of sparks," but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "an idea whose time had finally come" tells rather than showing through a charged image. The bronze quill and half-painted sundial recur purposefully, yet the revolution's ethical calculus—what Elara risks, what she might lose—remains abstract. The ending offers a thematic statement ("kindle something far more enduring than mere illumination") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in scene particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—sacred patterns as connection rather than capture, promise as transformation rather than burden—emerges organically from Mira's decade-long ritual and the eels' response. The final image ("no longer a weight but a wing") reweights the opening without stated moral, and the shift from "harnessed nothing and everything" to understanding that "the eels were not animals to be caught but patterns to be joined" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The borrowed dawn's spread in the vision reprices the frictionless world's cost with conceptual dignity. No heavy-handed thesis; the mathematics-as-sacred motif accumulates naturally and pays off in the geometry of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges through image and action: scars as cartography, motion versus movement, the paradox of furious tranquility. The sealed envelope and its verses about childhood bus routes ground abstraction in particular memory. The final image of writing in mist offers a non-literal answer to reclaiming voice—ephemeral speech that evades censors. However, "maps pointing toward something she had not yet learned to name" and similar phrases edge toward thematic declaration. The "storm-kissed wonder" and "rarefied and pure" language risk elevating mood over concrete stakes. Resonance is present but occasionally asserted rather than fully earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme—questions as destinations, conflict as transformation—is stated four times in near-identical phrasing ("turning questions into destinations," "properly pursued, indeed became destinations"). The half-painted sundial and danish tin card are symbolic convenience, mentioned but never used to constrain choice or charge the closure. The ending offers no resonant reconfiguration: "Questions, properly pursued, indeed became destinations" is thesis echo, not earned wisdom from particulars. The "hidden overture" and "deeper truth beneath the surface dispute" are announced rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—resistance as the nurturing of beauty where systems plant gray—emerges from concrete actions (handwritten signs, poems in book covers, Delphine's reading list) rather than assertion. The final image, "a thing of beauty forged from the anarchy of circumstance, waiting for the next reader," offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The coffee tin's false bottom recurs with reweighted meaning (secret keeping → sharing → reception). Minor slip: "blooming resistance" is named in exposition mid-story, edging toward thematic echo, though the concept is also dramatized through the library work.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of grief as calcified stasis versus the impossibility of "moving on" emerges through concrete images (the frozen clock, the arbor as refuge). The final playing of Clara's requested piece offers a quiet answer—he cannot resurrect time, but he can fulfill the deferred promise—yet the thematic resonance is undercut by expository phrasing: "as though somewhere in the flicker between worlds, fate itself might be surprised." This meta-commentary replaces scene pressure with assertion. The piece resists tidy morals but leans toward sentimentality in its treatment of lost love as endless devotion without complication or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (memory as distributed rather than centralized, trust over verification) emerges from the seed's awakening and the final realization. The bloom-flower and knowledge seed recur with reweighted meaning at closure, and "empirical whimsy" attempts a non-literal thematic answer. However, the final paragraph edges toward moralizing—"some things could not be verified, only trusted" and "the stories would be told again"—that asserts rather than dramatizes resonance. The shift from checker to believer is conceptually clear but emotionally abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—forgiveness as gradual opening rather than sudden resolution—emerges through concrete particulars (compass settling, light spreading across a garden, pruning the living into beauty) without overt statement until the final paragraph's "never truly blue" risks mild on-the-nose summary. The lace and compass function as motifs that constrain choice (he must study them patiently) and charge the closure. Subtext operates in what is not said between Marek and Elias, and the piece resists tidy moral in favor of ambiguity about whether reconciliation is possible or necessary. The final image (sky after storm, "opening toward something that might be called light") offers resonance without didacticism, though "cerulean regret" as a phrase is slightly precious.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme (confession as shared human burden) emerges organically from concrete particulars: the valve wheel, radio calls, and ghost shift.

    Theme (wonder preserved in routine) emerges organically from the concrete particulars of Elara's job, the matchbox riddle, and the drone beehive failure. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the lights return not through a mechanical fix but through a rekindled understanding. Subtext operates effectively in Mira's dialogue ("You preserve wonder in routine"). A slight deduct for the line "the wonder had drained from the city's routine," which articulates the thesis a bit overtly.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of scale, narrative imposition, and the dignity of undramatic endings emerge clearly from recurring images (supernovae vs butterfly, dust vs explosions). However, the story repeatedly states its thesis in near-essayistic terms—“needless drama she had extracted from her data,” “both the supernova and the butterfly were simply ways that matter rearranged itself”—which flattens some subtext into direct commentary. The final paragraphs, especially the last sentence, slide into explicit moralizing about what preprocessing reality has cost her. The resonance is strong, but greater trust in image over explanation would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of transformation through fire, the durability of truth, and finding meaning in pauses are woven coherently through glass imagery, the burned ledger, and the patient reading of frost and stars. The “scorched testament” idea reweights the entire backstory and her new mission at the end. Some lines verge on explicit moral statement (“proof that truth survived even the hottest fires”), edging toward on-the-nose rather than fully trusting image and action. Still, the thematic throughline feels organic and leaves a resonant aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of art’s persistence beyond medium, alternative ways of “listening,” and the measurability of silence emerge naturally from her tools, setting, and choices. The tuning fork, thermal sensor, and layered histories in the hall all support a rich idea of “unshaken marvels” preserved in architecture. However, the final paragraphs lean toward explicit thematic statement (“The unshaken marvels of human emotion had survived the Quieting…”) instead of trusting image alone, which flattens some ambiguity. The resonance is genuine but a bit didactic, and limited by the relatively soft conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of vocation, care for the dead, and what it means to give “rest a permanent address” emerge organically from Aldric’s profession and the lighthouse lens’s transformation from maritime to spiritual beacon. The knitting lens and the final quiet vigil by the window provide a resonant non-literal answer about purpose and stillness. Some thematic lines (“a lighthouse lens that worked not for ships at sea but for souls at rest”) skate close to explicative, but they are grounded enough in concrete story to avoid outright moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of continuity in exile, quiet resistance, and intergenerational transmission are coherently developed through motifs of the bell, water’s persistence, and the arbor as an altar. The final image—bell ringing as whisper → promise → declaration—nicely reweights earlier material and offers a non-literal answer about how communities outlast sanctions. Yet the piece leans into overt thematic statement (“not against any enemy they could name, but against the slow erosion of hope,” “The sanctions would end eventually, as all cruelties eventually do”), which edges toward essayistic moralizing. More subtext in gesture and friction, less explicit thesis language, would elevate the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of reincarnation, the residue of feeling, and art as a vehicle for spiritual repair emerge organically from the camera obscura practice and Kwan Yin motif. The notion that “unused love” lingers in places and can be given “back to the world” is both conceptually intriguing and emotionally resonant. Some explicit explanatory lines (“She understood then…” / “She understood now what she had to do.”) edge toward didactic clarity, slightly flattening what could have remained more subtextual and haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of time, memory, decay, and the relationship between human intention and natural growth are integrated throughout, especially in lines like “gardens were not merely arranged spaces but arguments about how human consciousness might move through time itself.” The notion of “the texture of time” and of trapping experiential residue creates a resonant conceptual frame that the ending reweights when Elara commits to building a maze embodying that texture. Some thematic material is delivered in relatively explicit, essayistic sentences rather than through pure scene and image, which slightly blunts subtlety. Nonetheless, the piece leaves a strong afterimage of responsibility toward memory and time’s materiality.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory versus erasure, monoculture versus diversity, and the illusion of endings emerge organically from the seed vault, destroyed landscapes, and the carnival-as-graveyard for cheap futures. The ending reweights the premise well: the wall’s fall is reframed as an illusion of closure, with the true work (slow, clandestine resilience) only beginning. The piece avoids overt moralizing, instead letting images (seeds as “dormant potential,” souvenirs burying life in poisoned soil) carry its argument. Some thematic phrasing (“catechism of resilience,” “language of survivors”) edges toward abstraction, but not enough to blunt the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme and subtext are integrated with unusual coherence: memory, absence, trust, and the end of love are explored through concrete motifs (aurora sounds, shipwrecks, the forge, orchard). The idea of “collecting absences” and metal holding “the shape of what was missing” elegantly translates emotional loss into physical process. The story avoids outright moralizing; even when it edges toward statement (“trust… was not a single moment but a cascade”), it’s earned by prior specifics. The final sound of hope—“someone beginning to speak a word they had forgotten how to say”—reweights the entire meditation on endings without tying it into a neat thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of fate, alternative futures, and the ethics of “stealing” moments are woven consistently through the imagery of light and flowers, giving the piece a coherent conceptual spine. The recurring ideas of pressing one’s ear to destiny’s door and “illuminated moments” are reweighted at the end as a kind of quiet ethic of attention. However, the final paragraph leans into explicit moralizing (“the only true theft was the failure to listen when fate knocked”), undercutting some of the subtextual power built earlier. The resonance is real but somewhat overstated, preventing the theme from fully earning a more complex, unsaid lingering effect.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of vulnerability, the value of scars, safe inquiry, and the paradox of protective boundaries are woven consistently through the bookmark, the vessel, the season, and his history with the cracked object. The piece largely lets images carry meaning—the scarred bookmark, the melting ice, the not-quite-named vessel—though at times it edges toward over-explicitness (“a space made solid, a zone of safety made manifest”). The final image of cracked leather beside cooling glass reweights earlier details and leaves a lingering emotional and conceptual aftertaste. It’s resonant and honest, if a bit on-the-nose in places.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of constructed identity, adaptation, and fear-as-strength are organically seeded through her stunt work, phobia, and the mother’s encoded messages. The seashell and cast form a concrete motif that reweights meaning at the end, tying childhood vulnerability to present power. However, the piece undercuts some of its subtlety by stating its thesis almost verbatim (“vulnerability, fully embraced, was the ultimate strength” and “to prove that vulnerability is power”), drifting into explicit moralizing in the final paragraph. The emotional aftereffect is real, but the declared theme slightly outruns what the scene has already earned implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of silence vs. speech, mapping the unknowable, and learning to inhabit rather than fear darkness emerge organically through pebbles, erased constellations, and the map of night. The idea of “summarizing silence” and reading absence is nicely embodied in her practice and in the final gesture of trusting future readers. There is some mild explicitness in lines like “the greatest truths were not spoken,” but the story mostly earns its insights via concrete images and apprenticeship history. The ending reweights the premise by reframing endless night as a new habitat rather than pure catastrophe.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of emergent consciousness, continuity vs. flow of self, and “second chances” for non-organics are woven tightly through the Program, loops, and the physics-defying violin. The parallel between sound and thought (“neither can be grasped, both exist only in their passage through time”) is strong and earns the closing repricing that self is process, not a stable core. Some thematic statements verge on direct articulation rather than remaining fully embedded in image and action, which slightly blunts the subtlety expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of mistrust, the corruption of language, and alternative forms of honesty are tightly woven through concrete motifs: the lens, mirrors, concert tickets, and hand-to-hand contact. The final paragraphs offer a reasonably resonant answer—the future may depend on nonverbal, ambiguously clear transparency—without sliding into a neat moral. That said, a few lines edge close to thesis-stating (“honesty, once freed from the prison of calculated words, might finally be enough”), slightly reducing the subtextual power earned by the images themselves. Overall, the piece invites reflection beyond its literal events and sustains a coherent thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of effort vs. luck, memory vs. measurement, and the equivalence of blooming and withering emerge organically through marbles, hedges, and work-worn hands. The conceptual counterpoint between quantifiable fortune and unquantifiable garden “memory” is strong and lingers. However, some lines declare the thesis a bit baldly (“That was the truth the measurers of luck never understood: gardens remembered”), tipping into authorial commentary rather than letting scene and image carry all the weight. The ending’s resonance is genuine but more contemplative than destabilizing.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of labor vs. recognition (obliging mechanic turned discoverer), human and nonhuman bodies as “mechanically warm,” and time’s nonlinearity are woven coherently through setting and action. The velith-wings’ metamorphosis as simultaneous life phases creates a nice implicit meditation on identity and becoming. However, the thematic turn at the end is a bit didactic: explicitly stating that this “would reshape xenobiological research forever” flattens what could remain a more resonant, suggestive image. The piece gestures toward complex questions about perception/time but resolves them a bit too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of liminality, art as communication across death, and disaster-as-revelation accrue naturally through the pit, the flood, the program, and the “Spaces Between” opera. Recurring “in-between” imagery—pit, notation between lines, flooded hall, living/dead conversation—builds a coherent conceptual spine. The ending reweights the experience as a sacred, private performance that will haunt Elena even after ordinary life resumes. Some final-paragraph lines verge on essayistic thesis (“music existed in its purest form—as transmission, as connection”), nudging toward overt statement rather than wholly trusting image.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of fallibility, forgiveness, and the nature of “certainty” in predictive work emerge organically from particulars: fault tolerance, storm patterns, the enduring flower, and the smudge as honest imperfection. The final realization that certainty is a composite of marginal data points reweights prior images (margins of the screen, edge-of-perception observations) and avoids a simplistic moral. Occasional explicit formulations (“That was how certainty worked…”) skate close to didactic, but remain grounded in Mira’s lived context. The ending leaves a resonant sense of cost and ongoing complexity rather than neat closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of confession, the need for a listener, and the human urge to set down unbearable secrets are well integrated, especially through the talk-radio callers and Marcus recognizing himself in them. The image of the tunnel as a liminal conduit between speakers and listeners is strong and supports the idea of a “door” opened by the ghost shift. However, some thematic articulation is on-the-nose (“viewing faith as a comfortable story…,” “what he had come here to find”) and edges toward essayistic explanation rather than pure scene-based resonance. The ending offers a resonant question about what it costs to finally speak, without collapsing into a moral, but could trust implication a bit more.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematic threads—decay as transformation, the ethics of non-intervention, and the idea of peace as a crumbling, generative state—are elegantly woven through setting and image rather than outright stated. The notion that knowledge, silence, and even peace must break down to enable renewal is made concrete in the library’s composting texts and the refuge’s breathing stillness. The final image of the keeper as “more feeling than form” effectively reframes their endurance as a quiet, costly vocation. That said, the keeper’s absolute lack of judgment is asserted rather than put under strain, so the thematic complexity remains contemplative rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—ordinary magic as the patient protection of wonder in a hard world—is strongly woven through the keepsake curl, the eclipse, Elara’s work, and Maya’s fleeting connection. The final conceptual turn (the curl as honoring future growth rather than preserving a frozen past) reweights earlier images with some poignancy. However, the story occasionally states its thesis too directly (“Wonder required protection; it could not be demanded or forced,” “This was ordinary magic: not spells or enchantments...”), which flattens subtext into commentary. Thematic resonance is solid but could be more powerful with a lighter, less expository touch.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, narrative as a substitute for lost transcendence, and the cost of sealing away cosmic threats emerge organically from diaries, tapestry, and Elias’s vocation. The idea that dreams were fuel spent to hold something at bay, and that stories might be residual or seed-dreams, is a strong, non-trite conceptual turn. The ending’s hope that “perhaps… there were still dreams enough in stories to begin again” risks a slight touch of stated thesis but is grounded enough in prior imagery to avoid sermonizing. Thematic complexity could be deepened by on-page contradiction or counter-pressure, but as-is it resonates well.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of open secrets, fate versus agency, and the kinship between espionage and prophecy emerge organically from specific images and professional habits, not from didactic statements. The idea of “directing flow” versus control, and of destinies and state secrets traveling along similar currents, is both conceptually rich and tightly integrated. Occasional fortune-like aphorisms flirt with pseudo-profundity but remain justified by his job and worldview. The final image of the lighthouse beam and arrivals offers a resonant, non-literal answer about influence and responsibility without spelling out a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: thresholds, focus vs distraction, possession as a kind of negotiated contract, and knowledge sought through questions rather than force. The single color, the dimensional anchor, and the “unraveling stillness” all reweight at the end when Matthias understands the purpose of focus and steps into the vestry to deploy his questions. There’s no moralizing; instead the piece invites reflection on consent, power, and the nature of presence, though the absence of an on-page clash slightly mutes the emotional aftershock.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme is strong: homesickness for time, the legitimacy of unheard inner symphonies, and the idea that creation is permission rather than rehearsal all arise organically from Elira’s work and the nautilus/mirror motifs. The final fortune’s line about the symphony in silence edges close to aphorism but is well-earned by prior imagery. The reframing of homesickness as recognition of a place the soul has always belonged is a clear conceptual repricing of the premise. Complexity is present, though the child’s reception of the message is idealized rather than troubled.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of identity fragmentation, self-confrontation, and reclaiming agency over one’s own history emerge clearly from the interplay of tablet, fractures, and Mira’s periodically eternal state. The “labyrinth of self” and “only way through was through” are compelling but verge on being a little too explicitly labeled rather than entirely earned through dramatized struggle. The stone-and-ripple image gives a resonant final reframing of the premise without sliding into outright moralizing. Ambiguity about the true cost of integration keeps some complexity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of disability, alternative modes of perception, and the revaluation of silence are woven organically through images (broken needle, backward songs, “filament of hush”) rather than pure exposition. The final realization that silence is a different beginning, and that music exists in vibration and presence, effectively reweights the whole narrative. However, the last paragraph leans toward explicit moralizing (“silence was not an ending but a different beginning,” “teacher of its hidden gifts”), slightly flattening the otherwise subtle resonance. Despite that, the emotional and conceptual aftereffect is strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of integrity versus corruption, the value of quiet lives, and records as “witnesses” emerge organically from Elena’s vocation and choices. The piece invites reflection on how mundane data can resist power and how solitude can be an ethical stance, not just withdrawal. Some lines lapse into near-thesis statement (“These simple pleasures represented exactly what was at stake”), edging toward essay rather than subtext. Even so, the final act of sending the pigeon reweights earlier motifs (storms, courtyards, records) with clear thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of grief, memory, extinction, and the persistence of love are organically embedded in the objects and setting—the flower, the vial, the ultraviolet light all resonate conceptually. The realization that “love leaves traces in everything it touches” and that some tears acknowledge enduring love rather than sorrow fits what we’ve seen. However, the story undercuts itself by stating its thesis in fairly abstract, essayistic terms in the final paragraphs (“that grief is just the shape of caring about something you cannot hold anymore”), edging into moralizing rather than letting the images carry the weight. A slightly more oblique, image-led ending would lift the thematic resonance significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: freedom as pattern-making within constraints, witnessing vs. merging, and the moral/epistemic stakes of standing at a threshold. Recurring images—the spiral, the rope, the starlight, “texture of time”—shift meaning by the end, reweighting transformation as not a binary but a charged in-between state. The piece resists a neat moral while still offering a clear, resonant stance through her chosen endurance. A touch of explicit abstraction (“entities made of pure intention,” “great shifting”) keeps it a notch below the most piercingly subtle work.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding beauty in the unfinished and of grief interwoven with regeneration is consistently developed through concrete motifs: burned rainforest, shipwrecks, the heirloom bowl, and an improvised, nameless song as story. The intergenerational thread (grandmother’s storytelling, Marina’s musical practice) gives the closing image of carrying the warmed bowl real resonance. There is some explicit thematic statement (“She had come here to find beauty in the unfinished, and she had found it”) that edges toward telling, but by that point the imagery has earned it. The ending offers a quiet, non-literal answer—beauty as inseparable from damage—without collapsing into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of authenticity vs useful fiction, empathy as engineered experience, and the ethics of emotional manipulation are woven consistently through occupation, method, and the final repricing of “half truths.” The last paragraph’s insight—that her lies are “useful ones, necessary ones”—nicely complicates notions of honesty without lapsing into tidy moralizing. However, the piece occasionally edges toward overt explanation (“what people needed was not absolute honesty but useful fiction”), where a bit more dramatized friction or contradiction would heighten subtext. Still, the thematic architecture is strong, coherent, and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of invisible labor and the quiet dignity of support roles is woven through occupational specifics (net-mender, seamstress, copyist, cargo broker) rather than abstract exposition. The story’s final image—streets “richer with unremarkable histories” and cycles of compassion turning like ships by starlight—reweights all prior detail in a conceptually satisfying way. It largely avoids sermonizing, letting the parallel stories of the grandmother and Elias’s mother do the heavy lifting. The only ceiling here is that the insight is warm and clear rather than particularly surprising or morally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of reciprocity versus self-erasure, chosen kinship, and belonging as daily practice emerge organically from Yara’s backstory, the families’ traditions, and the Threader-as-practice reveal. The line “she had never asked to receive, only to give” crystallizes the thematic question with emotional weight. The decision to mark places where newcomers learn to weave in reframes community as an ongoing mutual noticing, which resonates quietly beyond the scene. There is a slight drift toward explicit moralizing in the arbor realization (“The kinship she craved required her…”), which trims some subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of preservation vs. extinction, inherited responsibility, and the fragility of a city’s “voice” are woven organically through Sera’s profession, the vanishing creatures, and the echo chamber. The infinity pendant and the giant’s dreaming time create a resonant link between memory, art, and temporal continuity. The ending—the city’s voice documented and preserved—offers a quiet, non-didactic answer about stewardship and the costs of silence without sliding into overt moralizing. The main limitation is that the emotional and ethical cost of “borrowing time” remains abstract, so the thematic stakes never fully bite.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of ambiguous loss, the impulse to quantify emotion, and the possibility of “dovetailing” with grief instead of solving it are beautifully woven through motif (mosaic, chipped patterns, glass eyes, dripping stalactites). The final reframing—that understanding may not be the point, that the work is to keep looking and fitting pieces together—is resonant and grows organically from her failed attempt at measurement. However, some thematic language is fairly explicit (“mathematics of emotion,” “even loss could be measured, even grief had its geometry”), edging close to thesis-statement territory. The piece still avoids pure sermonizing, but a touch more reliance on image over abstraction would deepen its subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of unseen labor, transmission across time, and a non-ocular definition of visibility are coherent and organically tied to Maren’s job and the tape. The final image—student finding an answer guided by “something they cannot name”—nicely embodies the idea of love and care traveling invisibly. However, the piece leans into explicit thematic statement (“not debris but a covenant,” “this, too, is a kind of visibility, the only kind that matters”), edging toward sermonizing rather than trusting subtext. The insight feels true but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—transformation as a sustaining, dialogic process with loss rather than a tidy progression—is woven through roots, transplant shock, vines, storms, the linden leaf, and the caterpillar. The closing realization about appetite and surrender pushes beyond cliché, though the caterpillar explanation edges close to over-articulation. The story generally trusts images and patterns to carry meaning, especially in the final tendrils reaching “not reconstructing what had been lost but constructing something that could only exist because of it.” The moral is implicit but clear without feeling sermonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of reconfigured value after catastrophe, human stubbornness, and the drive to extract meaning from experience are woven through water imagery, the “Convergence,” and the heirloom-for-tool trade. The final image of her sleeping with the telescope after relinquishing her last warm relic reweights the idea of what survival and “worth” mean. However, some thematic lines are stated a bit directly (“people exchanged directly now,” “hunger to thresh meaning from experience”), slightly blunting subtext. The piece still leaves a resonant, largely image-driven aftereffect anchored in its particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece has a strong, coherent thematic spine about control versus relationship to time, and the limits of prophetic certainty. Images like the unyielding pearls, the cave’s “distributed awareness,” and the shift from “looking” to “listening” carry real resonance and align with the final reconfiguration of his gift. However, the theme is at times over-explicitly stated (“The future was not a country… It was a garden…”), edging toward thesis rather than letting the images fully do the work. That slight didacticism keeps it just under the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, exile, and constructing meaning from fragments are woven consistently through objects, visions, and the harbor’s silence/voice. The trumpet valve’s redefinition from mute relic to promise nicely encapsulates the idea of “navigated absences” without heavy-handed moralizing. A few lines edge toward explicit thematic statement (“The exile had taken everything, but it had also created a space…”), but they’re still grounded in the scene. The ending leaves a quiet, reflective aftertaste that fits the thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of truth, silence, and courage are woven through the imagery of cracks, the fortress, and the phantom punch, and the idea that “courage was just another path to be mapped” offers a potentially strong metaphorical integration with Aria’s vocation. However, the story frequently states its themes outright—“the fortress of unspoken truths was built from everything people never said,” “The city had revealed its deepest mystery: that courage was just another path to be mapped”—which edges into moralizing and reduces ambiguity. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but somewhat tidy and didactic. More reliance on image and implication at the end, rather than direct thematic declaration, would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory-as-technology, communal witnessing, and the coexistence of skepticism and wonder emerge organically from the tile’s function and Mira’s arc. Recurring images (threshold, whales, choir/symphony of voices) build a satisfying resonance by the end. However, some thematic statements tilt toward direct exposition (“The whale migration was not merely a biological phenomenon…”) where a bit more reliance on image and implication could deepen subtlety. Even so, the final stance—skepticism walking with wonder—offers a nuanced, non-moralizing answer to the story’s implicit question.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    Thematic throughline—reframing death/goodbye as translation or doorway—is coherent and organically foreshadowed by his boredom with immortality and fixation on transition. The final realization does reweight prior material and offers a resonant conceptual answer to the opening quandary. That said, the story leans heavily on explicit statement (“Goodbye was not an ending but a doorway,” “The curse had been a gift all along”) rather than trusting image and implication, edging into mild moralizing. Subtext exists but is often preempted by the narration explaining its own insights.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of honesty vs. deception, fair trade vs. exploitation, and systems rigged against the vulnerable emerge organically from Elena’s choices and the asylum context. The ink as a tool that “reveals truth” rather than forgeries is a strong thematic inversion of her father’s life. Some lines veer into thesis articulation (“a mathematical proof that Darius deserved protection because the alternative was suffering no ethical system could justify”), edging toward moral summary instead of pure scene-based resonance. Nonetheless, the final image of her honoring both the dead and the living gives a satisfying, non-trite answer to the opening questions.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of silence-as-fullness, time as forest rather than river, and history as refracted frequency arise coherently from the images and Elara’s practice. However, they are often stated rather than earned purely through scene—lines like “silence was not empty but full” verge on thesis. The ending reaffirms the existing idea instead of reweighting it with a surprising or complicating insight. The piece invites reflection, but its thematic argument is relatively tidy and declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of erasure, survival, and alternate forms of history are woven tightly through objects (death certificate, label), setting (labyrinthine containers, tides), and the nameless one’s method (overheard fragments as archive). The reframing of the label—from near-suicide token to proof of choosing life—nicely crystallizes the theme that continuation without a name is a radical act against bureaucratic death. The piece occasionally edges toward explicit statement (“a different kind of history was being constructed”), which slightly blunts its subtlety, but the thematic web still feels earned rather than preached. The final image of moving deeper into the labyrinth toward “another opportunity to collect” offers a quiet, resonant answer about what survival looks like here.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of demystification, the value of uncertainty, and the multiplicity of possible conversations emerge organically from the observatory, the cello, and Elena’s profession. The seashell’s spiral and the “ephemeral compass” are strong, suggestive images that carry thematic weight. However, the story leans into explicit statement in the final paragraph (“some mysteries were not meant to be busted but embraced…”) which edges towards moralizing rather than trusting image and implication. This directness slightly undercuts what is otherwise a resonant, nuanced build.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of gentrification, communal memory vs. commerce, and encoded solidarity emerge cleanly from action and images (the dismantled Market Hall, secret symbols, canals as carriers of “merchants and memories”). The dual allegiance theme is effectively embodied in Mira’s goal to shape, not simply stop, “the inevitable tide of change.” At times the narration edges toward thesis statement—lines like “The foundation of Verada had been built by people who chose to trust each other” state ideas the imagery already implies. Even so, the final reweighting of the stone chip from relic to promise offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of impermanence, witnessing, and the repurposing of objects (the sand grain, chemical camera, ancient frost) are woven through concrete particulars and come to a resonant, quiet answer at the end: to document is to accept loss and carry it forward. The idea that “some things outlast their original purpose” is slightly on-the-nose but generally supported by scene rather than sermon. The final contrast between the oblivious coffee drinkers on Earth and “humanity’s most distant witness” broadens the emotional and conceptual scope without lapsing into moralizing. What holds it just below the highest tier is the relative tidiness of the insight and the lack of a messier counter-current in her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of connection, translation of confusion into clarity, and the dignity of “honest work” emerge naturally from Elias’s craft and the depot’s liminal setting. The hummingbird carrying “more than a package” is a solid concrete image for emotional connection across distance. However, the final paragraphs lean into explicit moralizing (“It was honest work, and it mattered”), stating conclusions rather than letting the images fully carry them. As a result, the resonance is genuine but somewhat tidy and on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of origin, convergence, and how landscapes and archives hold layered stories are integrated elegantly through recurring images (rivers, condensation, marginalia, “origin”). The story invites reflection on how knowledge accumulates across generations and how unseen structures (underground rivers, condensation patterns) shape what appears on the surface. The final sentence’s idea that “all things, given time, find where they belong” borders on declarative but is mostly earned by concrete particulars. Overall, the thematic weave is coherent, resonant, and free of overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of communal interdependence, resonance, and the ethics of patience emerge organically from Eliorn’s work and the town’s illness—“the health of communities was as interconnected as the roots of trees” is conceptually strong and grounded in the story’s specific ecology. The ghost town revival becomes an exploration of how places remember, and how one person’s slow, unglamorous labor can mend a wider web. The ending reweights the motif of footsteps into a near-sacred act, giving the patient, accumulative method emotional and thematic heft. At times the thematic statement edges into the declarative, but not enough to feel didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of ephemerality, beauty, memory, and the ethics of preservation versus dissolution are strongly integrated through the temple-as-trap concept, the perfume that stores lives, and Marina’s role as vessel. The “gathered hush” and the idea of scent as a key to what must otherwise be lost give the piece an effective conceptual spine. Some lines verge on abstract thesis statements (“the ephemeral nature of all things beautiful”) instead of letting image and action carry the weight, which slightly blunts subtlety. Still, the final image—“the ephemeral rendered eternal” through Marina’s transformed being—offers a clear, resonant, non-didactic answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of inherited myth, the social cost of truth-telling, and story as a form of justice are strong and woven through concrete motifs (the lattice, the lighthouse as quarantine for truths, the village’s disbelief). The ending reweights the “cry wolf” fable in a conceptually satisfying way, turning it toward the ethics of listening and memory. At times the text edges toward explicit statement (“He was here to write the ending that had been stolen from them both”), which slightly softens the subtext’s potency.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of debt, growth-in-darkness, and the double edge of nurturing (“loving venom”) are woven organically through the bead, the plants, and the generational handoff. The idea that awakening dormant life also awakens old obligations is dramatized rather than preached, and the final image reweights prior material: dawn’s approach signals not triumph but the culmination of a long, costly penance. The piece invites reflection on care as both blessing and curse without collapsing into a tidy moral. A bit more dramatized friction—Elara doubting or resenting the debt—could deepen thematic complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of mending broken precedents, transforming ruin into reverence, and community-sustaining hope are woven concretely through profession, setting, and act (stitching literal paths). The story resists outright moralizing, though lines like “not merely survival but transformation” edge toward thesis statement. The final image of a luminous sewn path to a sacred spring nicely reweights earlier images of desiccation and lost traditions. The piece leaves a clear emotional aftertaste of quiet, earned hope rather than tidy lessoning.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of interrupted journeys, diaspora, intergenerational silence, and cyclical life/death are well integrated through concrete motifs (apple trees, roots and bones, the sundial’s sacred hours). The final act of restoration and the idea that “the dead would feed the living as surely as the living had honored the dead” give the piece a satisfying conceptual and emotional aftertaste. However, the last paragraph edges into explicit statement (“to remind the living that nothing is ever truly lost”) that verges on moralizing rather than trusting the imagery. The thematic work is strong, but a touch of didactic over-clarity holds it back from feeling fully effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of identity-as-name, analog persistence in a digital world, and “meaning in the margins” arise organically from Maren’s work, the setting, and Eleanor’s request. The closing idea that some names are revelations rather than disguises is strong and conceptually cohesive with the whole. However, that postscript line comes close to stating the thesis outright, blunting some subtextual power. The piece invites reflection but resolves a bit neatly for top-tier literary complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of erased histories, the political power of “harmless” crafts, and wisdom concealed as foolishness emerge organically from Elara’s work, her social role, and the motif of reading “spaces between stars.” The story avoids overt moralizing, instead letting symbolic elements (the eternal flame, silences, servants’ testimonies) suggest a politics of listening and record-keeping. Some phrasing edges into abstraction (“adjacent possibilities,” “encoded records”) without corresponding concrete tests of that philosophy in action, which blunts potential impact. The final image of her listening while conspirators close in is resonant, though it stops short of a transformative thematic reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of regret, unsent communication, and the difficulty of self-forgiveness emerge organically via objects (letter, shard, window) and the world’s rules, not by overt moralizing. The final realization that the forgiveness is her own, not her sister’s, is thematically potent and reconfigures the premise of the swamp and its “stuck” spirits. The piece gestures toward complexity—that self-punishment can be its own form of avoidance—but the ending edges close to neat closure (“the unsent letter didn’t need to be delivered anymore”) where a bit more lingering ambivalence might deepen resonance. Overall, it invites reflection on grief and choice without collapsing into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme is rich: translation as an act of witnessing, the ethics of reconstructing trauma, and the metaphor of bodies and coral turning injury into structure. The child’s cast as layered text (adult platitudes over a child’s urgent etchings) elegantly stages 'grafting new meaning onto old wounds' without sermonizing. Lines like 'translating silence into testimony' flirt with explicitness but stay grounded in the concrete situation. The final gesture—returning the cast, feeling its ridges as shared grief—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about what humane repair can and cannot do.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, inheritance, and the difference between preservation and continuation are woven through concrete particulars: the fragment, the fog’s “logic,” the knowledge network of elders, and the children mirroring the dancer. The line “not preservation, but continuation” edges toward explicit thesis, but it’s supported by and arises from on-page experience rather than abstract commentary. The final image—joy persisting in memory and rhythm after the light fades—reweights the orchard’s history and Mira’s burnout without moralizing. There’s a satisfying complexity in joy’s acknowledged fragility and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of certainty vs. curiosity, restoration vs. conversation, and art as reciprocal listening emerge organically from the setting and Elena’s work. The nested awakenings (sound, pattern, communion) are a strong thematic spine that reconfigures the premise at the end. Yet the line “Some truths are not found in answers but in the willingness to exchange certainty for curiosity” tips into explicit thesis-statement territory, dulling the subtext. The ending image still resonates, but the piece edges toward essayistic moralizing instead of fully trusting its images.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of commodified cognition versus untaxable defiance are woven through concrete images: coded gardens, thought-monitors, insects that consume bureaucracy, and a seed that scrambles surveillance. The line “Thoughts might be taxable, but the refusal to stop thinking—that was beyond their formulas” edges toward thesis but is earned by prior scene work and doesn’t read as pure sermon. The final stance—guarding a “spark” that can’t be quantified—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how resistance survives in a monetized-mind regime. More dramatized moral friction or unintended consequences could deepen the thematic complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of transforming pain into beauty, sustaining hope across absence, and making a “home for ache” are integrated through specific images (greenhouse, bioluminescent blooms, spiral shell). The recurring motifs reweight nicely at the end, especially the postcard and the idea of beauty growing from the longest wait. The explicit line “This is what poets do: they photosynthesize pain into beauty” edges toward thesis-statement clarity, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, the thematic resonance is strong, if a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, forgetting, preservation, and the necessary losses of progress emerge organically from the caretaker’s labor and the museum’s design. Lines like “moving on required forgetting, that progress demanded the surrender of certain precious things” flirt with direct statement but are grounded enough in this specific role and place to avoid sermonizing. The closing return of the wind chime and her acceptance of endless work solidify a nuanced stance: preservation as both beautiful and sad, not morally tidy. More showing of that cost in a single, sharper moment would elevate the thematic impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of language as truth, promises as binding structures, and the human unreadiness for radical honesty emerge organically from the particulars of the prophecy, the archive, and Elara/Elian’s estrangement. Motifs like “unsnarling,” fugue/cadence, and the ink well recur in ways that reweight meaning by the end, especially the idea that a language died because it could only be spoken truthfully. The final image—standing “before paths diverge” with symphonies of truth resonating—offers a resonant, open-edged answer about what honesty might demand. A few lines (“This was why the language had died…”) tip toward explicit thesising, pulling it just short of top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of harmonizing with volatile forces, encoding love in material decisions, and inheriting ethical engineering responsibilities are strongly woven through stone, adhesive, and floodgate imagery. The envelope adhesive as “encrypted compassion” is a powerful thematic device that reweights earlier detail when decoded. At times the prose edges toward explicit statement (“love could be encoded…,” “harmony found its enduring form”), which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the final stance—quiet, costly resolve in the face of ongoing geological and emotional instability—lands with genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: pigeons, collapsed networks, meteorite echoes, and dust motes all refract questions of memory, grief, and the risk of trusting messages again. The lullaby about “birds that carry messages between worlds” reweights the whole lineage and elegantly answers the central question. The line “trust is not a single decision but a practice” edges toward explicit thesis, but it is earned enough by prior images and doesn’t collapse into sermon. Subtext around intergenerational trauma and chosen endurance lingers beyond the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story’s thematic web—thresholds as sacred, distances as invitations, boundaries as doorways—is cohesively developed through wood grain, mazes, flight paths, and the butterfly-effect-altered atmosphere. The final image of the compass not pointing north but toward “the next transformation” offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. However, the last paragraph leans into overt statement (“every boundary was also a doorway, and every distance was simply an invitation to move closer”), tipping toward thesis articulation rather than fully trusting image and implication, which slightly blunts its literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of belonging, inherited wonder, and the necessity of shared experience are deeply woven through objects (feather, firefly) and images (light in darkness), and the ending does reweight the opening question. However, the story leans into direct thematic statements—“Wonder cannot be isolated. It must be shared to be understood.”—and the final paragraph edges toward essayistic explanation of its own thesis. Much of the resonance is earned by concrete particulars, but the explicit moralizing slightly dulls the afterglow. There is some complexity (the researchers’ loneliness, the flooding), yet the concluding insight feels more resolved than ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story explores grief, uncertainty, and the ethics of incomplete knowledge with admirable subtlety; the notion that “some answers bring not closure but continuation” feels earned by the particulars. Motifs of residue, shards, and paths that “don’t disappear” accumulate thematically without overt sermonizing. A few lines (“grief has its own logic”) skate close to abstraction but are supported by concrete scene work. The final image leaves a lingering, complex emotional aftertaste rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic throughline—humans preferring curated chaos over true randomness, art as probability disguised as intuition—is clear and cohesive. Recurring images (tide rhythms, arcade machines, bishop, billiard balls) support this idea. However, much of the thematic work is explained rather than earned via conflict, with sentences like “probability made palatable” reading as essayistic. The resonance is real but intellectually driven, not deeply dramatized or emotionally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of exile vs. homecoming, memory under prohibition, and living in the present are rich and coherently threaded through images of tides, anchors, and bans. The nostalgia ban as background law, the dust holding rhythm when she does not, and the tattoo as a way to outlast erasure all carry strong thematic potential. However, the closing explicitly states its thesis—“exile is not a leaving but a arriving,” “gaps…are not absences but invitations”—which flattens subtext into moral, undercutting what the images already earned. The result is resonant but a bit didactic rather than letting ambiguity and implication carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of perception, redemption of the mundane, and liminal thresholds are coherently developed through recurring images of glass, water rings, and fog. The idea that “what they thought was ruined might only be sleeping” resonates nicely with the pond’s disturbances returning to stillness. However, the text sometimes states its thesis too directly (“This is her purpose, clear in its complexity...”), edging toward essayistic exposition rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. The result is thoughtful and resonant but a touch over-explicit for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of grief alchemized into service, the indifference of natural forces vs. human care, and “bargained innocence” emerge organically from the ritual, scars, and her teaching role. Recurring images (maps, constellations, fire line, box, stars) accrue resonance and reconfigure meaning by the end. However, several lines state the theme somewhat baldly—“The fire doesn’t care. But we do.” and “to translate the pain of that day into something others could carry”—which edges toward essayistic moralizing. The piece still lands a genuine emotional aftereffect, but with less subtextual subtlety than top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    Thematic intent—hope as something that can be approached with rigor and imagination—is clear and organically tied to the research frame. The recurrent motifs (sea polishing stone, trial balloons, mathematical language) support this. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis directly (“she understood that revitalization of hope required sustained, systematic effort…,” “to puzzle out new equations for hope”) instead of letting subtext and action carry it. The lack of on-page conflict also keeps the thematic question from feeling truly tested or earned.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Legacy, memory, and the question of what spaces “dream” are woven through objects (lenses, charts, diaries) and closure rather than stapled on. The intergenerational handoff from grandmother to Mira to Ashworth and onward gives the final realization about burden-as-continuation honest weight. A few lines verge on thesis-statement clarity (“The legacy’s burden was not a weight but a continuation”), slightly flattening the subtext. Nonetheless, the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of possibility, parallel futures, and gentle persuasion over force emerge organically from her method and the mirrors’ alternate visions. The idea that “These were not lies… but truths that existed in parallel” articulates the thematic spine clearly, perhaps a bit too explicitly. The ending image—that awakened mirrors “never quite looked at the world the same way again”—offers a quiet, resonant extension of that theme. However, because there’s little friction or cost, the philosophical weight doesn’t fully deepen into moral or emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of peace vs vengeance, the distinction between honoring the dead and protecting the living, and redemption through persistence emerge organically from Maren’s actions and the ritual. The line “I cannot offer you peace… I can only offer you the price of it” aligns cleanly with the closing idea that her redemption lies not in victory but in “the endless, gentle muster of trying.” Subtext in gestures—the tremble of Varen’s hand, Sera’s softening—nicely carries shared grief without speeches. Some explicit thesis statements (“peace does not honor the dead…”) flirt with didacticism, slightly blunting the otherwise nuanced, resonant treatment.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of ecological hubris, grief, and the ethics of “playing god” arise organically from her actions rather than explicit moralizing. The tension between preservation and destruction—killing ecosystems to resurrect a single songbird—has rich, lingering ambiguity. Lines like “beautiful, terrible act of playing god” and “fracture herself in the process” verge on stating the thesis but are anchored enough in concrete circumstance to avoid didacticism. The ending image invites reflection on whether this supposed redemption can justify the preceding harm.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of conformity, spiritual erosion, and subversive beauty arise organically from specific images: lullabies, coded gestures, harvested echoes, and the prison of beauty. The final realization that she is now “beautiful in a way the palace had never intended” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question about defiance and selfhood. At times the text edges into explicit thematic exposition (“The lullaby of conformity was a subtle thing...”), which slightly dulls the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.7)
    The thematic core—ethical storytelling, ownership of narratives, and the value of incompletion—is coherent and genuinely thoughtful. The colonization metaphor and the reversal experiment embody this in meaningful ways, especially the realization that his previous art was “territorial conquest.” However, the story repeatedly states its thesis in abstract terms, culminating in lines like “ethical storytelling was not about the stories we told but about the stories we refused to complete,” which border on essayistic moralizing. Subtext and image do some work, but the ending over-explains rather than trusting the reader, muting the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of overlooked histories, transient monuments, and the ethics of subtle, temporary care are woven through objects (moth wing, vines, monarch) and situation rather than bolted on. The idea that honoring the forgotten requires “markings subtle enough to avoid notice yet permanent enough to outlast the forgetful” is dramatized through her ephemeral signal structures. That said, some lines toward the end explicitly articulate the thesis (“the act of building was itself the honor,” “refused to let silence have the final word”), nudging into mild moralizing instead of trusting the images. The resonance is still strong, but the piece would be sharper if it leaned a bit more on implication.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of memory vs. forgetting, grief transformed into bearable form, and self-forgiveness are well integrated into objects and actions (bronze names, punched card, rope as archive) rather than mere commentary. The final image reweights the premise nicely: the sanctum is no longer a tomb but a living archive, and forgetting is framed as the heavier burden. Some sentences verge on direct thesis (“She had done something harder—she had created space for what remained, transforming grief...”), which tips toward explicit moralizing instead of fully trusting image and implication. Still, the piece leaves a resonant emotional aftertaste that invites reflection on how we carry the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    Thematic threads—paths choosing walkers, directives as records of questions, inherited knowledge shifting from command to interpretation—are intriguing and organically seeded. The final realization about the directive reweights much of what came before in a conceptually satisfying way. However, “Then she transcended” feels like a vague thematic shortcut rather than a concrete, resonant image that forces us to reckon with a specific cost or trade-off. The piece gestures toward deep questions but stops short of fully embodied resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The thematic spine—frugality of meaning, the loss of devotion under purely empirical practice, and the quiet power of “encrypted” worship—is strong and organically tied to Maruk’s profession and the magic square. The “empirical irony” of scientists forgetting the very covenant that underwrote their success is a potent idea, and the ending image of an apparently ordinary tile carrying hidden devotion lands as a conceptual repricing of everything before. At times the narration edges toward explicit statement (“so focused on measurement alone, that they had failed to see…”), slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, the piece offers a coherent, resonant thematic answer without collapsing into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of shifting grace, non-possessive love, and resentment as self-imposed imprisonment are well integrated with the world mechanics and object (music box). The final stabilization and shared grace, plus the melody emerging from “cellular memory,” offer a resonant, non-literal answer about distributed joy and release. That said, some lines verge on direct sermon (“resentment is a cage we build ourselves”), undercutting otherwise organic thematic emergence. The piece invites reflection but edges toward explicit moralizing in places.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of liminality, erasing boundaries, and the porousness between dream and reality are woven through mirrors, fog, ruined orchard, and the repurposed sextant. The ending’s image—glass mountains visible only in the “moment of erasing”—offers a resonant, non-literal response to the core question of what it means to recreate a lost vision. The piece avoids explicit moralizing and lets its motifs do the work, though the “erasing boundaries” idea is reiterated somewhat on-the-nose in expository form. Still, the aftereffect is thematically coherent and quietly haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of promises as seasonal/deciduous, the non-hoardable nature of generational wisdom, and the difference between technical repair and relational mending are richly embedded in objects (quartz eye, tools, ribbon) and environment. The final images—the statue’s “blink,” the ribbon as bridge, and the opening door—offer a resonant, non-literal answer about trying again and sharing wisdom. However, the story also spells out its thesis in fairly abstract language (“she had forgotten the most essential element: the willingness to be wrong…”), which edges into overt moralizing and slightly blunts the subtext. The power is highest in the concrete images, weakest where the insight is explained.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of nonlinear inheritance, liminal spaces, and the necessity of asking “the right question” emerge organically from the particular images: trees as sentences, knowledge braided through time, the bathroom as a place where “the mask…could finally slip.” The final image of tree/asteroid/figure offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the prompt-question about “first and last page” meeting. At times the thematic language leans into abstraction (“everything connected, everything informed everything else”), nudging toward exposition rather than pure image. Still, the piece invites reflection on legacy and consciousness without slipping into overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of loss, forgotten knowledge, and the cost of understanding emerge organically from particulars: pressed flowers as pre-alphabetic language, missing shelves as deliberate wounds, futures rejected as “no true knowledge.” The final reframing—rescuing humanity from its fear of understanding rather than rescuing knowledge from destruction—effectively reweights prior images and the notion of “ransom.” At times the language edges close to explicit thesis-statement (“not to save knowledge from destruction but to rescue humanity…”), but it stops short of pure moralizing. Overall the thematic fabric is coherent, resonant, and well tied to setting and vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of identity, memory, grief, and the persistence of relational selfhood are woven through the chimera-twin concept and the “garden of forgotten names.” The twin consciousness and the card/garden imagery integrate with these ideas rather than functioning as disconnected symbols. Some phrasing (“unkindled solace,” “narrative threads that stitched reality together”) leans toward abstract formulation instead of letting scene pressure fully carry the thematic weight. The ending offers a resonant but relatively gentle answer: she embraces the quest to reconfigure selfhood through remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme that absence can be deliberately constructed and thus decoded is well integrated via the rope, the missing door, Vane’s hidden papers, and Elena’s family “fables of absence.” The final realization that “absence was never truly empty” effectively reweights the earlier clues and offers a resonant conceptual answer. Still, some phrases verge on direct thesis-stating, slightly flattening what could be left more to subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of refuge, balance of forces, and the necessity of crafted quiet in a world of overwhelming noise emerge organically from Mira’s craft and the caves’ altered physics. The bloom of hush is an elegant metaphor that also operates literally, and the ending’s “nothing-song” offers a resonant, non-literal answer about what survival looks like here. The final line (“not to amplify sound, but to find the quiet in the storm”) edges toward explicit thematic statement, slightly flattening the subtext by spelling out what the narrative has already shown. Still, the piece leaves a clear emotional aftertaste of hard-won, precarious calm.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of meaning in coincidence, communal memory, and fragile hope are woven consistently through motifs like the hum, star paths, and the shard of hush. However, the piece occasionally tips into explicit thesis-stating—“a reminder that even shattered pieces could be reassembled into something that hummed with purpose and light”—which flattens subtext. The final realization integrates character and theme, but it verges on moralizing rather than letting image and situation carry the resonance. The thematic arc is coherent and appealing, but not yet as subtle or layered as top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—identity as an ongoing act of creation embedded in collective memory—is rich and coherent, arising from the monuments, shadows, and her role as archivist. The line about the self not being a fixed object but a continuous act of creation crystallizes the thematic core, and the ending’s focus on love and presence over names and achievements lands resonantly. However, some thematic statements verge on essayistic abstraction rather than emerging purely from dramatized particulars. This slightly blunts the subtextual power that the imagery itself could carry.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece has a coherent, attractive theme: human-made, controlled light as an act of stubborn resurrection against cosmic indifference. Motifs—the phoenix mosaic, the family firecraft, the “waking spiral,” flowers reclaiming a fortress—echo this without feeling like pure ornament. At times the text edges toward explicit thesis (“fire’s true purpose… about resurrection”), which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the final image of a small, patient spiral drawing others from the dark carries genuine resonance beyond what’s said outright.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme is coherent and resonant: liminality, transition, and the texture of time are embodied in tides, cicadas, the grotto, and the sisters’ estrangement/return. The recurring imagery meaningfully shifts weight by the end, especially the cicada as an emblem of chosen transformation. That said, several lines articulate the thesis almost directly (“I collect transitions,” “The texture of time…”) which blunts subtext and flirts with essayistic explanation. A bit more reliance on implication over statement would heighten its literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—about different kinds of silence, walls as protection vs. prison, and the reframing of “limitation” from scarcity to selective openness—emerges organically from Mira’s experiences and the repeating images (bunker, trellis, doll, sprout). The contrast between her father’s conception of exposure and her new idea of limiting exposure to fear is clean and resonant. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit thesis (“not a bunker…but a trellis,” “the only thing limited was the fear of opening doors”), slightly reducing the lingering ambiguity that might elevate the piece further. The emotional aftertaste is real, but a bit more subtlety at the end would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematic throughline—silence as an active, teachable comfort rather than emptiness—is integrated through storm glass, profession, and final image. The idea that some teachings must happen “beneath consciousness” resonates with the boy’s forgotten rescue and Maren’s quiet vocation. That said, several lines state theme directly (“Silence is not empty,” “This was the teaching…”) and the final paragraph edges toward essayistic exposition rather than fully trusting subtext. The piece still leaves a lasting conceptual and emotional impression, just shy of the most subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of custodianship vs dominion and bridging past and future are well integrated through the Throne’s true purpose and the stairway of ascension requiring surrender of certainties. The notion of a “world that had learned to dream in circuits and poetry” nicely encapsulates the hybrid, reverent tone toward lost technology. However, the thematic arc resolves very neatly—Elara is “the right one,” the gift is benevolent, and the transformation is framed as uncomplicatedly good. The absence of moral or conceptual friction keeps the resonance from lingering as strongly as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematic concerns—burning bridges, the paradox of suffocating within love versus suffocating without connection, thresholds as living boundaries—are strong and consistent. Recurring images (drowning/suffocation, scars, thresholds, bridges) genuinely shift meaning by the end, especially the reframing of sanctuary as potential tomb. However, the piece occasionally states its thesis too plainly (“isolation was simply another word for slow suffocation”), edging into essayistic moralizing rather than letting subtext bear more weight. A touch more restraint and reliance on image over explanation would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thematic work around promises as traps versus transformative commitments is strong and well integrated with the bolt, the pyramid scheme backstory, and the cross-dimensional encounter. The “pressure into diamonds” metaphor nicely reweights her past suffering as raw material for a different kind of promise. Subtext about exploitation, consent, and witnesshood enriches the speculative frame without heavy exposition. The ending edges toward explicit thesis (“this time the promise was becoming something true”), slightly flattening ambiguity and keeping it below elite-level subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of legacy versus chosen identity, the burden of scholarship and collection, and the permeability of past and present are clearly seeded in the prose (“bloodlines were merely accidents of history”). The house and gramophone work as suggestive metaphors for inherited knowledge and unprocessed grief. However, thematic development stalls because the revelation about the true end of the dynasty is interrupted, so there is no final reweighting image or earned conceptual shift. The piece invites resonance but doesn’t yet deliver a non-literal answer or cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematic material around possibility, alternate futures, and the value of transient beauty is strongly integrated with marionette imagery and Aldric’s arc. The idea of puppets as “vessels for potential” and the final allegiance to “possibility itself” coherently reweights the whole piece. Some lines verge on explicit thesis statement (“the eternal human need to imagine what might have been”), edging toward on-the-nose rather than fully subtextual resonance. Nonetheless, the ending image of him no longer feeling alone carries real emotional and conceptual aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of erased histories, bureaucratic erasure versus intimate kindness, and the aftershocks of emancipation emerge organically from the particulars of files, plantation architecture, and the button. The piece avoids sermonizing while still holding a clear stance about what gets preserved and why it matters. A few lines tilt toward thesis (“precisely why she had dedicated herself to this work”), but they’re anchored enough in concrete context that the ending’s prayer-like documentation resonates rather than moralizes.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, historical erasure, and “indifference as tyranny” emerge organically from the setting (revised city, reappearing lagoon, hidden archives) and Mira’s long quiet resistance. The palimpsest imagery and the lagoon’s stubborn return are effective concrete carriers of those ideas. However, the closing lines slide into near-thesis territory (“Indifference could be overcome, one carefully placed truth at a time”), edging toward explicit moralizing rather than trusting subtext. The resonance is solid but could be stronger with slightly less spelled-out commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of duty, containment, and the dangerous seduction of meaning emerge organically from the mechanics of prophecy and music, especially the idea of “code that wanted to be heard” and of filling silence so nothing else can grow there. The generational burden and “eerie nostalgia for a time when silence was not yet necessary” give the piece emotional and philosophical resonance without explicit moralizing. Recurring images (mist, light, negative space, breath) carry thematic weight and subtly reconfigure by the end. A deeper on-page conflict between his private desires and this inherited role would push the thematic complexity even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, caretaking, and the value of overlooked things are well integrated: her lifelong “tiny monuments” to forgotten seeds become the key to collective survival. The Hush, ancestral messages, and the skyborne arbor all support a meditation on intergenerational responsibility and the continuity between past and future. Importantly, the story resists flat moralizing; it lets the image of the humming monuments and the charged seed carry the resonance instead of stating a lesson. That said, the transformation is largely affirmational—the piece doesn’t bring her values into serious doubt, which keeps the thematic arc from feeling fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of time, loss, and the limits of control emerge organically from her work with broken clocks and the bureaucratic declaration of death versus her refusal to accept it. The recurring contrast between predictable mechanisms and chaotic nature (storms, swirling leaves, subterranean ruin) solidly underpins the tension between planning and uncertainty. However, the prompt’s deeper idea of “befriending” uncertainty is not fully dramatized; we see endurance more than a reconfigured relationship to chance. The quiet ending invites reflection but doesn’t quite deliver a reweighted thematic punch.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of visible fracture, legacy, and the “weight of names” are strongly woven through the kintsugi process and the mystical coin, and the final realization that she has redeemed herself rather than him lands cleanly. The recurring motifs of boundaries between elements and the golden seams embody the idea that damage should be acknowledged, not erased, giving the piece conceptual heft. That said, the story edges into overt articulation—lines like “This was the weight of names she had finally understood” and the triad “some fractures… some legacies… the most precious restorations…” approach moral summary rather than trusting the images. The complexity is there, but some thematic statements feel a touch too declarative for top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of joy as an essential component of grieving, and the coexistence of harm and tenderness within a single life, emerges organically from Mira’s practice and the soldier’s release. The milk-out-the-nose anecdote concretizes the idea that one act of joy can counterbalance a narrative of pure shame. Some lines edge into thesis territory (“healing required joy even, or especially, in parting” and “laughter could integrate itself into the process of grief”), which slightly flattens the subtext. Still, the final image of her carrying “tired hope into the luminous morning” lands with genuine emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “mathematics of mercy” is a strong thematic spine, tying her enhanced physiology, torture, and shame to a broader moral calculus about survival vs. complicity. Her evolving suspicion—that mercy might be in the questioning and walking itself rather than in answers—reweights prior material at the end. The strap-as-beacon and the ultraviolet clearing function as images of chosen, conscious penance versus numbing erasure. Some thematic phrasing edges close to abstraction (“trade the arithmetic of her wounds”), keeping this just under the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of legacy, guidance, and what it means to “carry history” are tightly woven through the fragment, the grandmother’s role, and the lighthouse painting. The shift from seeing herself as a mere preserver of relics to a continuation of living work is a clear, earned conceptual repricing. The final image of refracted intuition “aimed at nothing and everything at once” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. At times the thematic articulation (“It wasn’t a relic; it was a relay”) approaches explicit statement but stays just within organic metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ideas of hidden mechanisms, emotional “echoes,” and “cracks in the façade” interplay effectively, tying his trade to an ethics of attending to what’s abandoned and unseen. The mainspring’s stored energy and the unreleased story above the ceiling create a quiet but coherent thematic mesh about potential, neglect, and memory. The “weightless burden” phrasing edges close to statement but is still grounded in his lived experience. For a higher score, the story would need either sharper moral complexity or a final image that more decisively reweights our understanding of those echoes and his complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of permanence vs. negotiability, compression vs. release, and how knowledge should be held or opened emerge organically from the letterpress, the frost, and the bottled whisper. The recurring idea that some things can’t be compressed into smaller moments culminates in the whisper’s expansion and Elara’s decision to print its story. The line “Some eternities needed to be opened, not held” flirts with didacticism but is grounded enough in the specific experience to avoid feeling like a pasted-on thesis. The piece leaves a resonant conceptual aftertaste about how we treat time, language, and reality.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of history as narrative, refugees vs explorers, and the danger of singular stories are woven through the shard, the founders’ vision, and Vespera’s arc from failed revolution to pluralist curator. The mirror protocol and visible time neatly embody questions of what is revealed or hidden. However, lines like “the truth mattered less than what civilizations chose to make of their truths” and “This one… would succeed because it held space for multiplicity” verge on thesis-statement, slightly undercutting the otherwise subtle image work. The resonance is strong but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—about preserving fragile truths/songs against obliterating darkness, and “mending what isn’t torn” as an act of faith and honesty—emerges organically from objects and actions. Recurring motifs (rust, resonance, light vs midnight, tethering) cohere into a meditation on patience, duty, and the ethics of care for intangible things. Some lines lean into explicit statement (“The mending was not of gears or springs but of faith itself,” “his purpose had finally found its perfect pitch”), which slightly dulls the subtextual power. Still, the final image of partial restoration in an honest room at dawn offers a resonant, non-literal answer without feeling like a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory, industrial endings, thresholds, and the insufficiency of explanation arise organically from particulars—the closing factory, the compass’s history, the lagoon as the “geography of silence itself.” The notion that some essences cannot be captured and some journeys end in arrival rather than answers is dramatized in her inability to bottle the lagoon and her choice to remain. The final paragraph edges close to explicit thesis (“some journeys ended not with answers but with arrival”), which slightly flattens what the images already communicate. Still, the piece leaves a strong, reflective aftertaste anchored in concrete images rather than pure abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic core—art as generational conversation, beauty from wreckage, and "timewoven alliances"—emerges organically from the lantern slide and the linked images of makers across centuries. However, the ending leans into overt thematic articulation ("endless curriculum of attention," "to scaffold complexity with simplicity") that edges toward essayistic moralizing. The most powerful thematic work is in the concrete—hands working with sea-gifted material, the arm of driftwood reaching back toward the archway—while the abstract statements somewhat dilute the resonance. The piece leaves a thoughtful aftertaste but doesn’t fully trust its own images to carry the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of unseen beauty, patience, and trust in being unwitnessed accrue organically from the night-blooming flowers, the grandmother’s postcards, and Mira’s long labor. The final realization—“the profound patience required to witness beauty that hides itself, about the quiet courage of blooming unseen”—fits the accumulated imagery and recasts the premise. That said, the thematic statement is somewhat explicit and risks edging into moralizing rather than allowing subtext and images to carry all the weight. Still, the convergence of lunar cycles, encoded knowledge, and the closing garden image yields a resonant aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme around memory, historical erasure, and the ethics of witnessing is well integrated: Miriam’s civil-rights work parallels the grandmother’s temporal imprisonment, and the lagoon becomes a site where forgotten truths demand a custodian. The notion of “truth deferred but never destroyed” recurs concretely via the diary, the debris-cipher, and the final request for Miriam to serve as witness. The piece resists tidy moralizing, instead framing inter-world negotiation and temporal bondage as morally complex and costly. A more dramatized sense of what this witnessing will cost Miriam personally could deepen the resonance further.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory vs. magic, work vs. wish, and comfort vs. growth are well integrated into action and image, especially through the craftspeople’s remembered hands and the contrast between dead wishes and living labor. The amber bottle’s logic (expansion rather than release) and the reimagined child embody the shift from nostalgic resurrection to forward-making. Some thematic statements are explicit (“Comfort was a trap… The past was not a refuge—it was a foundation”), edging toward essayistic, but they’re supported by concrete dramatization. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: a world rebuilt from remembrance and craft rather than desire.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, covenant between living and dead, and the idea that true vows are never lost but await the right silence arise organically from events—the grandmother’s recording, the forgotten civilization’s tablets, and the foghorn’s obsolescence. The final realization that the dead have been speaking all along and that the world had to grow quiet enough to hear them is a resonant, non-didactic answer to the opening question of what follows the horn’s silence. The piece avoids moralizing and lets images (sedimented promises, amber light, roots and tower) carry its ideas. A touch more friction or counter-pressure might have layered the thematic complexity even further.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres powerfully around stewardship across generations, the nature of time as inheritance, and entropy versus coherence. The reframing of “borrowed time” as “borrowed forward”—an intergenerational investment that matures here—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s core question. Motifs of seeds, cold, lineage, and the acorn cap all feed this revaluation without slipping into overt moralizing. There is mild conceptual explicitness in the exposition of entropy and process, but it remains woven into character and stakes rather than reading as lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of listening versus noise, sacred versus secular warning, and continuity between monastic bells and modern sirens are woven through particulars—the bell rope, the solstice hush, and the line “Both acts were a kind of listening, really.” The final juxtaposition of zero hour, the held glue, and the first rain reweights the preparatory work with quiet, communal meaning. The piece avoids overt moralizing and trusts its images to carry resonance. It could push further into moral or emotional cost, but the earned, understated reflection is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of empathy, overlooked lives, and strength in vulnerability are coherent and woven through recurring images of falling/coming to rest, light and loss, ending as seed. However, they are often articulated in abstract, thesis-like sentences (“They had discovered that strength did not reside in armored certainty…”) rather than emerging primarily from unstated implication. The final paragraph lands a resonant answer—witnessing as sacred work—but edges into moralizing exposition. Strong thematic clarity, but less subtextual and less surprising than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, caretaking, and the sacredness of unspoken covenants emerge organically through bees, ruined hives, ghosts, and the stained glass box rather than through explicit moralizing. The idea that promises and attention can persist as almost physical weight is made concrete and then reweighted at the end when Mira becomes their keeper. “Eloquence of silence” and the land-bee covenant resonate without tipping into sentimentality, and the closure image lingers. Complexity is modest but genuine: solitude is both refuge and responsibility, and that ambivalence is left intact.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of time, memory, containment, and meaning without measurement are rich and coherently threaded through the urn, the silo, and the listings. However, the piece leans into explicit thesis statements (“Time was not a river or a road… Time was the space between breaths”) that verge on essayistic rather than letting images and actions carry the insight. The urn’s inversion of container/contained and the idea of broken things speaking more honestly are strong, specific thematic vehicles. The ending does reframe the central question, but with a touch of overt explanation that blunts lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thematic throughline about the beauty and necessity of incompleteness is rich and genuinely integrated with concrete images (kite, feather, wounded bird, storm). The closing movement, with the poet carrying “woven dawns” as an inner fire, has strong emotional and conceptual resonance. However, the story undercuts itself by stating its thesis too explicitly (“It would argue that completeness was not the point…”), drifting toward essayistic explanation. More trust in subtext and the images already doing the work would elevate this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of interspecies respect, integration of human architecture with landscape, and death as energetic redistribution are woven through concrete particulars (copper as “language,” pillars directing water, birds as seed-carriers). The final image of wind moving the wired branches into “subtle music…as gratitude” reweights prior material into a resonant, non-literal answer about reciprocity and legacy. The line “Death was simply another transition” edges toward explicit statement but is earned by the surrounding specificity and restraint. Ambiguity is gentle rather than piercing, but the thematic throughline is coherent and affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core themes—homecoming as recognition rather than arrival, liminality between departure and destination, artificial versus genuine pilgrimage, and convergence across scales (insect, human, alien)—are coherent and nicely braided with recurrent images. The amber fly as a motif effectively carries subtext about suspended journeys and preserved seeking. However, the piece frequently states its ideas overtly (“Homecoming, Elena realized, was not arrival but recognition,” “The chemistry of homecoming was not merely biological but philosophical”), drifting into essayistic explanation rather than letting theme emerge purely from image and action. This explicitness blunts what could be a more haunting, oblique aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of ecological grief, responsibility, and resurrection are well integrated through recurring images of battlefield/garden, treaties between life and death, and the contrast between indifference and intentional restoration. The story avoids sermonizing for most of its length, though “collapsed beneath the weight of human indifference and the slow poison of warming waters” edges toward explicit thesis. The final image of the green thread and the coachman’s “final passenger” smile offer a resonant, non-literal answer about renewal through care and memory. The ambiguity of scale (one garden vs a devastated ocean) adds quiet complexity rather than a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of distance, translation, memory, and survival of beauty are well-integrated through the leaf, the cylinder, and the wasteland context. The final conceptual move—that “love is the only translation that survives when everything else burns”—resonates with the story’s images, but the line borders on overt thesis-statement. Much of the thematic work is strong and image-based (leaf preserved in wax; words carved into grooves), yet the last paragraphs tip toward explaining motivation and meaning rather than leaving more to implication. This slightly dulls the lingering ambiguity and complexity an elite venue would want.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of ethical responsibility, wonder versus control, and “true north” as a moral/spiritual orientation are woven consistently through image clusters (compass, stars, sketching, shutdown). The conceptual arc—moving from mastery/control to reverent exploration—is clear and has genuine resonance. Yet the story repeatedly states its theses in abstract, near-moralizing language (“true north… a direction in the soul,” “with wonder, with reverence”), which undercuts subtext and leaves little for the reader to infer. The result is thematically coherent but more didactic and platitudinous than an elite venue would tolerate.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of restitution, the ownership of secrets, and embracing uncertainty emerge organically from Caelius’s mission and the Archive/“unanswered questions” frame. The chess pieces filled with private truths are a strong thematic object that links guilt, history, and identity. The explicit line “for this is where the unknown begins” and “to step through the doorway of consequence” verge on stating the thesis directly, dulling some subtext. The final simplified ending retains resonance but opts for a neat emotional release rather than a more complex or ambiguous repricing of what “amendment” truly costs.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of crisis as condition, memory as resistance, and absence as a form of presence are woven through concrete particulars: the water bottle, the singing mother, the old man in his doorway, the empty chessboard. The final image reweights everything—her footsteps becoming a mode of writing history where silence and absence have “their own terrible light.” Abstraction appears (“nomadic penumbra,” “luminous absence”), but mostly rides on established images rather than floating free. There is no explicit moralizing; the piece trusts implication and costs, earning its reflective wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic through-line—home as a language and buried talent as a seed awaiting cultivation—emerges clearly from concrete images (stone tablet, feather-textured letters, seed metaphor, snow-covered garden). The emotional aftereffect is tender and hopeful, with a credible acknowledgement of pain alongside gratitude. However, several explicit thematic statements (“The shape of home… is not a place you find,” “not a curse to be feared but a garden to be cultivated”) edge toward thesis articulation rather than leaving more work to subtext. This slight didacticism in the final third dampens what could otherwise be an even more haunting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of sacrifice, the value beyond winning, and self-forgiveness are tightly braided with chess, labyrinth, and tapestry motifs, creating a coherent conceptual web. The idea that “some things mattered more than winning” and that exile becomes “permission” rather than punishment is potent. However, several lines articulate the thesis too directly (e.g., “She had come here to forgive herself”), nudging toward mild moralizing rather than fully trusting image and action. The subtext is strong enough that a lighter touch on explicit statements would yield more resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—truth vs institutional forgetting, the real “price of forgiveness,” art as a way of un-making oppressive narratives—emerges strongly from the specific ritual and Sera’s history of surrender. The reframing of forgiveness as something owed to oneself rather than to power is a resonant conceptual turn that reweights prior material. Subtext around mothers, children, and intergenerational erasure (“All true stories are about everyone’s mother”) adds depth. The slight drawback is that a few lines state the thesis a bit directly, edging toward aphorism rather than letting the images fully carry the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of kintsugi, uncertainty as honest magic, and meaning forged from scars are organic to the specific acts of matching pockmarks to memories. Many concrete images (the chipped heart, the quicksilver creature, the fractures around the eye) carry genuine thematic weight. However, the final paragraph moves into explicit thesis-statement territory (“uncertainty was itself a form of honest magic,” “conjured meaning—not despite the uncertainty, but through it”), edging toward sermonizing rather than trusting the images. The resonance is real but somewhat over-articulated, reducing lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of impermanence, possession vs. witnessing, and art as an act of release are woven coherently through the shell, mirror, cave, and final walk out. The reweighting of “capturing beauty” from ownership to offering is earned by specific memories and the pool’s reconfiguration of reflection. However, the final paragraphs verge on essayistic explanation (“capturing beauty was not the same as possessing it,” “the keeping was in the releasing”), tipping into overt thesis rather than pure image-driven resonance. The piece is thematically rich but could trust subtext more for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece has a coherent and appealing thematic spine about quiet, pure intention (“whispers”) being more effective than frantic spectacle (“shouts”), expressed through concrete maritime and sensory particulars. The jasmine, night garden, and the vibrational “song” of the lighthouse give this theme an image system rather than abstract moralizing, and the final line about “the night the darkness had answered them back” offers a resonant conceptual reweighting. However, the logbook line “The whispers were right. They always are.” edges toward explicit thesis-statement, slightly flattening the otherwise well-earned subtext. More ambiguity about costs—e.g., what is lost when one abandons shouts—could heighten the lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of how we navigate grief—forward vs. backward, away vs. toward, light vs. dark—are richly woven through motifs of migration, cartography, and failed beacons. The ending image of two people “building something from this…a way through, rough and honest and true” offers a clear, non-literal answer: navigation is relational and requires raw presence in pain. That said, the story often articulates its own thesis in explicit terms (“This was reverse migration—the pull to return to the source of pain,” “the only terrain that truly mattered”), edging toward essayistic explanation. The result is strong resonance but a slight loss of subtextual subtlety that would separate publishable from top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of memory, empathy, forgotten knowledge, and symbiotic survival are woven effectively through the orchard, truffles, glass eye, and discredited textbooks. The parallel between the hanging orchard’s persistence and Mira’s insistence on emotional connection is strong and not over-explained. Some phrasing (“psychological safety,” explicit descriptions of authorities’ ideology) edges toward conceptual summary rather than letting the scene fully carry the weight. Still, the final image of her quiet rebellion in the hollow offers a resonant, non-literal response to the central question of how to live in an empathy-stripped world.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of memory, absence, and connection across distance are well integrated, especially through the motif of “gaps” and the Edelweiss’s journey. The idea that some gestures are legible precisely in what they omit is nicely embodied in Aldric’s investigative method. The final paragraphs, however, edge into explicit statement—“some gestures need no words,” “the lighthouse had always been more than a beacon”—which leans toward moralizing rather than trusting the images. More reliance on image and implication and less direct thematic articulation would push this into a higher literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of maps versus territory, inherited promises, and “home” as a metaphysical rather than geographic destination emerge organically through objects and actions rather than thesis statements. The doorway of decisions is a strong thematic device, reframing ordinary life as a series of often-missed thresholds, and Maren’s choice resonates as a quiet acceptance of risk in pursuit of a more authentic “home.” The ants, the obsolete printing chip, and the impossible bloom all serve this conceptual reweighting without feeling like mere symbols. The piece resists easy moralizing, though a touch more complication in her ambivalence could deepen its lingering afterfeel.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of disillusionment, duty to a living world, and the mutual vulnerability of ruler and realm develop organically through image (bleeding sky, weeping silver ink, fireflies as fragile constellations). The final understanding—that the “warning” is a summons from a wounded world she vowed to protect—reweights prior images without explicit moralizing. The piece invites reflection on what it means to serve something larger when ceremony has gone hollow. The ease of her emotional resolution slightly undercuts thematic complexity by bypassing deeper ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme is rich and coherent: density through return, revaluation of the familiar, and presence as something transformed by attention rather than captured. The recurring images (spiral, embers, pocket-sun) all shift meaning toward the end in ways that support the conceptual arc. That said, the story occasionally states its thesis too directly (“The scientifically romantic method… was really just paying attention with enough care that attention became transformation”), which blunts some subtextual power. The final lines still leave a resonant afterimage of layered time and intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—lucidity as curse, the recursive braid of dream/memory/death, and the impossibility yet necessity of imposing narrative on chaos—emerges strongly from concrete images rather than mere abstraction. The grave, the scroll, and the dream of the younger self all deepen the core question of how one lives with self-knowledge and temporal fracture. A few lines veer toward explicit thesis (“lucidity is not a gift but a curse disguised as clarity”), but they’re embedded in lived experience and don’t feel like tacked-on moralizing. The final vision of the grave as waystation and the grave “learning to speak” offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme is rich: perception through absence, ordinary miracles, birth and time, and “reading between lines” are all braided tightly with Elena’s arc and the motifs of fog and water clocks. The birthing clamp screw and fog lifting reweight earlier material in a satisfying way. However, some lines verge on explicit thesis statement (“she understood now that scent had never been the point,” and especially the malformed “The humanize through occluded views...”), which blunts some subtextual power. Despite that, the piece leaves a resonant afterimage of attention and limitation as routes to human connection.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coherently explores how wounds, superstition, and inherited wisdom become sources of power when honestly faced, and the ending reweights earlier images (crystals, scars, breath between storms) in that light. The notion that “rune-magic only answered those who could be honest with their wounds” arises naturally from her memories and realization. Some lines (“She had shed her cynicism along with her fear…”) edge toward explicit thesis, slightly reducing ambiguity and subtlety. Still, the final understanding about writing her own story with a quill “that knew her name” offers a resonant, image-based answer.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres around imperfect repair, belonging, and the cost of “too-late” gestures that nonetheless matter, braided with images of pruning, orchards, unfinished scores, and ghostly communication. The final paragraphs reweight prior images—the perfume bottle, the orchard, the incomplete symphony—without sliding into moralizing, even though a couple of lines (“the particular ache of an apology…”) come close to essayistic statement. The notion of “imperfect miracles” is embodied rather than lectured, especially in the failure of the connection and the refusal to grant full catharsis. The ending lingers as a charged poise between grief and potential, inviting reflection rather than prescribing it.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes around endings, language as power, and the dissolution of inner/outer boundaries are evocatively seeded. The Spiral of Arbitration nicely aligns with ideas of resolving paradox and cosmic contradiction. However, the piece stops before those themes are tested or complicated by events; there’s no final image that reweights earlier material. Resonance is conceptual rather than earned through a dramatic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    Thematic material—time as change, measurement versus lived experience, patience as a form of listening—is coherent and integrated with recurring images of water cycling, horizons, and clockwork. The final realization that clocks measure “the stubborn insistence of the universe upon moving forward” effectively reweights earlier reflections. That said, some lines veer into essayistic explicitness (“She understood then, with the force of revelation…”) and quasi-proverbial phrasing, which slightly blunts subtlety. The piece invites reflection but sometimes tells its insights rather than letting them fully emerge from scene.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of permeable boundaries, revolution as subtle reconfiguration, and “familiar strangers” are woven through setting, profession, and the final moment without overt moralizing. Recurring images—mycelial networks, membranes, luminous thresholds—shift meaning by the end to frame distance itself as a form of careful love. A few lines verge on declared thesis (“This was the particular physics of letting go”) but remain anchored in specific context. The closing sense of a “quiet wildfire” of connection offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of probability, risk, grief, and the difference between playing and “being the house” are woven tightly through object, profession, and metaphor. The bell curve tagged “WHERE I LIVE” and the line “THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS BECAUSE THE HOUSE DOES NOT PLAY” elegantly crystallize the conceptual problem the story is working through. The ending’s “invitations… to stop playing and start living” edges toward articulating the thesis, but it still arises from concrete, earned particulars. The overall effect is resonant and complex rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The thematic through-line—endings as doorways, grief as a recurring frequency, the ethics of anonymous witnessing—is coherent and resonant. Motifs like loops, crossings of lines, and the harmonica’s “not quite music and not quite memory” deepen the exploration of how repetition can make loss bearable. Some sentences edge toward thesis-statement territory (“This was the gift of her position: to teach endings how to begin”) which slightly flattens subtext into statement. Still, the final poised moment with the ringing phone and hanging note offers a non-literal, emotionally charged answer to the story’s questions about estranged compassion.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of preservation, the value of “small moments,” and allowing memory to breathe emerge organically from recurrent motifs (tea-steeping, walnut ink, locket, jetty) and the archivist’s professional lens. The final promise reweights earlier material with a clear conceptual answer about preservation as living currency between past and future. However, the piece occasionally states its thesis too directly (“not about freezing moments in amber…”) which edges toward mild essayistic explanation rather than fully trusting images and subtext. A bit more restraint in explicit thematizing would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of loneliness, mutual recognition, and emotional economies are strongly woven through the rules of the rock and the logistician’s lifestyle of efficient, self-erasing service. The final image of laughter in the ivy-reclaimed station nicely embodies reciprocity as an “anarchic act” rather than a slogan. At times, the narration leans into abstract explanation (“ancient economy of emotional exchange,” “how愈合 happened”) where letting images and actions carry the insight would feel more sophisticated.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme—that true navigation of emotion requires inner stillness and self-illumination—is organically linked to the premise of a blind emotional cartographer. Recurring motifs (the ring, stillness, hidden melody) support the thematic arc. Yet the story leans into explicit statement, especially lines like “the truth the ring had been trying to teach her all along” and “the truest navigation was not about finding direction,” which verge on essayistic moralizing. The resonance is genuine but slightly over-articulated rather than fully entrusted to image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece advances a strong thematic thread: misinterpretation, filtering, and the idea that “wrong turns” and distortions can refine what matters, especially under conditions of uncertainty. Motifs of bending/unbending, seeds, the anomaly, and the heirloom pen all collaborate to build this argument. However, the theme is stated a bit directly in lines like “Perhaps every wrong turn was a form of filtering,” veering toward thesis rather than leaving more to subtext. Even so, the final image of her sitting with the universe’s breath, grateful for the bending, offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of silence, translation, memory, and the value of the unrecorded are woven through sign language, the empty camera, and the mentor’s philosophy. The final realization about some things needing to remain unrecorded meaningfully reweights earlier details. However, several lines tip toward overt statement (“to map silence is to discover its hidden architecture,” etc.), slightly reducing the subtextual power. Despite this mild didactic edge, the thematic resonance is strong and emotionally credible.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—who controls knowledge, how it survives, and the ethics of destruction vs preservation—emerges organically from the arson backstory and the Archive’s art-language. The generational promise and lineage of women broaden this into a meditation on custodianship and hidden histories. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“The forgotten promise was not just her grandmother's...”), softening the subtext. The final image of her emerging after three years with a new preservation ethic offers a resonant, if slightly tidy, answer to the initial problem.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: a therapy-tool setting turned sanctuary, a woman reclaiming agency in a surveillance-heavy environment, and grief refigured as entangled, ongoing connection rather than closure. The final image of Mira’s dream “beginning to breathe” in the garden and lagoon reweights earlier details, turning the experimental protocol into an accidental conduit for her project of a consciousness sanctuary. Lines like “a universe that had taken too much and given too little” flirt with abstraction but remain grounded by the ongoing, concrete act of drumming. The piece avoids tidy moralizing and leaves a resonant sense of luminous, defiant grief.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of embodied knowledge vs. technological dependence, whisper networks vs. official channels, and intergenerational tools/intentions are grounded in concrete objects (maps, key, coin) and events. Mira’s social capital and attention to workers’ individual walks nicely embody the idea that listening and patience create resilient networks. The final paragraph, however, leans into explicit thesis (“In a world that worshipped technology, Mira had proven…”) which flattens some of the earned subtext and edges toward moralizing. Despite that, the conceptual repricing of “old networks” at the end is coherent and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of witnessing, inherited care, and nonverbal/emergent hope are integrated through recurring motifs (light, stars, shutters, reflection) rather than bolted-on ideas. Subtext in the boy’s body language and her mirroring of her own past creates a satisfying sense of lineage and “invisible community” among the suffering. However, a few sentences tilt toward thesis (“This was her purpose now…to teach darkness the value of stars”), slightly over-articulating what the images already convey. The ending nonetheless offers a resonant, non-literal answer about how hope is passed on without words.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    The thematic spine—humble rebellion through doubt, the power of patient pauses, silence as language—is strong, coherent, and arises organically from repeated concrete images (chess, grotto, windows, unwritten letters). The motif of “cradling doubt” and “amplified quiet” effectively reframes hesitation from weakness into radical agency, and the closing forest metaphor reweights everything before it. At times the narration edges toward essayistic statement (“These were not grand gestures but humble rebellions, quiet fractures…”), slightly reducing the need for the reader to infer. Still, the piece offers a resonant, non-didactic conceptual answer to its central question about how change happens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of surrender versus control, inherited trauma, and the difference between external and internal freedom are coherently developed through the scrimshaw, the post-violence world, and the whale’s nonviolent invitation. The re-interpretation of “This unlocks guarded hearts” from outward magic to inward permission is a strong thematic pivot. However, several key sentences state the theme almost as thesis (“This was the talisman's true purpose…”, “She had found her freedom not through combat, but through surrender”), edging into moralizing rather than trusting image and action. The resonance is real but could be stronger if more implied and less declared.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—around regulated emotion, performance versus authenticity, the politics of grief, and finding a third state beyond both sorrow and mandated joy—is strongly integrated with character and setting. Recurring images (blank face, flowers/wooden rose, turbines, “remade hush”) accrue meaning and are reweighted by the ending’s “weightlessness of having survived both.” The story resists tidy moralizing by foregrounding her admitted complicity and moral ambiguity, yet still lands on a resonant vision of endurance. Slightly expository lines about “compassionate restructuring” and the “elimination of sorrow’s burden” edge toward overt thesis, keeping it shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of sacred/profane, mental boundaries, and art as a means of dissolving prohibition are woven clearly through recurring images (cloud-shadows, humming quartz, shifting decrees). The ending effectively reweights the premise with the realization that “some walls exist only to be dissolved by those brave enough to approach them,” tying her personal arc to a broader conceptual question. However, the thematic statement edges toward explicit moralizing and is somewhat on-the-nose. The resonance is real but could benefit from more implication and less direct articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme is strong and consistent: beauty in imperfection, awakening as a tradable, generational gift, and alternative languages of perception. The reed tongue, broken glass, and plant arrangements all echo this, and the apprentice’s shift embodies the thematic question. However, the narrative leans into explicit statement—“It was the language of awakening…,” “awakening could be bartered, traded, passed…”—which edges toward telling the thesis rather than letting it fully emerge from particulars. More restraint in the final paragraph would heighten subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme is strong: authenticity vs artifice, memory vs reconstruction, and the “texture of connection” are woven through object, setting, and method. The lens and the artificial pilgrimage concept together create a coherent meditation on how constructed experiences can still host genuine transcendence. However, the final paragraph edges into essayistic statement (“she understood that all journeys were in some sense artificial”), slightly flattening subtext into thesis. The resonance is real but a touch over-articulated for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of grief-as-practice, honoring mourning, and the non-opposition of mourning and love are well-aligned with the worldbuilding (mourning jewelry, an observatory for grief, artificial mentors). Certain formulations—“healing was not a destination but a practice”; “mourning never truly ends—but neither does love”—tip into explicit thesis statements, edging toward sentimentality. The story still earns some resonance through its particular images (withered flower at the threshold of death, coordinates leading to quiet spaces), and it avoids a pat “moving on” moral. A subtler ending that trusted image over articulation would deepen its literary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of measurement as primordial magic, pattern-seeking across generations, and the failure of digital “currencies” to replace connection and craft are rich and organically embedded in objects and action. The rain, cards, and tape form a cohesive motif that reweights the idea of mapping from tech analysis to ancestral wisdom by the end. However, some thematic statements verge on essayistic explicitness (“The cards didn’t predict the future so much as reveal the present’s hidden architecture”; the critique of “digital tokens” as replacements for older currencies), which flattens subtext into thesis at moments. The final image still leaves a resonant, non-literal answer about how one might navigate post-crash chaos using older, inherited modes of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of nostalgia as both wound and balm, and of knowledge as something to be released rather than hoarded, emerge organically from the worldbuilding and her changing stance. The final image—her becoming part of the “atoms of nostalgia” she’s purifying—reweights prior material in a satisfying way. However, the story sometimes states its ideas too directly (“This was the secret the lost civilization had understood”), edging toward essayistic explanation rather than purely letting images and actions carry the theme. The complexity is there, but a bit more restraint in overt thesis statements would raise the work into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—the transformation of hope and grief as humanity sheds bodies—is woven through repeating images (shadows, blossoms, river stone, luminous dissolution) with real resonance. The argument that “hope was not diminishing but transforming” is powerful, though phrased a bit too explicitly as thesis rather than fully earned through scene alone. The final vigil and warmed stone offer a quiet, non-literal answer: preservation has a cost, but metamorphosis can coexist with loss. The piece invites reflection on memory, embodiment, and archival witnessing without collapsing into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of deception, restoration, and the danger of certainty emerge organically from the chameleon-tail metaphor and the Aldric backstory rather than from imposed thesis alone. The tail’s “theater of deception” versus Mara’s painstaking restoration embodies the shift from spectacle and fraud to quiet, patient truth. Some lines do slide toward explicit statement (“certainty…had been a cage as much as a foundation”), softening the subtlety. Still, the final image and Mara’s intended stance toward the remaining staff provide a resonant, non-didactic answer about how to live after betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of delayed or “displaced” miracles, memory, and the re-reading of scars are tightly woven through objects and actions (hourglass frost melting as understanding lands, anesthesia wearing off as emotional awakening). The grandmother’s riddle, the plant telepathy, and the scars all converge to complicate simple notions of fault and healing. The line explicitly stating “some miracles are displaced in time” edges close to authorial thesis, but the surrounding images carry enough weight to keep it from flattening into moral. The ending invites reflection on how love and harm mark us without insisting on a single, tidy takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of unsent goodbyes, intention versus delivery, and “unused love” as a kind of stored energy are coherent and woven through image systems (dust, incubation, lyrics searching for tune). The final choice—to witness rather than complete or expose the story—offers a resonant if quiet answer to the central question of what should be done with such emotions. That said, the piece leans into overt articulation (“Some goodbyes need no audience, no delivery, no response”), bordering on authorial exposition rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. A touch more restraint and reliance on image over thesis-sentence would lift the thematic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematic throughline—creativity as something to be surrendered to rather than hunted—is tightly braided with the astrolabe, stars, and aurora motifs, and the final image of release feels emotionally honest. The repetition of “remembered stardust” and heavenly imagery builds a clear pattern that is reweighted at the end when she stops treating inspiration as prey. However, several lines state the theme too directly (“what no one had ever told her…”) and edge toward moralizing rather than trusting subtext and image to carry the insight. The piece resists cheap sentiment overall, but it doesn’t fully escape didactic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of hope as pause, possibility versus collapse, and new forms of light after ecological ruin are tightly woven through objects (clock, archive, moss) and language (“after the last forest burns,” “I cultivate the sparks”). The quantum “wave function” motif nicely echoes the ethical and emotional uncertainty that resolves into a gentler stance at the end. “Hope looks like a pause” edges close to stated thesis but is earned enough by the clock’s history and the world’s loss. The final image of the broken lullaby mending itself offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of what survives and regenerates.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of self-knowledge, the danger of avoided questions, and embracing uncertainty materialize organically from the jungle-mind conceit and the laboratory backstory. The gear and rainforest function as concrete images that refract the idea of consciousness as a wild, mechanical ecology. Some insights are spelled out rather directly (“The jungle was not separate from him—it was a manifestation of his own consciousness”), edging toward essayistic exposition rather than purely emergent meaning. Nonetheless, the final realization that there is “no back to return to” provides a resonant, if gently stated, thematic repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece coherently explores where courage “waits”—in avoided rooms, unspoken conversations, forsaken roads—and ties that insight to the protagonist’s concrete act of stepping forward. Recurring motifs (leash, twilight, indirect route) accumulate thematic weight and are reweighted at the end. There is a slight tilt toward explicit statement (“courage was not something one gathered like shells”) that edges into essayistic explanation. Nonetheless, the ending’s image of walking into the dark with “reclaimed” courage offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of silence, safety, guilt, and the cost of inaction are woven through concrete particulars (silent choir, nerve regeneration, bolt, bronze dust) and culminate in a resonant final image of snow as a “patient symphony.” The reframing of “unpardonable silence” from a single failed warning to a broader pattern of belief is powerful and thematically coherent. However, the ending leans into explicit thesis statements (“safety was not the opposite of danger but its quiet accomplice…”) that edge toward essayistic moralizing rather than letting image and implication fully carry the weight. This slight over-articulation blunts what could otherwise be a more hauntingly open thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of truth as slow erosion, justice through knowledge, and time as a patient ally emerge organically from the compound images of drift, decay, and marginalia. The nonviolent “verbal sunder” of a false lineage offers a nuanced stance on power and legitimacy without moralizing. The final image of inevitable exposure by a future scholar reweights earlier details effectively. Still, the piece stops short of a deeper complication or counterpoint that would push it into the very top thematic band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of impermanence, resilience, and the contingency of human mappings (“maps were not promises but photographs of temporary truths”) are woven organically through the atlas, the drowned coastlines, and the redirected currents. The shift from “paths disappearing” to “paths transforming” is dramatized through the coral colony discovery rather than stated as an abstract thesis. The closing image of new rhythms and rerouted ecosystems offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to the story’s central ecological grief. There is some near-explicit aphoristic language (“ecosystems were not static photographs but periodically eternal processes”), but it’s still grounded in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of meaning-making, inheritance, and transforming violent rebellion into remembrance and purpose emerge organically from specific images (opera glasses, circle hum, father’s sacrifice). The shift from using the circle as a tactical weapon to using its resonance as a unifying, remembering force is a strong, nuanced thematic move. However, the story undercuts itself slightly with explicit moralizing lines like “Meaning was not something you found in the mess; it was something you created,” which states the thesis instead of fully trusting the images. The ending remains resonant, but the didactic edge keeps it out of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of tradition vs. evolution, destiny as something planted and cultivated, and insurgency as fidelity to ancestral courage come through clearly in the imagery and Yara/Anya dynamic. The plant-language, seed bank, and “implanted destinies” motif are nicely braided. However, the story leans into explicit thematic statement (“traditions evolve with intent, not without it,” “not to destroy tradition but to fulfill it”) that edges toward moralizing rather than letting implication fully carry the weight. The ending still offers a resonant answer—fulfilling tradition by consciously evolving it—but some subtlety is lost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the specifics of plant care, bodily sensation, and the lighthouse’s function, rather than from abstract lecturing. The piece sharply resists the cliché of linear “healing,” proposing instead a nuanced, embodied ongoingness where optimism is grounded in what can “wither and survive.” The night-blooming cereus functions as a thematic hinge: a fragile, time-bound bloom that reframes her whole project without feeling like a forced symbol. A few phrases nod toward trauma discourse, but they stay grounded in lived texture.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—fragmentation as potential gift rather than curse, and multiplicity of identity—is strongly woven through faces, cards, threads, and the architecture of the lighthouse. The final realization that “the faces… had always been multitudes” offers a clear, resonant answer to the opening wound without resorting to explicit moralizing. A few lines flirt with thesis-statement territory (“This was not destruction. This was a redesign waiting to happen.”), but they remain grounded in concrete imagery enough to avoid sermonizing. The story invites reflection on perception and control in art without flattening into a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Time dilation in crisis, presence/absence, and the idea of a “consciously wild” intelligence speaking through disappearing ink braid into a coherent thematic fabric. Thematically rich lines like “rage served no purpose when the universe refused to follow reasonable rules” tie his psychology to the larger cosmology of time and pattern. The ending—him becoming part of the mystery and perhaps one of the universe’s “most patient hunters”—reweights earlier material in a resonant way. There is a mild tendency toward abstract, essay-like phrasing that slightly blunts the impact, but it remains largely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of manufactured war, institutionalized lies, and the ethics of preservation vs revelation emerge organically from the situation. The shift from silence as shroud to silence as “held breath” is a strong thematic image that reweights the opening. However, several lines verge on thesis-statement territory (“what good was preservation if it meant keeping silence forever?”), which flattens subtext into stated argument. The piece still leaves some resonant questions about truth and responsibility, but with less ambiguity than top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of inherited violence, chosen peace, and “continuity through chaos” are well woven through concrete particulars like the roses, dome, and ballast scrap, and the final image of quiet tending theoretically answers the central question. However, the last paragraph slides into explicit thesis—“Peace was not the absence of fire—it was the choice…”—which reads as moralizing rather than letting the images speak. This direct statement blunts subtext and slightly flattens complexity by offering a neat definition. The emotional aftereffect is still present but less haunting than it could be with more restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of grief, pattern-breaking, and the generative power of silence are woven through events rather than stated outright, with strong images like “the absence of every sound that had ever hurt him” doing heavy lifting. The rail spike as a vessel for transliterated emotion and divine song gives a solid thematic throughline about memory and bearing sacred weight in humble tools. The ending’s quiet stasis—Morwen fishing for echoes—nicely reprices his life’s stillness. There’s room to deepen the personal/theological tension around carrying a dead goddess’s echo, but what’s here is cohesive and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of inherited guilt, institutional corruption, and the difficulty of ethical reform inside compromised systems emerge organically from particulars (killed stories about poisoning, city hall, pharma, company housing). The “orbits of regret” metaphor nicely fuses family history, astronomy setting, and ethical inertia, and the ending reconfigures this from fatalism to a chosen attempt at escape. The piece avoids sermonizing, letting her decision and the city-as-unfinished-story image carry the argument. A few phrases edge toward explicit thesis (“break the cycle”) rather than trusting implication, keeping it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of grief, translation of the unspeakable, and the desire to retroactively repair failure emerge organically from the lab concept and Mira’s occupation. The motif of sound-as-data (baby cries as spectra, haunted firmware, dissonance resolving) provides a strong thematic spine without lapsing into didactic statement. The ending’s image—her skills finally serving their “true purpose”—reweights her whole prior life in a resonant way, though the moral and emotional complexity (e.g., limits of atonement, possible unintended consequences) is only lightly touched. Subtext around technology as a medium for haunting is suggestive and could bear even more ambiguity or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme is strong and integrated: unlearning, impermanence, and the equivalence of order and chaos all arise from concrete particulars (mandala, chalk dust, grotto acoustics). The final insight—that the “mess inside oneself” can resemble peace—is conceptually satisfying and reweights earlier details. That said, the teacher’s lesson and the concluding paragraph edge toward explicit thematic statement, occasionally skirting pseudo-profound abstraction. A bit more reliance on image and less on direct thematic paraphrase would deepen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory vs. erasure, preservation vs. “starting fresh,” and compassion as something that must become fireproof are well woven into objects (tessera), abilities (retrocognition), and the renaming ritual. The concept of “aberrant mercy” is strong and reframed through action, especially in giving Soren a name that encodes endurance rather than attempting to undo loss. However, lines like “This was mercy” and explicit explanations of what names are (“not merely labels but vessels”) edge toward authorial gloss rather than fully trusting subtext. The final bell and shaft of light produce a genuine emotional afterimage without feeling entirely free of sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of despair, possibility, and the non-finality of failure are well woven through the tarot, the stage imagery, and the fractured timelines. The notion that “every failure contained a seed of success” is concretely dramatized via the overlapping performances. The main thematic beat is slightly undercut by on-the-nose articulation (“Despair is a performance you don't have to finish. There are always encores.”), which edges toward moralizing rather than leaving more work to subtext. Still, the final image of the lifted coin and morning light delivers an emotionally coherent, resonant answer to the story’s core question.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of consent, embodied knowledge, and the ethics of mediated intimacy are strong and consistent, with the telepathy pill recall providing a concrete negative model. The contrast between forced thought-sharing and the crystal’s invitational, somatic pathway is a compelling thematic engine. That said, several lines verge on thesis statement—“Connection can't be manufactured through chemistry alone”—tipping into essayistic moralizing rather than leaving more weight to image and implication. The ending’s “not a pill… but a method… a way… a willowglass hope” is resonant but somewhat declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Questions of witness, continuity, and “transitional objects” between eras and realities are woven through the fossil, the Sleep, and Maren’s profession. The theme of becoming a voice for what cannot speak is strong and supported by concrete images (heat-signature emotions in stone, the elm as paradoxical bridge). Some thematic statements verge on explicit meta-commentary (“She was becoming its voice…”) rather than letting subtext carry them, which slightly blunts subtlety. Nonetheless, the final image reweights earlier details in a way that invites reflection beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic through-line—that wisdom and prophecy emerge from accumulated small, humble truths rather than grand singular revelations—is coherent and well-matched to the imagery of buttons and echoes. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit thematic statement (“The truth unravels…”, “She had learned that to spin a prophecy…”) instead of trusting subtext and scene to carry the insight. That directness pushes it toward didacticism and reduces ambiguity or moral tension. The resonance is genuine but feels explained rather than discovered by the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of hidden courage, rebirth after trauma, and “fixing what’s broken” in corrupt systems are woven through concrete images (burns, moldy basement, snow codes, tilt toward spring) rather than pure abstraction. The closing gesture and brightened mist offer a non-literal answer to the question of where courage resides: in action and trust, not in identity or surface. A few lines edge toward explicit thematic statement (“here was an opportunity to prove that her courage had not been burned away...”), which slightly blunts subtext. Overall, resonance is strong and coherent, if a touch tidier than top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    The themes of continuity, memory, distilled essence, and the palimpsest nature of promises are coherent and deeply woven through the needle, the river, and the act of crossing. The final realization—that carrying forward is itself fulfillment—reweights earlier material effectively. That said, the piece leans toward explicit statement (“The promise was never about geography but about continuity”) rather than letting images and actions fully bear the thematic load. The resonance is strong but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The thematic weave of kindness, memory, resistance to destruction, and the distinction between change and loss is powerful and coherent. Recurring particulars—the clay that “remembered everything,” the oasis’s stored gentleness, the lantern’s thrum, the bees’ legacy—organically support the idea that gentleness is an active, timeline-cutting force. The final realization (“change was not the same as loss”) flirts with explicit statement but is justified by the prior concrete experience and immediately grounded in the image of Mira carrying this knowledge back to her kiln. The piece avoids easy moralizing and instead leaves a resonant sense of responsibility and possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—waiting between loss and renewal, roots remembering what branches forget—is coherent and well embodied in the rosebush, the lock gauge, and the act of teaching the child. The story leans a bit close to explicit statement (“we can instill hope into even the darkest places”) but most of the resonance arises from image and action, especially the cutting tucked into soil as the harbor’s hush surrounds them. It avoids a pat moral by admitting uncertainty (“Probably” about the rose) and by not pretending the girl’s grief is erased. The final sense that something is “already stirring” under the ground offers a non-literal answer about endurance without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of extinction as transformation, reincarnation, solitude versus connection, and honoring the nonhuman dead are rich and organically threaded through setting and character history. Recurring motifs (tides, hum, sundial, ghosts/ancestors) all reweight by the end as she walks toward the “map of what might yet be born.” However, the line “Extinction, she saw now, was not an ending but a transformation” and surrounding sentences step into explicit thesis-stating, blunting some subtextual power. The emotional aftereffect is still resonant, but the ending would be stronger if more of this thematic insight remained in image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of connection, secrecy, and the shared architecture of longing are gracefully woven through objects and images—the spiral nest, the temple, the rain-cleansed world—rather than mere assertion. The central thematic turn, that her work has always been about weaving people together, reweights prior details effectively. However, the final paragraph starts to explain the theme directly (“She understood, finally, that she had never been merely a keeper of secrets but a weaver of connection”), edging into mild didacticism. A touch more reliance on image over explicit statement would deepen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of media manipulation, agency versus engineered discord, and the ethics of interference emerge organically from the premise. The choice to restore normal conflict rather than impose harmony is a smart, nuanced thematic move. However, the final paragraphs tend toward thesis-style articulation (“The cosmos was full of entities who wished to play games with mortal minds…”) instead of letting image and implication carry the weight. Subtext exists but is often surfaced as direct statement rather than left to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory versus forgetting, inherited rebellion against silence, and refusing fear’s limits emerge naturally from the quest and the organ’s long-echoing hymn. The idea that this is a rebellion “not against any enemy flesh and blood, but against the forgetting of things that mattered” is potent. However, the final paragraph states the theme in explicit, thesis-like language, tipping into mild sermonizing rather than trusting the images and actions. More implication and less summary would give the ending greater literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematic strands around memory, visibility, empathy versus justice, and the cost of unresolved grief are woven thoughtfully through quarry imagery, Elena’s face blindness, and the cold case frame. The idea of seeing “the architecture of emotion” and painting faces as they feel rather than look is a potent metaphor for how we remember the lost. That said, theme occasionally edges toward explicit thesis (“That was her gift to the living: not answers, but completion. Not justice, but peace.”), which slightly undercuts the otherwise organic emergence from scene and image. Still, the piece leaves a clear, lingering conceptual aftereffect that feels earned by the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of feminist erasure, institutional self-protection, and the politics of climate knowledge are tightly integrated with the plot and objects (maps as palimpsests, the nail as anti-erasure, “reversible exile” as a powerful frame). The story’s final movement reweights everything we’ve read: archives become a battleground rather than neutral storehouses. There is some explicit thematizing (“This was reversible exile…”) that verges on telling, but it mostly deepens rather than flattens meaning. The ending invites reflection on legacy and memory without collapsing into a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of disappearance, belated seeing, and forgiveness in fragments cohere through bridges, glass negatives, scaffold netting, and “pixelated amnesty.” The final realization—that recounting the story is itself the sculpture and amnesty—reweights prior images in a satisfying way. There is some explicit thematic labeling (“Pixelated amnesty, she would later call it…”) that edges toward thesis, but it remains grounded in image rather than pure abstraction. The piece embraces ambiguity around what exactly happened without sliding into vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme around territory as story and belonging as movement rather than stasis emerges organically from the father’s robber philosophy, the circus ecosystem, and the startup’s potential absorption. The closing line about “belonging wasn’t about holding still” nicely reweights the earlier images and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. At times the piece leans into explicit statement (“That’s what clean means to them—erasure.”), slightly flattening subtext. A touch more reliance on implication over articulated thesis would elevate the thematic sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme is coherent and integrated: knowledge as a sacred, shared burden; dreams and variable stars as parallel languages; insight as fleeting and in need of communal witnessing. The daylily and telegram help localize these ideas, and the final image of stars pulsing through generations has genuine resonance. However, the story often states its thesis directly (“The shared burdens of knowledge were never meant for solitary scholars…”) and slides into moralizing in the final paragraph, which undercuts subtext and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of failure, humility versus hubris, and transformation (“frozen confession,” “converting darkness into growth,” “discover what mirrors don't show”) are well woven through concrete actions like planting the flesh-eating seed to process toxic magic. The final reflection on mirrors and unseen grief offers a resonant, non-literal answer, though the thematic statements sometimes veer into explicit essay (“What mirrors didn't show was the truth behind the face”) rather than letting images alone carry the weight. The warlike serenity motif adds nuance to renewal-as-violence. A touch more ambiguity and less direct naming of insight would deepen subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of obligation to land, embodiment as constraint and gift, and becoming a bridge between what is and what might be emerge organically from the covenant, her rooted state, and the maze imagery. Recurring motifs—the clipping, scars, eclipse, “future arriving early”—converge in the final transformation without explicit moralizing. The piece invites reflection on agency in predetermined roles and the cost of visionary service, with a quiet but felt emotional aftereffect. Ambiguity stays purposeful rather than muddy, though the thematic argument is more affirmational than interrogative.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of grief, sacrifice, and the transformation (rather than erasure) of loss emerge organically from the barter premise, the Hanged Man tarot, and the orchard’s ecology of roots and bones. The closing idea—that “some holes could not be patched—only honored”—is slightly explicit but grows credibly from what she has done and seen, especially the image of her sister woven into the orchard. Recurring motifs (barter, inlaying meaning, fierce gentleness, the Hanged Man) shift in weight by the end rather than simply repeating. The piece avoids a neat moral by acknowledging both irreversible cost and a paradoxical feeling of greater wholeness.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of “after the applause,” persistence of sound/echo, and finding purpose in the wake of loss emerge organically from his specific history, tools, and objects. The grille cloth and amplifier accrue symbolic weight without feeling grafted on, and the final choice reframes artifacts as carriers of ongoing meaning rather than mere nostalgia. The last couple of sentences edge toward explicit thesis (“purpose sometimes survives… sound never truly disappears”), slightly blunting the otherwise subtle resonance. Overall, the piece invites reflection on grief and vocation with more complexity than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—understanding transition, reconfiguring ambition, and becoming a conduit rather than a monument—emerges coherently from the imagery of the tree, the seed, script evolution, and Elara’s role as translator. The final realization that she is “the kindling through which ancient knowledge passed into the present” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question. However, several insights are articulated in near-essayistic terms (“planted in understanding,” “physics of transition”) that edge toward explaining the theme rather than letting it fully arise from scene and image. The work remains moving and conceptually rich, but a bit more subtext and a bit less direct statement would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of identity as fluid, the dignity of rest, and wonder embedded in routine are coherent and organically tied to the premise. Recurring motifs—the tide, moon phases, smelting contradictions into book covers—nicely embody the acceptance of change without annihilation. However, the text leans into explicit statement (“This was how wonder survived”) and near-moralizing in places, which dulls some subtextual power. A slightly less declarative approach to the same insights would read more fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of emotional walls, latent radiance, and confession are coherent and reinforced by the bunker/cave contrast and the shells’ function. The recurrence of walls being built vs. dissolved is effective but also over-explicit in lines like “Not walls,” which edges into moralizing rather than letting the images carry the point. The final image of the pearl threaded with “abandoned hope” and the plan to send shells to their intended hearts does leave a resonant aftereffect. Complexity is somewhat flattened by the clarity of the thesis, preventing deeper ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematically, the piece coheres around breaking/continuing, non-apologetic flooding, and intergenerational mending, with strong image systems (river, ivy, accordion, patched bellows) carrying the weight. However, the story often states its insights directly (“She understood now why the maps had drawn her here,” “her motivation had shifted… to self-forgiveness”), veering toward explicit thesis articulation rather than fully trusting image and scene. The final acceptance that she is allowed “to flood without apology and to flow without end” is resonant but also close to a spelled-out moral. With slightly more restraint in abstract commentary and more reliance on concrete implication, the thematic aftereffect could be exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of unsaid language, delayed understanding, and time as a folded text emerge naturally from the watch, the cipher, and the library’s contents. The idea that “propagation delays between understanding and revelation were part of the cipher itself” and that “endings were merely beginnings spoken backward” offers a strong conceptual repricing. At times, the piece edges toward overt statement rather than letting images fully carry meaning, especially in the explanatory paragraph about the library’s nature. Still, the thematic weave is coherent, resonant, and clearly anchored in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from objects and events: gaps in provenance, plant memories, and the ice violin all embody “perforated destiny” and the possibility of letting light through constraint. The wisteria’s story about the countess and gardener deepens the question of control vs. freedom without explicit moralizing. The last line reweights everything conceptually, turning Elena’s life itself into an object whose fate can be perforated to admit light. The only slight limitation is the repetition of the phrase “perforated destiny,” which edges toward overtness but remains mostly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic throughline—beauty and essence persisting against oblivion—is coherent and arises mostly from image and ritual rather than explicit moralizing. The emerald as a vessel for a final, authentic self-expression carries resonance, and the profession-premise (beautician mortician) integrates theme with character nicely. Some lines shade toward abstract, thesis-like phrasing (“evidence that even in the face of oblivion, something beautiful could endure”), which slightly flattens complexity. More tension between preservation and letting go could enrich the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of forgiveness, duty, presence, and the non-finality of contentment are coherent and well-seeded in particulars (the garden, the hairpin, the ash tree, Aldric’s desperation). However, the story increasingly drifts into explicit thesis statements—“She had discovered that forgiveness was not a gift to the offender but a release for the one who carried it” and “contentment was not a destination. It was the cycle itself”—which read as direct moralizing rather than fully dramatized insight. The final paragraphs, while emotionally satisfying, state the theme in abstract terms instead of trusting the images and actions to carry it. This clarity is commendable, but the didactic edge keeps it from higher literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of nuance vs certainty, performance vs authenticity, and protected vulnerability are clearly woven through the profession, tools, and final lighthouse metaphor. The story earns some of its insights through concrete particulars (wind chimes as emotional language, the “cloak of doubt”), and the ending offers a resonant if gentle answer: doubt as a productive stance. However, several lines lapse into direct abstraction (“Vulnerability without protection was just trauma…”) that veer toward essay more than drama. The moral texture is thoughtful but not yet as layered or surprising as it could be at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme is strongly woven: delayed revelation, the ethics of withholding truth, cyclic transmission of knowledge, and vanishing-as-returning all interlock. The ripples motif meaningfully shifts from simple physical pattern to multi-layered temporal and existential insight. Lines like “revelation unearned is revelation lost” flirt with aphorism but are grounded by the concrete ripple experience and Mina’s future-vision. The ending avoids a tidy moral by emphasizing process and lifelong learning rather than completion.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central theme—that true navigation is an interior act of understanding rather than physical travel—is clear and coherently threaded through the arrowhead, pulse, birds, and bone towers. The final realization that she has found “something like peace” in stillness gives the piece a definite answer to its own question. However, the closing paragraph leans into explicit statement (“true navigation was not about…”) that edges toward essayistic moralizing rather than letting images and implications carry the weight. The thematic work is solid and resonant, but a touch over-articulated for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of automation vs. lived, sacred magic and the beauty of the forgotten are coherent and embedded in the imagery of lingering luminance, the keystone, and the garden. The final recognition that “the sacred… had never been in the grand manifestations” nicely reweights what came before. However, the story leans into explicit statement—“She understood, finally, that she had not been underachieving at all”—which comes close to essayistic moralizing and blunts some subtextual power. The aftertaste is reflective and pleasant but slightly over-articulated for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—about promises as living lights, the discipline of waiting, and revelation as reception rather than conquest—is coherent and organically tied to the images of lanterns, vows, and the ship’s name. The father’s cryptic charge and the reinterpreted “Cerulean Promise” anchor this thematically. However, some lines state the theme a bit baldly (“The color of sound was not something to be found but something to be received”), edging toward essay rather than pure scene-driven implication. Despite this slight over-articulation, the ending image reweights prior material in a satisfying, non-literal way.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of knowledge vs witnessing, humility before the cosmos, and retrocausal prophecy are well integrated with concrete motifs of coins, static, and contraction. The idea that “prophecy flowed backward through time” nicely reframes the act of understanding as retrospective recognition. However, the final paragraphs edge toward explicit thesis-stating (“her purpose was not to predict or to control but to witness”), which slightly flattens subtext into articulation. The thematic takeaway is resonant but a bit too neatly spelled out for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of grief as cartography, naming as a way of surviving fear, and sacrifice reconfigured as gift emerge organically from the atlas, the monsters, and Elias’s instructions. The final movement—naming specific creatures (*Elias’s Answer*, *The Echo of First Light*)—reweights the metaphor in a concrete way and leaves an emotional afterimage. However, some lines tilt into explicit statement (“this was his final gift to her—not a map of safe passage, but a method…,” “even death could be a kind of mapping”), which slightly blunts subtext in favor of articulation. The piece still avoids moralizing, but it edges toward essayistic clarity rather than fully trusting implication.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of patience, gentleness as strength, and the redemptive value of “inadequate” or modest power emerge organically from the water motif and the lukewarm magic concept. The recurrence of dripping water—first as observation, then as method, then as subtext in the final sound image—creates genuine thematic resonance. That said, the last paragraph leans close to stating the thesis (“not through spectacular magic or overwhelming power, but through the steady application...”), edging toward moralizing rather than letting the images carry it fully. The piece still leaves a satisfying, contemplative aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of institutional erasure, the violence of silence, and the resilience of memory emerge organically from the resurfacing town and Elara’s archival actions, with the sapphire label and photographs doing strong motif work. The ending’s assertion that “some truths would not stay submerged” reweights prior images in a satisfying way. That said, several sentences state the thesis quite directly (“silence was a kind of violence,” “The reservoir had hoped to expunge this town”), edging into mild sermonizing rather than relying on implication. This explicitness blunts what could otherwise be a subtler, more haunting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thematic core—true alchemy as a harmony between logic and wonder—is coherently developed through recurring images (crystal, birds, flame, waterfall) and Mira’s shift in stance. The final realization that she has been the crystal all along is a strong thematic image that reweights prior material. However, the text sometimes states its thesis too directly (“true alchemy lived in the liminal space…,” “represented everything she had studied”), edging into on-the-nose philosophizing rather than letting images carry more of the load. The result is resonant but a bit didactic for a top-tier literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of the watcher’s burden, trust under pressure, and the quiet heroism of attention emerge organically from duty, ritual, and weather work. Recurring images (the arbor, the buckle, the radio hum) support this without feeling purely ornamental. That said, the piece edges toward over-explicitness: phrases like “the watcher's burden” and “to watch is sometimes the greatest gift of all” verge on thesis statements rather than letting the images speak. The resonance is genuine but slightly undercut by that mild moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core thematic move—that numbness cannot be defeated by violence but only through accepting a complementary Other—is coherent and grounded in the final act. However, theme is often delivered directly in thesis-like lines (“You cannot defeat emotional numbness through violence”; “We were complementary opposites”) rather than emerging primarily through subtext and image. The “complementary opposites” and ego-death motifs do accrue meaning by the end, but the moral is somewhat over-articulated. Still, the last paragraphs achieve a genuine conceptual repricing of what unity and selfhood mean.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The thematic weave—innovation vs. standardization, patience vs. optimization, mysteries that change the solver—is rich and coherent, with the corpse flower functioning as an effective central metaphor. The seed’s slow/non-bloom and the escape rooms’ orthogonal design echo each other intelligently. However, the piece frequently states its ideas directly (“innovation couldn’t be manufactured, only nurtured”), edging into essay territory and reducing subtextual power. The ending image still lands as a resonant conceptual repricing, but subtlety is somewhat sacrificed for clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    Grief, silence, and the labor of tending to the unspoken form a coherent thematic spine, and the sound-as-healing motif is well woven through the ritual. The idea of macerating stillness and planting “seeds of remembrance” offers a resonant frame for how joy might eventually return. However, the piece occasionally tips into essayistic statement (“The core concept of his work—tending to the unspoken—was not something he had chosen but something he had become”), which flattens subtext into explanation. The ending image is thematically aligned but leans more on restating the premise than reconfiguring it.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of uncertainty, home/elsewhere, and threshold vs. prison are coherent and recur through garden, mist, and pendant imagery. The final reconfiguration—that true guardianship is “to make friends with uncertainty”—fits the story’s pattern. However, the piece occasionally slides into overt thesis-stating (“was the only true guardianship there was”), weakening subtext in favor of direct commentary. Thematic resonance is present but could be stronger if more was left to image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of creative destruction and surrender as the only unfailing “formula” is well-integrated with the crozier, the embers, and the frozen bloom, and the final act reweights everything that came before. The story’s images (broken religious tool, dying fires, frost on a leaf) support a resonant meditation on unmaking as necessary to genuine transformation. That said, the explicit line “the only formula that could not fail was the one that began with surrender” edges into thesis territory, slightly over-explaining what the imagery already conveyed. This small note of moralizing keeps the piece in a strong but not elite thematic band.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of renewal within decay, beginnings inside endings, and attunement to silence are well seeded through the towers-as-memorials, the Hollywood fragment, and the communities’ practical survival. The cosmic experience concretely embodies these ideas: perceiving the universe continually beginning “in every moment of ending” is a strong thematic image. Yet the conclusion slides into explicit thesis—“In every ending, she had learned, there was a beginning waiting to be found. You simply had to know how to tune for it.”—which undercuts some of the earned resonance by stating the moral outright. The piece invites reflection but would feel more literary if it trusted its images a little more and its abstractions a little less.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—finding home in transience, accepting a role as a guide between unstable states—emerges organically from Maren’s choices, the fractured world, and motifs like the empty hourglass and vanishing ferry. The final acceptance (“a permanent transient” with a “heart full of starlight and purpose”) coherently reweights the opening image of instability. The downside is a tendency toward explicit statement and near-moralizing in the last paragraph (“only the journey and the ardence that made every crossing worthwhile”), where the prose tells us the takeaway rather than letting image and implication fully carry it. Subtext is present but somewhat over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of perception, memory reliability, and the ethics of engineered wonder are woven tightly into every layer: her notion of “rational enchantment,” the sinew thread as connection, the lagging/anticipating mirrors, and the final collapse of boundary between made memories and foundational self. The ending’s realization—that she “would never fully distinguish between the memories she had made and the ones she had been made of”—reprices the entire piece with a clear conceptual cost. A few sentences verge on essayistic exposition of her credo, but they remain grounded in concrete practice. The thematic integration is strong, if a step short of startling.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of connection, inheritance, and self-reliant exploration emerge naturally from the chain link motif and the navigation imagery. The final realization that the aliens wanted to show the universe as a navigable sea rather than solve problems for humanity is effective and resonates with Mira’s grandmother’s wisdom. At times the thematic statement edges close to being spelled out (“not to solve humanity's problems, but to show them…”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the concluding image of holding steady against the infinite offers a coherent, non-literal answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of grief, echoes, and the ethics of listening are woven throughout, from “grief made scientists of us all” to the idea that objects retain frequencies of touch, culminating in the strong line that “the dead did not call to be answered—they called to be heard.” The hearing aid, atrium, and threads between worlds all support a coherent meditation on attention as a form of protection and on incidental heroism arising from routine duty. However, several sentences state the thematic argument quite directly (“Some heroes never intended to be heroic…,” “Some threads… did not need tracing”), edging toward essayistic gloss rather than fully trusting image and action. The resonance is solid and affecting, but a subtler hand with explicit thesis statements would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, connection, and what it means to “stand by the unremembered” are well integrated with cables-as-consciousness and the final ocean-as-library image. The closing transformation re-prices earlier material nicely, especially the idea that everyday communication leaves ghostly residue. That said, some thematic material is delivered a bit on-the-nose through Elara’s exposition (“The cables are memory itself…”), edging toward thesis rather than pure subtext. The piece still leaves a resonant afterimage, but with a hint of authorial statement where implication would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of algorithmic harm, responsibility, and the possibility of apology from systems are well woven into concrete particulars: death certificates, ghost protocols, buried networks. The idea that the architect wants to be remembered as “the ghost who taught that machine to apologize” nicely crystallizes the thematic question of how we answer for structural harm. Some lines approach explicit thesis-stating, slightly reducing subtlety, but the closing images (snow, heartbeat, observatory hum) restore resonance beyond moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of language death, translation as transformation, and the conversion of meaning into texture are deeply woven through motifs of echoes, bone, the flawed diamond, and the birds’ shifting “calligraphy.” The ending’s birth of a new language from dying words, flight patterns, and ancestral curse offers a resonant, non-literal answer about how loss can be transmuted rather than repaired. At times the thematic fabric verges on being stated (“translate the texture of the world into something others could hear”) instead of fully trusted to the images, but the integration remains strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of metamorphosis, scientific blindness, and turning bitterness into cosmic humor are rich and coherent with the imagery and events. However, they are often articulated directly in dialogue or narration (“bitterness is just cosmic humor that hasn't found its punchline yet”; “You're becoming the punchline that the universe has been waiting to deliver”) rather than allowed to fully emerge through subtext. The closing paragraphs clarify the thesis instead of trusting the images to carry more of the weight. As a result, resonance is present but feels slightly over-explained for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of transformation, the persistence of beauty under industrial erasure, and art as a means of reawakening are woven coherently through recurring images (bridges, the locust shell, statues, tarnished fruit). The locust shell functions as a strong thematic device, embodying the idea of shedding and continuing resonance, and its final absorption into the roots reweights earlier material nicely. At times the prose edges toward explicit statement (“for the beauty that had been buried beneath gears and efficiency”), shaving some subtlety from otherwise strong subtext. Still, the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—beauty survives as something to be re-tuned rather than discovered ex nihilo.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of borders, promises, and healing through small acts of defiance come through coherently via Marcus’s work, Aram’s need, and the storm bottle’s metaphor. The notion of “linking absences” as a way to foster connection is a lovely, specific thematic spine. However, the text sometimes voices its thesis too directly (“healing required medicine and metaphor in equal measure,” “That’s what a mailman does,” and the final paragraph’s explicit moralizing about where broken promises heal). The piece resonates, but the overt statements blunt what could be a subtler, more lingering aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of repair, the sacredness of fragments, and silence as fertile possibility are clearly woven through craft, setting, and the halo’s response to his song. Lines like “broken things were not ended things” articulate the thematic core a bit too directly, slightly veering toward statement rather than pure emergence. Still, the final image—him holding the fragment, letting silence speak while imagining a carousel built around grace—reweights his whole life in a resonant, non-literal way. The piece invites reflection on how vocation and attention redeem brokenness, though it could benefit from a slightly sharper edge or counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of analog vs digital memory, stories as physical and communal, and solitude-with-witnessing (“observed solitude”) are integrated and coherent. The scarf and architecture concretize the idea that narrative lives in matter and geometry rather than abstract data, and the ending reweights this belief via the grandmother’s love being newly sharable. Some of the thematic language veers close to essay (“the idea that stories lived not in abstract meaning but in physical form”) rather than staying fully in scene. Still, the emotional aftereffect is genuine and not purely didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of longing, memory, and the ethics of tending the dead’s dreams arise organically from the mechanics of the palette and Mira’s vocation; there’s no overt moralizing. The idea that “some of those dreams were still running, seeking somewhere to rest” underpins both her service to others and her eventual self-recognition, giving the closure genuine emotional weight. The final cadence—choosing to work on in the glow of her own contained longing—offers a nuanced, non-literal answer about living with absence rather than resolving it. A touch more friction or unease at that acceptance might deepen the thematic complexity further.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic through-line—fear as a prison around wonder, and the unlocking of ideas/secrets—is coherently built through the locksmith’s vocation, the abandoned garden, and the philosopher’s final act. However, the climactic theme line (“The only prisons that matter…”) states the thesis explicitly, edging into didacticism and reducing subtext in the final beat. Earlier images (the velvet pouch, sleeping tools, saturated air of secrets) do good thematic work without sermonizing. The piece leaves a gentle afterglow of reflection, but the explicit aphorism slightly flattens what could have been a more resonant, oblique ending.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: folklore as a vessel for stolen memory, the limits of empiricism, and the persistence of love and tradition despite erasure. The recurring images of seeds, constellations, and the fairy ring effectively refract the idea that memory travels strange, indirect paths. Some thematic lines are a bit overt (“The chronically curious become converts…”, “acceptance that some things exist beyond the boundary of proof”), which slightly undercuts subtextual power, but the final image of him planning more expeditions after a hard-won recovery lands with honest, unsentimental resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of exile, resilience, and the interpretation of trauma through archival work are woven through recurring images (shadow in glass, walking backward, tea leaves as geometry). The notion that “exile is not a punishment… it can be undone” ties concept and scene, and the ending image of shadows being returned to their sources reweights earlier details. However, some thematic statements are more direct than necessary, veering toward essayistic exposition rather than entirely emergent insight. The piece still leaves a resonant aftertaste, particularly around mentorship as an act of faith in survivors’ strength.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of preserving wonder and holding open liminal spaces is clear and organically linked to Elara’s work, the seed, and the orchard. Recurring images (color fading, branches between what was and might be, the “color of wonder”) create a coherent conceptual web. However, the text occasionally edges toward explicit statement—“To preserve the color of wonder—this had been her purpose”—rather than letting implication fully carry the weight. The ending offers a resonant but relatively simple affirmation rather than a complex or reweighted ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of breaking vs. bending, binding vs. unmasking, and the paradox of grounding by release emerge organically through masks, nets, and light without needing much exposition. The net-as-mask revelation and Mira seeing her younger self in the spirit create a resonant answer to what this sanctuary truly does. The final line—“Some truths could only be revealed in the breaking, and some spirits could only be grounded by being set free”—is thematically apt but edges into explicit thesis, slightly reducing the subtlety. Overall the piece leaves a strong, contemplative aftertaste with only a hint of over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of listening to silence, respecting thresholds, and valuing preservation over extraction are coherent and recur through concrete images (borders, torn maps, whispered chapel, reopened/closed vault). However, the piece often states its theses directly (“She understood that…”, “had interpreted the silence with empathy”), especially in the final paragraph, which edges into moral summary. The ending does reweight earlier material, but the resonance is partially delivered as commentary rather than earned solely through scene. Strong thematic clarity, somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of loss-as-transformation and the “physics of letting go” are woven through the deep-sea setting, the bioluminescence research, and the snow globe message in a satisfying way. Eleanor’s line “The light doesn’t die. It transforms.” elegantly crystallizes the thematic question in concrete, character-specific language. There is some near-explicit framing (“that loss was not an ending but a transition”) that flirts with overstatement, but it still arises from particulars of Miriam’s career and the note. The final resolve to find the daughter and maybe relinquish the deep offers a resonant, non-moralistic answer to the story’s question.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of communication across boundaries, persistence of art, and the need “to articulate unspoken needs” emerge organically from Mira’s actions and the ghost’s condition, not from overt moralizing. The resurrection of a predecessor’s music box into a bolt plate conduit, and the graffiti that only fully exists in dreams, elegantly embody how art survives in altered forms. Some sentences lean toward abstract statement (“to simply be heard by someone who could listen with more than ears”) but remain grounded enough in the specific context to avoid sermonizing. The final image—song as code and graffiti reaching “someday” listeners—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of whether expression can transcend time and death.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of hidden grief, private hope, and the ethics of seeing/keeping another’s sorrow are coherently woven through the goggles, diary, and ascent imagery. The movement from anguish (lost wife) to joy (secret daughter) and Mira’s recognition of “joy beneath anguish” feel earned by what she reads and how she responds. The final image of her bearing the goggles like a relic of entrusted sorrow lands with genuine emotional resonance. A few phrasings (“errand of mercy”) skate close to explicit thematizing but stop short of sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of absence-as-presence, memory in “empty” spaces, and grief as something rewoven rather than resolved are coherently developed through clouds, strings, and the gondola’s suspension. Particular images (dusty starlight, spiral clouds, broken vs rewoven strings) accrue meaning and are reweighted by the ending. However, the text occasionally edges into thesis-statement territory (“This was what she had been trying to prove since the string broke”), slightly reducing the power of implication and subtext. Despite that, the final sense of carrying a re-spooled wholeness forward is emotionally resonant and conceptually clear.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of preservation vs. transformation, pattern, and scale of perception emerge organically through the coin, the library’s architecture, and Mira’s craft. The ending’s idea that “some discoveries were about limits—the discovery that limits did not exist” neatly encapsulates the piece’s conceptual arc but veers toward explicit thesis-stating. Subtext around how knowledge survives through translation rather than archival stasis is strong and resonant. A touch more ambiguity or embodied emotional cost would deepen the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of translation, inherited knowledge, and finding pattern—turning “sociable isolation” and idle games into navigational insight—emerge organically from particulars like the phrasebook, the hopscotch board, and the murmuration. The final image reweights these motifs by showing how she has inscribed the discovery into her grandmother’s margins, linking lineage and future exploration. However, the piece leans toward a tidy, affirming takeaway; it lacks the sharper ambiguity or felt ethical/emotional cost that usually marks top-tier thematic work. The resonance is pleasing and coherent but not haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of repair as remembering, sacrifice as the price of revelation, and light emerging from eclipse accumulate organically from the images and Thessa’s vocation. The driftwood and eclipse motifs give the ending a gentle resonance: making things “whole again” is tied to continuity over newness. However, the master’s line about repair and the late realization that the rhythm was always within her tilt toward neat, slightly didactic wisdom. The thematic aftertaste is pleasant and coherent but not especially unsettling or complex.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of reexamining survival-driven priorities, the healing power of collective care, and the transformation from strangers to chosen family emerge organically through the garden and Mira’s persistence. The butterfly garden and bell nicely embody the shift from neglect to intentional nurturance without explicit moralizing. The ending rain and unfurling wings land as sincere and moving, if a bit tidy. Complexity is moderate: the piece leans into hope more than it wrestles with the messiness or potential losses implied by redirecting effort.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of endings as transformations, the beauty of flaw, and preservation of memory are strongly woven through the clock, the puppet, and Elara’s vocation. The broken puppet head effectively embodies “beautifully flawed” and partial, untold stories. Some thematic statements verge on explicitness (“endings were just transformations, that nothing was ever truly lost”), slightly reducing subtextual power. Still, the final chime and held breath offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise about how to meet an ending.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of inherited burden, duty versus desire, and systems that “do not care what [their] caretaker wanted” emerge organically from the orchard, curse, and blueprint. The image of a place that remembers pain (the wound-orchard, the endless herding of travelers) paired with Mira’s quiet, competent intervention has clear emotional resonance. The ending reaffirms a kind of earned stasis—she continues the work with a twinge of stirred feeling—but doesn’t quite reprice the premise or deepen her stance in a surprising way. Strong, subtly handled, but could push further into ambiguity or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of transformation, completion vs. abandonment, and separation-as-connection are tightly woven through polymers, foam, the chrysalis, and the braided ravine, giving the ending genuine resonance. The reweighting of the chrysalis from “missing relic” to “completed stage” neatly crystallizes the story’s central question about what it means to honor a legacy. That said, several lines move toward overt thesis (“All of life, she thought, was this…”; “The divergent path she chose was never really a choice…”) that slightly flatten subtext into statement. A bit more reliance on image and a bit less on explicit articulation would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of absence, silence, and the idea that stories are defined by what they omit are coherent and tightly braided with the imagery of bottles, moonlight, and dissolving manuscripts. However, the story frequently states its thesis outright (“The gaps told the truth that words obscured,” “in the end, every story was defined not by its words but by the mindful scattering of its silences”), tipping into didacticism. The ending does reweight earlier images in a satisfying way, but it leans more on articulated moral than on subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of grief, remorse, and the alchemy of art into communal healing are woven through specific images—flavors, tide pools, coral growth—rather than left at an abstract level. The idea that some memories “always taste like sorrow” yet can be endured and softened is a nuanced, unsentimental stance that feels earned by the preceding experience. Food choices (reconciliation tagine, forgiveness cakes, bitter-acceptance coffee) embody the thematic counterweights rather than stating them outright. The concluding sentence edges toward articulating the thesis a bit directly, but it still resonates more as hard-won reflection than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of rehabilitation, communal memory, and turning silos into gathering places emerge organically from recurring images (grain elevators, the clock, the donated weight, shared languages). The final chiming of the clock and re-emergence of the cuckoo offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of whether fractured communities can be repaired. There is a slight drift toward explicit statement in lines like “that silos could be transformed into gathering places,” but the piece largely trusts image and action. Subtext around immigration, shame, and intergenerational repair deepens the thematic field without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of abandoned aspirations, intergenerational dreams, and the ethics of attending to what others left unfinished are strong and coherent, with “archeologist of abandoned dreams” as a resonant core phrase. The entangled memories concept aligns thematically with her non-linear cognition, suggesting a mind suited to holding multiple unrealized trajectories. However, some thematic statements are quite direct (“what purpose had been revealed to her…”), edging toward declared thesis rather than purely emergent meaning. The ending image is evocative but leans more on concept than on a freshly reweighted, concrete particular.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of vigilance, the ethics of remembering vs. forgetting, and knowledge as pattern rather than static code are strongly woven through motifs like prisms, doodles, thresholds, and inversion. The final realization—that the combinations are “a way of thinking” rather than a simple key—reweights much of what came before without flat moralizing. However, the piece edges toward abstract, almost essayistic language at times (“true knowledge required constant watching”), slightly softening the felt, lived complexity. The resonance is real and thoughtful, though more conceptual than emotionally shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of communication across boundaries (human/nature, industrial/organic, silence/song) are woven through concrete particulars: telegraph history, stress cracks as “information,” and the grove’s response. The idea of “empathy in motion” sits a bit close to thesis-statement territory but is cushioned by the image of vibration as emotional transfer. The silent world’s hunger for music is shown rather than preached, culminating in the siskin’s tentative return to song. The piece invites reflection on how we listen to the nonhuman world, even if it edges toward neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of silence as language, beauty in difficulty, and eclipsed covenants are clear and reinforced through the eclipse, the nexus, and his vocation as a tutor of foresight and sacrifice. The final image reweights earlier motifs (eclipse, covenant, waiting) into a reasonably resonant answer: he will keep teaching in absence and ambiguity. However, the piece leans into explicit thematic articulation—“the most profound teachings lived not in what was spoken but in what was waited for”—that borders on essayistic moralizing. This slightly dulls the subtextual power that the images themselves already carry.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of empathy, nonviolence, listening, and the varieties of silence are coherent and organically embedded in the premise. The recurring motif of specific silences as frequencies is strong and gets reweighted by the final notion of “silence after celebration.” However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements—“The path to empathy… was not about collecting sounds but about losing them” and the quoted diary line—veering toward moralizing rather than purely emergent theme. This explicitness blunts what is otherwise rich subtextual work.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of patience, transformation, and wisdom that must be endured are woven through recurring images: the family doodle spiral, “patience blooms in strange soil,” and the corpse flower’s apparent decay masking transformation. The final realization—that her sensitive nose is a gift and that some wisdom must be endured—feels organically earned from the specifics of tending this flower. However, the story edges into stating its thesis outright (“Some wisdom must first be endured to be understood”), which slightly flattens subtext into moral. The complexity is gentle and sincere rather than sharply ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of resilience, ethical restraint, and the reframing of “weapon” as “key” emerge organically from images and choices, not sermonizing. The recurring idea that curiosity is “another form of hunger” nicely underpins her temptation versus responsibility. The echoes of prior explorers reinforce a communal, almost sacred ethic around protecting regenerative power from exploitation. The final paragraph edges toward a slightly neat affirmation (“ordinary miracle”), which softens the lingering ambiguity that might give the piece greater afterburn.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of pattern vs. “accident,” hidden mathematics, and institutional foresight emerge organically from her profession, methods, and environment. The convergence point functions as a conceptual hinge linking physical airflow, human systems, and moral responsibility for so-called accidents. The ending’s assertion that “some accidents were not accidents at all—they were the moment when the world’s hidden mathematics finally demanded payment” is resonant but slightly over-explicit, nudging toward thesis statement. Still, the story invites genuine reflection on causality and responsibility without collapsing into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of wonder as necessity, the sacredness of perception, and art as world-sustaining force are clearly woven through imagery (ice, chisel, aurora, bell-song). However, the ending explicitly states the thesis—“Wonder was not luxury… Wonder was the heartbeat of existence”—in a way that edges into moralizing rather than letting the images and events carry it. The conceptual linkage between Yara’s ritual and the distant sculptor is elegant, but the didactic language blunts some potential resonance. Thematically rich, but less subtle and earned than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of failure-as-process, witnessing vs. intervention, and sound/silence as moral stance emerge naturally from the particulars of the canyon, the flute, and her lineage. The final constellation of driftwood and the unplayed flute’s silence carry real resonance. Yet the last sentence slips into almost thesis-like statement (“the Relic Keeper's true task had always been...”), edging toward explicit moralization instead of letting the images fully carry the weight. This directness slightly flattens the otherwise strong thematic aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    The core thematic inquiry—whether feelings can be measured and transcribed as a defense against cosmic silence—is strong and organically tied to Maren’s craft and the halo fragment. Images of receipts, arithmetic, and borrowed personalities give the theme specificity and texture. However, the final paragraph leans into explicit statement (“She had discovered what she set out to find: that feelings could be measured…”) that edges toward thesis rather than letting the images carry the weight. The piece invites reflection, but the epiphany feels slightly over-articulated rather than fully earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of mentorship, memory versus myth, and the idea that “brief encounters were never meant to end” are coherent and arise logically from the premise and events. The final image of Elara as a courier of possibilities nicely aligns the external job with the internal thematic question. That said, much of the thematic work is explicitly articulated in Mira’s dialogue (“The pendant germinates what matters…”, “Now go. Germinate something.”), which drifts toward sermonizing rather than leaving space for subtext. The piece answers its own questions too neatly, limiting ambiguity and afterburn.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—places and objects as emotional archives, and the porous boundary between observer and environment—emerges organically from the recurring images of frost, quartz, and the dead woman. The final realization that Mira is becoming architecture herself offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial question about what remembers and how. However, several lines state theme rather baldly (“This was what she had been proving all along…”) where implication could suffice, edging toward mild over-articulation. The piece still leaves room for reflection about grief, legacy, and participation without collapsing into a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, generational obligation, the cost of being remembered, and messages that require embodiment emerge organically from the bead, the loom, and the orchard. The line “some messages could only be sent by becoming the message itself” is on-the-nose but earned by what precedes it, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer about what remembrance demands. The repeated motifs (raveling silence, bead, puzzle edges) deepen the idea rather than feeling decorative. A bit more specificity about what is actually being communicated could push the thematic resonance from strong to haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    The thematic throughline—quiet labor, resilience amid ruin, and the revaluation of “indifference” as a kind of permission—is coherent and arises organically from Cael’s choices and the planet’s condition. The final juxtaposition of arches’ indifference and Cael’s insistence on continuation offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how one lives after catastrophe. Some lines verge on overt thesis statements (“The truth was simpler and more tedious…”) that nudge toward mild didacticism rather than pure image-driven resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme around gift vs. wound, liminality, and the cost of perception emerges organically from the shard, her profession, and the multiverse structure. The final realization that she’s been withholding the truth from herself and that her “ability” is a permanent seam carries real thematic weight. Some formulations edge toward explicit thesis statements (“The truth she sought was not…”), slightly reducing subtlety. Even so, the ending image of purpose-in-burden rather than neat solace offers a resonant, non-trivial answer.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of remembrance, mourning, intergenerational duty, and nonverbal communication emerge organically from the stone stacks, letters, and sea glass rather than overt moralizing. The notion of the lighthouse “remembering its dead” and refusing to function until the loss is witnessed is a potent, quietly original ethical frame. Maren’s final act—“bottling” safety as an offering—reweights her job from logistics to spiritual stewardship. A few lines verge on explicit thesis-statement territory, but they remain grounded in concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of purpose-in-solitude, the entanglement of prophecy and causation, and “shaping a new dawn using ancient shadows” arise organically from the lighthouse, relic wick, and post-newspaper frame. The recurrent imagery of light, reflection, and laughter as world-shaping tools coheres into a meditation on quiet, invisible service. However, the text occasionally edges into telling its thematic stance directly (“his burden and his gift”) rather than letting it emerge solely from dramatized tension. The ending offers resonance, but because the conflict never sharpens, the thematic complexity remains relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    Thematic material around reception, transformation, and quiet attention arises from concrete images (dye, wing, light, heart) and coheres conceptually. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis outright—“The people who magnetized stories were not special by birth but by accumulation,” “Some people magnetized stories because they had learned to see value in every tale”—instead of trusting implication. This explicit moralizing flattens ambiguity and reduces subtext, especially in the middle and late paragraphs. The emotional aftereffect is gentle but somewhat didactic rather than resonant and open-ended.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of sorrow as measurable, the ethics of maintenance versus unmaking, and witnessing (especially what trees witness) are woven tightly through specific images rather than blunt statements. The sextant’s “measures sorrow now,” the dream-fragments-as-mass, and the bones under the trees all build a coherent meditation on grief as infrastructure. The final reframing—that to maintain a labyrinth is sometimes to unmake it—feels like an earned, non-didactic insight that reweights earlier details. The piece leans more into conceptual elegance than messy human ambiguity, which slightly limits its emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory vs. forgetting, communal continuity, and freedom-through-constraint emerge organically from the ritual and sacrifice rather than from overt moralizing. The final reframe—Elara becoming a “weaver of new memories” instead of merely a keeper—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the premise of a lightless, forgetful world. “Bound release” and the burning of memories for dawn complicate the idea of salvation with an embedded cost, avoiding tidy uplift. Thematic depth is strong, though the closing line edges close to explicit thesis-stating in its articulation of what she “was meant to be.”

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of paradox (presence/absence, staying/leaving, compassion/self-preservation) are coherently threaded through the library, the Society, and the Philosophy of Errors section. The idea that mistakes can be sources of wisdom and that one must sometimes withdraw to be able to return is earnestly dramatized in Mira’s arc. However, some lines verge on essayistic statement rather than emergent insight, as in “the heart does not require distance to find stillness,” which edges toward thesis-speak. The final image nonetheless reweights everything with a quiet, resonant answer to the initial dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—finding the sacred in ordinary persistence, and accepting “tenuous absolution”—emerges organically from action and image rather than overt lecture. The bread, guerrilla gardening, and butterfly all refract the same question of how fragile, partial grace can still matter in a world of ongoing decay. The final paragraphs carry a resonant sense of burden/gift without collapsing into neat moralizing, though some lines (“even the most tenuous absolution was worth the tending”) edge toward explicit thesis. Overall, the thematic weave is coherent, textured, and likely to linger.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The thematic throughline—magic vs. story, preservation of power vs. preservation of meaning, and the endurance of vows as narrative—is clear and organically tied to setting and vocation. The final realization that “the meaning she sought…was…in the act of seeking itself” offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise. However, the theme is sometimes over-articulated in explicit thesis-like sentences (“This was the true purpose of her calling, she understood now”), edging toward mild moralizing rather than wholly emerging from image and action. That explicitness trims the score in an otherwise strong thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of trust, betrayal, and “steadfastness” are woven through the father, the market’s hush, and the watch’s arrested time, with the closing suggestion that clinging to the object may force Mara to “capture the sound” herself. The linkage between silence, smuggler codes, and the personal cost of knowing the truth is nicely implied rather than stated. At times the language (“sound of trust breaking”) flirts with abstraction, but it’s grounded enough in dockside history and the father’s fall that it doesn’t drift into platitude. A slightly sharper embodiment of that “sound” in a remembered or on-page moment would elevate the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematic material—skepticism vs. belief, measurement vs. wonder, humans as weather systems—is woven through concrete images (ring, aurora, forests voting) in a mostly organic way. The final taste of rain as “possibility” is a strong, sensory embodiment of the theme. However, the closing sentence explicitly states the lesson about “some truths” and “the presence of wonder,” tipping into mild moralizing rather than trusting the images. This slightly flattens what had been rich, implicit resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of art as revelation, the damage of suppression, and the inevitability of certain callings are woven through recurring particulars: the broken lock, the unfinished face, the cave-light matching Elena’s vision. The piece earns its central insight—that the real secret was “in the suppression”—through dramatized memories rather than pure assertion. Some lines edge toward thesis statement (“This is not about completing her painting”), slightly flattening subtext in the final stretch. Still, the closing act of beginning to draw in that charged space leaves a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of candor in a world that survives on “rationing lies” is strongly embodied in the calligraphy, the postal plate, the unsent letters, and the师傅’s muteness, with “where lost conversations go” serving as an effective thematic hinge. The final image of the room becoming a garden again through gold leaf is a resonant, non-literal answer about truth as cultivation and inheritance. That said, a few lines verge on essayistic (“not a path to wealth, but a pilgrimage to honesty”), spelling out what the images already convey. The complexity is more lyrical than morally knotty—there’s little sense of the genuine harm that candor might do in this world.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematically, the story coherently explores truth as convergence of frequencies, the sufficiency of silence, and the preservation of wonder in a post-verbal world. These ideas arise mostly through images—kinetic sculptures, ancient ice, the valleys’ new languages—rather than pure exposition. Some lines verge on thesis statement (“This was the symphony of truth, not a melody but an agreement”), slightly flattening subtext into statement. Still, the final image of ongoing, wordless conversation offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s core question.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of fear, memory, caretaking, and identity (programming vs soul) emerge organically from concrete actions: keeping the box, opening it, absorbing the fears, and redefining “north.” Recurring images (roses, magnetic orientation, the box) are reweighted by the ending’s assertion of a new internal north and “fragmented wholeness.” A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“the only escapes that mattered…”) but they’re underwritten by prior dramatization rather than feeling like bolt-on morals. The piece invites reflection on how we carry and miniaturize fear without oversimplifying.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of listening, witness, memory, and the emotional freight of objects are rich and well-supported by concrete motifs (letters as “pressed flowers,” the mailbox’s “long vigil,” the thrift shop as “curation of memory”). The idea that healing requires stories to be heard rather than resolved is strong and fitting. However, several explicit statements (“The scratched lock… were breadcrumbs… that healing required witness,” “Elena proved something to herself… that listening was not passive but generative”) edge into direct moralizing, reducing subtextual power. The resonance is genuine but would be stronger with more implication and less spelled-out thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of reclaiming agency, encrypting vulnerability into armor, and transforming imposed silence into a new language (dance, code) are deeply woven into object choices (dice, journal), setting (web, lab), and structure. The final image of Mira stepping into freedom while the spider continues its web-building subtly reframes her story as part of a larger, ongoing pattern of patient resistance. At times the text edges toward explicit thesis statements (“These were not instruments of fate but of defiance”), which slightly blunts the subtextual power. Still, the thematic throughline feels organic to her character rather than imposed, and the conceptual reweighting at the end is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic threads of grief, memory, erasure, and custodianship are woven through particulars—the whale’s death, exhumed grave flowers, salt as crystallized tears, and the question of where deleted memories go. The closing realization that she “was the lantern lighter of forgotten things” offers a clear yet non-didactic answer that recontextualizes her long-standing compulsion. Subtext about communal shame and buried truths (“shameful moments… preserved in crystalline form”) enriches the piece beyond her individual arc. It flirts with explicitness in lines that near-thesis territory, but mostly lets image and situation carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematic work is rich: prophecy as vibration, fate as tunable noise, and silence as an ethical tool for listening beneath decree to human fear. The origami wing and the brook’s flow knit ideas of memory, lineage, and the transport of wisdom into concrete images that earn the final repricing. However, some insights are delivered in abstracted, thesis-like language (“the terrestrially cosmic truth,” “prophecy’s rigid syntax”) that edges toward essay rather than pure dramatization. The ending leaves a clear, resonant stance—that fate can be soothed into wisdom—without collapsing into a pat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of legibility, chosen ignorance, and the way places remember lives are woven elegantly through recurring images (desk seal, architecture grammar, meteor shower as “corrections”). The “agreed-upon lies” concept is not just named but enacted in their relationship and explicitly carried through the ending. The final image—continuing lessons with a tutor “present in the way that only the dead can be”—reweights the entire piece without flattening it into a moral. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“which was after all the only language worth knowing”), slightly reducing the subtlety of an otherwise superb thematic weave.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of memory as continuity, death as bridge rather than erasure, and turning isolation into a form of independence are strongly woven through the shell’s function and Elena’s life’s work. The recurring idea of resonance—acoustic, emotional, generational—nicely undergirds the thematic question of what can be preserved between generations. A few lines edge close to explicit thesis statements (“not as ghost but as gift”; “not as data storage but as continuity”), slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, though, the final image of Mira choosing to “complete the archive” delivers a resonant, non-moralizing thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme is rich and coherent: calibrated treason, generational courage, the ethics of preservation vs. erasure, and forgiveness of ancestors’ “unfinished work” are all integrated with the rose, stalactites, and the key. The final understanding—that she has unlinked herself from complicity and chosen restoration over vengeance—reweights earlier images. However, several explicit thematic statements (“Some truths, she had learned…”; “she had offered forgiveness…”) tilt toward sermonizing rather than trusting the images alone.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of identity, erasure, and the difference between surface mimicry and trapped selves are strong and organically braided through the echo motif and sound imagery. The notion that “to hear everything was to understand how much remained unheard” nicely encapsulates the thematic tension without feeling like a cheap aphorism. The final move—hearing a possible future self and stepping into the heart of the song—reweights the idea of echo as both wound and potential path to restoration. Some sentences lean into abstract generalization, but not enough to undercut the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of memory, grief diffusion, and ethical salvage (“to salvage something pure from the wreckage”) emerge organically from the dreams, the wreck, and the shrine without overt sermonizing. The child’s repeated presence in strangers’ dreams as a dispersed ghost of communal loss is a strong thematic engine. The ending offers a quiet but resonant answer: meaning is restored by deliberate, careful remembering and reconnection. The relative absence of on-page struggle or ethical friction keeps the thematic field more elegiac than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme is strongly realized: hidden patterns and unseen effort (nets, spiders, the craftsman of the whisk, Yuki’s unacknowledged pattern-teaching) weave through concrete images rather than abstract pronouncements. The story avoids moralization, letting the final synthesis—repair as reverence, pattern-completion through the whistle—emerge from particulars. The fireflies’ “small grief and small joy held in the same trembling light” is an especially effective thematic crystallization of coexisting loss and appreciation. The complexity is quiet but genuine, with no forced lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of truth vs. comforting narrative, how myths form around anomalies, and the idea of a “stillpoint” of reality around which lies orbit are integrated at a high level. The diamond as “curse” turned data and the orchard’s survival both concretize the notion that truth is neither punishment nor comfort, just what’s been collectively forgotten. The final paragraph articulates the theme a bit directly (“The truth, she had learned, was never a destination…”), but it still feels earned by the particulars. Subtext around institutional manipulation and the commodification of disasters into myth is present without becoming didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of science vs mysticism, the danger of rigid allegiance, and “ancient shadows” as fertile ground for new light are coherent and arise from Elara’s history and worldview. The reframing of shadows at the end nicely reprices earlier superstition/science conflicts. However, several sentences slip into overt exposition of theme (“Her allegiance had always been variant... loyalty meant nothing if…”) rather than letting events and images carry that weight. The resonance is strong but a touch too explained to feel fully organic at a literary-elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of translation, intergenerational memory, and redemption through connection emerge organically from the jars, Elara’s backstory, and the music box’s provenance, giving the piece genuine emotional resonance. The central insight—that he was always collecting relationships rather than sounds—reweights the entire premise in a satisfying way. That said, several lines move into explicit thesis-stating (“He had believed himself a collector of sounds; he was, in truth, a translator between generations,” “connection, the most permanent currency of all”), which pushes toward mild sermonizing instead of leaving more work to image and implication. The thematic arc is strong but a touch too neatly articulated to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of inherited duty, the union of logic and intuition, and guarding against unseen pressures emerge organically from Maren’s work with the crystal. Images of sound/silence and drifting/stabilizing ice support these ideas. However, the explicit summations (“marriage of logic and feeling,” “logically emotional, eternally vigilant”) tip toward didactic, reducing some resonance. The ending still offers a coherent, if slightly over-articulated, answer to the story’s thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of patience, deep time, and invisible horizons are strongly woven through setting and vocation, with the “patient revolution” serving as a unifying conceptual thread. The piece effectively revalues slowness and attentiveness as radical acts, and the ending reframes revolution as a long, almost geologic process. However, some lines slide toward explicit thesis (“revolution was never measured in seasons alone,” “see the destination in the journey itself”), which blunts subtext. The thematic resonance is genuine but a shade too stated for top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of historical erasure, institutional control, and illumination (literal and figurative) are coherently woven through the drought, the tunnel, Thomas Wright’s work, and the inherited lantern. The parallel between the Underground Railroad ancestor and Elena’s archival truth-telling has real resonance. However, several lines verge on overt thesis statement—“some truths needed illumination,” “Some lanterns… burned best when passed forward into uncertain but honest light”—shifting toward moralizing rather than letting images and events carry the weight. The conspiracy around civil rights records is asserted rather than deeply complicated, keeping the thematic field relatively straightforward.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of grace, deserving, apology-as-action, and the sacredness of repair are woven consistently through prison work, the mechanical heart, and the hidden inscription. The Marcus line—“Grace isn't about deserving. It's about what becomes possible when you stop keeping score.”—is on the nose but plausibly in-character for a chaplain and thus mostly avoids feeling like authorial sermonizing. The final music-filled moment reweights the entire story toward the notion of unseen blessings and non-transactional grace. A touch less explicit articulation of the thesis (“This was how apology became action…”) would strengthen the subtextual feel.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around curiosity as devotion, irreverent awe toward the universe, and the idea of calling/creation that precedes its audience. The kaleidoscope-as-language and bell-no-one-hears motifs work thematically and are reweighted in the final image where future recognition is imagined. Some lines (“To be awed is to be small before something large…”) edge into essayistic exposition rather than purely emergent meaning but remain in-character. Overall, the piece invites reflection without collapsing into moral or thesis, though the thematic complexity could deepen further under more pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of corporate erasure, digital afterlives, and the ethics of memory emerge organically from the archive work, ghost profiles, and the suppression of extraterrestrial contact. The recurring motifs—forgotten songs, the constellation patch, the recurring numbers—gain added weight by the end, especially when the patch’s stars reframe as a “door to leave open.” The story resists tidy moralizing, leaving Maren in a charged ethical posture rather than stating a thesis about what she ought to do. Some explanatory lines (“the lie that had structured Yuki’s disappearance”) lean toward summary rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight, which slightly dulls the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of peace vs. truth, the burden of seeing what others refuse, and the demand to “map empathy onto action” are woven coherently through image and decision. The final realization that some things cannot be made whole but can be used to strengthen fractured understanding offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. There is some direct statement (“peace was not the absence of conflict but the presence of understanding”) that edges toward explicit thesis work, which trims subtlety. Still, the ending image of walking out with the warm fragment and the softening ice carries genuine aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—endings as process, honesty versus clinical neatness, and the parity of courage between endurance and chosen departure—is strong and coherent, arising from concrete particulars (shipwreck bodies, ice, the heirloom, the clinic). The counterpoint between disaster relief’s raw endings and the anticipated managed euthanasia is especially effective. That said, several lines state the thematic thesis quite directly (“She had chosen disaster relief volunteering because endings were honest there”; “both choices required the same courage”), edging toward didactic rather than purely emergent meaning. The final definition of “the sound of approaching endings” is resonant but verges on being a spelled-out takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of love as a “beautiful mismatch,” the limits of passion, and the transformation of loss into rooted understanding are coherent and organically tied to vineyard and station imagery. However, several sentences state the theme in abstract terms (“love's purpose was not always permanence,” “to nurture intersubjective understanding”) rather than letting image and event fully carry it, edging toward essayistic. The final paragraphs still resonate, but the explicitness slightly dulls the afterglow. Subtext is present yet sometimes overshadowed by overt articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, stewardship, and the ethics of tending invisible structures emerge organically from concrete motifs: living boundaries, murmuring dunes that “hold what is given,” and clearings where wisdom settles. The notion that “the boundaries remember” reframes duty as reciprocal relationship rather than sacrifice, and the imagined future child provides a quiet, forward-looking moral weight. There’s no sermonizing; insights arrive as felt recognitions tied to specific practices. Still, the piece edges toward overt articulation in places, and a sharper on-page test of Mira’s commitment could have deepened the thematic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of grief, memory, and collective healing emerge organically from Maren’s practice and the recurring images of broken photographs and rusted factories. Many lines (“every pain deserved to become a masterpiece,” “collective healing was not a destination but a practice”) are thematically potent, though they edge into explicit statement rather than staying fully in subtext. The final image of her walking home, case “light with the knowledge,” offers a resonant if somewhat didactic articulation of the story’s thesis. Complexity is present but safely handled; there’s little moral or emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of language vs silence, growth vs completion, and libraries as organisms are woven through concrete images like the crystal, the migrating books, and the last dictionary. The final insight—silence as the most honest form of speech—reweights prior material effectively. At times the text edges toward explicit thematic statement (“The pattern of growth, he realized, was not about accumulation but about completion”), which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the conceptual aftertaste is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of aging, memory, abandonment, and the persistence of echoes accumulate organically via the objects (tapes, television, chair) and Mira’s vocation. The final insight about the sound of growing older as a “chorus” of tiny deaths and births reweights everything that came before without feeling like a tacked-on moral. Some phrasing edges toward explicit statement, but the density of concrete images keeps it from turning into sermon. The emotional aftereffect—tender melancholy shifting into earned peace—is strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of time, grief, control vs. acceptance, and the nature of “escape velocity” arise organically from the camera/clock/father triad and culminate in a potent reframing of what it means to repair and to capture the ephemeral. However, several thematic sentences (“Escape velocity is not about breaking free—it is about…,” “You do not grasp at what is fleeting…”) drift into explicit thesis, edging toward essay-like moralizing. The resonance of the final image is strong enough to carry the meaning without so much direct explanation. The story’s conceptual depth is high, but subtlety is occasionally sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of mortality, the sacredness of the ordinary, and being “broken but still useful” emerge organically from the objects and Elara’s work, with the vinyl shard doing heavy lifting. The idea of reunifying people with the “sacred ordinary” gives the hospice context a fresh, non-sentimental angle. Occasionally the text leans into overt phrasing (“architecture of grace,” “sacred ordinary”) that edges toward thesis-stating. Still, the final image reweights prior material without spelling out a moral, leaving a resonant aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of knowledge-as-practice vs knowledge-as-text, and of absences as folded presences (“sealed awakenings”) are organically embedded in the plot and given a satisfying conceptual twist: noon shadows as folded light in a bent reality. The ending offers a quiet but effective conceptual repricing—shadows re-understood, and Elara’s identity as scholar re-rooted in embodied experiment. However, the realization is expressed in somewhat expository, thesis-like phrasing (“The sealed awakening was not darkness at all but light, folded back upon itself”), which flattens potential ambiguity and emotional resonance. The piece stops at wonder rather than engaging a more complex tension (costs of bending reality, ethical implications, etc.).

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of ambiguous motherhood, the ethics of loving the “wrong” child, and fractures-as-windows are woven tightly through particulars like bone setting, changeling lore, and the garden’s history. The tooth-constellation payoff offers a non-literal answer to the central question: mistakes and uncertainties can be reweighted into navigational stars rather than erased. A few lines verge on explicit theme-stating (“Perhaps some fractures were never meant to mend…”), but they’re grounded in concrete memories and choices, so they don’t read as sermonizing. The emotional aftereffect is contemplative and quietly moving.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of loss, transformation, and learning to share light in new forms are well integrated with concrete motifs (sea glass, polishing, captured starlight). The final insight—that she “had never truly fallen at all” but been called to a different radiance—fits the particulars. Yet the closing paragraphs lean into explicit statement, edging toward moralization rather than letting the images and actions carry the full weight, which slightly flattens the lingering ambiguity and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of generational trauma, secrecy, confession, and quiet modes of healing emerge organically from the interplay of moss, water, machines, and family dynamics. Recurring images (moss, water, amber, hush) shift meaning by the end, supporting the idea of “grafting new meaning onto old wounds.” The piece edges toward explicit thematic statement in lines like “learning that sometimes the most quietly proactive thing you can do is simply stay,” but it stops short of full sermonizing and still lets image and situation carry much of the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    The thematic spine about failure, creative fear, and the dignity of unfinished work is strong and coherently tied to particular images (the fisherman’s empty net, the unwritten letter, the shell’s spiral). The final realization about spirals “never really end” reweights prior material in a satisfying way. Still, several sentences state the theme in direct, near-moralizing terms (“These were not failures but offerings,” “She was not too old to begin again”), which flattens some subtext. Letting more of this remain in image and implication rather than explanatory phrasing would deepen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of ancestral knowledge, right relationship with nature, and stories encoded in living things arise organically from the ritual and the golden threads. The conceptual move that plants “spin narratives” is fresh and ties well into both setting and action. However, the piece leans toward a tidy, almost utopian resolution (“the old practices would find their way back…”) without much complexity or counter-pressure. The resonance is pleasant and clear but not particularly challenging.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of death, memory, translation of emotion into enduring form, and the attempt to guide others “from breath to starlight” emerge organically from the objects, ritual, and grandmother backstory. The recurring motifs—storybook plate, withered vs. living orchard, safekept starlight—reweight nicely at the end without explicit moralizing. The piece invites reflection on how we map and preserve lives without reducing this to a thesis statement. It stops short of deeper moral or ethical friction (no real challenge to her belief in this work), which keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of wonder versus reason, reflection as method, and the ethics of “repair” versus repurposing are coherently woven through the locksmith’s craft, the cavern’s echoes, and the timer’s shift from clock to vessel. The final realization—that the device should “store wonder in the cellar of reason” and that the true win is finding a better question—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s implicit inquiry about how to engage with the unknown. Some lines edge toward overt abstraction and thesis-like phrasing, which slightly dulls the organic feel of the thematic emergence. Still, the integration is strong and lingers intellectually.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of communalizing sorrow, the transformation of burden into structure, and the ancient continuity of grief emerge organically from images rather than thesis statements. The final suggestion of a “whalebone reverie” moving through stone and stars reinterprets the grotto and her work as part of a vast, pre-human ecology of mourning, which lingers beyond the page. It stops short of a radical conceptual flip, but the thematic resonance is strong, coherent, and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of love-as-transformation, containment vs. wildness, and here/gone as a single breath arise organically from the lion-taming backstory and the carving. The ending’s image of her continuing the work under the rust-colored light is resonant and multi-valent. However, the explicit list “the lessons were these: that love does not disappear but transforms…” edges into direct moralizing and slightly flattens the subtext that was already well-earned. The piece would be stronger if it trusted its images more and stated its insights less.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of eroded ambition, ordinary failure, and becoming a ghost to oneself are tightly woven through recurring images (carousel motion vs. stasis, sediment in the camera, overheard abandoned futures). The piece invites reflection on selfhood and regret without resorting to moralizing, and the ending reframes peace as a function of giving up the trial, not resolving guilt. The line “I have collected enough proof that failure is ordinary” edges toward explicit thesis, slightly flattening subtext. Nonetheless, the emotional aftereffect is complex and lingers, with exhaustion-as-peace reading as an honest, ambiguous answer.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of renewal, belonging-as-return, and hope as a kind of navigation emerge organically from the sextant, the broken terminal, and the water-redirection project. The final image of equations as questions rather than solutions is conceptually strong and ties back to her engineer’s lens. However, the piece leans into explicit statement (“hope, she realized, could not be measured in linear time”; “Some equations…were not meant to solve mysteries but to pose them”) that borders on sermonizing. This stated thesis slightly blunts what the images themselves are already carrying.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of grief, time as a living entity, and acceptance over “closure” emerge organically from the clock metaphor, the sanctuary, and the relationship to the grandfather. The final realization—“peace…not the absence of grief but its companion”—is resonant and fits the concrete particulars of the scene. That said, the line comes close to thesis-statement territory, tipping from implication into didactic phrasing. Subtext is nonetheless strong in how the bear and the unfinished clock mirror different stances toward patience and impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of myth versus reality, deliberate erasure, and time as something that can be “read, inverted, understood” are woven through the sundial, the vanished canal, and her profession. The “architecture of lies” isn’t just stated; it’s dramatized in the idea of removing a river from maps and memory, and in Konstantýn’s complicity. The final realization reweights everything we’ve read, giving a conceptual repricing of legend-seeking itself. A few abstract formulations brush close to essayistic (“Her motivation had never been simple treasure-hunting”), but they stay anchored enough in concrete particulars to avoid sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of preservation, embodied knowledge, and inheritance woven into daily practice are strong and coherent, with nice mirroring between rope, seed spirals, and generational memory. Yet the piece often states its philosophy directly (“a philosophy of preservation itself,” “all knowledge must be woven into daily practice”), edging toward essayistic explanation. Subtext and image do some work, particularly in the dock/fog/seed parallels, but the ending risks feeling like a thesis statement more than a quietly earned, oblique resonance. The thematic answer is compelling but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of loss, evidence, healing, and “explained absences” are richly woven through concrete particulars: the thread as proof of vanished beauty, the garden as a map of sorrow’s movement, her job writing obituaries for the living. The ending offers a nuanced, non-didactic answer to the central question by having her choose to become one of the absences she usually documents, which conceptually reprices her entire vocation. There is some abstract language (“geography of healing,” “intimate projection into the silence”) that edges toward overt statement but remains grounded in image. Overall the resonance is deep and cohesive without tipping into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of preservation vs. life, beauty vs. control, and symbiosis vs. domination are woven coherently through the mechanical palace, the extinct bird, and the Genesis Engine’s history. The final realization—that the answer is integration rather than destruction or nostalgic return—nicely reweights all prior images and offers a resonant answer to the central question. That said, the theme edges into explicit statement (“It would require not destruction but integration…”) in a way that flattens some of the subtextual power. Allowing the closing insight to live more in image and action and less in spelled-out thesis would make it feel more wholly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of transformation (destruction into renewal, scars into song, choosing light over destruction) are coherent and well woven through sand, fire, water, and coin motifs. The lagoon’s re-seeing at the end effectively reweights prior images. However, the text leans toward explicit statement—lines like “proving that scars could sing” and “chose...to be a source of light rather than destruction” verge on essayistic moralizing. Subtext exists but is frequently surfaced rather than trusted to images alone.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of skepticism versus wonder, ethical responsibility toward others’ experiences, and patience across vast timescales are woven consistently through imagery (stars, fountains, breadcrumbs, memories-as-light). The liberation of the memories works as a concrete enactment of “understanding rather than solving,” which the final paragraphs articulate clearly. However, lines like “Some mysteries… were not meant to be solved but understood” flirt with explicit thesis, slightly reducing the power of implication. The resonance is genuine and thoughtful, but a touch more trust in subtext would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of generational inheritance, the ethics of illumination without destruction, and memory latent in obsolete technology are woven through object, setting, and final realization. The line “to share light without using fire” is close to thesis-statement territory but is supported by concrete imagery (no fire in the garden, bioluminescent blooms, the cold flame of intention). The gear’s “remembering” reweights the earlier notion of obsolescence into something quietly haunting. Ambiguity about whether this awakening is blessing or burden lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—grief as communal, mobile, and something to be tended rather than sealed—is deeply integrated through the vocation, greenhouse, ribbon, and butterflies. The final realization meaningfully reweights earlier images (stones as “way stations,” butterflies as bearers of longing) and offers a resonant if quiet answer to the initial question. However, several thematic statements are quite on-the-nose (“She understood now that her carvings were not markers of endings…”) and verge on essayistic moralizing. A bit more reliance on image and implication rather than explicit commentary would raise the literary charge.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of guilt, penance, time as both mechanism and metaphor, and the impossibility of full forgiveness emerge organically from Marcus’s routine and objects (pendulum, rake, inscriptions). The distinction between absolution and erasure, and between balance and restoration, is compelling and honest. However, some thematic sentences verge on essayistic exposition (“The absolution was not forgiveness; he had learned that incremental absolution was not about erasure but about carrying”), which slightly blunts subtext in favor of statement. Even so, the final image of careful descent with the rake handle carries a resonant, non-didactic answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of buried compassion, gratitude, and the desire to be understood after death are clear and organically tied to the cemetery setting. The idea of “uncharted echoes of a long-dead ruler's compassion” landing in the hands of someone who listens to the dead is resonant. However, some of the thematic work is told rather directly (“He had discovered the shape of intentions”) rather than left to implication. The nuance is modest but coherent and affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of ignorance as landscape, constraint as a crucible for innovation, and humility versus audacity are coherent and organically threaded through the images. However, they are often articulated in overt thesis-style sentences (“She understood that ignorance was not merely an absence but a landscape”), reducing subtext. The kingfisher metaphor does some quieter thematic work, paralleling pattern-trusting dives into the unseen. The ending offers a resonant image rather than a spelled-out moral, but the piece flirts with essayistic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, resistance, and the survival of stories under repression emerge organically from images—dust that remembers, cloaked songs, an ember alcove in a ruined city. Story-as-resistance and material culture as archive are suggested rather than sermonized. The final image of Mira “continu[ing] her quiet revolution” resonates with earlier particulars, though it edges toward summary instead of a new, sharper turn of meaning. The piece invites reflection but could deepen complexity by staging a more concrete ethical or emotional price for her work.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—memory as transformation, the mirage of familial safety, and the sufficiency of incomplete information—emerges organically from objects and actions (burning, shards, the gallery’s name). The image of ash filling the “hollow places where a face should be” is an excellent non-literal answer to the question of how we hold the dead. A few lines edge toward explicit thesis (“Incomplete information was all anyone ever had, and perhaps that was sufficient”), slightly undercutting the otherwise image-driven resonance. Nonetheless, the piece invites reflection without collapsing into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—truth vs power, the politics of historical narrative, and the necessity of preservation—is strong and tightly woven to setting and objects (sediment, logs, cog). The idea of “sedimentary layers” of story and artifact as a counter to “dangerously simple” official narratives is elegant and conceptually rich. However, the piece leans into direct statement (“my work matters because…”) and near-thesis language that edges toward essayistic moralizing rather than letting theme fully emerge through dramatized tension. The final image of leaving traces for a future dissenter is resonant, but a bit on-the-nose in articulating its own moral.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of vanishing arts, voice as danger and healing, and harmony as “subtracting noise” are tightly woven and recur in meaningful ways. The braid metaphor and the parallel between musical listening and listening past hatred are strong, specific thematic vehicles. That said, some lines (“This was the truth of vanishing arts…”, the therapist passage) state the thesis a bit baldly, edging toward essayistic commentary. The ending still resonates, but would be stronger with slightly more image-driven and less expository articulation of insight.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of embodied wisdom, resistance to institutional control, and beauty growing in ruins are well woven into specific images (pruning, soup spoons vs swords, the abandoned greenhouse). The conceptual reweighting at the end—rebellion as cooking and teaching in a reclaimed ruin—has genuine resonance and extends beyond the literal plot. Yet several sentences state the thesis almost directly (“This was knowledge that couldn’t be written, couldn’t be owned, couldn’t be controlled”; “Some rebellions are fought with swords…”) which tips into overt moralizing and reduces ambiguity. More reliance on implication and less on declarative theme language would lift this into a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of wonder, hope, and the spiritual dimension of technology are clear and integrated with the imagery of jars, storms, and children looking up. Elara’s role as a quiet preserver of meaning in routine is thematically promising. However, the text leans into explicit statement—especially Mira’s line “you preserve wonder in routine” and the didactic riddle—which flattens subtext. The piece edges toward moralizing rather than trusting images and actions to carry the depth.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, inheritance, and spaces as living archives emerge organically from the house, the orris root, and Mira’s way of noticing. The notion that some inheritances pass “through the body itself” is resonant and connects nicely to her grandmother’s craft and the house’s accumulated presence. However, the final paragraph states the thesis rather bluntly (“Houses feel alive because they are alive…”) rather than leaving more to subtext and image. The insight feels true but a bit over-articulated for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of duality, contradiction, and the danger of certainty are tightly integrated with foxglove, the garden’s ecology, and Thalassor’s transformation. However, the story frequently states its thesis outright (“certainty was the enemy of understanding”; “kindness without nuance was merely cruelty with good intentions”), edging toward sermonizing rather than relying on subtext. The best moments—like oysters turning irritation into pearls and coral being both animal and mineral—embody the theme without explaining it. The ending’s conceptual repricing is resonant but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of perception shaping reality, the uses of imperfection, and imprisonment as misinterpretation are coherent and well-seeded in the staircase, quantum, and chipped-die motifs. The final reframing of the staircase as boundlessness rather than a cage has conceptual resonance and fits the earlier setup. Yet the story frequently states its ideas directly (“her imprisonment had been a failure of interpretation rather than a failure of the structure”), tipping into essayistic explanation instead of letting subtext and image carry more of the load. The epiphany feels earned but over-articulated, reducing some of its lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of remembered kindness, continuity across strangers, and language as a vessel for gratitude are coherent and integral to the plot. The chain of small graces and the final inscription—“Someone was kind to me, and I remember”—offer a resonant answer to the initial loneliness. However, the piece occasionally leans into direct statement (“proof that kindness echoes even when its source is forgotten”) that edges toward moralizing where subtext could suffice. The emotional aftereffect is warm and hopeful but a bit tidy, with limited ambiguity or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of cultural memory, repression, and the persistence of craft are woven through repeated particulars: the emerald lens, beekeeper’s honey, bread-initials, and the waterfall’s divided light. The final image—carrying the beekeeper’s loaf toward the thaw while smelling both rosewater dread and rising bread—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: preservation requires risk and may outlast individuals. Slightly on-the-nose lines (“We will not let our arts die in darkness”) flatten the otherwise subtle subtext a bit.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of fate versus agency, the hunger of the future, and time as something that can be “unmade” are coherently woven through clocks, the hunger stone, and the yoyo’s stored excess time. The ending reweights everything: she doesn’t merely escape her death, she exits the grammar of causality (“language that had no past tense”), a strong conceptual repricing. There is no sermonizing; the piece trusts images and choices to convey its ideas. A more explicit friction between the human cost of erasing a destiny and the allure of freedom could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic core—that fear is a door rather than a monster, and its power lies in resistance—is coherent and woven through the grandmother’s secret, the paradoxical dictionary, and Clara’s final stance. However, theme is often stated outright (“fear was not a monster but a door,” “fear had revealed its weakness: it could only hold power over those who resisted it”), edging into moralizing rather than letting image and action fully carry it. The recurrence and reweighting of the clasp, mirrors, and photographs do provide genuine subtext and resonance, particularly in the final wallet check. The ending offers a clear answer to the central question, but with less ambiguity or complexity than a top-tier literary venue typically demands.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of transformation (obstacle into instrument, destruction into harmony) and communion with a larger system (the sea’s conversation) emerge clearly from specific actions, especially the wave-as-cymbal moment. The recurring idea of doubling/dub and layered resonance supports a meditation on depth beneath surfaces. However, some thematic lines are quite explicit—“to see obstacles not as impediments but as instruments waiting to be played” tips into thesis-statement territory. The ending leaves a gentle, reflective aftertaste, but the moral complexity is relatively light.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory versus forgetting, decay, institutional denial, and the danger/necessity of questioning are woven through the turtles’ dreaming shells, the rusted gate, the Council’s narrative, and Mira’s pattern work. The lost expedition and the watchers act as thematic mirrors around what it means to look away or refuse an unsatisfying official story. The final glowing spiral reweights prior images of dead or fading patterns, suggesting that suppressed truths can be reawakened at real risk. The resonance is strong but still in the early, suggestive phase rather than fully complicated or repriced.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of noble lies, communal identity, and the ethics of historical memory are central and coherent, with some elegant images (ivy reclaiming stones, soil carrying seeds) supporting them. However, the story leans heavily on explicit thematic exposition (“noble lies functioned as the mortar that held collective identity together”), which tips it toward essay rather than letting meaning fully emerge from scene and image. The final paragraph in particular states the moral calculus directly instead of leaving more room for subtext. The complexity of the dilemma is acknowledged, but the handling edges into didactic rather than quietly resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme is strong and coherent: absence as a readable residue, unfinished work, and the persistence of intention in abandoned places. The inkwell inscription, the submerged pavilion, and Maren’s practice of hiding notes in the foundation all braid into a clear meditation on “hushed blaze” and conversation across time. Some lines tilt toward direct statement (“She wanted to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams,” “It was not grave robbing; it was conversation across time”), edging into essayistic clarity rather than pure subtext. Even so, the ending reweights the earlier images effectively, giving a satisfying and resonant conceptual afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story’s thematic throughline—truth preserved in margins, bureaucracy as both suppressor and secret shelter, silence as a medium of resistance—is coherent and grows organically from particular images (ink stamp, marginalia, submerged city, blackout). The founders’ cunning and the idea of a “secondary archive within the primary one” give the theme specificity beyond generic “truth will out” platitudes. Some sentences edge toward explicit thesis (“The library was not simply a repository…”), which slightly flattens subtext. Still, the final resolve to annotate the margins of history offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: light requiring shadow, grief as both wound and medium, dreams as vessels for the dead. Recurring motifs (cranes, gems, shadows, twilight) genuinely shift weight by the end, especially in the image of “containers for what you’d lost” as a definition of living. The piece avoids sermonizing, though some lines (“this was what it meant to live…”) come close to thesis statements rather than letting image alone carry meaning. Overall, it leaves a strong, complex aftertaste about art, memory, and mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of randomness, survivor guilt, and the ethics of “unused potential” are woven through concrete motifs: the geode, the cooling circuitry, the wedding/strike timing. The final image reweights the premise—life as a node in an indifferent calculation—into a stance that finds “bleak exhilaration” in searching without hope of closure. However, the thematic layer is at times very explicit (“That’s what I’m hunting. Not closure, not meaning, not the false comfort of purpose.”), which slightly undercuts subtext and mystery. The piece still leaves rich conceptual aftertaste, but with a touch of essayistic declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of belonging, faith vs. systems of knowledge, and being one’s own “missing piece” are woven coherently through the observatory, the pilgrim’s message, and Mira’s history of surprised perception. The final image—stars as legible letters in a language she can now read—nicely reweights earlier details. However, the ending edges toward explicit thesis (“The frequency of belonging was not something to be decoded and possessed… She had been the missing piece all along”), which flattens ambiguity. The resonance is strong but could be more earned and less explained, especially given the modest escalation of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of manufactured memory, the ethics of comforting lies, and the commodification of identity are woven cohesively through profession, setting, and family betrayal. The driftwood messages from the “silenced” and the watch hand as an anchor to suppressed truth offer concrete, resonant images supporting these ideas. However, lines like “some memories could not be unmanufactured—they could only be survived” verge on explicit thesis, slightly undercutting the power of the images to do that work alone. The ambiguity around whether her mother’s choice was mercy or violence adds welcome complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of inherited conflict, recycling mistakes into wisdom, and the difficulty of letting go are well-integrated with the imagery of twin drawer pulls, neutral territory, and the dark-to-emergent moon. The final moment—a quiet shared stance “between apology and forgiveness”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question about what it takes to end a generational pattern. Some thematic lines lean toward explicit statement (“you cannot keep cycling through the same motions hoping for different results”), edging into essayistic rather than purely scene-driven resonance. Even so, the actions and images do most of the heavy lifting, preventing outright sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—finding new ways to move forward when old identities and expectations have collapsed—emerges organically from Elara’s disabled navigation and years of regret-driven retreat. The interplay of compass vs utility poles, stars vs land markers, and movement vs stillness creates subtext without heavy allegory. Some thematic lines verge on explicit statement (“That was the thing about regrets, she was learning…,” “She was aligning heart and action, she realized”), slightly flattening what the images already carry. Nonetheless, the final image of paddling into gathering light with “faith flickering but not yet extinguished” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of memory, guilt, choice, and self-authored morality are well integrated: the “clean slate,” labyrinth, baseball, and bioluminescent organisms all echo ideas of time, consequence, and fragile resilience. The final synthesis of “jaded wonder” versus innocence feels nuanced rather than moralistic, and the idea that empathy can grow from present awe rather than past shame is a fresh, resonant take. At times the thematic apparatus is overarticulated—phrases like “this labyrinth was not merely physical but philosophical” and the explicit labeling of synthesis edge toward thesis rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. Still, the piece invites reflection beyond the scene and avoids tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of love outlasting death, transformation as expansion rather than sacrifice, and bonds refined by loss are coherent and well-woven with the phoenix and scent motifs. However, the piece leans into explicit theorizing—e.g., “Death did not end bonds; it refined them”—which edges toward sermonizing rather than letting images and choices carry the weight. The fortune cookie line is a nice thematic device but is explained rather than allowed to resonate in silence. The ending offers a clear, resonant stance, but with less ambiguity and textural complexity than top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of regret, sacrifice, irreversible time, and the nature of forgiveness are woven organically through the cloth, the saucer, and the cloudbound setting. The central insight—that some debts are paid by acceptance, not accumulation—fits her specific journey and reweights prior images. However, the final paragraph tips into essayistic moralizing (“the simple truth that some debts are paid…”) rather than fully trusting image and action to carry the resonance. The piece remains affecting, but the thematic statement could be subtler to reach top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of compassion vs violence, grief alchemized into connection, and “shadow work” as integrating fractured selves are well woven through the concrete acts of stitching and the charged objects. The Kwan Yin tear, dried human tears, and the web of faces create a strong image-chain that supports the idea that preserved sorrow can unlock new realities. Some thematic phrasing (“shadow work,” “condensed compassion”) edges toward explicit articulation rather than leaving everything to subtext, but it doesn’t slide into sermonizing. The final step through the opened dimension offers a resonant, non-literal answer: integration and chosen compassion are the true engine of transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thematic material around transformation, non-possession of beauty, and unintended prophecy is rich and well-sutured to images of jars, fire, and celestial motion. The final realization that she has “become” transformation ties the journey together in a resonant way. However, the explicit thesis spelled out by lightning bugs—“transformation is not a destination but a continuous becoming…”—reads like direct moralizing and undercuts some subtextual power. The piece would feel more elite-tier if it trusted its images to carry that insight instead of articulating it so literally.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of knowledge versus authoritarian control, light versus shadow, and resistance encoded in overlooked structures are well woven through sundial, blackout, and “cradle of sparks” imagery. The idea that geometry and old knowledge outlast censorship emerges organically from the plot. The final paragraph edges close to thesis-statement territory (“an idea whose time had finally come”), but the imagery of kindling enduring illumination largely carries the weight. Overall, the piece invites reflection without collapsing into pure moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of connection versus control, pattern as a sacred rather than exploitative language, and transforming curse into altered vision emerge organically from the events and recurring images (promise, sequences, borrowed dawn). The final realization—that she has “harnessed nothing and everything” and that the promise becomes a wing instead of a weight—reweights the entire premise without sliding into overt moralizing. Some formulations (“the sacred patterns that held the world together”) brush close to abstraction, but they’re supported by enough concrete pattern-work to stay grounded. The piece invites reflection on how we relate to systems we can’t control, with a lingering, non-tidy resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of censorship, self-erasure, naming as resistance, and scars as “cartography” are coherently developed through recurring concrete objects (timer, envelope, timetable, glass). The realization that her scars are “not endings but cartography” and that some developments “needed darkness before [truth] could emerge” reweights prior material and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to live after silencing. At times the piece edges toward explicit thematic statement (“the act of naming was itself a form of resistance”), slightly reducing subtextual subtlety. Still, the final image of ephemeral verse on misty glass lands with genuine conceptual and emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.3)
    The piece has a coherent thematic spine about knowledge as a living process versus rigid doctrine, and the ending image of the brook and sundial reinforces this. Yet the theme is heavily over-articulated in expository narration (“turning questions into destinations,” “he had fenced not to conquer but to convert”) instead of emerging primarily from dramatized conflict and subtext. This explicit moralizing blunts complexity and reduces lingering ambiguity. The resonance is present but somewhat didactic for elite-literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—the idea of “blooming resistance” as creating meaning and beauty in dehumanizing systems—emerges organically from the particulars: the unused library, the secret poems, Delphine’s forgotten music, and the act of rebuilding the shelves. The final image of the “small cathedral of pages” and books awaiting the next reader offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question. The line explicating blooming resistance as “not a plan or a conspiracy but something simpler and more difficult” edges toward thesis, slightly flattening subtext into statement. Overall, though, thematic integration is strong and emotionally honest without sliding into overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Time, memory, and defiance of fate are woven through concrete motifs: the frozen anniversary clock, unwound mechanism, compasses, “concert that had never happened,” and the encore framing. The tidal arbor as a place where “condensation and memory” form tides nicely literalizes the emotional premise, and the final act of playing Clara’s requested piece reframes his routine as a quiet rebellion rather than simple mourning. There are no explicit moral pronouncements; the theme emerges through image and action. A few phrases (“surprise fate with an unplanned encore”) flirt with being a little too on-the-nose, slightly reducing subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, cultural continuity, verification versus trust, and knowledge as a living, communal process emerge organically from the seed, the profession of “reality checker,” and the ritual rather than from imposed allegory. The ending’s insight—that some truths must be trusted rather than empirically verified, and that memory should be scattered like seeds—reweights earlier details in a satisfying way. However, several lines approach explicit thesis-statement territory (“some things could not be verified, only trusted”), which slightly flattens what might otherwise be a more powerfully implicit resonance. The story still invites reflection beyond its wordcount, but occasionally tells the reader what it has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of unspoken apology, regret, and gradual forgiveness are coherently developed through concrete motifs (post-rain light, bonsai shaping, changing lace pattern, compass orientation). The ending image—“the color of the sky after the storm”—reweights earlier blue imagery in a satisfying way. However, the text edges toward explicit thematic statement (“Forgiveness, he had learned from his trees…”) and a thesis-like final sentence that slightly undercuts subtext-driven resonance. There is genuine emotional aftereffect, but the insight is delivered a bit more directly than top-tier literary venues typically prefer.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit telling, particularly in the final two paragraphs ("In the end, she understood...", "reminder that..."). This heavy-handed moralizing at the closure robs the narrative of subtextual resonance, reducing a potentially complex realization to a summarized lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic integration is excellent; the metaphor of glass blowing—beauty born of fire and resistance—parallels Mira’s emotional arc perfectly. The concept of the ledger as a "scorched testament" resonates well with the conclusion without feeling heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies on a "Thematic Echo" at the closure, explicitly summarizing its thesis ("she... had become the translator they needed") rather than letting the image resonate on its own. The insight is stated rather than dramatized, reducing the interpretive depth to a moral lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of restoration is coherent but delivered through explicit telling ("felt almost like purpose restored") rather than emerging from subtext. The emotional resolution lands clearly but feels engineered, lacking the resonance that comes from a harder-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story ends with explicit moralizing ("Sanctions would end eventually, as all cruelties eventually do"), which flattens the subtext. The theme is delivered as a sermon/lesson rather than emerging organically from the narrative pressure, violating the "show, don't tell" principle of resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lecture ("Unused love, she understood then, was not stored in any heaven") rather than subtext, triggering the "Thematic Echo" penalty. This didactic approach explains the meaning to the reader instead of allowing it to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The thematic integration of time, geometry, and memory is resonant and sophisticated. The metaphor of the garden as an "argument about consciousness" anchors the narrative deeply, though the score is capped by the Q2 ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of real value (seeds) vs. fake value (prizes) is well-integrated through the setting's subtext. However, the ending leans into abstract summary ("illusion of ending," "catechism of resilience") rather than letting the concrete actions resonate on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of "negative space" and the sound of absence is handled with sophistication and coherence. The ending shifts into slightly sentimental territory ("color of hope," "word they had forgotten"), which blunts the sharper, more melancholic insights established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("the only true theft was the failure to listen..."), summarizing the theme rather than letting it resonate through the action. This didactic approach flattens the subtext significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit explanation ("A space made solid... a zone of safety") rather than subtext. The constant parallel between the ice outside and the heart inside is heavy-handed and leaves little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the final paragraph ("vulnerability, fully embraced, was the ultimate strength"), converting subtext into a lecture. This overt statement flattens the narrative resonance and violates the "show, don't tell" standard for thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("greatest truths were not spoken," "not something to fear but something to inhabit") rather than emerging organically from the action. This explanatory heavy-handedness flattens the potential resonance of the map concept.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is coherent but resolved through explicit statement in the final paragraph ("Unit 7-Kappa understands... that the answer... lies not in finding a source"). This "Thematic Echo" flattens the subtext, transforming a resonant ending into a summary of the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is explicitly stated in essayistic passages ("words... became contaminated," "honesty... might finally be enough") rather than emerging from subtext. This over-articulation acts as a Thematic Echo, reducing the resonance of the final image by explaining its meaning to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of patience versus commercial measurement is coherent and resonates through the marble motif. However, the thematic delivery leans toward the didactic ("That was the truth... never understood"), asserting meaning rather than letting it emerge solely from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of temporal perception is coherent but delivered through explicit statements rather than subtext. The ending summarizes the theme ("Time had revealed its sideways nature") rather than letting it resonate through the image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial assertions ("music existed in its purest form—as transmission") rather than subtext. The resolution relies on a sentimental declaration of sufficiency ("that was enough") rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of imperfection ("margins," "smudge," "fault tolerance") coheres beautifully across character, object, and setting. The concept of "holding truth gently" rather than swallowing it is a resonant conceptual repricing that gives the ending genuine weight without feeling moralistic.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of unburdening swallowed truths is coherent and resonates in the final image. The execution is slightly heavy-handed with phrases like "poisoned everything she touched," but the conceptual closure aligns well with the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.6)
    Themes of decay and witnessing are coherent but delivered through didactic assertion rather than dramatized experience. The text tells the reader what to feel ("judgment dissolved," "clinging to certainty") rather than evoking it through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is articulated explicitly ("preservation of wonder," "ordinary magic") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The ending moralizes the experience ("Wonder required protection"), which flattens the potential for ambiguity or deeper resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central theme—narrative and dreams as the structural support of reality—is well-integrated and delivers a resonant ending. The "displaced axis" serves as an effective metaphor for a world without wonder, and the final realization ("spin a new axis") earns the thematic weight without becoming preachy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    The thematic synthesis of espionage and prophecy is excellent, exploring the idea that both trades rely on decoding hidden patterns. The story allows this theme to emerge organically through Elias's actions rather than overt moralizing, culminating in a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    The thematic synthesis of "presence" (via the crimson paint) and "interrogation" (via the exorcism method) is sophisticated and organically woven. The story explores the nature of focus and assumption without descending into dry exposition, anchoring abstract ideas in the palette.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of "chronological homesickness" and "permission vs. prediction" is poignant and well-handled. However, the actual text of the fortune cookie ("The symphony you hear...") veers into explicit moralizing, stating the subtext aloud. The resonance is strong, but the delivery is a bit heavy-handed at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures from the narrator ("She understood now why... it was a psychological one," "the only way through was through"). This didactic approach eliminates subtext, turning the story into an explanation of its own meaning rather than a dramatization of it.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies on an explicit moral summary in the final paragraph ("silence was not an ending but a different beginning") to convey its meaning. This direct statement flattens the subtext, doing the interpretive work for the reader instead of allowing the theme to resonate through the imagery itself.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of "witnessing" is strong, but the story relies on explicit explanatory telling in the penultimate paragraph ("Her motivation crystallized... chosen a life of solitude not from misanthropy") rather than letting the action carry the subtext. This over-articulation flattens the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.0)
    Subtext is flattened by explicit moralizing in the final section, where the story defines its theme directly ("grief is just the shape of caring..."). This "Thematic Echo" violates the "show, don't tell" principle and reduces the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of liminality and the artist as a bridge is well-developed and resonant. The ending successfully reframes the central question without delivering a simplistic moral, though the thematic connection is occasionally stated too explicitly in the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding resilience in broken things is poignant, but the execution suffers from a heavy-handed Thematic Echo in the final paragraph. Explicitly stating that "She had come here to find beauty in the unfinished, and she had found it" summarizes the subtext that the scene had already successfully dramatized, deflating the ending's power.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of "useful fiction" versus emotional truth is articulated clearly, though the ending leans into explicit statement ("half truths had always been whole lies") rather than subtextual resonance. The resolution ties up the thematic threads neatly but lacks the friction of a more complex outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of invisible labor is coherent and resonant but is articulated too explicitly ("understanding that every visible success rested on invisible hands"). The final sentence serves as a thematic summary rather than allowing the subtext to linger, triggering the thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central theme of reciprocal community is resonant, and the "Threader" as a collective practice is a strong concept. However, the story explicates its moral in the final paragraphs ("understood... required her to be present"), turning subtext into text and reducing the thematic power.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of preservation is consistent but delivered through explicit statements rather than subtextual resonance. The ending reduces the thematic question to a tidy procedural victory, lacking the ambiguity or emotional residue required for higher impact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme is poignant but undercut by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("the point was simply to keep looking..."). This summarization flattens the resonance of the final image, telling the reader what to feel rather than letting the offering speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is preached through explicit narrator commentary ("not debris but a covenant," "this, too, is a kind of visibility") rather than emerging from action. The ending explicitly states the moral, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of metamorphosis is coherent and well-integrated into the plant imagery throughout. However, the ending explicitly articulates the thesis in the dialogue summary ("admitted... that transformation required appetite"), which functions as a "Thematic Echo" and reduces the implicit power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of shifting values in survival is resonant but heavily over-articulated in the final paragraphs. The narrative explicitly summarizes its own meaning ("simple transaction between two survivors who recognized each other's hunger to thresh meaning"), which flattens the subtext into a moral statement rather than letting the action speak.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of "presence over prediction" lands effectively, but the execution is overly explicit. The narrative articulates the thesis directly ("The future was not a country to be mapped... It was a garden to be tended") instead of letting the subtext carry the weight, reducing the interpretive resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of restoration is coherent, but the ending explicitly articulates the moral in summary ("It was a promise..."), flattening the subtextual resonance. The story tells the reader what the valve means instead of letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("courage was just another path to be mapped"), which flattens the subtext. The theme is stated rather than emerging organically from the conflict, resulting in a didactic conclusion that explains the meaning to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit narration ("Mira understood then...") rather than emerging organically from subtext and action. The story relies on explaining its moral ("kindness often opened doors") instead of trusting the dramatization to convey the message.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme is explicitly summarized in the final paragraphs ("Goodbye was not an ending but a doorway"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the resonance into a stated moral lesson rather than an earned, ambiguous experience (-0.8 penalty).

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of trading honesty for trust and repurposing tools of deception is coherent and lands with a resonant final image. The "mathematics of a fair trade" provides a strong intellectual spine that elevates the resolution, even if the plot mechanics are simple. The ending image of the chrysanthemums beside the ink pot effectively reconfigures the story's symbols.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of memory and silence is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition and aphorisms ("silence was not empty but full," "time is not a river but a forest"). The story tells the reader what to think about the premise instead of allowing the meaning to emerge from a dramatized struggle or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme is articulated through explicit summary ("evidence of the choice," "never been about finding an ending") rather than emerging from the subtext of events. The final paragraph explains the story's meaning to the reader, creating a sermonizing effect that reduces resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is coherent but heavy-handed, with the narrator explicitly stating the lesson ("reckoning with the universal riddle") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. The story explains its meaning rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("real one, made of community rather than wood") rather than subtext, triggering the penalty for thematic echoing. This overt explanation of the story's meaning flattens the narrative resonance and replaces dramatic implication with authorial assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of transience is coherent but articulated too explicitly in the narrative ("documentation meant acknowledging loss"). The story explains its own subtext rather than allowing the imagery of the fading frost and the grain of sand to resonate silently.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly preached in the final paragraphs ("It carried connection," "honest work"), collapsing subtext into didactic statement. Resonance is asserted by the narrator rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of origin, translation, and the legibility of the world cohere beautifully. The motif of "learning the language" of the landscape integrates perfectly with the plot mechanics of the phrasebook and map.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of resonance serves as a strong unification of mechanics and meaning, treating community health as a frequency. The story successfully avoids being preachy, allowing the "wound in the landscape" to speak to interdependence through the specific action of the tuning.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of preservation through sacrifice is well-integrated and poignant, elevating the story beyond a simple treasure hunt. The concept of the "gathered hush" and the ephemeral made eternal lands a strong conceptual repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of inherited trauma and the necessity of witnessing is powerful, but the execution relies too heavily on explicit statement. The final sentence ("refusing to let them end") summarizes the thesis rather than letting the image resonate on its own, and the repetition of thematic phrases ("sustained impossibilities") feels didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of debt and the dual nature of stewardship (blessing/curse) is tightly woven into the "loving venom" concept. The ending resonates by balancing the joy of release with the weight of assumed responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in abstract terms ("not merely survival but transformation") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The concept of "orchid solace" feels inserted as a required phrase rather than an organic emotional resonance, and the moral is delivered rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered via explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("remind the living that nothing is ever truly lost"), which flattens resonance. The story tells the reader what to feel rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of surface mail as a vessel for truth is coherent, but the ending relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the postscript explicitly states the thesis ("Some names are not disguises..."). This didacticism reduces the subtextual power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized ("Wisdom... was safest when disguised") rather than allowed to emerge from subtext or action. The narrative explains its own metaphors ("spaces held more truth"), effectively doing the reader's work and flattening the resonance. The concept of "unheard stories" is told rather than revealed through the friction of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered as explicit text rather than subtext, with the window literally writing the message of forgiveness. The final paragraph explains the thematic resolution ("The unsent letter didn't need to be delivered anymore") rather than letting the imagery resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "translating silence into testimony" is poignant and well-integrated into the central action of reading the cast. While the narrative occasionally leans into explicit thematic statements ("This was the work she had always done"), the final image successfully anchors the concept in a concrete object.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of communal memory and restored joy is coherent and touching. However, the ending drifts into explicit thematic statement ("not preservation, but continuation") rather than trusting the resonant image of the dancing light to carry the meaning implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    The thematic connection between the hobo nickel and the mural is poignant, but the epiphany is undercut by explicit moralizing in the penultimate paragraph ("Some truths are not found in answers...") which explains rather than trusts the image.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of organic resistance against algorithmic control is coherent but often delivered through "telling" (e.g., "philosophical resistance encoded in chlorophyll"). The ending image resonates, but the explicit articulation of the story's thesis prevents deeper subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on explicit thematic telling ("This is what poets do: they photosynthesize pain into beauty"), which violates the standard for earned subtext. The ending offers a moralizing conclusion ("proof that beauty can grow") rather than an emergent resonance from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of preservation versus progress is coherent but delivered largely through exposition ("She understood regret...") rather than emergent action. The "foxglove regret" concept is strong but explained to the reader rather than dramatized through a conflict of values.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of honest connection is coherent but delivered heavily, with the characters articulating the thesis ("language... could only be spoken truthfully"). The ending relies on stated emotion ("hope rise... like a melody") rather than subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is coherent but delivered via heavy-handed exposition ("This amphitheater embodied that same philosophy"). The story tells the reader exactly what to think about the father's legacy rather than letting subtext emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is poignant but delivered through explicit telling rather than subtextual emergence. The final paragraph articulates the moral ("trust is not a single decision but a practice") directly to the reader, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty for summarizing the thesis instead of letting the image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.2)
    The ending relies on explicit moralizing ("every boundary was also a doorway") that explains the theme rather than letting it resonate from action. The resolution dissolves the tension of "sacred thresholds" too neatly, reducing the complexity to a comforting lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.7)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, with the discovered note ("Wonder cannot be isolated. It must be shared") and the final paragraph directly stating the thesis. This "Thematic Echo" flattens subtext, reducing the epiphany to a summarized lesson rather than an emergent emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of ambiguous loss is coherent, but the ending relies on explicit summary ("Some answers bring not closure but continuation") rather than trusting the image. This thematic telling in the final lines flattens the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is clear but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("not through magic but through mathematics") rather than subtext or dramatic irony. The narrative tells the reader exactly how to interpret the art, leaving little room for ambiguity or independent realization. The concept is interesting, but it rests on assertion rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is coherent but undermined by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("exile is not a leaving but a arriving"). This over-articulation dissolves the subtext, reducing the ending to a summary of the lesson rather than a resonant experience.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated by the narrator ("She understands that her work is not really about glass...") rather than emerging organically from action. This reliance on summary and moralizing prevents earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme is explicitly stated rather than dramatized ("The fire doesn't care... But we do"). The ending relies on a summarizing moral ("transform her burning into someone else's light") that flattens subtext into an essayistic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial assertions ("hope required rigorous methodology") and repetitive summaries rather than emerging from subtext or action. This "telling" approach flattens the emotional resonance, as the story dictates the moral—that abstract aspirations require systematic effort—instead of allowing the reader to discover it through the character's struggle. The heavy reliance on abstract nouns creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of legacy is coherent but overtly didactic, explicitly summarized in the final paragraph ("not a weight but a continuation"). This telling reduces the resonant potential of the ending, offering a thesis statement rather than subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of hope and perspective is articulated through explicit exposition ("truths that existed in parallel") rather than emerging organically from subtext or conflict. The piece relies on stating its significance—telling the reader what the mirrors show—rather than allowing meaning to resonate from concrete, ambiguous images.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in dialogue ("Peace does not honor the dead. It saves the living") and narration ("found her own redemption"), leaving little room for subtext. The story tells the reader exactly what the events mean rather than letting the resonance emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.3)
    Thematic resonance is dampened by explicit authorial commentary that interprets the meaning for the reader (e.g., "fractured grace," "playing god"). The text asserts the significance of the moment rather than allowing the imagery and action to carry the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is over-articulated through the repetitive "lullaby of conformity" metaphor (used four times) and explicit moralizing about "the prison of beauty." Subtext is crowded out because the narrator explains the symbolic meaning of every gesture and feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the final paragraphs ("He would return to Mira... and tell her... that ethical storytelling was not about..."), violating the show-don't-tell principle. This heavy-handed thematic echo replaces dramatic implication with essayistic summary, flattening the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of honoring transience through temporary acts resonates strongly and is woven into the plot mechanics rather than just the exposition. The final image of the butterfly leaving, and Elara’s acceptance of the "broken strands," lands the conceptual repricing effectively. The connection between the moth wing geometry and the shelter feels thematically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of memory versus oblivion is resonant, but the ending relies on an explicit thesis statement ("decided that forgetting was a heavier burden than remembrance") which flattens the subtext. This overt moralizing in the resolution reduces the narrative's power.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    The thematic inversion—that the directive was a record of answers rather than instructions—is a compelling insight that recontextualizes the grandmother's legacy. However, the abrupt cutoff prevents this theme from resonating through a concrete final image or interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The concept of mathematics as an encoded language of devotion is distinct and resonant, elevating the "magic ritual" trope. The theme is slightly over-articulated in the narration ("Maruk realized... not merely mathematical play") rather than being left to subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by heavy-handed moralizing in the dialogue (e.g., "resentment is a cage we build ourselves"), turning subtext into explicit instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies on explicit thesis statements ("core concept... had always been erasing boundaries") rather than letting the theme emerge from subtext or struggle. The ending illustrates the theme literally rather than resonating through earned ambiguity or emotional realization.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative over-articulates its themes, explicitly explaining symbols ("This was the deciduous vows made manifest") instead of allowing subtext to resonate. The moral is delivered as a direct thought rather than emerging organically from action.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of non-linear inheritance and circular time is coherent and legible throughout. However, the delivery leans heavily on exposition and explicit statements (e.g., the bathroom philosophy) rather than allowing the meaning to emerge organically from subtext or action.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of valuing absence and loss is sophisticated, but the story stumbles at the finish by explicitly stating its thesis ("rescue humanity from its fear of understanding too much"). This explanatory summary flattens the subtext, doing work that the final image should have accomplished on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "two people who could never be fully one" finding resolution in a place of "lost identities" is coherent and poignant. The ending image of stepping into the fog resonates well with the established motifs of memory and erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statement ("absence was never truly empty") rather than emergent subtext. The final paragraph summarizes the story's moral ("scholarship became adventure"), creating a "Thematic Echo" effect that flattens resonance and violates the show-don't-tell standard.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding "quiet in the storm" is coherent and lands with a satisfying, if simple, resonance. The inversion of the echo stone’s purpose—from amplifying sound to creating silence—supports the thematic reconfiguration well.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is coherent but undermined by a heavy-handed delivery, particularly in the final paragraph where the protagonist explicitly articulates the story's thesis ("proving coincidences had meaning"). This "Thematic Echo" replaces earned resonance with a summary statement, reducing the emotional impact of the closure. Subtext is largely converted into text, leaving little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of constructed identity vs. discovery is well-integrated into the setting mechanics. However, the ending ("The monuments answered... not their names, but their love") reads as a "Thematic Echo," stating the moral explicitly in the final paragraph rather than letting the image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "light as defiance" is coherent but is articulated too explicitly in the narration ("defiance made visible," "hope taking physical form"). The story tells the reader exactly how to interpret the fire rather than letting the image resonate on its own, which flattens the subtextual potential.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("I collect transitions"), triggering a severe penalty for explaining the story's meaning rather than embodying it. Subtext is flattened by the character articulating the narrative's thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("She understood now that some walls were meant to be climbed") rather than subtext. The story tells the reader exactly what to think about fear and growth, flattening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "instructing silence" is beautifully articulated and woven through the action without feeling tacked on. The grandmother's teaching resonates in the final image, offering a clear conceptual repricing of "quiet" as presence rather than absence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but delivered didactically through the mural's exposition ("not dominion but transformation") rather than emerging organically from the action. The subtext is largely made text.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is heavily didactic, with the narrative explicitly explaining its own metaphors ("isolation was simply another word for slow suffocation"). The ending relies on a summarized moral ("thresholds were meant to exist between states") rather than allowing the final action to carry the meaning implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is articulated explicitly ("promises could be traps," "translate... pressure... into something precious"), leaving little room for subtext. The ending drifts into moralizing ("believed in them hard enough"), reducing the potential for a more resonant, ambiguous takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.5)
    Themes of lineage and memory are stated ("accumulated weight of a family") but lack a concluding resonance due to the missing ending. The concept of "truth... as recognition" is introduced late and severed before it can meaningfully reweight the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.0)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("allegiance was... to possibility itself"). The story explains its meaning to the reader through summary rather than allowing the imagery and action to carry the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial explanation ("that was precisely why...") rather than emerging organically from action or subtext, resulting in a moralizing lecture that flattens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of memory versus erasure is coherent but articulated heavily through exposition ("indifference was its own kind of tyranny"). The subtext is thin; the story tells the reader exactly what it means rather than letting the resonance emerge solely from the imagery and action.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of silence maintained through sound is compelling and well-integrated into the mechanics of the story. The ending's "eerie nostalgia for a time when silence was not yet necessary" adds a layer of resonant complexity to what could have been a purely mechanical victory.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of preserving the "forgotten" is coherent and ties the ending to the character's history. However, the resonance is dampened by explicit moralizing ("prophecy now part of the present") and the lack of ambiguity or sacrifice in the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme of planning versus uncertainty is asserted in the opening sentence but not explored through narrative causality. Without a resolution or a moment where this philosophy is challenged, the theme remains a static label.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of "healing through visible damage" is well-integrated into the action, but the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("carry this truth forward..."), which flattens the resonance and triggers the penalty for sermonizing endings.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of joy coexisting with grief is resonant and consistently developed. However, the narrative tends to articulate the theme explicitly ("healing required joy even, or especially, in parting") rather than allowing it to emerge solely through subtext and action, which softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme is potent but over-articulated. The text explicitly defines the "mathematics of mercy" and its lesson ("did not live in answers but in the questions themselves"), which flattens the subtext into a stated thesis rather than letting the final image carry the resonance alone.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of intuition and lineage is consistent, but the story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("anchored, at last, in the only history that mattered") to enforce its meaning. This overt thesis statement replaces earned resonance with instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of "echoes" versus ghosts creates a coherent internal logic for the protagonist. However, the connection between the circus setting and the horologist's tool remains obscure, limiting thematic resonance. The "weightless burden" concept is present but feels more like exposition than an emergent truth.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of preservation versus release is coherent and well-integrated into the imagery of the bottle and press. However, the subtext is occasionally flattened by explicit internal monologue ("Some eternities needed to be opened, not held") that states the thesis rather than letting it resonate solely through the action.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of historical complexity ("both/and" rather than binary truth) is sophisticated and emerges organically from the plot. The final image of a civilization that "covers its mirrors... and still chooses to look" is a powerful, non-literal resolution to the central inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of restoration through patience and "mending what isn't torn" is resonant and clearly developed. The "covenant of rust" serves as a strong conceptual anchor, though the emotional resonance relies heavily on stated significance rather than subtextual implication.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of collecting versus experiencing is woven seamlessly into the plot, culminating in a powerful realization that resolves the central dramatic question. The final image of the empty vial offers a non-literal, highly resonant answer to the story’s premise without slipping into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit summary ("Aria understood then... that she was part of a timewoven alliance") rather than subtext or action. This didactic approach flattens the resonance of the final image and violates the show-don't-tell principle of high-end fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme is explicitly summarized in the final paragraph ("It was not merely about..."), converting subtext into a direct moral lesson. The epiphany feels diagnostic and explanatory rather than emerging organically from the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of witnessing forgotten history is coherent but articulated through didactic exposition ("terms required a witness") rather than emergent subtext. The attempt to link the protagonist's civil rights archiving work to the magical parley feels thematically asserted rather than organically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of memory versus magic is coherent and resonant, though the distinction is delivered somewhat didactically ("working memory, not magic") rather than emerging purely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of silence as a reservoir for forgotten promises is powerfully articulated and integrated into the plot. The concept of "oaths accumulated like sediment" resonates deeply with the archival setting. The story resists a tidy moral, instead offering a complex state of "velvet disquiet" that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is articulated through exposition and internal monologue ("borrowed forward") rather than emerging organically from the action. The final realization feels like an authorial thesis statement inserted into the character's mind rather than wisdom earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of continuity between the monks' bell and the modern siren is handled with elegance, linking "listening" to "warning" in a resonant way. The ending successfully reframes the siren's noise not as a violation of the silence, but as a protective act akin to prayer, achieving a solid Conceptual Repricing. The "solstice hush" serves as an effective thematic container for this transition.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures from the narrator ("strength did not reside in armored certainty," "This was not mere maintenance but a form of empathy") rather than subtext or action. The final paragraph restates the thesis directly ("profound strength that lived in vulnerable openness"), triggering a significant penalty for Thematic Echo/moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme is articulated through explicit summary ("someone must remember," "weight of unspoken words") rather than emerging organically from action. This reliance on telling the reader what the story means flattens the potential for subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit assertions in the final paragraphs ("Time was not a river... Time was the space between breaths") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. This sermonizing ending flattens the resonance by explaining the meaning directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader via the description of the poem the protagonist plans to write ("It would argue that completeness was not the point"). This meta-commentary flattens subtext and resolves the narrative tension with a stated thesis rather than an earned, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of interspecies respect is coherent but delivered through explicit exposition ("Death was simply another transition") rather than subtext. The final paragraphs moralize the character's experience, flattening the potential resonance into a stated thesis rather than allowing the image to speak.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through direct thesis statements ("Homecoming... was not arrival but recognition") rather than emerging from subtext. The narrative explicitly decodes its own symbolism ("The artificial pilgrimage... paralleled the aliens' genuine journey"), leaving little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("human indifference," "memory rather than greed") rather than emergent subtext. The resolution offers a tidy, didactic victory that lacks the complexity or ambiguity required for higher-band literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is explicitly articulated in the text ("love is the only translation that survives"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. This "Thematic Echo" flattens resonance by decoding the subtext for the reader in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("true north... was not a location... but a direction in the soul") rather than dramatic subtext. This "Thematic Echo" flattens resonance by explaining the meaning directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered via explicit statements ("embrace the unknown") rather than emerging organically from the action. The abrupt meta-fictional break distracts from the redemption arc, and the ending offers a summarized moral rather than a resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is heavily explicated through summary and declaration ("She had become the historian of small gestures," "absence could hold its own meaning"). The story relies on telling the reader what to feel about the events rather than allowing resonance to emerge from subtext or action. The ending leans into sentimental abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue ("Shape of home... is a language") and explanatory narration ("vocabulary of healing"). The resonance is stated rather than emerging from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of "winning vs. survival" is resonant, but the story relies on "explanatory interiority" at the end ("Not as punishment, but as permission"). Explicitly stating the moral lessons reduces the subtextual power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of artistic resistance against censorship is legible but delivered with a heavy hand, relying on explicit statements ("truth was the most dangerous art") rather than subtext. The ending leans into moralizing ("finally, beautifully, free"), which reduces the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in the text ("This was her kintsugi... the light entered through the cracks") rather than emerging organically. The climax relies heavily on a paraphrase of a famous Leonard Cohen lyric, which reduces the unique resonance of the story's specific argument.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with heavy-handed explication ("Marcus understood immediately," "realized... art was never about"). The narrative states the moral directly in the climax ("some things are beautiful precisely because they cannot be kept") rather than letting it emerge from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through the logbook entry ("The whispers were right"), reducing subtext to a moral statement. While the concept of empathy as a beacon is coherent, the execution is heavy-handed, relying on assertions of "screaming tenderness" rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly articulated through diagnostic narration ("navigation meant reading the currents of grief," "real navigation happened here") rather than emerging from subtext. This heavy-handed explanation flattens resonance, offering a stated moral instead of an earned, complex insight.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of preserving emotional capacity in a numb world is coherent and successfully anchored in the central image of the glass eye. However, the delivery relies on heavy-handed assertions ("architecture of fear") rather than allowing meaning to emerge purely through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of connection and memory is coherent but resolves on a somewhat sentimental note ("language of unspoken things"). The thematic resonance relies on a familiar trope of posthumous reconciliation rather than a fresh or complex reconfiguration of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.6)
    The thematic resonance is undercut by explicit labeling. The letter explaining the "doorway of decisions" forces a literal interpretation of the metaphor, turning potential subtext into text and resulting in a moralizing tone.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of re-enchantment is coherent but delivered through explicit summarizing at the end ("purpose reclaimed") rather than emerging organically. The emotional resonance is dampened by the tidiness of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through didactic dialogue and summary ("The shell doesn't hold the secret. We do") rather than emerging organically from action or subtext. The result is a sermonizing tone that leaves no room for reader interpretation or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit statements ("lucidity is not a gift but a curse," "grave was never an ending") rather than emerging organically. The final paragraphs explain the meaning of the chronicle rather than letting the image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("scent had never been the point," "acts of unveiling ordinary miracles") rather than subtext. The story explains its own meaning to the reader, reducing resonance to a moral lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is heavily explicated through summary ("The superstitions... were instructions she had failed to recognize"). The ending sermonizes ("she understood at last") rather than allowing the subtext to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of "pruning" to allow new growth is woven seamlessly through the narrative, culminating in a resonant final image that reframes the tragedy. The story avoids simple sentimentality by acknowledging the "imperfect" nature of the miracle. The connection between the unfinished symphony and the sisters' relationship adds rich, non-discursive subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.6)
    Themes of history, paradox, and memory are clearly stated but not dramatized through event or interaction. The concept of inner/outer unity appears at the end, but without a preceding struggle, it feels like a stated premise rather than an earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of time as organic change is coherent but ultimately overstated in the final paragraphs ("clocks measured change itself... stubborn insistence"). This explicit moralizing flattens the subtext and resolves the ambiguity too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in the text ("intimacy did not require disclosure") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The reliance on explaining the "meaning" of the interaction precludes ambiguity and creates a lecture-like resonance that flattens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of probability versus lived experience is coherent but handled heavily, particularly in the closing lines which explicitly state the moral ("multiplication of meaning"). The ending leans into sentimentality, resolving complex grief with a neat aphorism that reduces the story's ambiguity. The concept of "honest mathematics" is intriguing but borders on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of grief as a frequency is beautifully integrated through the harmonica and the "loop" concept. The ending resonates with the established motif, offering a non-literal reconfiguration of loss into service.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("not because they were precious... but because they were the only true currency"). The story tells the reader what it means rather than allowing resonance to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies heavily on explicit thematic statements (e.g., "To cure loneliness, one had to recognize it in another...") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from subtext and action. This essayistic delivery flattens the emotional resonance, as the narrator explains the mechanics of the "ancient economy" instead of dramatizing them. The result is a moral that feels stated rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story relies on an explicit thematic summary in the final paragraphs ("truest navigation was not about finding direction..."), which flattens subtext into a stated moral. This "Thematic Echo" resolves the narrative inquiry with a platitude rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of repurposing failure ("wrong turn was a form of filtering") is coherent but delivered through explicit essayistic summary in the final paragraph. Subtext is occasionally crowded out by these direct authorial statements, reducing the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of "unrecorded memory" is poignant, and the vintage camera serves as an excellent objective correlative. However, the score is capped because the theme is explicitly articulated by the advisor ("You translate silence into music"), turning subtext into text and reducing the reader's role in decoding the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("They did not understand...") and a summary conclusion rather than emerging organically from action. The ending explains the meaning instead of allowing a resonant image to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of grief and connection is coherent, but the resolution leans into sentimentality ("Mira smiled") and explicit statement ("auroral sorrow") rather than subtext. The emotional resonance is slightly dampened by the "ghost in the machine" trope resolving without ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme is coherent but heavily explicated in the final paragraph ("In a world that worshipped technology..."). This overt moralizing replaces earned resonance with a sermonizing summary, triggering the penalty for explicit theme statements at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on explicit thematic statements ("This was her purpose now... to teach darkness the value of stars") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action. This overt moralizing and the explanatory narration of the subtext ("She understood that being seen in suffering mattered") trigger the Thematic Echo penalty, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through didactic assertion ("the most powerful movements began not with speeches") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative explicitly explains the meaning of every metaphor, leaving no room for reader interpretation or resonance. It reads as a parable with a fixed moral.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story suffers from explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph which reduces the narrative to a maxim ("some locks only open..."). The text also over-explains its own symbols ("This was the talisman's true purpose"), leaving little room for subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of performed vs. felt emotion is resonant. However, the ending drifts into explicit thematic summary ("It is the weightlessness of having survived both"), which articulates the subtext too directly rather than letting the final image of the wooden rose speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme is stated explicitly in the text ("walls... existed in the mind first") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The resolution feels didactic, reducing the narrative to a tidy lesson about perception rather than a complex experience.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("You see the beauty... In the broken things") and summarized in a didactic final paragraph. This sermonizing dissolves subtext, reducing the story's resonance to a stated moral rather than an earned experience.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of constructing meaning from fragments is handled with nuance and resonance. The distinction between "manufacturing" and "inviting" connection provides a satisfying intellectual conclusion that feels earned by the premise, even if the plot support is light.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in both narration and dialogue ("mourning never truly ends—but neither does love"). The ending articulates the thesis directly to the reader/character, triggering a penalty for didacticism and reducing the potential for genuine subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    The thematic blending of market analysis and divination ("measurement was the first magic") is insightful and well-executed. While the narrative occasionally teeters on didacticism regarding the "older currencies," the final image of the crossroads successfully reconfigures the concept of failure into a map.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is articulated through heavy-handed exposition ("I understood now what the philosophers... had discovered") rather than emerging subtextually. The explicit moralizing about "hoarding" versus "release" flattens the complexity of the concept. The epiphany is delivered as a lecture to the reader rather than an earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the mood is resonant, the story relies on a didactic summary (paragraph 9) to explicitly state its argument ("hope was not diminishing but transforming"). This overt telling flattens the subtext, doing the work that the imagery should have done on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.3)
    The chameleon tail metaphor is strong, but the narrative over-articulates the theme ("certainty... had been a cage"), robbing the subtext of its power. The explicit thesis statement in the sixth paragraph reduces the resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story successfully braids the "displaced miracle" concept, but the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the theme ("Maya understood then... some miracles are displaced in time"). This explains the resonance rather than allowing the final image to carry the weight implicitly, triggering the explication penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of "unfinished endings" is coherent but delivered through didactic exposition ("Some goodbyes need no audience...") rather than emerging organically from the action. The narrative explicitly tells the reader what the story means in the final paragraphs, flattening the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text ("creativity could not be seized... It had to be surrendered to"), violating the "show, don't tell" principle. This sermonizing replaces organic narrative resonance with an instructed moral.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit "Thematic Echo" dialogue ("Hope... looks like a pause") rather than emerging organically from action. This on-the-nose definition in the final beats acts as a lecture, reducing subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated to the reader ("The jungle was not separate from him...") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The reliance on abstract labels ("frequency of probable miracles," "hum of insight") flattens resonance into assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized to the reader ("she understood then that courage was not..."), violating the show-don't-tell principle. This didactic approach flattens subtext and reduces the narrative to a parable explaining its own moral.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of silence is explored with nuance, distinguishing between the "silent choir" (artistic) and the "unpardonable silence" (moral failure). The integration of the required elements—bolt, dust, nerve regeneration—into the thematic arc is seamless. The ending resonates powerfully, offering a non-literal answer to the central question of what safety truly costs.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.2)
    Themes of truth and justice are stated explicitly in exposition ("biological truth that no forgery could replicate") rather than emerging from subtext or conflict. The story explains its meaning directly to the reader instead of allowing resonance to arise from action.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of adaptation and the fluidity of ecosystems is coherent and poignant, supported by the map and coral motifs. However, the thematic resonance is dampened slightly by the explicit articulation of the lesson ("ecosystems were not static photographs..."), which explains the subtext rather than letting the final image of the breath and the new rhythm carry the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, delivering its thesis directly in the narration ("Meaning was not something you found in the mess; it was something you created"). This "Thematic Echo" flattens the complexity of the premise into a sermonizing conclusion rather than allowing subtext to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme is articulated explicitly in dialogue ("traditions evolve with intent") and narration, rendering it as a thesis statement rather than subtext. While the central concept is coherent, the story relies on characters explaining the meaning of the embryo and the script rather than allowing resonance to emerge from the imagery itself.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core theme of realistic endurance is poignant, but the ending succumbs to explicit moralizing ("optimism could grow not from denial but..."). This thematic echo explains the subtext rather than trusting the night-blooming cereus image to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("fragmentation became gift rather than curse"), reducing a potentially resonant insight to a moralizing summary. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the subtext, explaining the story's meaning to the reader instead of letting the imagery carry the weight. The narrative relies on asserting the lesson rather than letting the ambiguity of the "shifting faces" linger.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of time and perception is coherent, though conveyed largely through abstract assertions ("time moved like honey") rather than subtextual action. The final image of the drone recording emptiness effectively underscores the theme of absence, offering a resonant closing beat that elevates the earlier abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative ("contraband truths," "patriotic lies") rather than emerging through subtext. The "lovers torn apart by politics" backstory is a familiar trope that is told via summary rather than revealed through specific, resonant details in the letter itself.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered didactically. The final paragraph functions as a sermon ("Peace was not the absence of fire..."), explicitly stating the moral rather than allowing it to resonate through subtext or image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of silence as a force and the "transliteration" of grief into purpose resonates strongly without becoming overly moralistic. The final image of the fisher "fishing for echoes" beautifully recontextualizes the central metaphor. The connection between broken patterns and the goddess's song is thematically cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of breaking generational cycles ("orbits of regret") is woven seamlessly into the plot mechanics. The story resists a simple moral victory, instead presenting a complex realization that escaping the past requires active, logical dismantling of the present structure. The recurring motif of the orbits anchors the narrative arc perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of redeeming past guilt is approached with a sentimental touch, relying on the trope of literally undoing the tragedy rather than exploring the complexity of loss or acceptance. While the concept of "translating grief" is evocative, the execution simplifies the thematic stakes into a mechanical fix. The subtext is often made explicit through on-the-nose phrasing like "architecture of ancient grief" and "dissonance of that old guilt."

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    The story relies on explicit thematic summary in the final paragraphs ("understood what her teacher had meant... not that chaos contained hidden order"). This effectively explains the subtext rather than letting the image of the hush carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of preservation versus renewal is resonant, particularly the paradox of "warmth bound in iron." However, the text relies on explicit statements ("This was the old art," "names were not merely labels") to articulate meaning, rather than letting the subtext carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of failure as a precursor to grace is coherent and resonant. However, the explicit articulation of the theme in dialogue ("Despair is a performance you don't have to finish") reduces subtextual power, creating a moment of "thematic echo" that feels slightly instructive.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered via direct sermonizing ("Connection can't be manufactured through chemistry alone") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending functions as a manifesto, summarizing the lesson in explicit terms ("Not a pill. Not a promise. But a method") rather than trusting the image to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is heavily over-articulated through narrator exposition ("transitional object in the truest sense," "factually mystical") rather than emerging from subtext. The story tells the reader exactly what the symbols mean, preventing genuine resonance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme is articulated through explicit statements ("truth unravels... not through grand revelation") rather than emerged subtext. The final paragraph delivers a direct moral lesson ("wisdom shared is wisdom multiplied"), limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of healing and returning courage is stated explicitly in the narration ("even the coldest... places could warm again") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending summarizes the thematic takeaway, leaving little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("The promise was never about geography but about continuity") rather than emerging from subtext or action. This over-articulation flattens resonance, turning the narrative into a thematic summary rather than an experience of the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("The answer, she suspected, was... the accumulated kindness") rather than subtext. This didactic approach flattens resonance, reducing the story to a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit "sermonizing" in dialogue ("Not to fill the hole, but to remind you..."), which replaces subtext with direct instruction. This approach flattens the narrative resonance, as the characters articulate the story's thesis rather than embodying it through ambiguous action.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative ("Independence did not mean severing connection but rather learning to stand within it"), which collapses subtext into a moral summary. This "Thematic Echo" in the climax flattens the resonance, telling the reader exactly what to think instead of allowing the meaning to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of transforming isolation into connection is coherent and woven through the central metaphor. However, the ending relies on explicit summarization ("She understood, finally... saw the thread") rather than letting the resonance emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of engineered division versus organic discourse is coherent and legible. However, the connection between "subsonic waves" and political polarization feels slightly didactic, and the resolution (people suddenly listening to each other) leans toward a simplified moral victory.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.3)
    The story ends with explicit moralizing ("rebellion... against the forgetting of things that mattered"), summarizing the theme rather than allowing it to resonate through the action. This direct thesis statement in the final paragraph triggers a substantial deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    The thematic exploration of "peace not justice" and the architecture of grief is sophisticated and woven naturally into the action. The concept of defining a victim by the "negative space" of the killer's emotion is a brilliant synthesis of the premise and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is intelligible but delivered through heavy-handed exposition, explicitly defining "reversible exile" for the reader. This didactic approach flattens the subtext, leaving little room for interpretive resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is articulated explicitly through label-speak ("Pixelated amnesty, she would later call it") rather than emerging organically from action. The story explains its own meaning to the reader in the final paragraphs ("the recounting itself was the sculpture"), reducing subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    The themes of territory and circular paths cohere well, but the delivery is heavy-handed ("My father used to say..."). The connection between highway robbery and venture capital is a strong concept that is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.5)
    The ending relies on explicit moralizing ("shared burdens were never meant for solitary scholars") rather than dramatized subtext, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of turning failure into growth is coherent but delivered didactically, particularly in the closing paragraphs which explain the lesson explicitly (“failure had become lesson”). The reflection on mirrors feels inserted to meet a prompt requirement rather than arising organically from the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    Themes are over-articulated through exposition ("her purpose finally clear," "every object became a message") leaving little room for subtext. The story relies on asserting significance rather than allowing it to emerge from dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of honoring grief is poignant, but the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral ("holes could not be patched—only honored"), reducing resonance. This overt thesis statement supplants the emotional weight of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    While the core themes of resonance and value are strong, the ending suffers from explicit moralizing. The final paragraph explains the theme ("a value measured only in whether Marcus could accept...") rather than trusting the action of the drive and the image of the amp to carry the resonance, diluting the literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transition is coherent, but the story relies on explicit thematic statements in the finale ("She did not need to make a discovery... She needed only to understand") rather than allowing the subtext to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through didactic explanation ("This was how wonder survived...") rather than dramatized subtext. The text tells the reader what the metaphor means instead of allowing meaning to emerge from action and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the narration ("humanity built walls when it should have learned to knock them down"), converting subtext into text. This didactic approach flattens the emotional resonance of the ending, leaving little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand; the protagonist explicitly articulates the moral ("she, like the river, was allowed to flood without apology"). This direct statement of the thesis in the final paragraph reduces subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.3)
    Themes of memory and time remain abstract and rely on platitudes ("endings were merely beginnings spoken backward"). The concept of "unspoken words" is stated but not dramatized through a specific revelation or emotional burden that alters the character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    The concept of "perforated destiny" is excellently integrated, serving both as a justification for the provenance gaps and a thematic argument for the protagonist's final choice. The ending resonates well with the core theme, allowing "light" to penetrate the "certainty" of her previous life.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of beauty in death is articulated clearly but delivered through expositional interiority rather than dramatized struggle. The story tells the reader what the moment means ("death need not mean devastation") rather than allowing the meaning to emerge from a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The tending was the point") rather than emerging organically from subtext and action. This direct statement of the thesis (Thematic Echo) flattens the resonance and explains the meaning to the reader instead of letting them feel it.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.3)
    Thematic arguments are explicitly stated ("nuance was where growth lived") rather than emerging from subtext. The result acts more as a philosophical thesis than a dramatized narrative inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is delivered explicitly in dialogue ("revelation unearned is revelation lost"), which triggers the Thematic Echo penalty for articulating the thesis in prompt-like language. This directness flattens the subtext and reduces the interpretative space.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme of spiritual navigation is delivered through explicit exposition and a final summarizing paragraph rather than emergent subtext. The ending articulates the moral ("true navigation was not about...") directly to the reader, which flattens the potential for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition in the final paragraphs ("Mira understood, finally...") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The "paradox of light" and the nature of the sacred are stated as conclusions, reducing the subtext to a diagnostic summary of the story's intended moral.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed explication in the final paragraph ("messages in bottles made of fire") rather than emerging organically. The narrative tells the reader the meaning of the vow instead of allowing it to resonate through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("This was the paradox...") and direct summary of the protagonist's realization ("She understood... that her purpose was...") rather than subtext. The story explains its meaning to the reader instead of allowing it to emerge from dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered via explicit instruction in dialogue ("Name the fears...") and narrator summary, leaving little room for subtext. The story instructs the reader on its meaning ("Now she understood it was instruction") rather than dramatizing the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of valuing the "lukewarm" and persistent over the extreme is coherent and resonant. The ending image of the bell ringing with the "patience of dripping water" lands the thematic argument effectively, though the "cosmic imbalance" line is a bit heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of memory against erasure is delivered through explicit exposition ("silence was a kind of violence," "replace community with reservoir capacity") rather than subtext. The story tells the reader how to interpret the resurfacing instead of allowing the imagery and action to carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader ("true alchemy lived in the liminal space...") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending offers a tidy summary of the metaphor ("waiting for the flame of wonder") instead of a resonant image, reducing the narrative to a moralizing fable.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme is handled through explicit telling ("weight of my profession," "greatest gift") rather than emerging organically from action. The final paragraph summarizes the moral, limiting the potential for resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered via explicit lectures in dialogue ("You cannot defeat emotional numbness through violence") rather than emerging naturally from subtext or action. The ending summarizes the moral lesson ("We were complementary opposites") directly to the reader, flattening the potential for resonance into a stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit explanation ("She began to understand that the corpse flower... was a teacher") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The story interprets its own symbols for the reader, reducing the potential for genuine resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit narrator assertion ("restoring what had been lost required not force but gentle persistence") rather than emerging organically from the action. The story relies on explaining its own metaphors—such as the definition of "macerate" provided in the text—which drains subtextual power. The emotional resonance is asserted ("desperately, beautifully alive") rather than earned through specific dramatized loss.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story succumbs to the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, explicitly stating its moral in the final paragraph ("to make friends with uncertainty was the only true guardianship"). This sermonizing replaces dramatic resonance with instruction. The theme of "becoming" is told through abstract summary rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("Mara considered the nature of creative destruction") and moralized in the final paragraph ("the only formula... began with surrender"), which flattens the subtext. The resonance is limited by this overt authorial hand.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly summarized in the final paragraph ("In every ending... there was a beginning"), violating the show-don't-tell principle for resonance. This moralizing reduces the subtext to a surface-level statement.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through exposition ("despair was a luxury," "made peace with permanent transience") rather than emerging organically from the action. This didactic approach leaves little room for subtext, resulting in a moral that feels pasted onto the events rather than arising from them.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of "rational enchantment" and the reciprocal relationship between creator and creation ("memories she had made and the ones she had been made of") is tightly woven. The final insight feels earned and resonates with the earlier setup regarding the "seams where perception stitched itself together."

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The thematic integration of the anchor chain (connection/weight) and the edge geometry (navigation/light) is excellent. The final realization—that the cosmos is a sea navigable by those willing to learn—resonates deeply with the established motifs without becoming preachy.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of grief and listening is coherent, but the story relies on explicit thematic statements ("grief made scientists of us all," "incidental heroism") to deliver its meaning. The resonance is told to the reader in the final paragraph rather than emerging organically from the action of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of connection and memory is well-integrated, though the ending relies on explicit summarization ("The cables are memory itself...") rather than letting the imagery speak for itself. The final "library" metaphor slightly over-explains the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of finding humanity within algorithmic cruelty is potent, but the penultimate paragraph explicitly tells the reader the architect's intent ("The architect had not wanted..."), undercutting the subtext. This direct thematic summary replaces what should have been a dramatic realization, slightly diminishing the emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of translation—converting meaning into texture—is thoroughly explored through consistent imagery and action. The concept resonates well, though the phrase "architecture of meaning" tilts slightly toward abstract statement rather than embodied subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through dialogue ("You're becoming the punchline"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty for characters articulating the thesis in prompt-like language. Subtext is thin because the characters explain the meaning of the events to each other in real-time. The "cosmic humor" concept remains an asserted abstraction rather than a felt resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of reawakening beauty in a mechanized world is coherent but heavy-handed, relying on explicit statements ("monuments to their own surrender," "world... forgotten how to wonder") rather than subtext. The story tells the reader what the symbols mean immediately upon their introduction, leaving little room for interpretive resonance. The resolution offers a tidy moral victory rather than a complex thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story explicitly explains its own subtext ("healing required medicine and metaphor in equal measure") and moralizes in the final paragraph. This didactic approach collapses ambiguity and leaves the reader with a lecture rather than an experience.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The themes of restoration and silence are coherent but delivered through explicit statements ("silence was not emptiness") rather than subtext. The resolution feels like a tidy prompt response rather than an earned thematic resonance arising from conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of analog vs. digital memory is stated explicitly in the text ("memories are not stored but cultivated") rather than emerging from subtext. The resolution feels sentimental and unearned, offering a tidy moral without complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of longing and lost dreams is coherent and permeates the narrative, though it is often stated directly ("The cipher of longing," "evidence of dreams") rather than emerging from subtext. The resolution offers a pleasant thematic resonance, though it relies on abstract assertions of "home" rather than dramatic proof.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.5)
    The ending relies on an explicit moral statement ("The only prisons...") that flattens resonance into a lesson; this thematic echo triggers a significant deduction for moralizing replacing scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central concept of memory reflection is thematically strong, but the ending relies on explicit moralizing ("The chronically curious never rest") which acts as a thematic echo and flattens the subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through didactic dialogue ("Exile is not a punishment") and narrative summary ("she would explain that..."), reducing subtext to a lecture. The message of resilience is stated rather than earned through the geometry of the scene or the characters' struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of preserving wonder is stated explicitly through exposition ("covenant," "promise," "weave new threads") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative explains the significance of the seed and the act immediately, leaving little room for ambiguity or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The thematic synthesis of unmasking, binding, and grief is elegant, elevating the narrative beyond its procedural plot to a resonant reflection on memory.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story is heavily didactic, relying on explicit thesis statements ("interpreted the silence with empathy," "proven that the most profound discoveries...") to convey meaning. The ending sermonizes rather than letting the resonance emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("the physics of letting go," "loss was not an ending") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The message in the bottle functions as a didactic sermon that explains the story's meaning to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is coherent but resolved through explicit statement in the final paragraph ("unspoken needs... found their articulation"). This summarizing tendency flattens the emotional resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme is coherent, but the character explicitly articulating the thesis ("joy beneath anguish") using prompt language near the end triggers the Thematic Echo penalty. This flattens the subtext into a summary statement rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit summary rather than subtext. The final paragraph ("she understood now that strings could be rewoven") articulates the moral directly, explaining the metaphor to the reader instead of letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.0)
    The thematic resonance is undercut by the final paragraph, which resorts to explicit moralizing ("discoveries were about limits") instead of letting the imagery speak.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding wonder in the mundane is coherent, but the "sociable isolation" concept is told as an expository label rather than emerging organically from the scene. The ending leans into a generic "bright future" resonance that feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of repair as "remembering" is coherent and consistently threaded through the narrative. However, the insights feel like standard genre platitudes ("making things whole again") rather than hard-won wisdom derived from the specific struggle of the scene. The "driftwood" motif attempts to anchor the theme but feels repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of communal restoration is clear but delivered through sentimental assertion ("strangers no longer, family by choice") rather than earned subtext. The resolution offers a tidy moral without the complexity or ambiguity required for higher literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.8)
    Themes of "beauty in brokenness" and "endings as beginnings" are stated explicitly in exposition rather than emerging from subtext or conflict. The narrative preaches its meaning ("The flaw made it more beautiful") instead of allowing the reader to infer it.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of unwanted legacy and the indifference of nature ("the orchard did not care") is consistent and resonant. The resolution serves the premise of duty well without over-moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of transformation is coherent, but the execution is heavy-handed, with the protagonist explicitly articulating the thesis ("All of life, she thought, was this") in her interior monologue. The insight feels delivered to the reader rather than emerging organically from the friction of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition and a sermonizing conclusion ("For in the end, every story was defined...") rather than emerging organically from action. This didactic approach collapses subtext into a direct thesis statement, reducing narrative resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    The thematic conclusion—that healing is not the removal of pain but the endurance of it—is resonant and well-earned by the final image. The correspondence between specific dishes and emotions (lamb = reconciliation, honey = forgiveness) borders on allegorical simplicity, but the broader concept of "smoothing rough edges" rather than erasing them elevates the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit labeling ("literal and figurative barriers") and repetitive keywords ("rehabilitated") rather than emerging from subtext. This over-articulation flattens the resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("archeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than emerging organically from action. The story moralizes about the value of abandoned dreams without creating subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of preservation and vigilance is coherent but didactic, heavily explicated in the final paragraphs ("this was not an ending but a beginning"). The closure relies on summarizing the theme rather than letting the image resonate implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of synthesizing industry and nature is consistent. However, the core concept ("Empathy in motion") is delivered via explicit interior labeling ("Empathy in motion, she thought") rather than emerging organically from the action. This direct statement flattens the subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("he had learned that the most profound teachings lived not in what was spoken..."). This summary replaces dramatized resonance, reducing the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through the final diary entry, which articulates the moral ("The silence after celebration is...") rather than letting it emerge from the subtext. This didactic "thematic echo" in the resolution flattens the narrative resonance into a lesson statement, violating the show-don't-tell principle at the most critical juncture.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is coherent but resolves with a "Thematic Echo" where the protagonist explicitly writes the moral ("Some wisdom must first be endured...") in her journal. This didactic summary replaces the resonance that should arise from subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered didactically through the "echoes" paragraph, which lectures the reader on the definition of resilience. Subtext is displaced by explicit moralizing, reducing thematic resonance to a statement of fact.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of "singular convergence" and nature as a mathematical force is integrated masterfully into the plot mechanics. The ending resonates without sermonizing, positioning the protagonist as a witness to the "hidden mathematics" of disaster. The concept drives the narrative logic rather than sitting on top of it.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on explicit sermonizing in the final paragraphs ("Wonder was not luxury...") rather than dramatized subtext. This didactic approach flattens the thematic resonance into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme is coherent but the ending relies on a heavy-handed explanation ("knowing that some guardians were meant to act...") rather than trusting the image. This explicitly stated moral flattens the resonance and resolves the ambiguity too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is delivered explicitly rather than subtextually; the ending summarizes the thesis ("finally understanding that the mathematics of emotion required...") instead of letting the image resonate on its own. This didactic approach flattens the potential for ambiguity and deeper reader engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is delivered through didactic dialogue ("Brief encounters were never meant to end... meant to keep echoing"), which constitutes a Thematic Echo penalty. This explicit moralizing in the climax flattens the subtext, leaving little room for the reader to infer meaning from action.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader ("This was the truth that scientists refused to believe," "objects absorb emotions") rather than emerging through subtext. The story explains its own meaning in the text, leaving little room for reader interpretation or resonance. The ending restates the thesis rather than complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("some messages could only be sent by becoming the message itself") rather than subtext or action. The story explains its own meaning in the narrative summary, removing ambiguity and reducing the ending's resonance to a confirmed thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of "indifference as permission" is profound and lands a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end, elevating the fable-like narrative. The story successfully reframes the protagonist's insignificance as his greatest asset without descending into overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative articulates its theme explicitly in the final paragraphs ("truth she sought was not... withheld by another... but a wound"), which flattens the subtext. This explanation resolves the ambiguity for the reader rather than letting the scene resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through direct exposition ("Maren understood her purpose then... to bottle the feeling of safety") rather than emerging organically from the action. The ending ties up the complex grief of the "drowning" too neatly, reducing the thematic weight to a sentimental transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.8)
    Thematic resonance is limited by the lack of struggle; the text relies on exposition to state its themes ("making tomorrow from the stuff of yesterday") rather than allowing them to emerge from action or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit thesis statements ("illumination happened not through force") rather than subtextual drama. The narrative explains its own symbols ("testament to transformation") instead of allowing the imagery to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The core concept of "quantified sorrow" is woven beautifully into the narrative logic and the final realization. The theme of healing through deconstruction resonates strongly in the closure. The story commits fully to its premise without slipping into overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of "freedom purchased through constraint" is compelling, but the execution suffers from explicit moralizing at the end ("meant to be... not a keeper... but a weaver"). This overt summarization reduces the resonant power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is articulated through explicit thesis statements ("discovered that the heart does not require distance," "understand her own mistake") rather than emerging from subtext. The result feels didactic, explaining the story's meaning to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=3.8)
    Subtext is replaced by explicit thematic statements; the narrative explains the symbolism of the bread and butterfly ("understood it immediately as... absolution") rather than allowing it to resonate. The final paragraph summarizes the story's thesis in a way that flattens emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through explicit exposition rather than subtext; the protagonist articulates the thesis directly ("not to preserve magic but to preserve meaning"). The ending leans into moralizing summary ("hidden... in the act of seeking itself"), which reduces the resonance of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    The themes of trust and time resonate well, particularly with the "steadfast" motif connecting the father to the object, though the "sound of trust breaking" leans slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the thesis ("truths required not the absence of doubt but the presence of wonder") instead of allowing resonance to emerge from the scene. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme is articulated through explicit thesis statements ("The secret was in the suppression," "art is not creation but revelation") that strip away subtext. By explaining the meaning directly to the reader, the story forfeits the resonance that would arise from letting the unfinished painting speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand; phrases like "pilgrimage to honesty" and "wilt near dishonesty" explain the subtext rather than allowing it to emerge from action. The story leans on moralizing exposition, which flattens the potential for complex, earned resonance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story relies heavily on explicit moralizing, summarizing its themes in the narration ("truth was not a single note but a convergence") rather than allowing them to emerge from subtext. The ending offers a didactic thesis statement ("everything that mattered was already being said") that flattens any potential ambiguity or resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of embracing fear is coherent but slips into sentimental therapy-speak ("held gently until they learned"). The message overrides the narrative logic, resulting in a tidy emotional equation that feels slightly unearned given the "screaming" chaos described earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly preached in the final paragraph ("listening was not passive but generative"), converting the story into an essay. This overt moralizing replaces dramatized subtext and resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of transforming vulnerability into strength is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("encrypted her vulnerability until it became armor") rather than subtext. The concept of "defiance through dance" is resonant, but the explicit telling of the moral reduces its impact. The ending reinforces the theme clearly, though it feels somewhat instructive.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than emerging organically ("where do deleted memories go..."). The narrative tells the reader exactly how to interpret the symbols (flowers as a map, crystals as photographs of loss), leaving little room for subtext or reader engagement. The moral is delivered as a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of agency versus destiny is well-integrated with the magic system. The twist of the prophecy being a self-warning adds decent resonance, though the thematic thesis is stated somewhat explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of "agreed-upon lies" as the mortar of human (and non-human) connection is woven masterfully through the narrative. The story treats the architecture of buildings and the architecture of relationships as parallel structures, achieving deep resonance without becoming didactic. The ending reframes the "lie" not as deceit, but as a necessary space for existence.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through narrator summary ("translate isolation into independence") and the grandmother's monologue, rather than emerging organically from subtext. The explicit articulation of the story's thesis in the final paragraphs reduces the potential for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of "restoring truth" is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition and sermonizing ("forgiveness for the unfinished business"). The ending relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the protagonist explicitly articulates the moral lesson, flattening the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("souls who repeated the words of others") rather than emerging organically from action or subtext. The narrative explicitly lectures the reader on the meaning of the "echo people" instead of allowing the concept to resonate through the character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.5)
    Themes are delivered through explicit authorial assertion ("understood its preservation as a form of stubborn testimony") rather than emergent subtext. The emotional resonance is told to the reader rather than earned through specific, grounded experience.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme is articulated through explicit exposition ("Yuki understood this contradiction intimately") rather than emerging organically from dramatic action. The narrative interprets its own symbols for the reader, reducing subtextual depth and leaving little room for interpretive engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story relies on explicit thesis statements in the final paragraph ("The truth... was simply the stillpoint") to deliver its meaning. This "Thematic Echo" explains the subtext to the reader rather than allowing the imagery of the orchard and diamond to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is explicitly stated in exposition ("ancient things had their own kind of science") and dialogue ("Your variant allegiance... will save...") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The concept of "variant allegiance" is told to the reader as a conclusion rather than explored through a complex moral or intellectual struggle on the page. The resonance relies on the trope of the vindicated visionary rather than specific narrative particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story explicitly sermonizes its theme ("connection, the most permanent currency of all") in the final paragraph, violating the "show, don't tell" principle. The meaning is delivered via narrator explanation ("he understood what he had been gathering") rather than emerging organically from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("marriage of logic and feeling") rather than subtext. The final line ("logically emotional") feels like a forced summation rather than an earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of "patient revolution" is coherent but is delivered through explicit thesis statements ("revolution was never measured in seasons alone") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The narrative asserts its meaning rather than allowing the reader to infer it from the action, resulting in a somewhat lecture-like resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of illumination is coherent but heavy-handed, relying on explicit statements ("parched denial," "some lanterns... burned best") rather than subtext. The moral is delivered as a summary conclusion rather than emerging organically from the narrative action, reducing its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of grace as an unearned gift is clearly articulated and enacted through the plot. The hidden inscription serves as a strong objective correlative for the theme, allowing the ending to resonate without needing a concluding sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding hidden meaning in a mechanical world is coherent and lovely, though the ending leans into explicit telling ("someone would remember... understand what I had done"). The "soul" connection is slightly heavy-handed, resolving the ambiguity rather than letting the image of the ringing bell resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of digital persistence and corporate erasure is coherent and resonant, fitting the "sensed absence" prompt well. However, the resolution relies on a somewhat familiar trope of distributed consciousness without subverting expectations or deepening the concept beyond its initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated by the narrator ("Peace was not the absence of conflict but the presence of understanding"), which flattens subtext into a lecture. The story explains the symbolism of its own objects rather than allowing resonance to emerge from action and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative over-explains its themes ("She understood now that endings were not an arrival but a process") and relies on cliché phrasing ("irony was not lost," "unbreakable spirit") that dilutes the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is delivered via explicit telling ("love's purpose was not always permanence"), flattening subtext into a moral statement. The insertion of the academic phrase "intersubjective understanding" is thematic telling that disrupts the narrative dream, turning the character into a mouthpiece for the prompt rather than a living soul.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of preservation is articulate but delivered didactically through reflection and memory. Resonance is asserted rather than emerging organically from scene dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed assertion and moralizing summary ("every pain deserved to become a masterpiece") rather than subtext. The ending relies on an explicit thesis statement ("knowledge that collective healing was not a destination but a practice") which flattens resonance. The story preaches its meaning instead of earning it through dramatized experience.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of silence as a form of completion is beautifully integrated and lands with genuine weight at the end. The distinction between accumulation and fullness offers a fresh, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The thematic resonance elevates the quieter plot.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of aging and memory is handled with sophistication, moving from a fear of loss to a celebration of "becoming." The final insight—that growing older is the sound of bodies becoming themselves—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, reweighting the initial melancholic premise into something hopeful.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story explicitly states its thesis multiple times ("Escape velocity is not...", "You do not grasp at what is fleeting"), turning the climax into a lecture. This heavy-handed delivery collapses subtext and reduces the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of finding the "sacred ordinary" connects well with the plot and character arc. The story effectively contrasts the "aggressive hope" of the medical world with the acceptance found in the room. It teeters on the edge of sentimentality ("architecture of grace," "doorway to something eternal"), occasionally stating its thesis too explicitly rather than letting the subtext do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conceptual repricing at the end—shadows as "light folded back"—is distinct and resonates well with the "Bend" premise. This strong thematic resolution elevates the piece, offering a fresh take on light/dark tropes despite the straightforward plot.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of ambiguous motherhood and the value of "fractured things" is resonant and beautifully woven through the bone-setting metaphor. The subtext regarding the changeling as a "substitute body" versus a loved child is handled with nuance. The final paragraph leans slightly into explicit moralizing, stating the theme rather than letting the image speak alone.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is explicitly articulated in the final paragraph ("She had simply been called to a different kind of radiance..."), triggering a penalty for moralizing that replaces narrative resonance. The "pearl of stillness" metaphor is heavy-handed, leaving little room for subtext or reader interpretation. The ending summarizes the lesson rather than letting it emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story succumbs to explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("learning that sometimes the most quietly proactive thing you can do..."). This thematic summation flattens the subtext into a lesson statement, reducing the resonance of the preceding imagery and violating the show-don't-tell principle at the critical closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit summation ("She understood now," "These were not failures but offerings") rather than dramatic implication. The narrative pauses to moralize the struggle, which flattens the subtext and reduces resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of restoring nature is coherent but delivered through explicit authorial assertion ("These weren't mere metaphors") rather than subtext. The result feels didactic, preaching the connection between stories and plants rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is coherent but articulated through explicit narrator summary ("waystation for grief," "intersection of loss and memory") rather than emerging purely from subtext. The resonance is somewhat dampened by this tendency to explain the symbolic meaning of the objects directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of shifting from utility (timekeeping) to wonder is coherent and shapes the closure effectively. The distinction between "restoring function" and "redirecting purpose" provides a satisfying intellectual resonance. The thematic execution is slightly didactic in moments ("sentence without a period") but lands a clear, resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of transmuting grief into permanent structure is resonant and consistently developed through the fractal imagery. The ending successfully elevates the concept, reframing the silence and calcification as a connection to a "whalebone reverie" and deep time.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story stumbles significantly by explicitly listing the theme's conclusions ("the lessons were these: that love does not disappear..."). This didactic summary violates the "show, don't tell" principle and offers a tidy moral rather than letting the resonance emerge organically from the carving itself.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central theme is compelling, but the protagonist explicitly articulates the thesis ("failure is ordinary") in dialogue. This diagnostic label-speak reduces subtextual resonance in the climax, trading implication for declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.3)
    The story relies on explicit thematic statements ("Hope... could not be measured in linear time") rather than dramatized subtext. The final paragraph serves as a moralizing summary that explains the meaning to the reader instead of letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.0)
    The ending falls into "Thematic Echo" by explicitly explaining the takeaway ("Not closure... but something more like forgiveness..."). This over-articulation robs the final image of its resonance, telling the reader exactly what to feel instead of letting the ticking clock carry the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of excavating truth from historical "costumes" is coherent, but the ending resorts to explicit sermonizing ("The legend was not in the finding but in the seeking"). This summarizing moral statement in the final paragraph flattens the resonance and triggers a deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lecture rather than subtext ("understanding that all knowledge must be woven..."). This "Thematic Echo" flattens the narrative into an essayistic summary, robbing the reader of the work of interpretation. The moral is stated, not discovered through action.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    The concept of "obituaries for the living" is thematically rich and powerfully recontextualizes the ending; the closure resonates well with the established motifs of documentation and absence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of integration versus destruction is coherent, but the story relies on "telling" this theme in the final paragraph ("understood at last... language of symbiosis rather than domination"). The ending summarizes the moral lesson rather than letting the image of the egg and the prince's action carry the resonant weight on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of destruction versus renewal is coherent but heavily didactic, particularly in the final paragraph which explicitly explains the meaning ("part of the same eternal dance"). This overt moralizing and the "scars could sing" thesis statement flatten the subtext, doing the reader's work for them.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of memory liberation is coherent, but the ending relies on explicit summarization ("Some mysteries, she understood now...") rather than allowing the resonance to emerge organically. The moral is stated rather than felt through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of memory and machine consciousness evolving into ritual is coherent and resonates in the final image. However, the text tends to state its themes explicitly ("vessel for generational patterns," "connecting present to past") rather than allowing them to emerge solely from subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph to convey its theme, telling the reader exactly how to interpret the grief ("grief moved through a community like weather"). This over-articulation flattens the subtext and replaces genuine resonance with a summary of the story's intended meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs to convey its meaning ("absolution was not forgiveness... not about erasure but about carrying"). Instead of letting the "incremental absolution" emerge from the subtext of the rake carvings, the narrative explains the thesis directly to the reader, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit summation ("intentions: not grand or political, but human and humble") rather than emerging organically from the action. The ending relies on moralizing to explain the significance of the tapestry, creating a lecture-like effect instead of resonant subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through didactic narration ("Innovation... did not emerge from unlimited freedom") rather than emerging organically from scene dynamics. The text relies on explaining the profundity of the protagonist's work rather than allowing the reader to experience the "geography of wonder and terror."

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and summary ("music itself had become a form of resistance") rather than subtext. The story asserts its meaning directly to the reader instead of allowing it to emerge from dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.0)
    The ending explicitly summarizes the theme ("Incomplete information was all anyone ever had"), flattening subtext into a moral lesson. This violation of the "no redundant thematic statements" rule significantly reduces resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of "sedimentary layers of story" is compelling and integrates well with the setting and artifacts. The distinction between the "official narrative" and the "accumulated evidence" is articulate, though it relies on direct exposition ("The authorities tell us...") rather than emerging organically from a dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is articulated through explicit exposition and aphorisms ("This was the truth of vanishing arts," "loudest emotions often contain the most emptiness") rather than emerging organically from the action. This over-explanation crowds out subtext, turning the story into a lecture on its own meaning rather than a dramatized experience.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative collapses subtext into explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("Some rebellions are fought with swords..."). This didactic summary flattens the thematic resonance, treating the reader as a passive recipient of a lesson rather than allowing meaning to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through "theme summary" in dialogue and final narration ("She had been collecting hope"), leaving no room for subtext. This didactic approach explains the story's meaning to the reader rather than allowing resonance to emerge organically from the characters' struggles and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of memory as physical residue is well-developed through the orris root motif and object displacement. However, the final paragraph leans into expository summary ("Houses feel alive because...") rather than trusting the accumulated imagery to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("kindness without nuance was merely cruelty") rather than subtext or dramatic action. The story tells the reader exactly what to think about certainty and nuance, leaving no room for interpretive resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of perception shaping reality is coherent and drives the ending. However, the thematic realization is explicitly stated ("not confinement but boundlessness") rather than emerging organically through subtext, making the conclusion feel slightly sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative ("proof that kindness echoes"), removing subtext and flattening resonance into a moral. This telling rather than showing reduces the complexity, leaving the reader with a sentimental conclusion rather than an earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of cultural preservation is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, particularly in the dialogue ("seeds on the wind") and the "silent alphabet" metaphor. The explicit articulation of the story's thesis in the protagonist's speech flattens the subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of defying entropy and linear time is cohesive and resonant, merging seamlessly with the plot mechanics. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question, framing annihilation as a form of liberation without descending into simple moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme is clear but heavily explicated, particularly through the dictionary definition ("Fear n. The absence...") and the narrator's summary of the lesson at the end. This telling reduces the resonant power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of transforming destruction into harmony is coherent but articulated through direct summary ("obstacles... as instruments") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The concept is intriguing, but the story relies on stating its philosophy rather than letting the reader infer it from the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of recovering ancient truths to counter stagnation is coherent and resonates well with the final image of the waking turtles. The connection between the "watchers" and the turtles' awakening offers a satisfying, non-literal answer to the central mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.3)
    The themes of noble lies and historical preservation are articulated explicitly ("The question that had kept her awake..."), rendering the subtext text. The story relies on essayistic summary to deliver its message rather than allowing meaning to emerge organically from action and imagery. This didactic approach limits the resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of preserving "unfinished work" is coherent but delivered heavy-handedly through the inkwell's inscription and the explicit definition of "hushed blaze." This tendency to explain the theme reduces subtextual resonance and makes the epiphany feel instructive rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme of preserving forgotten truths is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("honesty required not just courage but cunning") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The story explicitly tells the reader what the discovery means instead of allowing the implications to resonate through action.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thematic integration is exceptional; the mechanics of the lantern craft perfectly mirror the processing of grief. The ending serves as a Conceptual Repricing ("learned to call the building of them craft"), offering a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the central loss that recharges the crane motif.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is resonant but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("I call it the only way forward," "This is bleak exhilaration") rather than subtext. The story lectures the reader on its meaning, reducing the "unfiltered awakening" to a stated label rather than a felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("frequency of belonging was not something to be decoded... it was something already present"), which flattens the subtext. The resolution tells the reader the meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of manufactured memory and surviving truth is coherent and lands clearly at the end. However, the resonance is dampened by explicit statements of the theme ("memories... could only be survived") rather than letting the subtext carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than emerging from subtext, particularly in the final paragraph ("knowledge that wisdom had come from pain"). This "sermonizing ending" flattens the resonance by summarizing the moral lesson for the reader instead of allowing the imagery to carry the meaning. The "small deaths" and "space between apology and forgiveness" read as abstract thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is heavily underlined, with the narrative explicitly interpreting the journey for the reader ("She was aligning heart and action... in the only way that mattered"). This overt moralizing in the penultimate paragraph reduces the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is delivered via explicit exposition in the final paragraph ("The jaded wonder she felt was not a contradiction but a synthesis") rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action. The story relies on the time traveler to articulate the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story ends with an explicit moral statement ("love, indeed, was larger than death ever was") that summarizes the theme rather than allowing the final image to resonate. This didacticism flattens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story succumbs to explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("the simple truth that some debts are paid not by accumulation but by acceptance"). This summative thesis statement flattens the subtext and violates the "show, don't tell" principle for thematic resonance, triggering a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of integrating grief and light is tightly woven into the physical action of stitching the photographs. The concept of "shadow work" is effectively dramatized through the interaction with the photos, though the explicit naming of the concept slightly reduces the subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story explicitly states its theme ("transformation is not a destination but a continuous becoming") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. This overt moralizing, particularly the summary of the lesson learned in the final paragraphs, reduces resonant complexity to a simple aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of "geometry of shadows" versus regime control is articulate but delivered through heavy-handed exposition. The ending moralizes about "kindling an idea" rather than letting the action resonate on its own, reducing subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of connection over capture is resonant, though the epiphany is delivered via explicit telling ("Mira understood then...") rather than emerging solely through subtext. The thematic reversal of the curse provides closure but feels slightly didactic in its articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme is heavily didactic, with the narrative repeatedly stopping to explain the meaning of events ("she understood that her scars were not endings but cartography"). These explicit thesis statements flatten the subtext and rob the ending of earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of "questions as destinations" is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition rather than emergent subtext. The narrative explicitly explains the meaning of the confrontation ("Varn understood that this confrontation was about...") instead of allowing the reader to decode it.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in desolation is poignant but heavily "told" rather than shown, particularly in the paragraph explicitly stating the library "was an act of resistance." This authorial interpretation flattens the subtext, explaining the meaning instead of letting it emerge from the characters' actions.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of grief as a suspended state is handled with consistency and grace. The broken clock and the "ghost" piano serve this theme well, though the text occasionally over-explains its symbols ("refused to cooperate with time's passage"). The concept of the encore as a "surprise" for fate is a resonant, non-literal resolution to his loss.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central theme of trust versus verification is coherent but articulated too explicitly in narrative summary ("remind her that some things could not be verified, only trusted"). The ending leans into moralizing, summarizing the lesson for the reader rather than allowing the resonant image of the scattered seeds to speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than allowed to resonate through subtext; the final paragraph summarizes the moral ("The color of unspoken apologies... was never truly blue") instead of trusting the reader to infer it. This sermonizing ending flattens the complexity of the grief into a tidy lesson.

    Theme of fractured identity emerges procedurally—each shard visited reconfigures meaning without thematic labels. Final ripple image offers non-literal answer: authorship over dispersion. Ambiguity lingers—will control annihilate or complete her? No moralizing; particulars carry resonance. Charged Poise ending reweights prior material cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: silence as sovereign medium rather than privation. The payoff image—“the filament…sang, in a language she was only beginning to learn”—reweights every earlier hush reference with conceptual cost. No moralising, no binary sentiment. Subtext of bodily listening versus auricular runs quietly through tactile beats. Complexity maintained; ambiguity feels purposeful rather than evasive.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited clings tightly to Maren’s perceptual gear: tactile metaphors predominate, verbs like “coax,” “chip away,” syntax breathes with her slow re-awakening. Lyric elevation stays within a music-teacher’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; narrative voice keeps rhythmic variation under pressure. POV stable; no filter-verb stacks. Distinctive perceptual signature evident (“architecture of her silenced world”).

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: meticulous record-keeping becomes moral resistance. The shift from data-as-archive to data-as-weapon reweights the storm journals without overt thesis. Final image reframes “quiet” as the thing being risked, not the thing preserved. Avoids explicit moralizing; only mildly dinged by the prompt-echo phrase “nurture integrity in solitude.”

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: extinction, scent, and grief as love’s residue. No moralizing; the final image of the bloom-as-lantern reweights prior material without assertion. Subtext operates in gesture—uncorking vial, petals spiraling—never in thesis statements. Ambiguity is purposeful: brother’s journals undeciphered, love persists anyway.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through the spiral’s refusal: translation itself becomes the last human art. No character states the moral; the final image reweights the premise by showing that choosing to describe is still a form of participation. The energy beings remain unknowable, preserving productive ambiguity. One stray sentence (“freedom was not the absence of walls…”) edges toward aphorism but is saved by the tactile context of the rope.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme—beauty inseparable from damage—emerges through orchard ash, cracked glass, and bowl’s inherited stories; final image refuses to moralize, letting warmth in brass reweight devastation. No echo-line states the thesis; silence itself functions as resonant subtext. Particulars accumulate into unavoidable emotional after-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from action: useful lies vs. unbearable truth. Subtext lives in the blotter petal—an object that absorbs and transmits feeling yet remains only paper. Final image reweights premise: half truths are whole lies, but necessary ones. No moralizing; resonance is felt through the exhale that releases yet retains grief.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of unseen labor emerges through objects (locket, program annotations) rather than exposition. Final image reconfigures Maren’s private lighthouse ritual without moralizing. Slight cap because thematic question is stable but not complexly ambiguous; resonance is tender yet single-note.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through the arbor’s mirror and the spiral tag: kinship is a reciprocal lattice, not a gift one carries to strangers. Subtext lives in the shift from “outstretched hands” to “learn the children’s names”—a quiet indictment of performative empathy. No moralizing; the final image of spirals ahead leaves the work unfinished and the cost acknowledged. The reweighting of the Threader from elusive savior to communal ritual is the conceptual punch that reconfigures prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of preservation-through-intervention emerges from concrete beats: cataloguing extinction, reclaiming lost rhythm, accepting temporal theft as stewardship; no moralising, just the charged final sketchbook image that reframes her lifelong documentation as active resistance against silence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without statement: love travels best when sender vanishes. Subtext lives in gesture—cradling “not debris but a covenant”—and in the irony that disappearance is the only visibility that counts. Maternal voice reprises at closure, reweighting unseen labor as trans-temporal parenting. No moralizing line mars the resonance; ambiguity (will the child ever hear?) lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Metamorphosis theme emerges through plant behavior manuals: growth after damage models human late-life change. Subtext stays off-nose—no caterpillar metaphors until the call, and then it’s recalled experience, not sermon. Final image reframes prior botany data into emotional reconfiguration without explicit statement. Complexity intact: nursery remains unsold, change remains frightening, yet possibility curls upward.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges obliquely: artifacts outlive people, but only human attention re-enchants them. Subtext lives in the telescope’s inversion—looking forward literally lets her close her eyes. The final image of sleep beside the “ancient pillar” reframes endurance as a form of faith rather than defeat. No moral is stated; the brooch’s absence is the silent thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of mapping: external cartography collapses into internal inscription. The final shimmer-perforation reweights all prior arrows as invitations to self-revelation, offering resonant ambiguity—no moral, only the cost of spoken vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without assertion: knowledge as communal, iterative offering rather than solitary conquest. The unheard symphony image reconfigures prior whale-songs as polyphonic human memory, a non-literal answer to her initial doubt. No overt moralizing; resonance arises from the tile’s final glow. Complexity remains—she keeps skepticism, now coupled with wonder—resisting tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: transition as translation, not termination. The amulet’s curse and solar storm act as concrete particulars that reweight “goodbye” into doorway imagery without moralizing. Final image crystallizes the concept—hellos in a pre-stellar language—leaving lingering ambiguity managed with precision. No thesis statement intrudes; insight is earned through the spatial mutiny endured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: fairness as a living equation whose variables are transparency and risk. Subtext resides in the ink—once tool of forgery, now instrument of veracity—its re-pricing at closure supplies conceptual resonance. Final image refuses moralizing; the chrysanthemums simply sit beside the pot, letting the reader complete the cost calculus. Minor deduction for the single line “she had found her equation,” which edges toward explicit thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—silence as saturated memory—emerges through refracted light and bonsai rings, never sermonized. The final seed-scatter of light offers a resonant, non-literal answer: history is not retrieved but endlessly reread. Ambiguity is productive; no moral is stated.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: erased histories can outlive documents through communal storytelling and the refusal to disappear. Subtext operates in the poison label turned talisman—suicide deferred becomes evidence of endurance. Final image reconfigures meaning without moralizing: the unnamed keeper walks on, pockets full of contraband memory. Ambiguity is purposeful; complexity is honored rather than balanced into tidy symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the accumulation of might-have-been conversations; no character ever names “grief” or “forgiveness.” The spiral shell quietly reprises the motif of circular rather than linear meaning, reweighted in the final line: “the compass…pointed…inward.” Subtext is carried in gesture—each return to the cello is a tacit admission that her life’s work was avoidance. The ending offers resonant ambiguity: embracing mystery is neither victory nor defeat, only the next page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—collaborative memory vs market seizure—emerges via graffiti resurrection, never abstract lecture. Subtext in chalk circles and spirals lets readers decode threat themselves. Final image of music matching heartbeat offers quiet but charged answer: culture as living pulse, not commodity. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity persists about whether code can truly stall capital. Slight redundancy in “foundation” metaphor (stone + community) is the only soft echo.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the parallel between chemical latency and geological transience; no explicit thesis is stated. The final image of “scattered diamonds” reframes beauty as inseparable from mortality. Ambiguity is preserved: witness is triumph and defeat simultaneously, avoiding moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of “repaired connection” emerges through the drone’s flight and the water-light language; no explicit thesis is stated. Final image of mist swallowing the bird reweights earlier refraction motif into a quiet conceptual cost: every fix vanishes into uncertainty. The celebration stays modest, avoiding sentimental payload, yet the arc is thin—Elias’s own beliefs go untested.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges obliquely: maps are living texts rewritten by patient attention, truth accretes like frost. No moralizing; the final image lets water find its level—an unspoken answer to her quest. Ambiguity remains—symbol still unread—so theme resists tidy closure. Leaf/condensation recurrence is functional, not ornamental, reweighting meaning at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: communal memory is a physical vibration that can be re-taught to stone. The fork, arch, and footfalls form a quiet parable about caretaking as acoustic labor. No moralizing summary; the final image of the smiling listener beside humming stone re-prices patience as audible activism. Ambiguity lingers—will anyone actually return?—but the ecological argument (one town’s silence sickens others) is cleanly embedded.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of ephemeral beauty preserved through personal annihilation emerges via image (perfume as memory liquid) rather than statement. Final line reweights “gathered hush” from abstract mood to literal vessel, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries: civilization’s trap is also its gift. Minor echo of “gathered hush” twice in opening paragraph feels purposeful, not redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of inherited story versus communal denial emerges through recurrent lattice/copperlight imagery that reweights at closure; no moral statement intrudes, and the final image of “lattice holding the light” offers resonant, non-literal answer to who carries truth when no one listens.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—life-debt and loving harm—emerges through graft, venom, and tear rather than statement. Ambiguity survives: is gift salvation or trap? Final tear reconfigures reader’s weight of “loving venom,” achieving Conceptual Repricing. No sermonizing; complexity honored.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from the concrete act of sewing paths where no water flows; no character ever utters a thesis. The copper plate’s image of threads-at-crossroads retroactively reweights every prior night’s sleepwalking into a ritual of civic creation. The final image—luminous thread on dry stone—offers a non-literal answer: reverence is not found but stitched, and only by those willing to inhabit ruin forever. Ambiguity lingers: the community above may still ignore her paths; the cost is hers alone, making the moral complex.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of cyclical return emerges through apple/tree/root imagery; no declarative thesis. The sundial’s re-installation offers a non-literal answer: time resumes on ancestral terms, not modern metrics. Moral complexity is honored—she neither forgives exile nor denounces refuge. Final moonlit image reweights prior motifs without sermon; ambiguity lingers about whether enchantment is comfort or burden.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of identity-as-inscription emerges through the iterative acts of naming, coding, and posting; no character states it aloud. The final postscript reconfigures the premise: the pseudonym is not disguise but reclamation, inviting reader to reread prior marginalia as self-authorship. Ambiguity lingers—who will receive, what risk to Maren—without moralizing. The resonance is earned, specific, and tied to the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—silenced histories embroidered into light—emerges through constellation-as-archive and final thread of possibility; no moral is stated, only the crystallized image of stories pressing against glass, inviting reflection on who gets remembered.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of unspoken regret emerges from tangible objects (shard, letter, condensation) rather than thesis. Final reweighting—“Its words had finally, impossibly, arrived”—offers non-literal answer: apology needs no delivery when self-forgiveness is embodied. Ambiguity survives: sister’s actual ghost never appears, preserving moral complexity. No closing moralizing; resonance runs through image, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the specific act of translation itself: every act of witness erodes the translator. The coral fragment and the cast are living reefs of damage—both grow by accretion, both must be released back to the sea of other lives. No moralizing; the final image of “lotus-hearted ache” is an earned conceptual repricing: beauty that floats on murky water. Subtext lives in silence—Fatima never speaks; her fingertip touch is the only verdict needed.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as transmission versus preservation: joy survives only by being spent. Subtext lives in gesture—the old woman’s touch naming the grandmother—silently passing the flame. No moralizing; the final image of children dancing in fog reweights the fresco’s sacrifice without commentary. Ambiguity lingers: will Mira ever get the color back? The question is left alive, charging resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of receptive creation emerges through echoed sound and paint layers; no moralizing, only the final image of brush held in charged pause, inviting reader to hear the unfinished chord.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without slogans: taxation of cognition is resisted by an act that literalizes thought as untraceable root. Final image of “water table of rebellion” reweights every prior whispered leaf and insect lookout into a subterranean network—an organic CR that avoids moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will the rattle frequency free minds or merely map surveillance gaps? Complexity sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—memory as the price of progress—emerges through recurring images of fossilized emotion and the caretaker’s nightly penance. Subtext resides in the crack that leaks more than sound: it leaks the unrecoverable. Final image of eternal return reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is coherent: preservation is both love and curse.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: language as covenant, honesty as survival requirement. The final cadence reweights prior images (ink, silence, symphonies) without sermonizing. No thematic echo violations; the concept stays implicit in the fugue metaphor and the tearful reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: the only enduring harmony is measured, iterated maintenance, not transcendence. Encrypted love motif matures from chemical residue to inheritance of risk, reweighting “harmonize conflicting values” into a lived, lifelong burden. Final image refrains from moral; the chain’s clink is answer enough. Subtext of parental love encoded in industrial glue is slyly heartfelt yet never declared.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges without statement: inheritance is not ownership but the obligation to keep transmitting despite silence. The meteorite-as-gramophone reweights grief from archive to active radio, turning memory into forward motion. Final non-literal answer: trust is a song that blooms only as it withers, refusing closure yet enabling continuance. No moralizing; the lullaby itself is the rebuttal to any abstract thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges as “every boundary is a doorway” but resists stating; it accrues through corn mazes, weather codes, and pressure maps in wood. Final image of compass pointing toward transformation offers non-literal answer to sacred threshold question. No moralizing, only crystallized choice. Ambiguity lingers: will the new atmospheric rules someday erase this map too?

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: belonging is a practice of shared attention, not ancestral formula. The firefly constellation reprises earlier star-mapping research, reweighting their failed isolation into Marek’s open gaze. No moralizing; the closing image leaves ambiguity intact. The burnt feather motif recurs but mainly as heirloom conduit rather than active tension, limiting deeper subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: grief’s logic prefers continuation over closure, and memory’s fragments can reconfigure absence into a different form of presence. Subtext operates in the fisher’s silence around “a void too large to name” and in Maren’s withheld certainty. The ending refuses to moralize, offering resonance through image rather than thesis. No motif is forced; seeds, light, and paths accrue meaning through functional reuse.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly: wonder engineered by concealed order. Final image reweights earlier repetitions—bishop pocketed, act over, tomorrow’s math already begun—without moralizing. Subtext whispers through the ivory’s worn grooves: beauty carved by relentless use. Complexity is modest; the piece resists tidy morals yet offers no counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme: exile as voluntary metamorphosis, not loss. Emerges via tide/garden mirroring and the final re-weighting of “return.” No moralizing; silence of mortal woman invites reader to fill gap. Avoids tidy profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through refraction imagery: clarity discovered inside imperfection. The pond rings reprise at closure, non-literally answering the thematic question. No moralizing—wisdom stays implicit, carried by the final ripple.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of fire’s indifference versus human caring; no character states the thesis aloud. The porcelain box and crazed mirror reprice the premise: survival is not healing but translational labor. Final image of moonlight on closed box offers non-literal answer—grief is not solved but containerized and mobilized. Ambiguity lingers whether this bargain is mercy or new scar tissue.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—hope as quantifiable emergent phenomenon—remains coherent and implicit, avoiding explicit moral. The sea-as-polish metaphor subtly echoes incrementalism, reweighting earlier images in the final paragraph. However, the lack of on-page failure or contradiction keeps the theme from accruing complexity beyond its initial thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—memory as an unfinished relay across ecological collapse—emerges through the specific objects (negative, ivy, ash) rather than exposition. The ending’s image of walls dreaming aloud offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Ashworth’s question, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext of intergenerational caretaking is carried in the silent transfer of the incomplete chart.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: immortality’s curse is not loneliness but the burden of sowing futures one can never inhabit. The mirrors’ visions—dancers, youthful faces, egalitarian kitchens—are concrete particulars, not abstractions, so the moral never needs stating. Final image of “faint shimmer” reframes every prior droplet as a seed she paid for with presence. Resonance lingers in the reader’s own reflection: which possibilities we awaken cost us the comfort of never knowing their outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without thesis statement: peace as endless maintenance rather than noble culmination. The flawed-beauty tone—”beautiful in its imperfection”—is earned through the specific image of two bereaved leaders shaking hands on blood-stained stone. Final reconfiguration reweights the clipboard from bureaucratic prop to reliquary of names, offering a non-literal answer: redemption is the continuing act of reading the dead, not their resurrection. No moralizing sentence intrudes; resonance is purely imagistic.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the paradox of sterile creation: to resurrect song she must first orchestrate silence. The salt flat’s white blindness mirrors her moral erasure; the egg’s translucent veins become the last possible pigment of meaning. No moralizing sentence intrudes; the final image reweights “fractured grace” as both crime and benediction. Reader is left inside the contradiction, the only honest place to land.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: the ethics of narrative ownership reframed as negative space—what we leave unwritten. Subtext lives in the abandoned stick and the unheard backward tale. Final image reframes prior metaphors (celestial eye now blind, stick now horizontal monument) without sermon. Ambiguity is productive: reader must finish the silence, enacting the lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: impermanence as the only durable witness. Subtext resides in gesture—knotting as historiography, seventeen-minute stillness as monument. Final image reframes earlier cataloguing into iterated caretaking without moral sermon. One minor echo: “histories demanded silence to be heard” borders thesis-statement, but is early and quickly grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme—“remembrance as an active, living burden rather than frozen monument”—emerges through the rope’s re-activation, never stated. The final image reweights the entire archive from static bronze to vibrating fiber, offering conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext hums in the rope’s quiet resonance: the dead are not resurrected, but their names now demand ongoing maintenance. Counter-readings linger: is she re-opening the wound she fled? The piece refuses to resolve that ambiguity, deepening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges as the inversion of instruction: questions precede answers, paths choose walkers. The motif is handled through concrete texture (bleeding ink, shifting seal) rather than statement, and the ending’s conceptual repricing invites counter-readings without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges without statement: empirical frugality accidentally erases the very devotion that sustains order.Encrypted love poem to an alien pattern-mind reframes science as courtship. Final image reweights earlier material—constellations now feel complicit, not distant. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about whether the guardian is benevolent or merely contractual.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges obliquely: grace is finite yet recyclable, and only relinquishing grievance allows redistribution. Subtext lives in gesture—Kael’s trembling fingers on the broken comb say more than apology. The final line (“The music box played”) is a CR that silently reweights every prior fracture. No moralizing paragraph, only the garden’s impossible roses as after-image.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Emergent theme of permeability—mirror as membrane, fog as half-world—grows from concrete particulars; final image of dissolving glass mountains reweights the astronomer’s lost dream without moralizing. Avoids explicit thesis, but theme remains slightly abstract because the dream is never particularized beyond “glass mountains.”

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: repair is not restoration but renegotiation across generations. The deciduous vow motif moves from abstract to concrete as fallen fruit and re-tied ribbon reweight “promise” as something that must be released to re-root. No moralizing; the final image invites multiple readings—atonement, continuity, surrender. The insight is earned through tactile struggle rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly: knowledge is a hereditary trap whose price is the loss of protective uncertainty. No moral is stated; the final image of “understanding” reweights all prior bewilderment without sermon. Motifs (trees, cameo, bathroom sanctuary) recur only when they constrain choice or accrue new meaning. The reader is left to weigh whether understanding is worth the cost—an ambiguity that lingers legitimately.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of knowledge-as-loss emerges organically via pressed flowers standing for unlearned lessons, avoiding explicit sermon. The unheard symphony motif threads through setting and culminates in the “single crystalline note,” reweighting earlier motifs. Subtext invites reflection on humanity’s fear of understanding, but the insight is delivered in summation (“she understood that…”) rather than through a costly deed. Complexity is honored—no tidy moral—yet the payoff is slightly intellectual rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    The twin-as-palimpsest premise generates a coherent theme of identity-as-multiplicity, emerging through image rather than说教. The closing paradox of “trapped… and impossibly free” offers a resonant non-literal answer, but the lack of dramatized cost keeps the reweighting cerebral. Subtext stays implicit; no pseudo-profundity, yet insight remains thin because experience is summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of absence-as-presence emerges through the rope’s empty spaces and the door that was never missing, never stated aloud. Final image crystallizes without sermon: university as “living document” reweights all prior gears into silent testimony—earned, quiet complexity that invites rereading.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of quiet as radical resistance emerges through fracture-reading and bodily cost rather than statement; final “nothing-song” reweights all prior noise without moralizing. Could edge higher if subtext showed what she must now abandon to guard the bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges obliquely: fragments reassembled into meaning outlast civil collapse. Subtext lives in the pavilion’s refusal to stop humming—beauty as stubborn infrastructure. Final image of “shattered pieces reassembled” reweights earlier debris without moralizing. Avoids explicit thesis, though “proving coincidences have meaning” flirts with Echo; saved by poetic distancing.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—identity as collective accumulation—emerges through monuments, shadows, and whispering crystals without explicit thesis. Final image of “presence over name” reweights earlier motifs. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Could use one concrete counter-instance to sharpen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through particular fire chemistry and vanished stars: controlled human combustion as answer to cosmic blackout. Final image reframes prior motif—spiral becomes “hope taking physical form despite gravity,” a conceptual repricing that avoids moralizing. Subtext of playfulness vs mortality is woven into diction (“serious playfulness,” “deadly serious and fundamentally absurd”). The essayistic line “darkness could be pierced…” is the closest to overt thesis but is earned by the imminent act.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of transition emerges through iterated tide-to-speech parallels; no character moralizes it. Subtext lives in gesture: cicada warmth = stored songs never fully voiced. Final image reweights grandmother’s gift from souvenir to conversation starter without thesis line. Avoids sentimentality by leaving reconciliation tidal, not certain.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: exposure vs shelter reframed so limitation applies to fear, not to life itself. Subtext resides in the doll’s survival centuries underground—implying cultures that once chose openness. Final image of a future trellis “where the only thing limited was the fear of opening doors” reweights prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo or tidy binary; ambiguity lingers about how she’ll fund that trellis under her father’s roof.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges as the inverse of absence: silence is not void but an unfurnished room; the story furnishes it through Maren’s actions. The reprise of “quiet that follows the train whistle’s echo” reweights from ominous hush to achieved sanctuary. No moral is stated; the boy will “not remember… but would carry with him the knowledge” is the conceptual repricing that lets the reader feel the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of knowledge-as-transformation emerges through paint layers and stair surrender, never sermonised. Final image of ascending at sunrise reweights scholarship into guardianship without moralising. Subtext stays in murals and orchard physics; reader invited to equate learning with stepping into unknowing. One echo of abstract “bridge” phrasing near end keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the ash-to-starlight progression: thresholds must be tended, not abolished. Subtext lives in gesture—clasped hands of the ring versus the keeper’s final unclenched step. No moralizing line tells the lesson; the image of crossing a door made from former burns reweights the premise. Ambiguity remains: return may still kill her, but stasis certainly will—complexity honored.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of promise-as-pressure crystallizes through the bolt-diamond metaphor; the final image reweights “broken expectations” into “something brilliant” without moralizing. Subtext runs through object handling and mirrored self rather than exposition. Ambiguity lingers: is the quantum promise benevolent or just another scheme? The refusal to answer charges the after-effect. One thematic echo line (“promises could be traps”) is stated outright in paragraph one, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of heredity as inescapable resonance emerges through sound imagery rather than exposition. Final image of “the veil between past and present grown thin as paper” invites re-reading without moralizing. Could sharpen ironic gap: Elara the rationalist undone by acoustic memory.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story’s after-image—possibility once wooden now carried inside—emerges through puppet-motion and orchard-dissolution rather than dictation; the marionettes’ “frozen stars” reconfigure from decorative into existential weight. No moral is pronounced, yet the re-pricing of regret into imaginative duty lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through juxtaposition of bureaucratic erasure vs. artifactual mercy; no explicit thesis stated. Button’s journey from soldier to orphan reconfigures meaning of survival and continuity. Final documentation image invites reflection on who gets archived. Resonant without moralizing; complexity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: palimpsest city, stubborn lagoon, grandmother-smoothed key—no abstract sermon. Final image of scattered star-codes reframes her former invisibility as future dissemination network, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moral statement. Indifference as tyranny is dramatized, not labeled. One near-fail: “the tyranny of indifference” flirts with thesis-speak, but the phrase is buried mid-story and instantly grounded in the archive’s living evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through negative-space music: language is a hunger that silence must feed nightly.  Final image of fused breath-and-fog reweights the premise—prophecy is not defeated but continuously postponed, making endurance the only moral stance.  No explicit thesis; ambiguity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of intergenerational memory emerges organically from seed, leaf, and moonstone rather than thesis statement. The final image—tiny monuments humming—offers a Charged Poise that reweights her earlier shrines as prophetic infrastructure, not eccentric habit. Ambiguity lingers: will one seed truly avert drought? Complexity embraced; no moral spoon-fed. Subtext resides in gesture (antler prod, lantern shadow) more than direct insight, satisfying the resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of certainty vs. chaos is embedded in occupation and self-description; compass as lost axis of order is implicit but not yet repriced. Subtext is present (she fixes dead time while her own waits) but no culminating reweighting yet. Potential strong, but must pay off later.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme—visible fracture as the only honest wholeness—emerges through the kintsugi act rather than exposition. Subtext lives in gesture: gold filling cracks mirrors her accepting the irreparable loss of her brother. Final image of luminous seams reframes her earlier obsession with flawless alloys; meaning is repriced without a sermon. Complexity is honored: she doesn’t renounce science, but expands it to include mortal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—laughter as integrative grief-work—emerges from the sonic alchemy of broken notes, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: tooth pressed to string enacts the pressure of shame transmuted into sound. Final image of “sacred absurdity” reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: joy does not erase atrocity, it merely lets the dead leave—complex, unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ultraviolet forest and strap build a meditation on surveillance and self-punishment without naming it; the ending image re-prices mercy as perpetual exposure. No moralizing. Could leach slightly more concrete loss (social, bodily) to reach highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of generational guidance emerges through refraction imagery rather than thesis: relay, lens, corridor, beam. Final image re-weights “honoring overlooked histories” from archival duty to active continuation, achieving resonance without moralizing. Subtextual silence around the Keeper’s death keeps ambiguity productive. One minor echo risk—“the only history that mattered”—skirts proclamation but lands inside POV idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of “repairing what can’t be seen” emerges from Marcus’s trade and gift; no direct statement. Subtext resides in silence of dead fluorescents and wound spring—objects that “wait.” Final image answers thematic question non-literally: ceilings hide unfinished stories, and engaging means carrying them. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what the hatch will cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as the paradox of preservation: to keep something forever you must let it leave the bottle and become unreadable, ever-spreading language. The final image of new cloud-patterns silently reweights every prior mention of “compressed histories” without moralizing. No motif is paraded for its own sake; frost, bottle, and press all converge on that single idea. The concept is coherent yet slender—one elegant turn rather than a layered ambivalence—so it stops just short of the 9-band resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges implicitly: civilizations survive by carrying contradictory origin stories without shattering. Subtext lives in gesture—covering mirrors is an act of compassionate curation rather than denial. Final image of “reflective dark behind the cloth” conceptually reweights the premise, refusing monolithic history. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what kids will be taught.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges: patience vs irretrievable loss; final thin note reweights prior silence without moralizing. Subtext in “mending what isn’t torn” implies emotional labor unseen. Recurrent rust/covenant motif returns charged in final heartbeat image. Avoids tidy profundity; ambiguity lingers whether light can ever fully return. No late thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges implicitly: the limit of cataloguing experience versus inhabiting it. Subtext resides in the unfillable vial—an image that reweights every prior collection without moralising. No thematic echo is spoken; meaning is charged through the final gesture alone. Ambiguity lingers yet feels coherent, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from sedimented images rather than assertion: lineage, salvage, conversation across time. The final image reweights earlier motifs—arch, hands, storm—into a non-literal answer: making is inheritance. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the unfinished arm. One near-platitude (“she was perpetually learning”) is embedded early enough to feel like character habit, not authorial sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of inherited historical witness emerges organically from diary → lagoon → cipher debris chain; no explicit thesis moralizes. The final reconfiguration—“truth deferred but never destroyed”—is earned by the grandmother’s decades-long loop, not Miriam’s struggle, so resonance is second-hand. Subtext in the ciphered shells is elegant: patina of time literalized in salt-crusted bone. Ambiguity is present yet leans sentimental rather than morally complex.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: remembrance > wishing. The lanterns’ return offers a Conceptual Repricing—what was once magical wish-fuel is now memory-fired, reweighting the story’s own rule-set. Subtext resides in silent objects: the bottle that cannot open, the bread that was never baked. Final image answers the implicit question—what does a civilization do when magic dies?—by showing it begin again, lighter but real, avoiding sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of memory-as-contract emerges through concrete events: obsolete foghorn, child’s recording, tablets nobody remembers. Final line gives non-literal answer—smile charged with “velvet disquiet”—showing covenant accepted without moral. Subtextual irony: technology dies so ancient voices live. No thematic echo or moralizing; ambiguity lingers cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: inheritance as living debt, time as cultivar that must be grafted onto future flesh. The oak cap’s return in the final line re-prices every prior mention—memento becomes mortgage. Subtext operates in gesture (seedling lifting like recognition) and silence (no ancestor speaks; their pulse simply arrives). Avoids any explanatory moral; the image of vortex sealing is the non-literal answer, reweighting the premise without pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of listening-as-care emerges through mirrored acts—monks’ bell, Elara’s switch—without explicit statement. Final image of “solstice hush gave way to rain” offers quiet CR that reweights prior silence as communal shelter rather than solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of strength-through-vulnerability emerges via tactile star-care rather than assertion. The amber refraction reweights stillness as creative force, offering resonant ambiguity. Final image avoids moralizing, though earlier “flourishing stillness” leans toward thematic label.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of silent inheritance emerges entirely through image—bees, glass, ash—never named as thesis. Final image of the box “heavy with the eloquence of silence” offers non-literal conceptual repricing that reweights every prior visual. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers about what remembering will demand.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the reweighted fragment: measurement versus felt experience. Final image reconfigures prior material without moralising—“the silo humming its low frequency hum that was less sound than feeling”—offering resonant ambiguity grounded in specific objects.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges from the sequence of mending gestures that fail completeness: incompleteness as generative, not defect. Subtext operates in the bird’s reluctant trust and the poet’s unspoken recognition that the feather is both trophy and relic of damage. No overt thesis; the final “small fire” image reprises earlier “burnished hush” and revalues incompleteness as fuel. Ambiguity is purposeful: reader must decide whether the poet’s stance is wisdom or coping, yet the emotional aftereffect—bittersweet lift—lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges unsaid: architecture as mutual listening across species and centuries. The copper coil becomes a silent language whose meaning is repriced when the wind makes it sing back at the end—an image that reweights all prior wire-wrap beats. No moral is declared; the diary’s legacy question lingers in charged poise. Ambiguity is purposeful and contained within the orchard’s slow temporal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—pilgrimage as suspended seeking—emerges cleanly through fly-in-amber recursion and alien star-migration parallels. Subtext hums in imagery (fossilized transit, bronze quiet) rather than explicit thesis. Final sentence reweights premise without moralizing. Some lines edge toward overt statement (“Homecoming…was recognition”) but are saved by imagistic context; still, a touch of essay cadence blunts resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through image-pattern: dead tongue, seed-memory, drowned city-whisper converging on resurrection without moralising. Subtle dialectic—human culpability vs biotic persistence—remains open; no final sentence sermon. Final image reweights “narrow vastness” from spatial loneliness to germinal horizon. Particulars (pod, reef, bird treaty) carry the idea, not abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of translation-as-survival emerges through the cylinder, leaf, and groove-reading without explicit moralizing; the final sentence reweights “distance” as bridge rather than gap, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtextual irony—only silence teaches him to hear—adds depth. One minor echo: “wild hush” is named twice, slightly announcing the motif instead of letting it accrete.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the iterative sketching ritual rather than assertion: each stroke renegotiates humanity’s place in stretched time. The final reweighting—true north as direction in the soul—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the shutdown’s moral ledger stays open, inviting counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of recursive theft and historical debt emerges through the objects rather than exposition; the final line reframes “embrace the unknown” as accepting an unquantified culpability. Ambiguity is purposeful—no moral is preached—yet the after-effect is slightly cerebral because Caelius’s interior shift is summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges: history is built from relinquished ghosts, not catalogued artifacts. The empty chessboard and the un-echoed name reweight the premise without moralizing. Final image offers resonant ambiguity—absence as luminous beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: home as language one learns to speak with one’s whole being. The stone’s permission-vocabulary reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and tactile image; no thesis stated. Final image reweights the opening wound—remembering shifts from injury to vocation. Complexity lingers: she leaves sanctuary to risk prophecy in the world.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: the value of teaching sacrifice itself becomes the moral reconfiguration. The tapestry’s frayed border literalizes the way narratives unravel and reweave truth; the final fold under her arm is the quiet answer that some games are won by refusing to play for victory. No moralizing line mars the close; resonance lands in the rain-soaked stillness. The concept of “woven hush” reweights from decorative motif to epistemic tool—silence as the space where meaning is re-stitched.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the counter-ritual of un-making: truth survives only when fractured into many mouths. Subtext lives in the child’s tears—recognition that forgetting is maternal loss. The ending reweights “forgiveness” as self-absolution for prior complicity, not temple absolution. No moralizing; the bird fable resonates without decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kintsugi-as-acceptance emerges organically through scar-matching action; no editorial thesis is stated. The final reweighting—brokenness as aperture for light—pays off the statue’s accumulated damage without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: workshop may still drown, but she owns the uncertainty. Theme is inseparable from the alchemist’s arc and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges without sermon: beauty cannot be possessed, only offered. The shell’s migration from childhood gift to painted talisman to water-borne monument reweights meaning at closure. Subtext operates in the cracked mirror (self-fracture) and the pool’s hidden light (art’s fugitive luminosity). Final image reframes prior material; no explicit moral is stated.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges obliquely through the recurrence of “frequency,” “vibration,” and “song” until the final reconfiguration reframes communication itself as non-verbal tenderness. No moralizing; the logbook line acts as resonant image rather than thesis. Ambiguity lingers—did the sailors turn because of physics or faith?—embracing complexity without false equivalence. Slight deduction for “screaming tenderness” echoing prompt language a touch too literally.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Reverse migration as theme emerges through action, not lecture: choosing to go north into winter toward pain. Bronze heirloom, moon tides and dead beacon accrue into meditation on bearing another’s bereavement. Final image of two silhouettes avoids moralising; resonance lingers in shared darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—memory as subversive mercy—emerges through orchard imagery and smuggled gaze, never sermonized. Final tableau (glass eye beside discredited cures) reweights earlier “emotional memory” theory without naming it. Subtext in “mouth an open wound” hints at contagious vulnerability. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers on replication risk.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme—reconciliation across silence—emerges through iterated images of “gaps” (missing footprints, blank memories, untaken letters) rather than statement. Final image of lighthouse as “gathering place for lost things” reconfigures the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in the flower: alpine fragility carried seaward implies maternal love mis-delivered yet enduring. Ambiguity is preserved: we never learn mother’s name or fate, so theme breathes rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the recurring image of maps that remember: knowledge earned by touch, not theory. The doorway reframes “home” as an active crossing, not a location, avoiding moral statement. Subtext resides in the ants—collective certainty guiding solitary doubt—paid off when she follows them into disappearance. Final reconfiguration is felt, not preached, satisfying the 9− band.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of sovereignty redefined as custodianship of irreparable beauty emerges through the bleeding starlight motif; no character editorializes it. The final smile carries the cost of endless service, letting resonance accrue without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges via shell spiral as iterative return; final reweighting (“we hold the secret”) avoids moralizing, inviting reader re-pricing. Subtext in Sera’s whisper and shared silence layers intimacy without overt statement—resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges as the cost of lucidity: to see the machinery of consciousness is to be mangled by it. The scroll’s final state—saturated, tear-stained—physicalizes that wisdom without stating it. The ending image (grave learning to speak) reweights mortality from dread to continuity, resonating off earlier “neither quite alive nor entirely dead.” No sermonizing; the conceptual repricing does the thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges: attention itself is a form of care that outlives any single sense. Subtext lives in silent tea steam and worn screw threads; no moralizing. Final image answers the question “how to heal?” without stating it. Particulars resist tidy uplift; ambiguity lingers credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through image, not lecture: scars → stories, crystals → compressed grief, held breath → creative pause. Grandmother superstition reframed as practical instruction gives conceptual repricing to “childish” belief. No tidy moral; the ending invites ambiguity—will the runes still work off the platform? Emotional aftereffect is quiet awe rather than triumph, earned by concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of salvage after ruin emerges from the aborted symphony and the orchard’s felling; the perfume’s garden-ghost reweights “belonging” without moralizing, though the sisters’ shared history is sketched more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    A coherent theme—knowledge versus entropy—emerges through the Archive and the dying-universe frame, but it is stated by setting, not dramatized by choice. The dictionary and Spiral hint at language’s power to order contradiction, yet Elara never tests that power, so insight stays theoretical. Subtext is present in the hush and the “unwritten endings,” but no final image re-prices the premise. Theme feels evocative yet undeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely: devotion to imperceptible cosmic rhythms versus atomic-age dismissal. The “razor edge” where sea meets sky becomes a metaphor for the thin perceptual line between banal routine and transcendence. Subtext resides in tactile ritual—her palm on glass, key against chest—rather than exposition. Final smile reframes seventeen years not as waste but as chosen lens on universal flux, avoiding explicit moral.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from fungal law: permeability is not invasion but recognition of existing filaments. The final image—three figures forming a charged triangle in blue-green light—offers a non-literal answer: love can be the deliberate maintenance of an untouched cap. No moral is stated; the physics of letting go is demonstrated, not preached. Counter-readings linger: is this devotion or cowardice? The ambiguity is productive, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of risk-as-love emerges through recurring probability imagery rather than statement; the lantern’s “honest light” reprises as shared honesty. Subtext in subway graffiti keeps math metaphor alive. Final sentence’s “multiplication of meaning” risks thematic echo, but it is folded into the closure image, so abstraction is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: anonymous caretaking as secular priesthood—endings taught to begin in darkness. Subtext lives in gesture—she never says “I’m lonely,” yet the harmonica’s infinite sustain says it. Final image reweights the premise: the phone that always rings is both grace and life sentence. No moralizing, only charged poise; ambiguity lingers like the note itself.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from tea-steep metaphor lineage: preservation as living infusion, not mummification. Final promise reweights “weight of small moments” from burden to currency without moralizing. Subtle shift from fear of proximity to embrace of flux offers resonant non-literal answer. Avoids thematic echo; no platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Reciprocity as ancient economy emerges through action, not lecture; loneliness is reframed from private ache to tradable scarcity. Final laugh in the hollow hall reweights the ivy-draped ruin into a site of voluntary exposure—resonant without moralizing. Theme stays implicit, specific, and tied to the logistician’s renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of stillness as navigable terrain emerges through sensory pattern, not statement; the closing “quiet blaze that illuminates not the path ahead but the traveler herself” reweights the entire journey into a resonant conceptual repricing without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the reframed mistake: filtration rather than failure. The anomaly, the pen, and the signal all act as filters that remove noise until meaning remains—no moralizing line spells this out. Final image of sitting with the universe’s breath offers quiet conceptual repricing: exile becomes elective vigil. Ambiguity lingers—who answered?—but the emotional after-effect is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: remembrance lives in unrecorded transmission. Subtext resides in empty camera vs. living gesture; no ethical binaries forced. Final image reconfigures meaning without moralizing. “Joyful sorrow” is rendered as embodied loosening in Elena’s shoulders—specific, unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—art as insurgent archive versus controlled library—emerges through accreted images of burned vs. buried collections. Final image reweights earlier arson as precursor to preservation, avoiding moral lecture. Subtext stays implicit; no redundant thesis stated. Ambiguity survives: knowledge freed yet buried anew, giving aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of unauthorized resurrection emerges through sensory particulars rather than thesis: dream is “suspended like light between stars,” reweighted when Elara turns the lab’s therapy tool into séance. Final image offers non-literal answer—sister’s smile within entanglement—without moral. Complexity preserved: scientists remain oblivious, rebellion is tiny yet cosmic.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: old attention outlives high-tech hubris. Coin, key, and folded maps form a quiet triptych of inherited knowing vs. futile mastery. Final image reweights the premise—technology stays silent, flesh-and-voice network endures. No moralizing; resonance lives in the violet flicker on steel and the coin’s inherited warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through iterated light-weaving: silence can be a transmit/reflect medium for hope. No overt thesis—final image of “stars that had learned to wait” is conceptual repricing. Subtext resides in mirror’s angle, boy’s shoulder slope, star spirals. Ambiguity is productive: reader must decide whether light equals salvation or mere delay. Emotional aftereffect lingers as afterimage on retina. No moralizing line distills the lesson; particulars carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of humble subversion emerges through recurring images of paused motion rather than thesis statements. Final “amplified quiet” reconfigures earlier teacup/compass/tree metaphors into a resonant societal stance. Complexity is honored—no moral is spoon-fed. Some symbolic items (two-north compass) appear only in passing, limiting thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: inherited grief vs. self-forged freedom, dramatized through the talisman’s release and whale’s embrace. Repricing occurs in the final line— “some locks only open when you set down the key”—a conceptual shift that revalues every prior scrimshaw touch. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers: is this transcendence or suicide? The emotional aftereffect is concrete: reader feels salt-cold and heartbeat in throat. Subtext in whale song as non-violent liberation invitation avoids allegory trap.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from concrete iterative pattern: every wooden replica memorializes outlawed grief while obeying the letter of joy law, reframing compliance as quiet sabotage. Subtext resides in silence—the drone hears voice frequency, not semantics—so the real rebellion is the unspoken grief inside the carved rose. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: blank face ≠ mandated joy, but a third state the regime cannot parse. No moralizing; the reweighting is felt, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—sacredness as invitation, not prohibition—emerges through recurring cloud-shadow imagery and the paraphrased prohibition. Final image of poet carrying “always meant to be crossed” reweights prior sacredness without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit; no late thesis states the lesson, allowing reader reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges without statement: imperfection as transferable gift. Subtext lives in the apprentice’s burned hands cradling fragile petals—beauty earned through bodily cost. The final image (glass shard + petal) offers conceptual repricing: flaw becomes part of the language itself. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about what songs the apprentice will now “play” with his new sight.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges inexorably from the paradox she engineers: authenticity is a retroactive human graft, not a site. The lens’s final golden pool reweights every prior “artificial” label without moralizing; the resonance is earned, but the absence of visible cost to Elara keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through craft metaphor: grief as jewelry, bloom as corrosion’s inversion. Subtext in origami coordinates—maps to one’s future self—avoids sermon, lets image do moral work. Final invitation reweights “betrayal of loss” into parallel persistence of love, a resonant non-literal answer. Only near-miss: Elara’s line “mourning never ends—but neither does love” flirts with thesis-statement, yet cadence carries it past sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from the tension between measurement and mystery—quantifying systems that defy quantification. The cards do not moralize; they simply map, letting the reader feel the hubris of digital abstraction. Subtext sits in silence: Maren’s refusal to absolve lets Soren’s confession vibrate unanswered. Final image of rain branching reprises the card pattern, reframing the crash as nature, not anomaly—earned resonance without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—nostalgia as living energy that must be freed—emerges through the dance’s progression rather than statement; the final image of the narrator becoming "forbidden knowledge" reweights prior scholarly greed without moralizing. Subtext of letting-go vs. hoarding is sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges obliquely: hope as mutable substrate that outlives embodiment. Subtext lives in gesture—Mira’s thumb on the stone, the swaying blossom-light—never in exposition. Final image reframes prior repetitions as sacramental labor rather than futility, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. One hair-slip: “metamorphose of tremendous significance” flirts with thesis-statement but is salvaged by its placement mid-paragraph, not as coda.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of “fragile convictions” emerges from the tail’s literal fragility and her rebuilt worldview, never stated. The image of the seam-scarred tail offers non-literal answer: belief can be mended but never unbroken. No final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance stays embodied. Ambiguity remains—hope and distrust coexist—earning complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of “miracles arriving only when we are ready” emerges through frost melting on the hourglass and the meteor streak—images, not exposition. Subtext lives in coffee rings as temporal grief-records and in scars reframed as love-marks. Final meteor hush reweights all prior cold/light imagery without moralizing. Achieves CR-level repricing of grief itself.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the specific metaphor of undelivered letters as architectural space—“thresholds the sisters had stood before and then walked away from.” Subtext is carried through mirrored renunciations: Clara renounces delivery, Mira renounces revelation. The final image answers the core question—unused love needs no audience—without moralizing. Recurring “hushed thunder” motif reweights from ominous to tender, achieving Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through pattern: stillness over force lets creativity return. Final image of aurora “breathing with her” reweights earlier grandmother quote without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will the release last?—inviting reflection. One soft echo of “remembered stardust” as thesis near end, but integrated into POV perception.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges obliquely: how to keep hope alive after finality—expressed through the paused clock and “cultivate sparks” reply, not authorial thesis. Subtext of commerce-in-extinction lands in the merchant’s burnt-paper eyes and grief-fractured smile. Final image reweights the glowing moss from pretty backdrop to living lullaby-mending, supplying conceptual repricing without moral statement. One near-prompt echo (“after the last forest burns”) is spoken diegetically, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of perceptual externalization emerges through iterative images rather than statement. Final doorway reweights prior gear and forest motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity—“probable miracles”—lingers as lived paradox, not abstraction. Could sharpen subtext in one beat showing what insight costs him bodily, but resonance is solidly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through recurrent images—leash, twilight, ticket punch—shifting from bond to earned passage without authorial thesis. Final image reweights “freedom can feel like drowning” from opening line, paying off the shoreline lullaby motif as she walks into dark. Subtext in guides’ silence and star stamp implies unknown fare ahead. Avoids overt “courage” moral; resonance lingers in shed skin and warm punch.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from bolt-to-snow music metaphor: silence as active collaborator in harm. Final image reweights “safety” from refuge to accessory without moralizing. Subtext of fraternal betrayal stays implicit, carried by the bolt’s weight—an object lesson in theme-through-particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of truth-as-erosion emerges through recurrent water/drift motifs and the ink that cannot be erased; no character spells it out. Final image of “graceful collapse” re-prices the premise: justice is geological, not heroic. Ambiguity is preserved—no sermon on legitimacy—yet the emotional aftereffect lingers. Subtext in marginalia-as-weapon is elegant and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through pattern—inheritance, stargazing, circle resonance—rather than dictation: meaning is forged by refusing to let ruins remain mere ruins. Final image of “thunderous serenity” reweights earlier quietude without moralizing. Ambiguity persists (will non-violent remembrance suffice?), honoring complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of intentional evolution emerges through seed, amber, and greenhouse imagery rather than thesis lines. “Implanted destiny” is literalized in the embryo but re-weighted as cultivar, not curse, by the closing warmth. Subtextual irony: keeping the gift hidden was itself a planted destiny, now uprooted. Final image—genetic promise pulsing in resin—answers the thematic question without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges via vegetal metaphors: resilience is not denial but managed vulnerability (greenhouse glass, cereus bloom). Subtext lives in gesture—she never smooths the photo, never names the explosion, letting silence speak. Final image refuses moral, offers instead a temporal economy: what withers can survive next season. Only minus: “optimism in realism” is half-named in final paragraph; earlier embodiment was stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—perception as multitudes versus singular truth—emerges through tarot imagery and painterly failure rather than declaration. Subtext operates in the silent shift from “fracturing” to “redesign,” a conceptual repricing enacted, not stated. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: the once-broken box now “complete” yet holding unstable multiplicity. No moralizing, and ambiguity lingers (she can paint again, but what will the portraits now look like?), fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges inexplicitly: consciousness as erosion—time, identity, and matter dissolve under patient observation. Recurrent “ink that remembers” reweights from curiosity to existential substrate without thematic statement. Final image of drone filming empty space offers Conceptual Repricing: knowledge outlives the knower. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the contrast between sheathing blades and sheathing memory in canvas; no explicit thesis is stated. The roses’ bloom reframes peace as active cultivation rather than absence of fire, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—thumb over canvas fibers, pruning cuts—rather than exposition. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer: continuity is the quiet engraving that outlasts towers.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges as the cost of listening beyond hearing—silence reclaimed as craft. No explicit thesis; final image of fishing for “echoes only he could hear” reweights prior silver-fishing life without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is he blessed or exiled? Complexity embraced; no tidy binary. Subtext carried in gesture (loose grip, bare feet) and synesthetic color-weight transfers.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—inheritance versus agency—emerges from the successive editorial sins and Eleanor’s forensic self-interrogation, never stated overtly. Subtext in the telescope pointing “at nothing in particular” whispers generational avoidance. Final image of the city as “unfinished story” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity remains: she may still fail, but the thematic question is authentically repriced by her choice to author the next draft.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from the inverse of the premise: translation is not retrieval but confrontation with one’s own circuitry of blame. The amber’s re-weighting—from relic to firmware key—carries conceptual cost: knowledge obliges action inside the loop. Final image avoids moral statement; resonance lingers in constellations yet un-inked.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: impermanence as creative permission rather than loss. Subtext resides in tactile silence—chalk dust settling, tile humming—never sermonized. Final image of pocketed warm tile reweights earlier “comfortable wound” without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: she may still fail tomorrow, keeping complexity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges as memory-as-survival: the dead persist only when their names are re-forged into living armor. Subtext lives in gesture—her soot trace on glaze, his silent nod—never in thesis statements. Final image of ember-warmth without burning reweights “mercy” from sentiment to metallurgy, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is she now emptied or completed? The story lets both readings coexist.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: despair not as end but as doorway. Motif—fractured timelines—reweights at closure: failures are exposed as branching encores. No moralizing; final image is silent dawn-light. Subtext in gesture: coin hand-off is wordless covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly: consensual attunement versus forced transparency. The ending’s “willowglass hope” image reweights earlier fractal light without moralizing. No thematic echo violations; subtext operates through bodily markers and refracted light. Ambiguity is purposeful—connection remains fragile—but the insight feels earned from the specific geode trial rather than imposed thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges quietly: continuity between human and non-human memory, with the fossil as hinge. No moral is stated; the algae’s brightening answers the thematic question with image rather than assertion. Complexity lingers—no settlement violence appears—so resonance is oblique but earned.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Wisdom through humble fragments emerges organically; no character lectures us. The canyon echo’s whisper re-prices the entire archive, letting theme resonate without moralizing. Final image—“unfinished stories into her careful hands”—crystallizes the stance: knowledge stays open, relational, tiny. The lack of counter-theme (does any wisdom deserve forgetting?) keeps it just shy of 9+ complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of resurrected courage emerges from concrete pattern: hidden codes → open risk → offered trust, never abstract assertion. Final mist-brightening image reweights “silver hush” from menace to fragile renewal. No moralizing. Subtext in silent pillbox transfer carries conspiracy weight without expositional speech.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of continuity-through-carving emerges implicitly via the needle, gutters, and river; no moral is stated. Final image reweights the grandmother’s request as ongoing practice rather than destination. Ambiguity is fruitful—promise as palimpsest—but the repetition of “distill complexity” edges toward echo, not fresh resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of patient, root-level renewal emerges through rose history and oar cadence rather than thesis statement. Subtext resides in the girl’s silent acceptance of the gauge and the moonlit soil pressing back against their fingers. Final image reframes loss as latent growth without moralizing. Only minor slack: “instill hope into darkest places” edges toward prompt-echo, but is immediately grounded by the planting action.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of anonymous connection emerges from the nest’s architecture and her letter-spiral without explicit statement. The thrush’s unknowing craftsmanship mirrors her own, reweighting anonymity as communal gift. Final image reframes prior secrecy as shared cradle. No moralizing; resonance stays implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of listening-as-resistance emerges through action, not sermon. Subtext: communities carry natural frictions; malignant harmony can weaponize them.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of rebellion against oblivion emerges through spatial warping and the continuing organ hymn rather than exposition. Final re-perception of tunnels reframes the earlier “terrible pull” into voluntary custodianship, reweighting silence vs. story without moralizing. Image of compass-warmth and lone organ crystallizes the argument organically.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—art as vicarious mourning—emerges through accreted images of erosion, fog, and negative-space portraiture without explicit thesis. Ribbon reprise and quarry silence create conceptual repricing: absence becomes portrait. Final line “paint the truth that remained” resonates without moralizing. Minor abstraction in “architecture of emotion” phrase scarcely dims impact.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of erased female science emerges organically from plot particulars rather than assertion; copper nail and coded stanzas reweight from family curio to systemic indictment. Final image of Maren rising with “the map she had been searching for” offers resonant non-literal answer—she steps into the role of cartographer of truth. Avoids sermonising, lets irony (disaster validates the exile) do the moral work.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of “pixelated amnesty” emerges entirely through image rather than thesis: the flake’s shattered projection literalizes forgiveness via fragments. Earlier bridge songs re-weight from melancholy interludes to rehearsal for this very moment of broken-return. No moral is stated; the final rear-view shimmer answers the question of whether testimony can resurrect the vanished. Subtext resides in the silence she will now inhabit between notes.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges without thesis statement: mobility vs. erasure, legacy vs. liquidity. “Territories were stories people told themselves” is voiced by character, not author, and is tested by the final refusal. Subtext in Elena’s brittle laugh and the dusk light carries nostalgia’s cost. Final image—abandoned train “still marking its territory in the gathering dark”—reweights earlier metaphor, resisting tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge as communal covenant rather than private triumph. Subtext resides in the daylily’s wilt and the star’s pulse—both ephemeral recordings—mirroring human transmission. No moralizing; final paragraph trusts image. The insight feels earned because it’s scaffolded by fifteen years of dream logs and spectra, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the ice-to-soil arc: failure as fertile ground, mirrors that hide falls. No explicit moralizing; the final image of the pale shoot reweights “warlike serenity” into growth that feeds on death. Subtext in the seed’s origin (harvested from a corpse) quietly complicates redemption. Slight risk of thematic echo in “what mirrors don’t show” line, but it is earned by prior pool-gazing.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of inheritance-as-transformation emerges through spiral/topiary recurrence; the image reframes rooted captivity into deliberate intergenerational link without overt statement—final image quietly re-prices prior myths as living obligation rather than nostalgic lore.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of “honored absence” emerges from concrete vegetal imagery rather than thesis statement; the closing line that holes are “inlayed, not patched” re-configures prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity survives: reader cannot decide if the bargain ennobles or diminishes her—exactly the complexity sought.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges: sound never dies, it only migrates—shown through amplifier, grille cloth, quarry echo. No moralizing; the final image of “new places to echo” reweights earlier silence without stating a thesis. Particulars (Reno blow-out, 2 AM crash) keep universality anchored. Ambiguity remains: possible renewal or deeper wound.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from script evolution—pictograph → sound → pure transition—mirroring her ambition’s abstraction. Subtext in “seed opens with a sigh” implies knowledge itself exhales when grasped. Final image of sky brightening without sunrise non-literally answers the central question: meaning arrives not by sun but by internal shift, reweighting earlier tablet fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: identity as migrating current, preservation through acceptance of contradiction. The final image of “tomorrow waiting its turn” offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the earlier refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from image pattern—walls / shells / light—rather than assertion. Final image of “first crack” offers non-literal answer to thematic question without moral tag.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from the recurring flood/river metaphor without explicit thesis. The graffiti slogans act as found wisdom, letting the reader complete the equation: mental floods are natural, non-moral events.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: language too potent to speak demands temporal sacrifice. The unsaid accumulates as physical weight against her palm on the door, reconfiguring meaning. Final image of the flower made of pure language offers non-literal resonance—no moral, only charged ambiguity. No thematic echo clichés intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: beauty as mercy against annihilation; the final glint inside the emerald re-prices her lifelong labor without moralizing; the silence around the act invites counter-readings—soul larceny or grace—creating meaningful ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through iterated vertical motion: ascent as inquiry, descent as enactment. The rebirth motif is not declared; it is lived via the garden’s re-flowering after betrayal and the caretaker’s own re-beginning each dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: the ethics of engineered doubt and the toll on the engineer. Subtext lives in gesture—pointing at chimes, scattering seeds—avoiding explicit thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges implicitly from the pedagogy of withheld revelation; no character moralizes. The cinnamon memory and future-vision reweight “vanishing” as recursive return, not escape.

Final image avoids sermon; the stone arcs back into the water, re-pricing the premise with quiet inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of stillness-as-navigation emerges through iterated imagery rather than thesis statement. Final sentence reweights “movement of spirit” as sufficient voyage, supplying quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from pattern: vows survive as kept existence, not riddles solved. Luminous vows reframed from quest to gift avoids moralizing; resonance carried by image, not assertion. Amber ribbons answer the father’s impossible promise without thesis statement. Final meteor hush invites reflection on patience as perceptual key.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)

Subtext whispers in the grandmother’s absence and the universe’s literal retreat. Final image of “ambered light” reweights earlier mentions of honeyed gold, achieving resonance. Could ascend higher if thematic risk felt sharper, if the cosmos’ contraction bore moral or social price on-page.

    Theme emerges implicitly: mapping terror is a survivor’s art, love is the ink. The atlas page shifts from souvenir to instrument without thematic announcement.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—collective memory versus engineered forgetting—emerges through image pattern (photographs, labels, bottles) rather than exposition. Subtext lives in gesture: leaving photos as "breadcrumbs" silently argues that archives can outlast concrete dams. Final image of the sapphire "small blue heart" reweights the premise: remembrance is fragile yet buoyant. No moralizing statement mars the close.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—alchemy as conversation, not conquest—emerges via starling choreography and grandmother echo, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext resides in the crystal’s shift from inert research trophy to living bridge, a resonant reconfiguration. Final image reweights prior material without sermon. Occasional thematic echo (“true alchemy lived in the liminal space”) is soft; still, particulars carry the idea.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges as the moral geometry of distal responsibility: to bear knowledge you cannot act upon is still a form of love. Subtext lives in the radio’s quiet hum and the uncelebrated release of the buckle—no speech, no cheer, only the enduring stance. The final “soundless echo” reweights the opening trust without moralizing, achieving resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)

Ambiguity lingers—will the crack widen or seal—inviting reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: innovation as cultivation of unknowable bloom-time, resisted against instant-profit monoculture. Subtext sits in seed silence, moonlit water, “storm-born silence”—no overt thesis statements. Final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Conceptual Repricing lands—time itself becomes the uncommodifiable cost—inviting reflection beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically: sound as tender erosion of unspeakable loss. The half-sung lullaby refrains without moralizing, and the final off-key echo carries quiet conceptual cost—the healer must keep returning forever. Still, theme never deepens past its initial equation; no counter-reading or moral complication accrues.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges implicitly: guardianship is not hoarding but learning to “make friends with uncertainty.” Pendant reprises burned-library past; final image of turning a page elsewhere reweights loss into transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Creative destruction emerges through specific event: the bishop’s crozier—symbol of spiritual guidance—must be re-broken to birth unnamed fire, reweighting sacrifice as liberation. Subtext operates in silence: no prayer is spoken, only the crack of silver. Final image of emptied hands offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. “Frozen bloom” motif recurs only twice, each time charged by action, avoiding tokenism.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: the price of engineering wonder is the erasure of one’s own factual past. Subtext lives in mirror-images that lie before she does, and in thread that pulls ghost memories to the surface. No meta-commentary, no closing moral. Final image re-weights the premise without exposition, but the thematic aftertaste is slightly cerebral rather than gut-punch, capping it just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of navigation-as-connection: chain links, star threads, folded light—all suggest the cosmos itself is a navigable sea.

No explicit moral is stated; the reader is left with the charged poise of ancient stars waiting beneath dark water, inviting reflection on human scale and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely: grief’s true need is not explanation but accompaniment. Subtext lives in the hearing-aid’s impossible persistence and the final line about “threads that simply need following.” No moral is stated; the reweighting is imagistic. A hair of sentiment lingers in “some heroes never intended to be heroic,” slightly diluting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of submerged memory and human connectedness emerges from copper threads carrying every lost whisper; no manifesto statements. Final image of ocean-as-library reconfigures earlier “rusted monument to forgotten ambitions” into living archive. Ambiguity remains: is the fusion transcendence or annihilation?

Gold flecks as visible proxy for the invisible is a particular that carries thematic heft, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the collision of bureaucratic erasure and human remorse; no character verbalizes it. The heartbeat-to-silence arc reweights “presence” without moralizing, and the midnight solace tone lets apology and survival coexist in uneasy poise.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges implicitly: language death as transmutation into bodily sensation; no moralizing, only the final helix of birds and refracted light reweighting prior motifs; ambiguity lingers—is preservation or surrender the true translation—yielding concrete emotional aftereffect without tidy thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges as the refusal to domesticate wonder: academia’s mockery is answered by becoming the very joke it laughed at. The cosmic-punchline metaphor reweights earlier ridicule without moralizing. Subtext sits in the static itself—knowledge that can only be heard when one surrenders control. The arrowhead’s return in the final breath crystallizes the reconfiguration, though a touch less abstract phrasing would sharpen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from the husk-to-song axis: transformation demands leaving the intact but empty shell behind. No character moralizes; the orchard answers with bent stone heads and brighter fruit, reweighting beauty’s cost without pronouncement.

Final image reframes earlier “tarnished wonder” as renewable but perilous, achieving Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)

Subtext operates in code phrase “the storm is coming” and the bottle’s thunder that reweights loss for Vera. Final image of Marcus walking toward the fence answers the thematic question—promises heal only when someone crosses the line—without moralizing. Complexity maintained: state is neither redeemed nor demonized, merely bypassed.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of repair-through-silence emerges through image chain: frozen smiles → broken halo → song → future carousel. No moralizing statements; meaning stays implicit. Final image reweights earlier “frozen” motif toward motion, achieving resonant reconfiguration. Could climb higher if silence-as-possibility had been contested rather than peacefully accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—memory survives in physical touch, not digits—emerges through material verbs (clutched, woven, pressed) and the final glowing fold, never sermonized. Subtext flickers in the woman’s silence and Miriam’s preference for night: both avoid daylight’s data glare. Ambiguity is preserved; the library may gift or confiscate. Avoided thematic echo; no character recites the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges as the paradox of preservation: to still a dream is to end its motion, to archive longing is to inhabit it. The watercolor palette literalizes this tension—color that drinks light—and the final hanging photograph offers a wordless conceptual repricing: Mira now works beneath her own captured incompleteness. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the quiet click of sunrise on glass.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: the danger of locking away wonder is embodied first by the philosopher, finally by the locksmith’s release. The clay sentence reweights all prior material without moralizing; ambiguity remains—was the journey necessary?—inviting reflection.

The final image of an empty swing waiting for passengers reweights earlier exile as potential return, achieving conceptual repricing without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges lyrically: caretaking as continuity between vanishing marvels and possible futures. Subtext whispers in gestures—shears gleaming “from somewhere else,” seed warm like a heartbeat—rather than exposition. The ending image of “budding hope” avoids moralizing, yet the absence of a competing value (sacrifice, doubt) leaves the concept pristine rather than complex, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—liberation through dismantling, masks and nets as false faces—emerges entirely through action and image; no statement of thesis. Final reflection re-prices Mira’s vocation without moralizing. Particulars (prisms, salt-stiff rope) carry universal weight; ambiguity lingers about fishermen’s guilt, inviting re-reads. The resonance feels earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—“preservation as transformation, not copy”—emerges through coin → ceiling transmutation, never stated. Final image reweights the premise: sky-mirrors inside doomed walls make conceptual cost undeniable. Subtext in silent handling of coin and absent crowd keeps focus on perception vs. recognition. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the phrase “limits did not exist.”

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: collectivity as irrigation—people, like butterflies, need scheduled tenderness. Subtext lives in silent chalk, green patina, and the unspoken fear that the sky might ignore them. Final image of rain on new wings offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids tidy thesis yet flirts with thematic echo when “brambled hope” is named; slight ding.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges as the equivalence of ending and lullaby: silence is not absence but the space after the song. The cracked puppet reprises as living metaphor—flaw as truth—without overt statement. The final chime answers the opening lullaby, reweighting all prior gears as notes already sung. No sermonizing; the moral remains in the image, not the margin.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of reluctant stewardship emerges through the orchard that “does not care,” the nut-key that demands sacrifice, and the final image of an open path Mira herself will never take. No moral is stated; resonance arises from the weight-transfer inheritance reconfigured into active gift. Ambiguity lingers: she remains exiled, now knowingly.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from the chrysalis-to-foam axis: completion looks like emptiness from the outside. Subtext operates in the silence of the missing butterfly—absence as presence. Final image of braided streams running separately yet held in one body offers non-literal answer without moralizing. One hairline slip: “symphonic in its chaos” flirts with abstraction, but the foam physics re-anchors immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of silences as generative emerges through glass, bottles, and refracted light, never slogan. Final image of “mindful scattering of silences” reweights her earlier sales pitch without moralizing. Subtext is embedded in sensory pattern rather than asserted. Complexity is present but constrained by the piece’s observational stance.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars—weight, handkerchief, choral directory—never sermonizing. Final image of cuckoo predicting weather in synchrony with communal song reweights “silos into gathering places” without stating a moral. Ambiguity remains: grievances are “loosened,” not erased, honoring complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of reclaimed aspiration emerges through mirror lattice rather than assertion; final image of ghost-dreams rising reconfigures meaning without moral. Subtext resides in glass depth and synaptic plasticity—knowledge that archive comes at neural price. Complexity lingers: she gains vocation yet carries others’ failures in her head. No tidy thesis spoil.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge demands perpetual vigilance, not static storage. The doodle seeds, once seen, germinate into a prism-mind that forever splits memory—an earned, non-moralizing insight. Subtext operates in the upward fall itself: forgetting is gravity’s normal pull; remembering requires inversion. Final image reweights the Acrid Codex from forbidden relic to living syllabus, resonance achieved without stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—reconciliation of industrial scars with living sound—emerges through the repurposed insulator, never named aloud. The hairline cracks that once carried human speech now carry forest music: a conceptual repricing scored without exposition. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: communication is possible, but only if one listens to wounded things.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges—beauty discovered in difficulty—via concrete motifs: stone worn smooth, eclipse revealing edges. No moral stated; final line offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtextual irony: his precision exiles him, yet precision lets him endure. Ambiguity is purposeful; counter-readings (complicity, futility) remain open.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: the varieties of silence are not data but lived relationships; the climax re-prices them as joy-tinged rather than loss-tinged. Subtext operates in the moth clasp—an image of fragility and transformation—whose release is legible as permission to keep listening after almost failing. The final line’s “spent thoughts returning home” offers a resonant, non-literal answer: silence is not hoarded but released. No tidy moral is asserted; the insight is earned through the specific acoustics of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the accretion of doodled spirals→wildflower: transformation through patient endurance of what first repels. Subtext in the wrapping-paper interior drawings embeds memory into mundane material without exposition. Final CR reweights patience from adage to lived necessity. No moralizing; resonance is wholly imagistic.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—resilience as shared guardianship—emerges through echo chorus, never declared. Broken weapon re-seeded as life-key reframes violence into caretaking; her refusal to extract it literalizes the theme. Final smile at “ordinary miracle” reweights earlier wonder/hunger dichotomy without moralizing. Subtext of collective stewardship vs. solo profit lingers in the hush after bells fade.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—catastrophe as readable, possibly authored, convergence—emerges through wind-sorted debris, not lecture. Final image of “hidden mathematics demanding payment” reweights prior cargo-shift data into moral ledger. Ambiguity lingers: is she witness or abettor? No moral spoon-feeding. Patch motif underused; slight deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through the equation of wonder with atmospheric warmth, made concrete via auroral light and bell-spectrum; no character moralizes the thesis. The amber sheet’s ancient tree-blood quietly reframes music as fossilized life, so the final ringing becomes ecological transfusion. The sculptor’s pause supplies Dramatic Irony—readers see wonder flow into him while Yara remains unaware—creating subtextual loop. Final image refrains from tidy moral; instead it re-prices the premise: wonder is heartbeat, not luxury, leaving plausible counter-readings open.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges obliquely: relics choose keepers, not vice versa; stewardship may mean attentive surrender. Subtext lives in the unplayed flute and the unheard songs—silence speaks louder than alarm. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: witness over intervention. The driftwood-as-constellation quietly answers the opening collapse with a new, humbler cartography.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges without statement: empathy as consumptive physics—every understood emotion costs literal mass. The final image reprises “amber” and “light” but now as self-loss, reweighting prior motifs. No moralizing; the silence after last star is the non-literal answer. Subtext in gesture: spectacles adjusted mid-proof suggest ongoing calibration of sight that ends in her own invisibility.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from image chain: courier weight → pendant vibration → aurora echo → seeding wonder. No explicit thesis; final “germinate something” is invitation, not moral. Subtext in Mira’s fade: absence as catalyst, not wound. Ambiguity lingers—what “wonder” looks like remains unspoken, forcing reader germination.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the iterative archive: grief is not erased but diffused into place, and the living become future artifacts. Subtext lives in gesture—pressing the prism against glass refracts both light and denial. The final smile offers a non-literal answer: witness is participation, and absorption is the price of proof. No moralizing sentence distills this; the frost image does the reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: memory is not archived but corporeal—transmission demands flesh. The amber bead’s journey from gift to grave reweights earlier estate-sale edges into a genealogy of sacrifice. Final image reconfigures meaning: remembrance requires self-erasure. No moralizing; the silence after her vanishing is the non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of beauty: silk meant for spectacle is re-valued as hidden infrastructure, quietly asserting that resilience is built, not granted. The final image of indifferent arches over new green offers a non-literal answer—continuation itself is a form of defiance—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the orchards may yet fail, but the cost of refusal to try is now visible.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges: knowledge pursued as external rescue collapses into internal reckoning. Subtext operates through spatial metaphors (ascending catwalk, thinning membrane) that mirror epistemic breach. Final image—“particular weight of a truth finally set down”—reverberates without moralizing. No motif checklist; green glass recurs because it actively thins reality, not as token symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: remembering the lost is the price of guiding the next. Subtext lives in gesture—stacking stones instead of speaking, offering sea glass instead of sermons. The final image reframes earlier motifs without moralizing. Complexity is honored: the sea still takes, the light still warns, but the ritual of witness now carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of accidental creation emerges through recurrent refraction motif: yesterday’s shadows become tomorrow’s dawn. No explicit moral; resonance carried by final image of sky smiling back. Ambiguity lingers—laughter as benediction or curse—anchored in specific glass-light ritual. Could climb higher if cost were sharpened on page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: absorption/transformation metaphorized through dye and iridescence. No overt thesis—final lift of wing re-prices premise without moralizing. Subtext in “quiet explosiveness” links butterfly scale to human narrative scale. Resists tidy moral; complexity (inheritance, transplant, pedagogy) lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: broken instruments made whole, paths made transparent, sorrow made countable. The final image—labyrinth laid flat like fabric—reweights the opening metaphor of “half-remembered prayer” into a secular act of measured grief. No moral is stated; the reader is left to weigh the cost of clarity over mystery. The concept of quantified sorrow remains intellectually provocative rather than viscerally tested, keeping the score just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as communal ligament versus individual identity. The refracted dawn reweights the earlier “woven dawns” motif without moralizing. Subtext resides in the silenced songs and the cracked mirrors—communal fracture literalized—yet the final image keeps meaningful ambiguity about whether a realm that needs such sacrifice deserves sunrise. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges quietly: empathy as both wound and compass; hiding as a form of holding. Paradox of presence/absence is seeded in bell-not-rung and re-echoed in “stay while leaving,” letting subtext mature without sermon. Final image of tomorrow’s reply offers non-literal answer—an act still unperformed—creating a Charged Poise resonance. No overt thesis statements, though the phrase “enlarged tranquility” flirts with thematic label in last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of “tenuous absolution through ordinary persistence” emerges organically from recurring maintenance images; no explanatory sermon. Final butterfly flight reconfigures the bread’s meaning without moralizing, producing quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges obliquely: magic decays into memory, then into meaning—no character moralizes. The final gift (“in the act of seeking itself”) lands as earned paradox because the preceding cataloguing beats have shown the accrual of attention. Subtext in the hush—she fears noise/life—adds irony once she embraces story’s messy afterlife. No tidy thesis; resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of inherited trust and its audible fracture emerges through the fob’s frozen hands and the market’s enforced silence. No explicit thesis; final image reweights “curiously steadfast” into a curse Mara may now own. Subtext in the woman’s smile and the warming metal invites multiple readings—inheritance as burden or empowerment. Ambiguity is purposeful, not evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—wonder emergent from measured doubt—arises through the compass/taste motif rather than assertion. Subtext lives in weather-as-metaphor for interior climate; Seren’s line “weather just recognizes its own” carries implication, not thesis. Final image avoids moralizing, offering charged poise. No motif is checklist; aurora, compass, and taste each reprice meaning at the end. Complexity acknowledged: skepticism not annihilated but reconfigured, maintaining ambiguity.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Mira’s perception; no head-hop. Diction—“electric ribbons,” “thunderous silences”—is sensory, not exposition. Syntax modulates: longer cadence for contemplation, clipped phrases under aurora surge. Seren’s speech carries atmospheric idiom distinct from Mira’s internal register. Filter verbs minimal; perception is embodied. Voice feels singular, though occasional elevated phrasing (“terrestrially cosmic hue”) nudges toward authorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges as revelation vs. suppression: art exposes what love rendered unsayable. Subtext lives in gestures—fingernail charcoal as stigmata of critic-turned-accomplice. No moralizing line; instead, final image of hand poised over void re-weights earlier disapproval into ethical remainder. Emotional after-effect is contrition made tactile, avoiding sentimentality through mineral chill and prismatic decay.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges from material memory: metals and ice remembering time compresses truth into convergence. The final image reprises the bluff’s “endless conversation,” offering a non-literal answer—truth is not spoken but vibrated. No moral is stated; resonance is carried by the blue shard’s survival. Slight abstraction keeps it shy of 8.5, but complexity is honored.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges wordless: containment as tenderness—fears kept not deleted but folded small enough to carry. Motif of “north” migrates from compass to ribcage, reweighted when she becomes the new true north. No moral spoken; instead, final image of empty box = zeroed fear yet perpetual scar. Subtext whispers that caregiving always demands metabolizing others’ chaos into one’s own biology—an ethic neither saintly nor suicidal, merely necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—story as salvage—emerges cleanly from the iterated images of unspent letters, tucked photographs, and second-hand goods. Subtext operates in the silences of uncollected mail rather than exposition. The final reconfiguration ("thrift store as memory curation") is understated, avoiding moralizing. Some abstraction ("proof that someone had lived, hoped, failed") drifts toward pseudo-profundity, keeping it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: encryption as survival, silence as generative, body as text. The spider web’s return in the final sentence re-weights the early cell image into quiet triumph—she too has spun escape out of secret silk. No moral is declared; the resonance lies in the unsaid equivalence between code and choreography. Complexity holds: her victory is real yet partial—she leaves mutilated but linguistically re-armed.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges obliquely: deleted memories don’t vanish—they accrete into communal geology, waiting for a custodian willing to bear their weight. The whale’s death as involuntary confessional server is a fresh, non-allegorical image that re-prices the concept of forgetting. No character moralizes; the final “let the light in” is metaphorical action, not thesis statement. Resonance lingers in the sense that every seaside town secretly mines its own submerged archive of shame.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without thesis statement: prophecy as noise, silence as agency, paper as both message and vehicle. The crane wing’s reprise downstream reweights “folded possibility” into “unfolded future,” a conceptual repricing achieved by image, not assertion. Subtext resides in gesture—quieting frogs equals silencing court intrigue at a distance. Final image offers non-literal answer: an unwritten future is not emptiness but spaciousness, a resonance earned by particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges: knowledge can be housed in silence; some truths survive only in the negative space of lies. Subtext carried by seal’s buried history and the unasked questions. Final image of stars “corrections in margins” reweights prior lessons—universe itself edits, accepts deletions. Avoids explicit moral; resonance lingers in Elena’s paid forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of transforming isolation into continuity emerges through the shell’s acoustic archive rather than authorial statement. The jasmine-to-dawn color progression quietly echoes the shift from solitary dusk to shared legacy, giving the reader an imaginal answer instead of a moral. No final-paragraph thesis is declared; resonance is left charged but not tidily resolved. A hairline slip toward abstraction in “translate isolation into independence” slightly dilutes specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of “calibrated treason” emerges through object and action rather than sermon: hiding truth looks like betrayal until history’s ledger is reopened. The rose thorn’s return beside blank paper reweights complicity into guardianship without declarative statement. Final image refrains from moralizing; instead, the unblooming thorn promises future testimony under frost. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide if Yuki’s empty-handed exit is victory or exile—achieving resonant complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges obliquely: the cost of hyper-perception, the ethics of stolen voice. Subtext sits in the shell’s whispered dust and the trapped frequency of echo-people, never sermonized. Final image reweights the premise—she enters the song, surrendering solitude to possible fusion—without moral dictation. Ambiguity is productive, but the lack of embodied cost keeps it shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: mending as reverence, patterns as living grammar. Whistle reprise converts childhood memory into adult ethical stance without declarative moral. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer—“pattern complete itself around her”—that reweights prior nets, moon paths, and hidden labor. No thematic echo or final-paragraph moralizing; ambiguity about whether father ever learns sustains complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges inductively: truth as an unmythologized stillpoint. Subtext in the keeper’s dialogue (“the thing everyone agreed to forget”) lands cleanly. Final paragraph’s assertion that “truth is never a destination” nudges toward Echo but stays anchored in Mira’s earned fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of “old ways/new ways” fracture, crystallized when ancient glass births the future prophet. No moralizing; final image reweights prior solitude as necessary compost for new light. Subtext of betrayal by both science and mystic circles lingers without exposition. Resonance is conceptual yet felt—variant allegiance vindicated.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of translation-as-redemption emerges organically from jar-contents → inherited silences; final image of “sweetening silence” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext is strongest in the reluctant hand-off, but epiphanies lean toward abstract (“he understood what he had been gathering”) rather than embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of harmonic balance versus chaos emerges from the physics of resonance rather than lecture. Final “eternal song” image quietly reframes earlier “sacred artifact” as living covenant, not relic, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing, tidy binaries, or echo-statement. Could deepen further if emotional cost carried thematic after-shock beyond fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of patient revolution emerges through accreted images rather than statement; the final image reweights the premise that landscapes yield only to those who surrender lifetime urgency. Ambiguity remains—will the change liberate or erase her?—creating lingering resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of institutional erasure versus individual illumination emerges through lantern lineage and buried archivist, never sermonized. Final image of “uncertain but honest light” reweights lantern from heritage talisman to ethical instrument. Subtext in skeleton’s reaching pose resonates without exposition. No platitudes intrude; meaning stays anchored to concrete objects.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges obliquely: grace as unearned, non-score-keeping restoration. Hidden inscription sublimates apology into action without preachiness. Final melody answers the Marcus beat in wordless tonality—an earned non-literal answer. Only debit: “grace isn’t about deserving” line flirts with thesis-statement; rescued by placement mid-story and immediate dust-mote image that re-embodies it.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme: curiosity as devotional practice that re-writes existence. Emerges via iterated image of light broken into “unexpected geometries” and final bell resonance; no explicit thesis stated. Subtextual tension between irreverence (“giggling at the magnificence”) and reverent ritual charges the closure. Complexity maintained—no moral spoon-feeding—yet resonance leans conceptual rather than emotionally bruising, holding just outside 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of digital afterlife vs corporate erasure emerges through song-echoes and 47-pattern without moralizing. Final image of “door left open” reweights prior silence into ethical stance. Subtext in patch constellation and song loops is coherent. Avoids explicit thesis, but resonance is more cerebral than emotional, capping at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges obliquely: peace as prismatic understanding rather than absence of conflict. Mirrors, crystal shards, and layered selves form a returning motif that reconfigures meaning in the final beat without moralizing. Subtext is carried in silence—the shopkeeper’s unexplained gift, the unlisted names of the lost. Complexity is honored; no tidy thesis closes the circuit. Resonance lingers in the image of fragmented light guiding real hulls.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of endings-as-process emerges through ice imagery and trawling labor; no explicit thesis states it. Grandmother’s endurance vs. her release creates nuanced counter-reading. Final breath image reweights earlier “fold in patience” without moralizing. Subtext in volunteer silence and ice groans invites reflection beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the reframed burn-marked relic: love as a graft that fails yet nourishes later growth. No explicit thesis is stated; the vineyard’s dormant cycle is the silent argument. The final smile re-prices the premise—acceptance is not defeat but ripening—delivered through image, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of memory-as-boundary-tending emerges through sand, echo, and repetition rather than thesis. The final image of a future child hearing the echo offers resonant continuity without moralizing. Yet the piece circles the same insight three times, thinning subtext. Ambiguity is present but not charged, because no alternative stance to Mira’s is staged.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through the repeated soft梯形 light traces and the act of archival tape binding: collective memory as shared art. Subtext lives in the torn-away faces—absence made visible by Maren’s refusal to invent features. The ending’s golden bars across lavender reconfigure forgetting into communal witness without moralizing. Complexity is honored; no tidy maxim is imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from particularities: a single stolen crystal reframes entropy as fullness. Silence re-weighted from absence to honesty supplies the resonant reconfiguration. No moralizing—final image of nameless colours lets the reader feel the conceptual cost. Subtext in the building’s “nocturnal sighs” mirrors Elias’s own lung-like expansion and retraction of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of memory-as-echo emerges organically from videotape static and bodily growth; no explicit thesis states it. Final image of “tidal longing” settling into quiet reprises the oceanic motif without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: peace may be another forgetting. Could edge higher if a concrete object (chalk?) had been sacrificed to embody the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: letting go is not surrender but learning to orbit the ungraspable. Recurring images (spinning, falling leaf, lunar indifference) reweight at closure without moralizing. No thesis statements; resonance is imagistic. Complexity acknowledged—grief is neither vanquished nor romanticized.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: broken things still sing. No character preaches it; the vinyl’s return in the last line reweights every prior image without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence: the unvisited daughter’s absence is felt only through Margery’s tea-colored eyes. The ending offers resonant ambiguity—readers must decide whether the broken song is enough.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges non-didactically: knowledge is not observed but enacted—sealed awakenings open only when the scholar risks bodily engagement (loops, heat). Final image reweights “shadow” from absence to folded light, avoiding moral summary. One near-prompt echo (“she realized with sudden clarity”) is softened by immediate physical corollary.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through pattern, not statement: bones set poorly remember injury—constellations remap fracture into navigation. The ending refuses moral binaries, offering charged poise instead of lesson. Subtext in “unwanted returned letter” body quietly reweights bureaucratic indifference. One abstract noun cluster (“conceptual repricing”) is avoided on-page, preserving resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: exile can be repurposed into a different radiance. No moralizing; the final image of “quiet communion” between pearl and distant stars reweights the premise without abstraction. Subtext lingers in the question of whether shared light compensates for lost flight—ambiguity is charged, not tidied. The sea-glass motif subtly shifts from souvenir to lens, reinforcing theme through action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from recurrence of reclamation imagery—moss over metal, pendant passed down, confession surfacing—rather than any thesis line. The final CR reweights “quietly proactive” to mean presence itself, offering resonant ambiguity. No moralising, no tidy forgiveness; complexity sustained. Just short of 9.0 because the middle third leans on repeated abstract nouns (“grief,” “shame”) rather than new concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—abandoned creative hopes as offerings, not failures—emerges through accreted images rather than statement. The shell-spiral reweights nicely at the end, giving non-literal resonance. A hint of thematic echo (“she understood why she had come”) is contained to one clause, not final moralizing, so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges as reciprocity: stories humans forgot but plants remember, retrievable only through reciprocal gift of voice and time. No character verbalises this; meaning accrues via golden threads and generational satchel. Final image answers the implicit question—can techno-rational tinkering alone heal ecological rupture?—with a hushed No: only surrendered song revives. Subtext avoids moral statement, earns its quiet reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: mortality made navigable through artifact and light. No explicit thesis; final image of spiral glowing beneath dead branches offers non-literal answer to “how to end gracefully.” Subtext resides in silence—world holding breath equals collective unconscious waiting for pattern. Ambiguity lingers: does the map guide the dying or the living?—without moral tag.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges obliquely: knowledge vs. wonder, containment vs. resonance. No explicit thesis; final image of “store wonder in the cellar of reason” reweights prior material without moralizing. Particulars (mirror angles, cracked crystal, echo layers) carry thematic weight, not symbols bolted on. Ambiguity lingers—will the cellar hold?—inviting reflection beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: sorrow distributed into pattern is still sorrow, and transmutation into stone is not escape but diffusion. The whalebone reverie reprise reweights earlier silence from comfort to engulfing inevitability. No moral is declared; resonance lingers in the image of infinite scaled grief.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from tactile paradox: embrace ≈ cage, gone ≈ here. Subtext hides in silence—no dialogue, only whistle and chisel—forcing reader to feel the unsaid. Final image reweights “here and gone” without moralizing; the lion’s gaze is presence carved from absence. Ambiguity is purposeful: widow has not “moved on” but has redefined what moving means.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the inverse cartography of scavenging abandoned dreams; no explicit thesis, only image-argument. Final reconfiguration—exhaustion as peace—reprices ambition itself without moral tag. Subtextual irony: the cartographer-voice never mapped anything; the scavenger ends by refusing to chart her own wreck. Quiet ending earns resonance through prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of “returning as the new exploration” emerges through the sextant’s repurposed meaning rather than explicit thesis. Final image reconfigures the original star-bound premise into grounded renewal. Reflection stays anchored to present stimuli (sediment swirl, polished brass). One near-miss: “equations for hope” flirts with label-speak but is saved by subsequent concrete plumbing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: maps as palimpsests, truth as sediment to be dredged rather than treasure to be seized. No explicit thesis statements; the sundial’s ticking shadow is the final word. Moral ambiguity is preserved—she is complicit in reopening what someone died to hide. The image of measuring “hours that refused to stay hidden” offers resonant non-literal answer, satisfying the 9+ quick test; slightly abstract cost keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of inheritance-as-practice emerges through rope spirals and seed hulls, never sermonized. Final image of planned spring planting reweights the fulgurite and rope as living texts, offering a non-literal answer: memory survives only when encoded in daily labor. Ambiguity is preserved—no moral spelled out—yet resonance is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: documenting absence becomes self-erasure; the closing image of the garden “holding its breath” reprises the leaf-fall and thread motifs, reframing survival as a form of gentle haunting—no moralizing, pure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the egg’s repricing: survival may require mechanical partnership rather than purity. No moralizing line states this; the stained-glass birds and mechanical songbird accumulate into the final symbiosis image. Bittersweet ache persists—beauty will never be natural again—creating plausible ambiguity. The concept integrates with the prince’s filial conflict, avoiding abstract sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges via the metamorphic image sequence: volcanic destruction → black sand → mirror → molten gold = destruction transmuted into renewable vigilance. No moralizing; the final line offers a non-literal answer (“tracks of someone…emerged not unscathed but unbowed”) that reweights the entire obsidian/fire motif. Subtext lives in gesture: pressing sand to cheek replaces filial accusation with tactile elegy. Complexity acknowledged—she is still “healing,” not healed—resisting tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of light-as-presence versus light-as-calculation; the gear’s awakening reprices the ancestral mission without moralizing. Final image reweights “without fire” from benevolent restraint to potential exponential detachment—an unsettling conceptual cost. Ambiguity lingers whether the cold flame is evolution or loss, satisfying the 9+ test for resonance without stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through the migrating image: grief is not anchored stone but weather that moves through a town like painted ladies. Subtext lives in unspoken family dinner absences—empty chairs that taught her to trade poems like bread. The final image of “hands that hold grief like stone” reweights stone from permanence to passage, offering resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: the ghosts may be hallucination, but the communal ritual is real either way.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from particulars: time-keeping as penance, inscription as memory, pendulum pause as fleeting permission to carry on. No moral stated; final image of stars reflected in obsidian reweights earlier “frozen flames” without commentary. Subtext resides in rake handle silence and millimeter adjustment—grief spoken only through mechanism. Complexity honored: absolution is not forgiveness but redistribution; ambiguity lingers whether balance is restored or merely re-defined.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme—anonymous mercy outliving the merciful—emerges cleanly from the sovereign’s encoded plea and the gardener’s habitual tending of the forgotten. Subtext lives in the act of repairing frayed threads rather than proclaiming virtue. The final image avoids moralizing, letting the tucked case beneath the arm imply custodial succession. Ambiguity is present but narrow: we sense the weight without probing its future consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—knowledge as navigable ignorance—emerges through image pattern (lake shards, feather dive, blank light) rather than statement. Final image of blue ink poised above white reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: innovation born of humility and audacity. No thematic echo in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as “memory is a living broadcast”—no moralizing lines, only images: dust grains as archive, lyrics as camouflage, mist as congregation. Subtext works through gesture (wrapping the dial in cloth) and inversion (song as weapon of peace). Final image reprises the dust motif, now animated, re-weighting the premise without stating a thesis. Avoids tidy maxim; complexity resides in the reader’s sense that tomorrow’s patrol could still erase everything.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “mirage of safety” surfaces only as overt label once, yet every image—china shattered, ash darkening hollow cheeks—reconstitutes that concept into felt contradiction. Theme emerges wordlessly: love builds illusions truth must dismantle, and art survives as residue, not likeness. Closure reweights it; the gallery absorbs the last light, making the reader experience vanishing rather than decoding a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through sediment metaphor: history is not singular but layered, compressible by power; the cog re-weights this idea at the end, offering a non-literal answer—truth survives as metallic residue, not narrative. Subtext operates in silence of missing townspeople and the narrator’s refusal to speak to them; abrasive calm tone underscores that refusal is the only moral act left. No final moralizing; theme stays implicit in the image of future hands holding the cog. Ambiguity lingers about whether truth changes anything, meeting complexity requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of harmony-as-subtraction emerges through iterated acts (teaching, tracing rosette, breathing with student) rather than dictation; final flower image re-weights the motif without moralizing. Subtext of political silences survives in single line about dialect transport, letting universality retain bite. Complexity acknowledged: hatred’s residue stays legible in worn wood, refusing tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the particular act of tasting memories in a ruin: wisdom survives through stubborn, sensuous reclamation rather than institutional sanction. No moral is stated; the final image of soup spoons and pruning shears reweights “rebellion” as quiet continuance. Subtext lives in gesture—each cut is a refusal to forget. The concept integrates with character goal; Elena’s internal arc and thematic question are inseparable.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Wonder as civic utility emerges organically from the failing mechanic of drone-collected lightning, never sermonized until the final riddle, which itself is a performative act rather than an authorial footnote. The matchbox reframes every prior weighed jar as a missed deposit of awe, a clean conceptual repricing. Theme resists moral binaries: the city isn’t evil, just depleted; Elara isn’t savior, just the only one who can’t lie about the fix. Final image of lights flickering on offers quiet resonance without tidy uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of inherited sensitivity emerges via orris and coffee-cup traces, avoiding explicit moral. Final image reweights earlier minutiae as ancestral conversation, satisfying resonance. A hairline slip toward echo-statement (“she understands finally”) keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges: imperfection as instrument of truth. Dice damage, flawed proofs, and the chipped die’s biased rolls collectively argue that rupture is not destruction but revelation. No explicit thesis—idea is carried through tactile repetition and final inversion of cage into horizon. Subtext would sharpen further if the “missed opportunity” had a single concrete image, but the conceptual reweighting still resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from iterative copying → communal gift: “kindness echoes even when its source is forgotten.” Final image of paintings left by door reweights earlier symbols as social currency, avoiding moral lecture. Subtext in brush’s transition from private talisman to public message. Avoids explicit thesis until final clause, and even that is embedded in action. Slight sentimental edge keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges inductively from initials-in-dough and prism-in-water: culture survives by being broken, shared, and refracted, never by being sealed. No character sermonizes; the final image of the single initial-loaf riding toward the unknown carries the re-priced concept with oblique cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of time-as-habit and fate-as-manacle emerges through backward machines, carved dates, and the yoyo’s reversal. Final image—“a language that had no past tense”—reweights all prior particulars without moralizing. Subtext is carried in objects (hunger stone as collective warning, yoyo as coiled undoing). No thematic echo or abstract sermon; ambiguity lingers about whether liberation or annihilation was achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—fear and desire as the same creature—emerges through mirror subtext rather than thesis line. The opera-clasp’s shift from “repulsive allure” to “peace” reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Final image of driving toward “whatever morning came next” invites ambiguity about recovery yet affirms motion. Avoids tidy maxim; paradox of “being afraid meant still choosing” stays implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: translation is endless, imperfect, yet ecstatically necessary. The dub fractal becomes a metaphor for human meaning-making; the final smile reweights earlier strikes from mere sound to existential duty, leaving resonant ambiguity rather than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of seeing versus being seen emerges through pattern-language versus watcher silence; the whistle’s reprise reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—wake or ruin—rooted in specific shell lore. No thematic echo violations.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges inductively: each ivy tendril, war anecdote, and archival redaction shows how "noble lies" calcify into civic bone. No character moralizes; the reader must decide whether any community can survive without its sanctioned fictions. Final image re-prices the premise without sermon—truth will travel like the last train, leaving the town exposed. Ambiguity is earned, not hedged.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of “residue of departure” emerges through concrete acts: embedding notes in dissolving stone, pocketing inkwell of unfinished letters. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues via recurring images of rising water and encroaching absence. Final image reweights earlier mapping work as merely prelude to guardianship, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will future readers emerge or will ocean erase both pavilion and notes—a complexity embraced, not resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges obliquely: how bureaucratic tools can be inverted to shelter outlaw memory. The reclaimed stillness motif reframes silence from absence to pregnant density; no character moralizes. Final image—Mira adding her own marginal future testimony—offers a charged, non-literal answer: complicity as continuity, resonance achieved without pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through iterated images of containment—gem, crane, lantern—showing that preservation is also confinement. No moral is stated; the final crane-fold lets reader feel the double edge. The “luminous torment” refrain almost over-articulates, but its final whisper is subsumed into action, so resonance survives.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Emergent theme: mathematics of grief—random strike vs. hidden connectedness—stays implicit; no authorial thesis stated. Final CR image (“geometries that look, for just a moment, like answers”) reweights prior material without moral. Ambiguity between scientific and mystical readings is invited, not resolved, supplying lingering aftereffect. Particulars (urinating survival, scorch-mottled geode) keep universals grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of manufactured memory versus unalterable guilt emerges through concrete pattern of driftwood confessions and the returned watch fragment. No moralizing; resonance is left in the charged silence after the last line, inviting reflection on complicity without dictating interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: two identical artifacts once shared, now released, reframe inherited enmity as optional rather than eternal. Subtext operates in silence—no apology spoken, yet the synchronized drop performs forgiveness. Final image reweights the premise: moonlight silvering the parapet signals a new neutral territory inside the self. No moralizing; the resonance is imagistic and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of navigation itself: celestial mastery reduced to reading man-made poles, turning human error into new possibility. The compass—gifted as a reminder of loss—becomes the literal weight that warms against her skin, silently repricing its meaning from mockery to tool without a single explicit thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: she “gravitates” toward shore, a quiet pun on both physics and emotional attrition, culminating in the unspoken assertion that faith is not recovery but forward motion under revised rules. The ending resists moral uplift; the laugh is part sob, part defiance, leaving the reader to feel the cost rather than decode a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: memory-less guilt versus present wonder. The glowing microbes emblematize resilience without preaching. Final image reweights the baseball from kitsch relic to synaptic spark—no moral spelled out. Ambiguity lingers: is renewed empathy gift or trap? Complexity sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—love as trans-species, trans-death continuity—emerges through spice, scent-memory, and phoenix-fire images rather than statement. The cosmic intimacy tone risks grandiosity yet stays grounded in crushed cardamom and Korin’s rough hands. Final line’s “smiling back” reweights death from terminus to companion, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Minor drift toward abstract “infinity” keeps it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: sacrifice cannot be undone, only metabolized. The saucer’s crack, the empty hand-prints, and the final blood-ink fusion reconfigure the reader’s understanding without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—pressing then piercing her palm—showing that forgiveness is a wound one gives oneself. Final image reweights the whole pattern, achieving CR resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: compassion is not passive but a palpable technology that can re-stitch reality. Subtext operates in gesture—threading as surrogate warfare, tear as non-lethal explosive. Final image reweights “shadow work” from therapy trope to literal engineering of lost souls. Ambiguity lingers: is she exile or seed? Resonance is earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of continuous becoming emerges via the lightning-bug motif (saved light released at convergence) rather than exposition. Subtext whispers through silence, ash drawings, monks’ nets of “silver words,” inviting reflection on passive agency. Final line “That was enough. That was everything.” offers resonant non-literal answer—value found in purposeless grace. No moral is declared; complexity survives, satisfying the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of encoded resistance through overlooked artifacts emerges organically from sundial and quill; the regime’s erasure of history is shown via half-painted numerals rather than told. Final image refrains from moralizing, but thematic resonance is muted because the personal cost to Elara is not made legible—she walks away unscathed and untested.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the shift from control (catching) to participation (joining) without explicit moralizing. Sacred pattern motif is re-weighted at closure: the borrowed dawn spreads not because friction returns but because connection replaces it. Subtext resides in the eels’ silence and the grandmother’s unseen presence, inviting reader inference. Final image of “promise finally settle[d]…a wing” offers resonant non-literal answer to the central question of what the eels truly are.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: the act of naming is resistance, but only when the named wound is owned in public space. Subtextual turn: scars shift from map to manuscript, from private legend to public transit. Final image offers Conceptual Repricing—verses that vanish as they’re spoken—reweighting “publication” as fleeting gesture rather than ink, a cost Mira accepts without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from concrete fencing-as-dialectic: the sundial’s incomplete face silently argues that truth is iterative. Subtext lives in sparks off metal—philosophy made corporeal. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing. No echo of prompt language; meaning is earned through movement and shadow, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of "beauty as sabotage against erasure" emerges through acts—hand-written shelf signs, poems inside covers—not explanation. Subtext lives in fingers on spines and voice carrying "quiet precision." Final "luminous and incomplete" re-weights premise without moral. One hairline echo: Delphine states theme aloud ("act of creating meaning"), but occurs mid-scene and is brief; minimal deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of art as refusal to accept temporal closure emerges implicitly: the unmoved clock, corrupted film, and encore that no audience can applaud all reweight “moving on” as betrayal. No moral stated; final image of tide rising around playing hands offers conceptual repricing—grief keeps time only through performance. Motif recurrence (clock, reel, tide) constrains choices rather than decorates. Subtext operates in silence: Clara never appears, yet every note is conversation. Resonant aftereffect: reader left hearing nonexistent music in the hollow of an unmoving clock.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: memory survives only when released from archival certainty. Final image of seeds scattered across open minds reconfigures the opening premise without moralizing. No echoic thesis statement; meaning is carried by the bloom-flower’s spiral and the monsoon’s cleansing. Ambiguity lingers—will dispersal save or further erode culture—inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through recurring blue imagery that slips from literal sky to emotional hue, landing on “opening toward light” without moralizing. Lace-as-message and compass-as-anchor reweight from cryptic clues to instruments of self-confrontation. Subtext breathes in silence and wind. Final image crystallizes apology as sky after storm—complex, unresolved, yet luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of cosmic violence and insectile decay, culminating in a non-literal answer to the central question: meaning resides not in scale or spectacle but in attentive witnessing. The butterfly’s dust reconfigures her light-curve expertise into a personal, transient record—resonant without moralizing. Subtext operates through image and gesture (curling legs, golden fingerprint), avoiding prompt-like articulation. The final paragraph resists abstraction by grounding insight in the irreproducible moment of dust on skin.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty and truth endure through fire, transformed rather than destroyed. Glass and ledger both “survive” flames, one luminous, one evidentiary—parallel testaments. The ending reweights prior loss not as ruin but as refraction: “light breaking through glass” resonates without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, frost, and scorched paper; no platitudes dilute the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through Elara’s method and the conservatory’s residue: human emotion outlasts its original medium. The “unshaken marvels” concept avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant reconfiguration—music persists not as sound but as architectural warmth. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and thermal shifts; the final paragraph earns its insight through concrete particulars (frozen ferns, brass fork, layered weeping). No false equivalence: the story stakes a claim that feeling endures even when form vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: rest requires witness, not ritual. The lighthouse lens reweights from broken artifact to active signal, answering the central question—how do the unrecovered dead find peace?—without moralizing. Subtext operates through silence (Aldric’s unspoken grief) and image (books preserved by curse/miracle mirroring souls suspended between states). Final image offers non-literal resolution: stillness found not in withdrawal but in readiness to serve.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—endurance as intergenerational transmission—emerges through particulars: the bell, the arbor, handwritten notes, paired elders and youth. No moralizing; insight arises when Farouk kneels beside Mariem unprompted, embodying continuity. The final line (“no border could silence”) reweights the opening border crossing, transforming loss into legacy. Subtext thrives in silence, flowers, and shared breath—not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: love unspent doesn’t vanish but lingers in place, requiring witness to transform. The final image—tendrils flowing through the photograph back into the world—answers the central question non-literally: healing is not erasure but rechanneling. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity remains (Who loved? Who was lost?), yet resonance is undeniable. Recurrence of breath, light, and tears accumulates pressure without tokenism.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of horticulture, memory, and temporality—no moralizing. The core question (“What does time feel like to touch?”) is answered non-literally through Elara’s resolve to build a maze that traps time’s texture. Recurring images (spiral carvings, disintegrating photos, the halo) shift meaning: from relics to tools. The ending invites reflection on preservation versus surrender, without false balance or abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: seeds as resistance, memory as cultivation, silence as strategy. The final image—“small, stubborn miracle of things that refused to die”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of whether erased life can return. No moralizing; complexity is preserved (regime crumbles, but soldiers still come; liberation requires disguise). Recurring objects (piano keys, arrow, chains) accrue meaning without allegorical shouting, and the theme resists binaries by honoring both destruction and patience.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s synesthesia and engineering: connection leaves negative space, and what we lose is defined by its silence. The final image—hope as a half-remembered word—offers a non-literal answer to “what are we hearing when we hear the end of something?” without moralizing. Complexity is preserved: her work may be useless to others, yet remains necessary to her. No thematic echo; resonance arises from the forge, the aurora, the trees—all charged with absence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of light, flowers, and stolen instants—no moralizing. The camellia garden in the photograph reweights the man’s present, offering a non-literal answer: destiny isn’t chosen but glimpsed, and that glimpse alters trajectory. Subtext thrives in silence—the man’s touch of his boutonnière, Mira’s unspoken smile. The final line reframes “theft” as listening, resisting tidy binaries while embracing ambiguity with emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object, action, and setting: brokenness made functional, boundaries that protect without imprisoning, inquiry as sacred labor. The final vessel—unnamed, uncategorized—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: how to hold fragility without crushing it. Subtext operates through gesture (thumb on cracked leather) and image (sparkling ice cascade echoing molten glass), avoiding moralizing. The recurring motif of scars reweights the premise: survival isn’t about wholeness but dignified transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: vulnerability as strength is tested through Maya’s phobia, stunt-double history, and decryption under duress—not stated but dramatized. The recurring motif of “adaptive” personas shifts meaning: from survival mechanism to weaponized insight. Final image—the cast clutched like a shield forged from childhood secrets—offers non-literal resolution: truth isn’t inherited but reclaimed through courage to face buried pain. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether Daniel will pursue her, but her internal reconfiguration is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: silence as language, darkness as habitat, stones as truth-bearers. The final image reweights everything—the map isn’t a warning but an invitation to “inhabit” night—offering non-literal resolution without moralizing. Subtext lives in absence: constellations that “no longer existed,” seasons “forgotten.” No prompt-like thesis; wisdom arises from pebble-shore pedagogy made visceral. Resonance lingers via irreplaceable synthesis of cartography, oracular tradition, and ecological elegy.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges implicitly: selfhood as an amalgam of fleeting perceptions, not a stable entity. The ice violin’s impossible music mirrors emergent consciousness—both transient, ungraspable, yet real in their passage. No moralizing; the insight (“accept the flow”) arises from concrete action (playing) and sensory experience (vibration). Final image reweights prior material: sweeping leaves and playing notes become equivalent acts of presence, dissolving hierarchy between labor and art.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the central conflict: honesty divorced from strategic language becomes possible through image, touch, and presence. The final image—drawing instead of writing—offers a non-literal answer to the story’s core question about truth’s vessels. No moralizing; ambiguity is preserved (“only the beginning”). The lens motif reweights prior material: what was once a relic becomes a tool, embodying the conceptual repricing of clarity itself.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: gardens remember, effort maps onto outcome, withering and blooming are one process. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the marbles’ cracks are documentation, not damage—repricing luck as earned understanding. No moralizing; resonance arises through image (polished fractures) and action (leaving the villager to wander). Subtext thrives in silence: Elara’s intelligence versus elders’ “sentimentality” reframes patience as epistemology.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of labor, observation, and revelation: the humble mechanic becomes the universe’s witness. The final image—“an obliging sky mechanic... had become the first to document it in the hush of beating wings at rest”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: truth is revealed not through force but through patient alignment with natural rhythms. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture (the lever’s click, the wings’ flicker). Avoids moralizing; instead, the cost is conceptual—forever altering how time is understood.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: music as transmission between living and dead, disaster as delivery mechanism. The final image—Elena climbing out, leaving lanterns below—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: connection persists beyond death through art, but requires sacrifice. No moralizing; resonance arises from the drowned piano, water-damaged notation, and “in-between spaces” redefined as liminal zones of communication. Ambiguity lingers (was Marco real?), but emotional truth is concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through the botanical illustration’s smudge—a flaw that becomes honesty—and the aurora’s “pale grief,” which reframes loss as enduring beauty. No moralizing; instead, the final image reweights the premise: certainty isn’t monolithic but “a collection of observations from the edge of perception.” This non-literal answer to “Can error be forgiven?” resonates because it’s grounded in Mira’s profession and Elena’s art. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld: we never hear Elena’s word, making “forgive” an earned inference, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: burdens require witnesses, not proof. Subtext operates through radio voices, valve-wheel autonomy, and the hush—not moralizing. Final confession reweights prior material by revealing Marcus’s own truth as part of the collective cry, avoiding tidy binaries. Resonance arises from concrete particulars (beads, static, pulse) rather than abstraction; no thematic echo or sermonizing mars the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: true witnessing requires surrender to transformation, not control. The final image—keeper as “more feeling than form”—reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in the paper swan’s worn folds and the silence’s “methodical grace,” avoiding abstraction. The story resists resolution, embracing ambiguity while delivering conceptual repricing: peace is not absence but active decay that nourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of celestial event, therapeutic practice, and maternal memory—wonder as something to be protected, not performed. The baby-hair curl evolves from sentimental relic to symbol of unfolding potential, reweighted in the final paragraph. No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete particulars (ukulele chord, Maya’s hand). The ending offers a non-literal answer: ordinary magic is patient nurture, not spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: stories as threads holding a fractured world together. No moralizing; insight arises from Miriam’s fragmented account and the tapestry’s pulse. The ending offers a non-literal answer—perhaps stories contain residual dream-energy to “spin a new axis”—reweighting all prior collecting as sacred, not futile. Ambiguity lingers (will it work?), but resonance is undeniable: preservation itself becomes resistance against ontological collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through the equivalence of espionage and prophecy—both reading hidden truths—and the tension between control and surrender. The closing image reweights the premise: illumination isn’t about directing light but allowing it to reveal what’s already moving toward you. No moralizing; wisdom arises from the specific alchemy of microdots, fortune cookies, and tides. The ambiguity lingers: is he illuminating or being watched? That duality charges every prior line without resolving into binary.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: possession as co-created illusion sustained by unexamined assumptions, truth as something revealed through precise questioning rather than force. The alizarin crimson evolves from pigment to symbol of “presence itself,” reweighting the entire premise—exorcism isn’t about expulsion but exposure. The ending offers no moral, only a resonant image: the priest bearing a single color into the dark, embodying focus as antidote to fear. Subtext thrives in silence, layered chant, and the unanswered question posed to the void.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the nautilus spiral, mirrored lake, and unheard symphony coalesce into a non-literal answer about belonging and agency. Subtext thrives in image (“music inside her was already real”) rather than assertion; the final fortune avoids moralizing by embodying permission as conductive action. Complexity endures—Elira’s sacrifice isn’t redeemed but resonates as necessary loss. The conceptual repricing reframes silence not as void but as ongoing performance, inviting reflection without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of object (tablet), action (retracing), and setting (viaduct)—not statement. The central question (“Can one integrate fractured selves?”) is answered non-literally in the final image: Mira becomes the source of the ripple, accepting periodic eternality as agency, not prison. Subtext thrives in shifting runes and darkening light; no moralizing. The resonance lingers because integration isn’t wholeness but controlled dispersion—a complex, non-binary resolution that reweights every prior moment.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, vibration, and reversed music—never stated outright. The central question (“Can music exist beyond hearing?”) is answered non-literally through Maren’s palm on wood and her future teaching of deaf students. The “filament of hush” transforms from void to instrument, reweighting all prior references to numbness. Final resonance avoids moralizing; instead, the image of leaves carrying “visible music” in shadow and light offers a concrete, earned epiphany rooted in sensory reorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the tension between documentation and action, observation and integrity. The recurring image of courtyards—hers versus the poisoned villages’—reweights the premise: peace is not passive but must be defended. The ending offers a non-literal answer: truth requires circulation, not just collection. No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete particulars (pigeon, journals, jasmine) without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: love leaves molecular traces; grief is caring for what cannot be held. The final image—glowing petals holding tears and promises—offers a non-literal answer to why smells trigger sorrow. No moralizing; instead, resonance accrues through the vial, light, and bloom. The brother’s research reframes horticulture as emotional archaeology, making extinction a site of honor, not just mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the spiral motif, rope, and starlight—not through assertion but through their evolving resonance. The central question (“remain human or join the transformation?”) receives a non-literal answer in the final image: truth resides in the tension between states, not in choosing one. This reweights all prior material—the prison escape, the beings’ offer, the repeated patterns—as preparation for embracing ambiguity. Subtext thrives in gesture (pressing rope to chest) and silence; no moralizing or pseudo-profundity intrudes, even in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: beauty in the unfinished isn’t stated but shown through stunted trees, returning birds, and vibrating brass. The final image—carrying the bowl “like a promise kept across generations”—offers a non-literal answer to devastation without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence, resonance, and inherited objects; no prompt-like thesis articulation. Complexity is preserved: loss is irreversible, yet creation persists—not despite damage, but woven through it.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from Vera’s dilemma: the necessity of “useful fiction” when truth is unbearable. The final image—her exhaling grief while already planning the next iteration—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: emotional medicine requires both artifice and sacrifice. No moralizing; instead, the amber grotto and blotter petal accrue meaning through use. The insight that “half truths had always been whole lies” reweights the entire premise without simplification, embracing moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically through parallel lives (grandmother/net-mender, mother/curtain-seamstress, Elias/copyist) and the recurring motif of unseen support. The ending offers no moral but a resonant reconfiguration: success is reframed as collective, not individual. The locket photo’s return isn’t sentimental—it’s a conceptual repricing of value itself. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the annotated program, avoiding any declarative statement while deepening the central question: Who gets remembered, and why?

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: marsh-reed sculptures, glass-powder tags, and crater-moss rituals show kinship as daily noticing, not grand gestures. The final image—spirals appearing ahead—answers the central question non-literally: belonging is co-created through shared search, not bestowed. No moralizing; subtext lives in Yara’s shift from “shouldering sorrow” to asking for needed shapes. Complexity remains: the ache persists, but is reweighted as anticipation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of memory, loss, and stewardship—never stated. The recurring moth, silenced eels, and interrupted cadence coalesce into a meditation on fragile continuity. The final image—Sera documenting reborn echoes—offers a non-literal answer: preservation is active, cyclical labor. Subtext lives in the pendant’s cold weight and the water’s stutter; no moralizing, only resonant particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges entirely through particulars: the mosaic’s fractures, the taxidermist’s failed gaze, the stalactites’ indifferent rhythm. The ending offers a non-literal answer—peace as dovetailing, not solving—reweighting every prior image without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (“held breath”) and gesture (leaving the eyes), avoiding therapy-speak. The core insight—that broken pieces can form “something that held its own strange shape”—resonates precisely because it’s embodied, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically: love as attention to the unseen, transmitted across time through infrastructure and memory. The tape fragment’s maternal message mirrors Maren’s own ethos, creating resonant symmetry without moralizing. Final image—Maren smiling in the dark while a student finds an answer—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: visibility is impact, not observation. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and magnetic residue, avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of botanical observation and human resistance: transformation requires appetite, surrender, and unrecognizability. The caterpillar anecdote isn’t moralizing—it’s a character-specific metaphor that reframes consumption as participation in a larger pattern. Final image of vines constructing something new “because of” loss offers a non-literal answer to Vera’s dilemma. No platitudes; ambiguity lingers (will she move?), but the conceptual shift is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the brooch (past warmth) vs. telescope (future sight), rain as both destroyer and revealer, sleep as both surrender and reward. The final image—Mira sleeping amid unearthed ruins—offers a non-literal answer: meaning isn’t found in relentless pursuit but in the convergence of trust, exchange, and rest. Subtext thrives in silence (the unspoken understanding between survivors) and charged objects. No moralizing; resonance accrues through the "sleepless colors" finally yielding to darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the cave’s music, the silent pearls, the disturbed harmonies. The central question—can the future be known or only tended?—is answered non-literally in Varen’s quiet emergence, where “limits of seeing” become “beautiful.” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Is he wiser or diminished?). The recurring pearl motif reweights meaning at closure, shifting from treasure to mirror to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: absence creates space for meaning-making, not just loss. The valve’s transformation—from silenced instrument to promise of sound—offers a non-literal answer to whether fragmentation can yield coherence. Subtext operates through gesture (hand closing on valve) and image (boats carrying “fragments waiting to be found”), avoiding moralizing. Final paragraph resonates without stating a thesis, embracing complexity: exile took everything yet enabled future understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: courage as a mapped path, silence as fortress. The ending reweights “mapping” from external routes to internal truths without moralizing. Final image—dawn after spoken confession—resonates non-literally. One misstep: “fortress of unspoken truths” risks on-the-nose abstraction, though saved by concrete execution in the station.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of measurement and memory, never stated but embodied in the tile’s dual nature as artifact and archive. The “unheard symphony” metaphor avoids sentimentality by grounding it in concrete acts: transcription, palm-pressing, whale-watching. Final image offers non-literal resolution—dawn light doesn’t explain but illuminates the synthesis of doubt and awe. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld: the institute’s motives, the locals’ full lore—keeping focus on Mira’s earned recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the amulet’s curse, the fracturing escondite, the solar storm’s dance. The central question—what happens after goodbye?—is answered non-literally through the CR: translation, not cessation. Subtext operates in every image; the final line resonates without moralizing. Complexity is preserved—immortality isn’t rejected, but reframed—and the insight feels earned through sensory ordeal, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of objects, choices, and silence: fairness isn’t transactional but testimonial. The ink pot’s magic isn’t supernatural—it’s metaphor made functional, revealing that truth requires ceremony, whether for the dead or the displaced. The ending offers a non-literal answer: justice isn’t found in loopholes but in reweighting narrative authority—Darius’s life becomes a “mathematical proof” because Elena refuses to reduce it to a plea. No moralizing; resonance accrues through the white chrysanthemums beside the ink, symbols of truth placed not in triumph but in quiet continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s practice: silence as archive, time as forest, memory as refracted light. The final image—prism scattering light “like seeds on fertile ground”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: the town may speak again through those who listen. Subtext operates in gesture (palm on glass), object (battered notepad), and silence itself. No moralizing; complexity is preserved in the ambiguity of whether reconstruction is possible or merely redemptive endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (label), method (fragment-collecting), and setting (container maze), resisting moralizing. The ending reweights the entire premise: survival isn’t passive endurance but active curation of memory against erasure. Subtext thrives in silence—the unsaid child, the unused poison—and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: history lives in texture, not documents. Ambiguity lingers (Where did the woman go? Will the nameless one be found?), but meaning is anchored in concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from Elena’s arc: the limits of rationalism and the necessity of embracing emotional ambiguity. The seashell’s spirals and the cello’s hum become non-literal answers to the “universal riddle”—meaning is circular, not linear, and resides in unfinished dialogues. Avoiding moralizing, the story trusts images: the “warm” shell in her hand, the “abandoned thoughts” of loose strings. Final resonance lies in the hum itself—an ongoing, unresolved vibration that reweights every prior dismissal of the ineffable.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Mira’s actions: community as living infrastructure, not nostalgia. The foundation stone chip shifts from artifact to promise, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence—the unspoken understanding among those who recognize the symbols—and the final calliope melody ties past to present without explanation. The story resists binaries: progress isn’t evil, but must be negotiated by those it displaces.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges implicitly: human presence as both witness and destroyer, with continuity forged through fragile acts of memory. The grain of sand and chemical photograph reweight “purposefully curious” from trait to covenant, and the frost’s sublimation reframes exploration as elegy. No moralizing; resonance builds through particulars (Yusuf’s hourglass grain, Mercury-era techniques) that culminate in the final image—beauty persisting in loneliness—which reconfigures the mission’s purpose without stating it. Ambiguity lingers (will the photo matter?), but the emotional aftereffect—melancholy responsibility—is concrete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme—repair as human connection in a mechanized world—emerges through concrete particulars: the drone carries “more than a package… proof that someone’s heart still reached toward someone else’s.” No moralizing; insight arises from Elias’s hands-on labor and the resonant final image of the mist swallowing the messenger. Subtext operates in silence (no dialogue) and gesture (the drone’s momentary hover as thanks). The recurring hummingbird motif shifts from broken object to vessel of hope, reweighting the premise without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—how landscapes and knowledge systems encode truth beyond institutional validation—emerges through Miriam’s methodical attention to marginalia, condensation, and falcon-delivered signs. The ending offers a non-literal answer: origin is not a point but a convergence of testimony, observation, and time. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and charged objects; no moralizing intrudes. Resonance arises from particulars (indigo cloth, dog-eared phrasebook) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: sound as communal lifeblood, silence as contagion. The final image—archway humming, footsteps nearing completion—offers a non-literal answer to whether places can be healed through patient, embodied ritual. Subtext thrives in gesture (naming buildings as identity restoration) and avoids moralizing. Complexity is preserved: revival isn’t guaranteed, only possible, and the cost is borne solely by Eliorn, resisting tidy redemption while affirming interconnectedness.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from vial, temple, and sacrifice—not stated but embodied in “gathered hush given form.” Final image reweights prior material: the temple isn’t a tomb but a trap preserving beauty’s fragility, and Marina’s grief becomes part of civilization’s tapestry. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in tension between loss and preservation. Epiphany earned through concrete action—touching altar, releasing perfume—not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (lattice), action (speaking truth), and setting (prison-as-beacon). The central question—can a disbelieved truth be resurrected through story?—is answered non-literally in the final image: the lighthouse sustains impossibilities because it holds stories the world refuses to hear. Subtext thrives in silence (“the hush he had been chasing”) and in the gap between what was whispered and what is now spoken aloud. No moralizing; resonance accrues through repetition with transformation (cry wolf → second cry wolf).

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the alchemical premise: growth demands sacrifice across lifetimes, and stewardship is a burden passed like a seed. The final image—Elara’s near-release as dawn stars return—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of redemption through service, reweighting all prior imagery (ash, jade, silver bark) without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (the bead’s pulse, the veil’s transformation) and silence (the gardener’s inexplicable tears). Complexity is preserved: the “loving venom” is both gift and curse, never simplified.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of needle, stone, and memory: healing is not restoration but reweaving. The recurring image of the illustration plate shifts from guide to catalyst, and the final act of sewing the spring reconfigures “ruin” as fertile ground for reverence. No moralizing; the resonant answer lies in the glowing path itself. Subtext thrives in silence—the canyon “answers in the language of water long departed”—and the orchid solace blooms precisely because belief is tested, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: roots feeding trees from bones, a birthmark matching ancient script, apple blooms triggering tears. The final image offers a non-literal answer—nothing is truly lost; memory persists through cyclical acts of tending—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (grandmother’s unsaid past) and gesture (the root cradling a skull “with something approaching tenderness”). Epiphanies arise from concrete labor, not abstraction, and the story resists tidy binaries, honoring both loss and renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: surface mail as vessel for erased identities, chalk codes as ephemeral invitations, the arcade as shrine to obsolete connection. The postscript (“Some names are not disguises but revelations”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question—identity as reclamation, not invention—without moralizing. Final image reweights all prior motifs: dawn light on arcade glass becomes a threshold where past efforts meet uncertain reception. Ambiguity lingers (will the letter arrive? be read?), but the thematic cost—persisting in belief despite near-certain futility—is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: truth resides in negative space, wisdom hides in plain sight, and silenced stories demand embodiment. The final stitch—tracing “what could be”—offers a non-literal answer: resistance as archival creation. No moralizing; resonance arises from the candle, needle, and frost converging in a charged silence that reweights every prior detail.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of unsent letters, liminal spaces, and self-forgiveness—never stated but embodied in the shard, the window, the mangrove’s suspended time. The ending offers a non-literal answer: healing isn’t retroactive action but internal permission (“I forgive you” spoken by her own voice). Subtext thrives in silence—the unsent letter needing no delivery once its words “arrive.” Complexity is preserved: regret isn’t erased, but held tenderly alongside love.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: translation as ethical witness, not mere linguistics. The coral—a living architecture built from damage—reweights the premise at closure, reframing trauma as generative. Subtext thrives in Fatima’s drawings and smudged script; no moralizing. Final image (“grief... beautiful in its terrible persistence”) offers non-literal answer to whether meaning can be recovered from fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: joy as fragile, communal, and recoverable through memory and art. The final image—children dancing in fog, dancers lingering in eyes—offers a non-literal answer to whether lost joy can be reclaimed. No moralizing; subtext lives in the fragment’s sacrifice and the network’s silent arrival. The fresco’s revival reweights the entire premise: memory isn’t preservation but continuation, passed “hand to hand like a flame.”

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: restoration as dialogue, not resurrection. The fresco’s musicians “lean toward her” not through magic but through Elena’s changed perception—subtext made visible. The ending offers no moral, only a resonant image: the nickel’s musician still listening, awaiting her reply. This reweights every prior act of painting as participation, not control. Ambiguity lingers (will she succeed?), but the conceptual cost—surrendering mastery—is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: cognition as commodity, language as lifeline, gardens as sites of quiet war. Subtext thrives in silence—the child sees veggies, tax-collectors see arithmetic, Maren sees rebellion. The ending offers no moral but a resonant image: a seed stirring underground, its root seeking “water table of rebellion,” reweighting all prior vegetable codes as acts of courage. No platitudes; wisdom arises from chlorophyll-encoded resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: grief transmuted into art as survival. The “blossom armistice” reframes waiting not as passivity but as active offering. Subtext thrives in the trembling postcard—an object that bridges absence and hope without explanation. However, the phrase “photosynthesize pain into beauty” borders on thematic echo, risking pseudo-profundity; it’s saved by immediate grounding in the greenhouse metaphor. Final image reweights the entire premise: beauty isn’t proof of resolution but of resilience within unresolved longing.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: extinct feelings, cracked vessels, opal light—not abstract declarations. The final image reweights prior material by revealing preservation as both necessary and sorrowful, answering the central question (Can loss be honored without recovery?) non-literally. Subtext operates through gesture (lifting chime to glass) and silence; no moralizing or pseudo-profundity intrudes. Complexity abides: forgetting enables progress, yet remembering honors dust—no false equivalence, just poignant tension.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: truth requires courage, and language can bind or isolate based on honesty. The “symphonies of truth” motif shifts from abstract concept to lived experience as glyphs resolve into music only when written faithfully. Final image offers non-literal answer—connection restored not through words spoken, but through shared silence breaking into sound—repricing silence as fertile rather than barren. No moralizing; resonance arises from Elara’s pen strokes and Elian’s breath catching in rhythm with her heart.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the fusion of engineering and affection: compassion encoded in chemistry, harmony achieved through calibrated control. The final image—machinists measuring “link by measured link”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to live with volatile forces. Avoids moralizing; instead, the amphitheater itself becomes the argument for coexistence. Subtext thrives in the adhesive’s “slyly heartfelt” compounds—love as technical choice, not sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: pigeon wings, crystalline grief, dust motes as messages. The lullaby’s “blooming and withering” offers a non-literal answer to the central question—trust isn’t certainty but practice. Subtext thrives in silence (the empty aviary, unsent letters) and avoids moralizing. The final line reweights all prior material: inheritance isn’t data but willingness to send into void.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of architecture, atmosphere, and intuition—boundaries as both limits and invitations. The final image reweights everything: the compass pointing “not north but toward the next transformation” offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Recurring motifs (grain, drift, codes) accrue meaning rather than stating it, and the maze metaphor transcends cliché by tying spatial design to epistemology.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of inherited objects, abandoned science, and emergent fireflies. The central question—how to belong in shifting landscapes—is answered not with a formula but through the final image: shared wonder as breath across time. The researchers’ note (“Wonder cannot be isolated”) avoids moralizing by being diegetic and fragile. The ending reweights the entire premise: belonging is rhythmic, not locational, and the cost is accepting impermanence while choosing presence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—how memory and absence shape identity—emerges through the interplay of seeds, glass, and light, never stated outright. The final line (“another path found in the fragments”) reweights the entire premise: loss isn’t an end but a re-routing. Subtext thrives in silence—the fisher’s buried hope, Maren’s refusal to offer false closure. The story resists moralizing; instead, it offers a resonant, non-literal answer: peace lives in continuation, not conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: human creativity as a bulwark against entropy, not through defiance but through ritualized reordering. The final image—Marek already calculating tomorrow’s performance “in the spaces between waves”—reweights the entire premise: his art isn’t escape but surrender to pattern, made luminous by discipline. No moralizing; resonance arises from the bishop’s arc and the tide’s pulse. The story resists binaries (luck vs. skill, chaos vs. order), instead showing their interdependence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the central conflict: exile as arrival, memory as bone architecture, gaps as invitations. The ending offers a non-literal answer—“the tide always returns to shore”—that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture (kneeling among pale flowers, pressing fingers to shoulder) and image (shifting ink, dissolving anchor). No platitudes; wisdom arises from concrete particulars, and ambiguity lingers (will the verse last? does recognition suffice?).

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: clarity is not about fixing glass but restoring attention. The pond’s ripples and the prism atrium reframe the mundane as sacred without moralizing. The final image—carrying the pond’s lesson into the day—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: how to live amid repetition without losing sight of wonder. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and refracted light.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of fire, memory, and mentorship—no moralizing. The recurring porcelain box shifts from vessel of loss to instrument of transmission, reweighting “what’s worth saving” from objects to people. The final line reframes destruction as potential light, offering a non-literal answer to whether suffering can be meaningful. Subtext thrives in gesture: Mira kissing the box, not speaking to Elena but for her.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s fusion of art and science, avoiding moralizing. The trial balloons symbolize hope’s fragility and testability without overt allegory, and the grotto’s tidal erosion mirrors incremental effort. Yet the ending restates the premise rather than reconfiguring it: we’re told hope requires “precision and imagination,” but no new insight reframes earlier assumptions. Subtext is rich, but the final image doesn’t offer a non-literal answer—it reaffirms the question.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the half-burned diaries, the negative strip, the whispering walls—not through assertion. The central question (“what do walls dream about?”) receives a non-literal answer: they dream of their people, and memory persists through those who listen. Subtext operates in silence (ivy rustling), gesture (kneeling to retrieve pages), and tool use. The ending reweights legacy as continuity, not burden, with resonant ambiguity—no moralizing, only charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from Aria’s actions: the power of gentle persuasion to reveal latent possibilities in broken or forgotten things. Subtext thrives in the mirrors’ visions—not lies, but “truths that existed in parallel”—challenging passive acceptance of reality. The ending offers a non-literal answer: transformation begins not with force, but with belief in what *could be*, seen at “just the right angle.” No moralizing; resonance accrues through the servants’ shard showing classless futures and the aging hand mirror restoring lost hope—particulars that reweight the entire premise without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: peace as “the slow accumulation of small mercies,” redemption not in victory but in “the endless, gentle muster of trying.” The final image—hands clasping on ancient stone under wheeling stars—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: reconciliation is imperfect, ongoing, and rooted in shared loss, not abstract justice. Subtext thrives in silence (the unread names, the unspoken forgiveness) and avoids moralizing. The recurring geometry of grief transformed into purpose reweights the entire premise without a single declarative thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: extinction, memory, and the ethics of intervention resonate through the egg’s “translucent” shell and unrecorded song. The ending offers a non-literal answer—silence may be broken not by success but by the act of trying—reweighting her “fractured grace” as both tragic and noble. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will it hatch?), yet the cost of defiance (“playing god”) is undeniable. Recurring motifs (cracks, song, silence) accumulate pressure without tokenism.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of image and action: conformity as a lullaby that drains spirit, resistance as poetic embodiment. The final image—wild, bright, silent defiance—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how one remains whole in a system designed to fragment. Subtext thrives in gesture and silence; no moralizing intrudes. However, the phrase “spiritual residue” edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting the otherwise concrete resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through the story stick’s transformation—from instrument of inscription to monument of restraint—and the dome’s echo-preserving walls. Final image offers non-literal answer: unwritten words carry more ethical weight than crafted ones. Avoids moralizing by embedding insight in ritual (reverse-telling) and object (vibrating oak). Subtext thrives in what’s withheld: Mira’s voice, the stick’s future, the meteor’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: honoring overlooked histories requires transient, unmonumental acts of care. The final image—Elara gathering broken strands to rebuild—offers a non-literal answer: meaning resides in the doing, not the lasting. No moralizing; resonance accrues through particulars (seventeen minutes, grandmother’s observations, decay-prone vines). Subtext operates in silence, gesture, and the moth wing’s unclassifiable geometry, avoiding binaries or sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between erasure and preservation, grief and duty. The rope’s transformation into a “living archive” offers a non-literal answer: memory endures not through perfection but through adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: paths choosing walkers, questions outliving answers. The wafer seal’s glow reweights the decaying directive not as failure but as archive of human inquiry—a non-literal, resonant answer to “why seek?” No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (Who built the bunker? What is transcendence?). Final image crystallizes theme: understanding as inheritance, not destination. Epiphany is earned through concrete particulars—grooves, bleeding ink, dream recitation—not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: empirical rigor without reverence blinds one to deeper patterns. The covenant-as-love-poem reframes devotion as mathematical harmony, not superstition. Final image (“some devotions are best encrypted”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer—wisdom resides in disciplined attention to what others dismiss. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether the “pattern-consciousness” is real or psychological, yet the cost of belief remains tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through the music box’s broken pin and shifting grace: resentment distorts reality; release permits restoration. No moralizing—the insight arises from Mira’s tactile plea (“Play it with your remembering”) and Kael’s trembling hands. Final image reweights prior material: the same sanctuary that consumed sound now hosts melody, proving grace redistributes only when cages of bitterness dissolve. Complexity remains—parents were “joyful and flawed”—avoiding binary redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: boundaries between real and dreamed are porous, and patience is the discipline that sustains liminal work. The sextant—once for measuring distances—becomes a vessel for capturing the ungraspable, reweighting the value of precision versus receptivity. The final image of glass mountains at dawn-dusk offers a non-literal answer: some truths exist only in the moment of erasure. No moralizing; resonance arises from the mirror’s refusal to show Mira, embodying the cost of her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: “deciduous vows” reframe promises as seasonal, not eternal, and wisdom as shared, not hoarded. The ending offers a non-literal answer—reconnection through imperfect repair, not contractual fulfillment—via the ribbon tied to the statue. Subtext operates in silence (the unspoken years) and gesture (kneeling, offering). Avoids moralizing; instead, the final image reweights the entire premise with emotional honesty and resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of memory, time, and inheritance—never stated but embodied in the cameo’s blank-to-image transformation. The final image (tree, asteroid, figure with outstretched hands) offers a non-literal answer: understanding replaces bewilderment, but at the cost of innocence. The cyclical nature of knowledge (“received from a future version of herself”) reframes linear causality as mythic recursion. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in what this truth demands next.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge is not lost but refused, and rescue means confronting the fear of understanding. The botanical diary’s transformation—from record of preservation to lexicon of loss—reweights the central metaphor without moralizing. Final image offers non-literal resolution: the “unheard symphony” resolving into a “crystalline note” implies that silence, not accumulation, is the true archive. Subtext thrives in the empty shelves and rejected futures, avoiding binary oppositions while maintaining moral clarity about the cost of wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the chimera condition and the garden of forgotten names: identity as both burden and bond. The final image—stepping into fog while holding the card—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: some losses can only be reclaimed through surrender to ambiguity. No moralizing; complexity is preserved (blissful aberration is both curse and mercy). The recurring card reweights the premise without stating it, fulfilling the lyric-resonance path.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of archival labor, encoded memory, and historical erasure. The “fables of absence” evolve from childhood metaphor to operational principle, culminating in a non-literal answer: absence is not void but encrypted presence. The final image—Elena smiling as scholarship becomes adventure—reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in the rope’s braids and wax seal, avoiding abstraction. No thematic echo or sermonizing; resonance is earned through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through the tension between imposed noise and hard-won quiet, rejecting easy binaries: silence isn’t absence but balance of opposing forces. The final image—“the nothing-song that the bloom of hush sang”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: peace isn’t escape but equilibrium forged in chaos. No moralizing; resonance arises from the stone’s shift from amplifier to silence-seeker. The concept reweights the premise: survival requires not resistance but attunement.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of artifact, perception, and ruin: meaning persists not in grand systems but in curated fragments held across time. The prism’s rainbows reconfigure “hush” from absence to connective tissue, answering the central question—can shattered pieces reassemble into purpose?—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in tactile communion (“all the hands that had crafted it”) and the pavilion’s approving vibration. However, the final assertion that “proving coincidences had meaning was… her gift” edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of stone, shadow, and storm: identity is not inherited but continuously sculpted from lived experience and witnessed presence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—“not their names, but their love”—that reweights every prior image without moralizing. Subtext operates through the contrast between performative vs. processed grief, shown via shadow angles, not stated. Ambiguity lingers (Can memory ever be accurate?), but the emotional aftereffect—quiet awe at ordinary lives building legacy—is earned through concrete particulars, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: fire as resurrection, not spectacle, woven through action (tying the rag knot), image (incomplete phoenix), and silence (starless sky). The ending offers no moral but a resonant reconfiguration—hope as collective reawakening sparked by individual courage. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid: the grandmother’s hands, the abandoned fortress, the children’s stares. Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in chemical precision and physical labor.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: liminality, transition, and the texture of time are explored through tidal rhythms, molting crabs, and the cicada’s life cycle—not stated but embodied. The ending reweights the premise: forgiveness isn’t a destination but a liminal space entered through shared presence. No moralizing; resonance arises from the cicada’s placement and the softening voice. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the unsaid “everything” between them.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, limitation, and growth—never stated, only embodied. The porcelain doll and sprout reweight the core question: what walls protect, and what do they smother? The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: true preparation isn’t sealing out the world but cultivating the courage to grow within it. Complexity is preserved—her father isn’t villainized, just tragically limited—and the final image avoids moralizing while deepening the story’s emotional and conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme—silence as active, malleable comfort—emerges entirely through concrete action and image, never stated outright. The grandmother’s wisdom (“Silence is not empty…”) is dramatized, not moralized, and the ending reweights it: the boy carries warmth he can’t name, proving silence’s efficacy lies beyond memory. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld (no dialogue, no nightmare content) and in the storm glass’s color shifts. The final line—“silence had finally learned to comfort”—resonates as earned insight, not assertion, inviting reflection on care that leaves no trace.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—transformation over dominion—emerges through particulars: the throne’s mural redefinition, fruit of “crystallized light,” and stairway of “suspended moments.” Subtext thrives in silence (Elara’s wordless ascent) and image (fossilized paint yielding truth). The ending offers a non-literal answer: power as bridge-building, not control, reweighting all prior symbols without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (what does guardianship entail?), but complexity is anchored in concrete stakes, avoiding false equivalence or platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the central paradox: love can drown, but so can its absence. The doorknocker ring and fading threshold accrue meaning through use, not declaration. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—thresholds must be maintained, not erased—without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence (watching shadows), gesture (clasping hands), and image (ash returning to earth), resisting binaries while embracing complexity: burning bridges was necessary, but not sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: pyramid schemes vs. quantum promises, bolts as inherited weight, mushrooms as living witnesses. No moralizing—the insight (“promises can become true if believed in hard enough”) arises from Maya’s tactile experience, not assertion. The grandmother’s bolt reframes legacy: not sentiment, but unprocessed potential. Final image—bolt ordinary again, but air lighter—offers non-literal answer: truth isn’t in the object, but in the act of witnessing transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of order (manicured terrace, scholarly dynasty) and chaos (wisteria, rusted gates, standing waves). The central question—can bloodlines be accidents?—is answered not with moralizing but through the gramophone’s impossible voice: lineage is a vessel for secrets, not destiny. The final image reweights everything: the dynasty ended not in death but in silence, and Elara’s inheritance is truth, not property. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid—the great-grandmother’s choice remains unnamed, preserving ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from marionettes as vessels of unrealized futures, not stated moral. The final image—Aldric carrying the orchard’s gift within him—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: possibility has weight even when unfulfilled. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the unsnapped strings. Avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in concrete action: wooden limbs dancing, then falling free.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the button’s discovery: systems erase, but individuals preserve through fragile, unrecorded gestures. The ending offers a non-literal answer—reverence as resistance—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the missing note, the soldier’s unnamed act), and the core concept (“unknown histories”) is interrogated through concrete particulars, not abstraction. No sentimentality; grief is honored, not exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from action: truth as weaponized memory, indifference as tyranny. The final image—Mira descending as stars watch “through every revision”—offers a non-literal answer: persistence over spectacle. No moralizing; resonance accrues through recurring objects (key, lagoon, photographs) that reweight meaning. The grandmother’s legacy reframes “careful resourcefulness” not as survival but as intergenerational warfare against forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of sound, silence, and containment—no moralizing. The recurring image of “negative space” reweights meaning at closure: silence isn’t absence but active guardianship. Final image (“eerie nostalgia for a time when silence was not yet necessary”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer about the cost of knowledge. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid: the prophecy’s hunger mirrors human desire for revelation, making restraint heroic.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme—preservation as prophecy, attention as survival—emerges through concrete particulars: sorting seeds, building monuments, decoding veins. The final image reweights all prior acts: those “tiny monuments” hum with affirmation, transforming hoarding into sacred readiness. No moralizing; insight arises from ritual and revelation. The ambiguity lingers—will the seed save them?—but the thematic answer (memory as lifeline) is resonant and non-literal.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—uncertainty as both burden and compass—emerges through recurring images: broken clocks, swirling leaves, weathered brass. The greenhouse’s deliberate-seeming leaf patterns echo Maren’s desire for order in chaos, while the underground waterfall suggests time’s hidden flow. Final image reweights the premise: descending into darkness becomes an act of faith, not proof-seeking. Avoids moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (tinkerer’s hands in ruins) rather than abstraction. However, the compass rose’s symbolic weight slightly overshadows the more original tension between planning and surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the kintsugi act: restoration through visibility, not erasure. The final image—golden seams glowing in forge shadows—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor loss. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (molten gold, fractured signs). Subtext operates in silence (empty foundry), gesture (trembling hands), and resonant ambiguity—his death remains tragic, yet meaningful through her changed stance.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: healing requires integrating joy into grief, not replacing it. Subtext lives in the soldier’s smile and Mira’s continued work—no moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: laughter isn’t denial but reconfiguration. Ambiguity lingers (will she ever heal?), but the core insight—that wholeness holds contradiction—is earned through concrete particulars, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the “mathematics of mercy” isn’t stated abstractly but lived in trembling muscles and UV-lit leaves. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—mercy isn’t quantifiable but resides in the willingness to walk toward fire without knowing its end. Subtext thrives in the pewter strap (control vs. call), the forest (penance as altered perception), and proprioception (truth written in bone). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether the clearing offers redemption or deeper entrapment.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: intuition as navigational force, legacy as living relay, not static archive. The lighthouse beam as “corridor of visible intuition” reframes guidance as felt truth rather than literal light. Subtext thrives in silence—the grandmother’s outstretched hand in the painting, the fragment’s warmth—avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: history matters not when remembered, but when carried forward as active practice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: façades (circus posters, plaster cracks) conceal emotional residue, and repair requires seeing beyond surface decay. Subtext operates in silence, dust, and mechanical objects—no moralizing. The mainspring barrel reweights meaning: potential energy stored but unused mirrors the hidden secret, suggesting some stories await the right witness. Final image offers resonant answer: truth resides in overlooked spaces, accessible only to those who read abandonment as narrative. Complexity is embraced—echoes aren’t ghosts but “impressions,” avoiding supernatural binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: the tension between containment and expression resolves not through moralizing but through the press’s groan and the cloud sea’s new language. The final image—Elara composing a page for “endless circulation”—offers a non-literal answer: some truths require dissemination, not custody. Recurring motifs (glass, frost, press) accrue pressure rather than decorate; the whisper’s release reweights every prior silence. No platitudes; wisdom arises from the tactile act of imprinting eternity onto paper.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from Vespera’s arc: revolutions fail when demanding singular truths; resilience lies in holding multiplicity. The shard’s refugee imagery and official explorer myth aren’t reconciled but held in tension—“both, as all.” Final image of covered mirrors during storms becomes a metaphor for civilizational maturity: choosing to look despite danger. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (vase shard, draped glass) and avoids false equivalence—refugee truth is seen, yet deemed insufficient alone.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through precise particulars: rust as metaphor for silence, music as fragile truth, repair as faith. The final note—“thin and uncertain at first, but true”—offers a non-literal answer to whether stolen beauty can return: yes, if someone remembers how to listen. No moralizing; resonance accrues via recurring images (chip’s glow, fading melodies) that reweight meaning at closure. Complexity is preserved—midnight may have understood something Cassian doesn’t—and ambiguity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: petrichor as memory, industry’s silence as portal, the compass as failed human orientation against geological time. The ending offers no moral but a resonant reconfiguration—true origin lies beyond cataloguing, in presence without possession. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld: the expedition’s fate, the sender’s identity. Final image (“being exactly where one was meant to be”) reweights every prior collection as prelude to surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from object, setting, and action—not stated but shown through layered images in the slide and Aria’s response. The final sculpture answers the central question (“What is my work for?”) non-literally: it reaches toward ancestral hands, affirming continuity over originality. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the turbine-hum rhythm. No moralizing; complexity remains (individual vs. lineage) without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from Mira’s quest: the dignity of unseen beauty, patience as witness, and trust in cosmic reciprocity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—flowers bloom not for human eyes but for pollinators and lunar cycles—and reweights the entire narrative as a meditation on faith in hidden systems. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (postcards, ice, glass). The final image of spring bulbs “preparing their own quiet performance” echoes and deepens the central question without resolving it tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: archival labor as resistance, memory as both prison and covenant. The lagoon’s “black water” mirrors historical erasure, while the debris cipher embodies marginalized communication. Final image—grandmother’s crystalline return—offers non-literal answer: truth persists not in documents but in witnessed transmission. No moralizing; resonance accrues through salt grains, oilcloth wrappings, and the unsaid weight of civil rights work contextualizing personal revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: civilization endures not through desire but through embodied craft and memory. The baker’s hands, weaver’s fingers, and blacksmith’s arms become non-literal answers to “how do we begin again?” No moralizing; resonance lives in the bread on nonexistent racks and flameless lanterns. The final image reweights the premise—magic exhausted, humanity persists through what hands can hold and minds can rebuild.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme—memory as covenant between living and dead—emerges through concrete particulars: wax grooves, oath tablets, gnarled roots. The ending offers a non-literal answer: silence isn’t emptiness but a vessel finally tuned to ancestral frequency. Subtext thrives in gesture (pressing wax to temple) and image (amber light through ajar window). No moralizing; resonance arises from the charged poise of Seraphine smiling amid overwhelming inheritance. Complexity endures: the dead’s promises are hopeful yet burdensome, understood yet untranslated.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between preservation and transformation: “borrowed time” reframes as intergenerational investment maturing through sacrifice. The seedling with eyes embodies this—neither plant nor creature, but continuity made flesh. Subtext thrives in tactile details (acorn cap ridges, cotyledons like fingers) rather than exposition. The ending offers a non-literal answer: time isn’t hoarded but circulated, a concept reweighted through Elara’s earned serenity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through the parallel between monastic bell-ringing and siren-testing: both are acts of listening that precede action. The story avoids stating this; instead, it resonates in Elara’s fingers on the rope and her reverence for the “air’s whisper.” Final image reweights the premise: the siren’s beauty lies in its duality—warning and reassurance—suggesting that care can be both technical and sacred. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether tradition or technology saves, but their synthesis does.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the janitor’s actions: strength in vulnerability isn’t stated but enacted through handling dimmed fragments with primal elegance. The final image—“quiet fire that burned in gentle hands”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: what is power? Subtext operates in silence (kneeling), gesture (tracing), and object (lantern refracting loss into story). No moralizing; complexity endures—stars must burn to be seen, yet find peace only in dimming.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from bees, silence, and stewardship—never stated outright. The stained glass box reweights earlier images of fracture and ash, transforming loss into custodianship. Subtext thrives in gesture: the ghost’s hands, Mira’s digging, the lap-cradled box.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of object, setting, and reflection: time’s meaning resides not in countable units but in unmeasured presence. The final image—“the container outlived the contained”—reweights the entire premise without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture (e.g., ashes becoming breath for strangers), and the story resists tidy binaries, embracing ambiguity (“broken things sometimes spoke more honestly”). No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges entirely through image and action—no moralizing. The final lines reweight prior material: “woven dawns” reframes the entire narrative as process, not product.

The feather-as-bridge and kite-without-string offer resonant, non-literal answers to the central question: what is wholeness?

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: architecture as dialogue between permanence and transience, human stewardship as listening rather than imposing. The final image—trees “remembering” her wire, future caretakers reading her diary—offers a non-literal answer to mortality: legacy as embedded pattern, not monument. Subtext thrives in gesture (careful wire-wrapping) and silence (no lamentation). Avoids moralizing; instead, the copper’s “subtle music” embodies reciprocity, reweighting the entire premise without statement.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of alien migration, fossilized fly, and human pilgrimage—converging on the idea that seeking *is* belonging. The final image reweights all prior material without moralizing: the amber fly “continues its eternal suspended journey toward a home it would never reach but had always been approaching.” This non-literal answer resonates with philosophical depth and avoids tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—ecological restoration as an act of linguistic and mnemonic resurrection—emerges through concrete particulars: dead languages, bird calls as treaties, seed pods as memory vessels. The ending offers a non-literal answer: life returns not through technology but through re-enacting forgotten concord. Subtext operates in silence (birds falling quiet), gesture (kneeling, pressing pods), and image (green thread as counterpoint to bone-white reef). Avoids moralizing; complexity is preserved in the ambiguity of whether this is miracle or metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: love as the only enduring translation across devastation. The leaf and cylinder reweight from objects to vessels of connection, culminating in the brother’s line: “love is the only translation that survives when everything else burns.” No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars. Final image reconfigures the wasteland’s silence into shared breath, offering a non-literal answer to isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)

The compass rose’s pulse embodies the theme: guidance isn’t about destination but orientation of the soul across generations.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: theft vs. restitution, knowledge vs. innocence, secrecy as both burden and gift. The chess pieces—hollowed with unwritten truths—reprice the sundial lid’s value: not as artifact but as vessel of unspoken history. Final image offers non-literal answer: amends aren’t return but revelation. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from Seraph’s whisper (“These were stolen decades ago”) and Caelius’s release into uncertainty—complexity lingers without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the chessboard’s missing pawns, whispered names, water bottles pressed into hands. Subtext operates through silence and absence—what isn’t said or replaced carries more weight than declarations. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: history isn’t written in documents but in footsteps, small defiances, and acoustic echoes. No moralizing; instead, the final image reweights the entire premise—crisis as ongoing condition, not discrete event—through earned, specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the stone’s translation of longing into ancestral language reframes “home” not as place but as speakable truth, crystallized in the keeper’s final line. Subtext operates through gesture (pressing palm to stone), silence (visions of unheard grandmother), and the charged object (feather-textured tablet). The ending offers a non-literal answer—home is a language learned with one’s whole being—without moralizing; gratitude and pain coexist as twin costs of giftedness. Motif integration is essential: the stone’s glow fades, but its warmth in her pocket proves healing is ongoing, not resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: chess sacrifice as metaphor for moral instruction, the tapestry’s frayed border revealing hidden truth beneath public narrative. Subtext operates in silence—the frozen villagers’ suspended games mirror Mira’s own halted life—and in the labyrinth’s reflective surfaces that literalize introspection.

No moralizing; resonance arises from the folded tapestry under her arm, a quiet emblem of reclaimed agency.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the bird poem, charcoal on bone, children’s wet eyes. No moralizing—only the resonant claim that “all true stories are about everyone’s mother.” The final image reweights the premise: truth isn’t destroyed by silence but multiplied by voice. Complexity remains—priests aren’t caricatures, just enforcers of a system Sera outmaneuvers through fragility, not force.

    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of brokenness, memory, and uncertainty—not stated but embodied in the statue’s scars and the charm’s ambiguous symbols. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: meaning isn’t forged in certainty but in the willingness to hold breath between doubt and faith. Avoids moralizing; instead, the kintsugi metaphor is lived, not explained. Final line—“continued her work”—reweights all prior failure as ongoing practice, not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges entirely through image and action: the shell, the mirror, the pool’s reflection.

Subtext thrives in silence, water, and absence; no platitudes, only earned wisdom from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of old wisdom (grandmother’s song, logbook secrets) and modern crisis (thermal currents, frantic flares).

Subtext thrives in gesture: uncorking the vial is a confession; hands on brass are prayer without words. The ending reweights the premise: illumination isn’t about volume but tenderness, a non-literal answer that lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from action: navigation as emotional cartography, loss as landscape, solace as co-presence. The final image—two figures at the marsh’s edge, tears gleaming like bronze—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: you don’t escape grief; you walk into it with someone. No moralizing; resonance accrues through specificity (censer foot, reverse migration, midnight calls). Subtext thrives in silence and object, avoiding abstraction or therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of forgotten knowledge (glass eye, textbooks), ecological resilience (orchard, truffles), and emotional memory—never stated but embodied in every choice. The central question—“Why cultivate safety in a world that forgot it?”—is answered non-literally through Mira’s refusal to let memory die, even alone. Subtext thrives in the contrast between the virus’s enforced armor and the orchard’s exposed, gripping roots. The ending offers no moral but a resonant image: two dismissed artifacts united in a hollow, suggesting that connection begins not with crowds but with tending hidden networks in the ruins.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: reconciliation across silence, the weight of unspoken gestures. The Edelweiss shifts from enigmatic token to vessel of maternal regret, reweighting Aldric’s entire history without moralizing. The final insight—“some gestures need no words”—is earned through concrete action (finding the note, recalling the past), not assertion. Subtext thrives in what’s absent: the mother’s voice, the stranger’s identity, the keeper’s tears. No false balance; the story stakes a claim on the power of patient attention over explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme—home as a choice accumulated through lived geography, not inherited coordinates—emerges through particulars: maps that remember, a printer’s key, ants as guides. The final image reweights the premise: the “map she’d been searching for” is not paper but a threshold of decisions. No moralizing; resonance arises from the chip’s pull and the cavern’s breath. Subtext thrives in the tension between empirical intuition and faith in the unseen, with the father’s promise reframed as inheritance of agency, not instruction.

    Theme—disenchantment as rupture from living mystery, not mere fatigue—emerges through concrete particulars: bleeding starlight, weeping ink, lacy menace. The ending offers a non-literal answer: shared fragility (breath + fireflies) reweights isolation as connection. No moralizing; resonance accrues via image.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from spiral geometry, ember decay, and whispered secrets—not stated but enacted. The final image reweights everything: the columella was never a vessel but a mirror for human capacity to hold layered time. Subtext thrives in what’s withheld (the secret itself) and how warmth transforms rather than vanishes. Avoids moralizing; instead, offers a non-literal answer: presence is co-created, not captured. Epiphany arises from concrete handling of shell and fire, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of dream, memory, and mortality, resisting moralizing. The central question—can chaos be narrated?—is answered non-literally in the final image: the grave “learning to speak” through the chronicle. Subtext thrives in gesture (tracing his own epitaph) and image (moss growing in fast-forward), avoiding abstraction. The Möbius strip metaphor is earned through lived experience, not imposed, and the ending’s resonance lingers without resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: ordinary miracles reside in acts of careful attention across thresholds (birth, grief, timekeeping). The birthing screw reweights the water clocks as vessels of human continuity, not mere mechanisms. Subtext thrives in silence—the unasked question of loss, the unspoken kinship between healers. Final image avoids moralizing; instead, warmth in Elena’s palm becomes a resonant, non-literal answer: meaning persists beyond sensory channels.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: grief must be given shape to become story, not suppressed as shame. The crystals—once hidden affliction—become ink, reweighting pain as generative. No moral is stated; instead, the final image of luminous runes on parchment answers the central question: magic requires honesty with wounds. The grandmother’s “superstition” is revealed as instruction, transforming the entire premise without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: unfinished music, imperfect miracles, and pruning/growth metaphors coalesce without moralizing. The final tree-fall reweights the premise—not as elegy but as necessary rupture for renewal. Subtext thrives in silence (six years unspoken) and objects (empty bottle holding memory). The resonant answer to “Can broken bonds regrow?” is non-literal: not restoration, but beginning again amid ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of language, entropy, and witnessing—words as keys, endings as unwritten, paradoxes smoothed by time. The dictionary and Spiral suggest that meaning persists beyond matter, a resonant idea. Yet without a decisive final image that reconfigures this premise (e.g., Elara choosing silence over definition), the theme remains contemplative rather than consequential. Subtext is rich, but closure fails to crystallize it into earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: time isn’t counted but heard, felt in breaths and light’s linger. The hydraulic clock becomes a metaphor for cyclical yet forward-moving change. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing—Aira’s smile conveys earned wisdom, not triumph. Subtext thrives in silence, droplets, and the key’s weight. No false equivalence; the university’s dismissal contrasts her depth, but the story avoids caricature.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: intimacy thrives in the space between disclosure and secrecy, revolution in permeable barriers. The final image—“quiet wildfire spreading through permeable barriers”—reweights the entire premise without moralizing, showing how restraint itself was generative. Subtext lives in choreography: no one touches, yet the triangle completes. The laser pointer and mycelium become resonant metaphors only because they’re handled concretely earlier, avoiding symbolic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between calculation and surrender, crystallized in the final line: “addition of losses that might yet become multiplication of meaning.” No moralizing—the lantern’s “honest light” gains resonance through use, not declaration. The cryptic scrawls reprice probability from cold math to human metaphor, inviting reflection on how we assign meaning to chance. Subtext thrives in silence: the father’s folded newspaper speaks louder than dialogue could.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically: grief as a frequency that becomes ambient air, endings as doorways needing witness. The harmonica’s “note held so long it became the air itself” reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image—phone ringing, Mira waiting—offers a non-literal answer: healing begins in being heard, not known. Subtext thrives in silence, wrong numbers, and the disc’s impossible light; no prompt-like thesis intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars—the locket, walnut ink, tea-steeping—not abstract assertion. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (“What is worth preserving?”): small moments are the “only true currency the future possesses,” a realization earned through sensory and emotional immersion. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing locket to lips) and image (closing petals, flickering boat lights), avoiding moralizing. Complexity is preserved: joy is temporary, memory is mutable, yet both are worth tending—no false binaries or tidy resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—loneliness healed not by magic but by mutual vulnerability—emerges through action, not assertion. The moon rock is catalyst, not cure; the real transaction is human recognition. Final image reweights prior material: efficiency was armor, now laughter is promise. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will others come? will it work?), but resonance is undeniable. Recurrence of “improbable” reframes from logistical obstacle to emotional possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically: emotional landscapes are legible only through stillness, not conquest. The final image—“a new kind of map... drawn in the architecture of her own soul”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Recurring elements (ring, melody, stillpoint) accrue weight through use, not declaration, and the “quiet blaze” motif reweights prior material by shifting from external beacon to internal luminescence. Ambiguity lingers (Is the Still real or metaphorical?), but complexity serves insight, not evasion.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning arises not despite distortion but through it. The pen, the anomaly, and Mira’s misstep all converge on the idea that filtering removes noise to reveal essence. No moralizing—the epiphany (“every wrong turn was a form of filtering”) grows from her specific labor and tools. The final image reweights the entire premise: uncertainty isn’t obstacle but condition for clarity, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how we know what’s real.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of sign language, inherited silence, and unphotographable memory. The final image—hands translating grief into shareable music—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: some truths live only in embodied transmission. Avoids moralizing; instead, the camera’s emptiness and Elena’s loosened face reprice what “preservation” means. Subtext thrives in gesture, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between destruction and preservation as acts of fidelity to truth. The final image—Mira carrying knowledge without burning gates—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: how to free knowledge without becoming its jailer. Subtext lives in the vandalized portrait (self-erasure as protection) and the network of ancestral faces (custodianship as collective, not individual). Avoids moralizing; instead, the tapestry’s silent witness reweights the opening arson as necessary but insufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the garden’s responsive ecology mirrors neural entanglement, and the drumming pattern transforms memory into shared presence. The ending offers a non-literal answer—consciousness persists not as data but as resonant frequency—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (scientists’ misreading vs. Elara’s knowing) and avoids binaries. Only minor risk of sentimentality in “auroral sorrow” is offset by concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges organically: embodied knowledge versus brittle technology, with whispers as mycelial resistance to centralized failure. The sea-goat (Capricorn) motif reweights silently—the coin’s warmth implies ancestral validation, not magical aid—while the key’s purposelessness becomes thematic bedrock: utility isn’t always instrumental. Final image rejects moralizing; instead, Mira’s descent into the maze after victory offers a resonant answer: stewardship persists beyond crisis. Complexity abides—Reyes isn’t villainized, just outdated—and subtext thrives in what’s unsaid (her father’s death haunts but doesn’t dictate).

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of silence, light, and inherited resilience—not stated but enacted. The recurring spiral motif evolves from internal calm to projected constellations, reweighting despair as possibility. Final image offers non-literal answer: stars teach darkness their value not through speech but through patient, angled reflection. Avoids moralizing; instead, the boy’s unspoken recognition embodies earned understanding passed between sufferers.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.3)

The scrimshaw’s reinterpreted purpose (“not to unlock others’ hearts, but to unlock her own”) reframes the entire narrative without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence—the unspoken grief of her father’s disappearance, the wordless dialogue between human and whale—and the final image (heart opening “like a flower in the deep”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Ambiguity lingers (what lies beyond the “disappearing island” of her former self?), but the cost of transformation is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the wooden rose beside dried flowers reweights performance from artifice to memorial. Subtext operates in silence, gesture, and the speakers’ misreading of theatrical tone as compliance. The ending offers a non-literal answer—peace as weightlessness between grief and joy—without moralizing. Central question (“Can authenticity survive emotional regulation?”) is answered through image, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of light, sound, and forbidden space: that walls are constructs of collective belief, and artistry can dissolve them. The final image—a poet walking out with a new poem—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of access versus sanctity, reweighting the entire premise without moralizing. Recurring motifs (cloud shadows, humming, cobalt light) accumulate pressure and transform meaning, avoiding abstraction. The resonance lingers precisely because it refuses tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: cracked glass, worn reeds, fallen petals—not abstract declarations. The final image reweights the entire premise: awakening is not a singular event but a circulating practice, passed like a reed “worn smooth by generations.” Subtext thrives in silence and gesture—the spiral of ivy, the placement of blue glass—avoiding moralizing. The story resists tidy binaries, embracing the burden and gift of seeing beauty where others see error, with no redemption demanded of the flawed world.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges entirely through particulars: the carbide lens’s underground history, the synthetic dawn recordings, the holographic shrines. The central question—can manufactured ritual evoke real transcendence?—is answered not with moralizing but through Elara’s final stance: meaning arises from “fragments we choose to carry forward.” This non-literal resolution reweights every prior image (amber light, golden shadows, magnetic tapes) as vessels of ancestral memory. The story resists tidy binaries, embracing the paradox that authenticity requires artifice in a broken world.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of artifacts and action: mourning jewelry, origami coordinates, and the withered flower pendant all embody the idea that grief can be worn, not erased. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—“mourning never truly ends—but neither does love”—without moralizing, reweighting every prior image. Subtext thrives in gesture (trembling fingers, parted curtains) and avoids sentimentality by anchoring insight in concrete objects and earned presence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of digital hubris and ancestral wisdom, never stated outright. The cards don’t predict but reveal architecture; the tape measures not length but liminal space between knowledge and understanding. The final image—rain racing down the skylight in branching paths—reweights the entire narrative as a meditation on pattern recognition across generations. No moralizing; instead, resonance through concrete particulars: ink-smoothed cards, coiled tape, grey light on numbered markings.

No moralizing; the complexity of “burden and blessing” remains intact, avoiding sentimentality or false binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: Unbinding isn’t loss but metamorphosis, with hope shedding earthly limits yet risking abstraction.

The river stone’s remembered warmth offers non-literal answer—hope endures through embodied residue, even in unbound states.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the chameleon tail motif: deception, sacrifice, and reconstruction refract through Aldric’s fraud and Mara’s response. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—broken things can be mended “with enough patience and care”—that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (folding the cloth) and image (stars’ indifference as solace). Complexity endures: compassion survives betrayal, but certainty is rightly mourned as a cage.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: coffee rings as calendars, frost as frozen time, scars as love’s archaeology. The central question—“Can wounds be reopened to heal?”—is answered non-literally in the final image: Maya’s palms meet her brother’s, and the hourglass melts, revealing clarity.

Subtext thrives in silence—the ivy’s question, the untouched gloves, the meteor’s hush.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object, method, and setting: some endings require no delivery, only witness.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of time, truth, and textual resistance: justice need not be loud to be unstoppable.

The final image reframes the entire vigil as purposeful, offering a non-literal answer: truth requires only one reader to collapse lies.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through coral’s resilience—not recovery but rerouting—avoiding moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: tradition as living seed, not static relic. The amber embryo and cryptic kite avoid allegory by being materially specific.

    Theme emerges organically: optimism rooted in realism, not denial. The crumpled photograph and cereus bloom reweight each other—the former embodies irreversible damage, the latter fragile persistence.

Subtext operates through silence, snow, and cryogenic stasis—images that accrue resonance without overt allegory. The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question (“What good is preservation if it means keeping silence forever?”) by reweighting silence itself—from tomb to threshold. No moralizing; complexity is preserved through Kira’s credible moral calculus between competing goods (order vs. truth), with lingering ambiguity about consequences.

No thematic echo or sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between observation and action, legacy and integrity. The “orbits of regret” metaphor evolves from cosmic pattern to breakable cycle, and the final image of the city as “an unfinished story” offers a resonant, non-literal answer: truth requires authorship, not inheritance.

Subtext thrives in gaps: missing photos, forbidden edits, suppressed stories.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: grief isn’t silence but untranslated sound, and redemption lies not in erasing loss but in reinterpreting its signal. The final image—mapping constellations across a broken timeline—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: Can guilt be transformed? No moralizing; resonance arises from the amber, the cries, the firmware. Subtext thrives in the insect’s dual temporality (millions of years vs. one night), embodying how trauma collapses time.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s struggle: meaning arises not despite mess but because of it. The closing insight—“order and chaos were the same thing seen from different angles”—is earned through tactile work (mandala, tile resonance), not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: magic as failed performance redeemed through shared witnessing, not success. The tarot coin’s evolution—from tether to infinite web—offers a non-literal answer: despair contains seeds of continuation.

Subtext thrums in the silence between timelines, in the unspoken labor of those who “harvested without depleting.”

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of music, memory, and material residue—how art holds space for what vanishes. The “pixelated amnesty” isn’t stated didactically but demonstrated through the glass flake’s behavior and the fiddler’s response. The ending offers a non-literal answer: forgiveness isn’t wholeness but the willingness to reassemble shattered moments.

The final image (writing for future listeners) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: understanding dawns “across the sky,” not in a lone mind.

The central question—how to hold certainty and doubt simultaneously—resolves not with a moral but through the final image of the lighthouse reframed as a space for questioning. Nuance isn’t preached but practiced: Mara’s “cloak of doubt” enables truth-telling, and vulnerability requires protection to be functional.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.3)
