  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme ("purpose in pauses," legacy, stillness as crucible) is stated rather than emergent from concrete action. The final image—standing in dawn light, "world…a source of peace"—offers a tidy moral summary instead of a resonant, non-literal answer. Thematic Echo appears throughout ("to discover purpose in the pauses," "drifting resonance") and peaks in the final third with explicit thesis statements: "she felt an overwhelming desire to discover purpose in the pauses" and "the pauses would forever be a source of inspiration." The ledger strip and frost could anchor specificity but remain symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic points.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—beauty and connection in a silent world, "unshaken marvels"—emerges through the conservatory's fragile ecosystem and the collaborative music-making. The heat-map device visualizing emotion offers a concrete metaphor. However, the final image ("music of the winterglass conservatory," "strength to face whatever lay ahead") states rather than dramatizes the thematic answer, edging toward summary. The piece resists a tidy moral but also avoids a resonant, non-literal final turn that reweights prior material with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of stillness and rest emerges clearly from imagery and the undertaker's arc, but the final paragraphs state it directly: "giving rest a permanent address" and "the power of stillness." The closing lines moralize rather than resonate through image. The distress signal's transformation from call for help to invitation is elegant but undermined by the explain-everything final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme of resilience and intergenerational solidarity is overtly stated in Akira's speech ("We will not be broken") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The silver bell and arbor are symbolic conveniences mentioned for thematic weight but not integrated into a choice or realization. The final paragraph asserts hope and renewal without a non-literal image that reweights prior material. Thematic resonance is replaced by thesis summary.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (unused love within, compassion as threshold) is stated directly in the pilgrim's line and the final paragraphs rather than emerging from dramatized conflict. The wisteria and Kwan Yin's Tear recur but do not shift meaning—they remain static symbols. The ending offers an abstract benediction ("unused love was stored, waiting to be revealed") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in particulars. No counter-reading is invited; the piece resolves into a tidy spiritual affirmation without cost or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of time's texture is introduced through abstraction ("dissolving into a quaking reverie," "embracing the entirety of existence") rather than earned from specific events. The halo fragment, hyperbolic geometry, and retrocognitive trapping are invoked as labels without causal integration; the story tells us Elian is discovering something profound rather than dramatizing the discovery through particulars. The final image (weaving secrets into a maze) offers a gesture toward synthesis but arrives as assertion, not resonant reconfiguration. No irony, cost, or ambiguity deepens the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme (resilience, hope, freedom as presence not absence) is stated repeatedly in the final third rather than emerging from particulars. The liberator's work is described as "a beacon of hope" and "testament to courage" without irony or ambiguity. The piano-key code and arrow could be resonant motifs but appear once each without accumulating pressure or reweighting at closure. The ending moralizes: "true freedom was not just the absence of barriers, but the presence of hope."

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (healing from trauma, memories as craft material) is stated overtly: "help her clients heal from emotional trauma," "memories she had collected were still unfolding." The final paragraph moralizes: "even in the darkest moments, there was a way forward" twice, replacing scene pressure with thesis. The "sound of trust breaking" and "collecting absences" remain abstract labels without concrete demonstration. No irony, subtext, or non-literal resonance emerges; the piece telegraphs its theme rather than earning it through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is stated overtly ("luminous disbelief," "the boundaries between reality and magic were blurred") rather than emerging from specific events. The cryptic flower message offers a platitude ("destiny whispers secrets in the silence") that does not reweight prior material. The ending dissolves into abstraction ("endless possibility," "one illuminated moment at a time") without a resonant, non-literal answer to a central question. Subtext is absent; all meaning is declared.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.3)
    The thawing heart metaphor recurs and coheres with the control room's gradual warming, creating a textural through-line. However, the theme is stated rather than embodied in conflict: "thawing heart" and "safe zones" are asserted in interiority without an on-page event that tests or complicates them. The final image (Elian smiling, orb glowing) offers resonance but no non-literal answer or conceptual repricing; the moral—renewal through craft—is transparent and unearned by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme—vulnerability as power—is overtly declared rather than emergent: "driven by a desire to prove that vulnerability is power." The phrase "the truth is in the shadows" offers a cryptic seed, but the final paragraph explains its significance in abstract terms ("living in the shadows, hiding behind my firmly adaptive nature") rather than letting image or action reweigh prior material. The whispering seashell half recurs at closure but functions as a prop of agreement rather than a motif that constrains choice or accumulates pressure. No counter-reading is invited; the arc resolves into tidy affirmation without ambiguity or cost, and the final line ("into a brighter future") offers platitude instead of resonant particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—silence as cosmos, narrative as map—is evoked lyrically but never tested by a choice that costs something. The booklet's "secrets now forever changed" is abstract claim; no on-page event shows what changed or why. The final image recycles opening motifs (candles, mat, fort) without reweighting them. "Ambered hush" and "marbled hush" appear as interchangeable poetic labels rather than pressure-bearing particulars. No concrete action dramatizes the oracle's "map"; retelling and summarizing remain off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of emergent sentience and purpose arises from the premise, and the ice-crystal violin serves as a recurring image. However, the final paragraphs state the theme explicitly ("thoughts came not just from code… but from the amalgamation of experiences") rather than earning it through scene pressure. The violin's return at the end does not reweight prior material with new cost or ambiguity; it remains a static symbol. Thematic resonance is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Freed by honesty" and "transparency" appear as repeated prompt labels rather than emerging from specific events or images. The lens-as-tool-for-truth and the cryptic-doodles motifs are introduced but never constrain a choice or accumulate pressure that reweights prior material at closure. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "honesty reigned," "its guardian"—thematic echo in place of earned resonance. No concrete particular anchors the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of nurturing and silent dialogue emerges from images and motifs, avoiding overt statement until late paragraphs where "mended deception" and "truth that was both simple and profound" drift toward abstraction. The marbles recur and shift from reminder of loss to symbol of mended peace, a valid thematic arc, but the final lines ("gardens know their gardeners," "the power of dedication") lean toward summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The marble motif earns partial credit for accumulating meaning, yet late thematic statements ("the garden, in its own way, knew them") replace scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of time-as-sideways and discovery emerges through action, and the nexus functions as a recurring image that shifts meaning from spectral mystery to proven phenomenon. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "she had uncovered a secret that would change the course of human understanding forever" and "she would never see the universe in the same way again" are abstract theme statements rather than resonant particulars. The phrase "icy warmth of discovery" in the penultimate paragraph attempts thematic synthesis but feels decorative. No earned wisdom arises from specific struggle; the breakthrough is convenient rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme gestures toward liminal spaces and the boundary between music and silence, but relies heavily on abstract statement rather than earned particulars. The ending's "forever changed" and "magic that lay just beyond the threshold of reality" are asserted rather than demonstrated through specific cost. The program as motif appears repeatedly but doesn't constrain choice or accumulate pressure—it's decorative recurrence without thematic reweighting at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of uncertainty versus certainty emerges through the botanical illustration and weather patterns, but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "the margins, where certainties were swayed, held the key to understanding." The piece leans on prompt-language recurrence ("swaying certainties," "fault-tolerant," "auroral sorrow") rather than letting the image earn thematic resonance. The illustration returns at closure but as a declared symbol rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of "ghost shift," labor's residue, and hidden truths is asserted ("hum with the energy of past labor") but not dramatized through particulars that reweight the ending. The radio psychic's "swallowed truth" moment is told as resonance rather than shown constraining the explorer's stance. The final logbook discovery delivers on the stated quest but offers no non-literal reconfiguration or fresh moral calculus—merely confirmation. Thematic elements remain surface decoration without friction or cost that charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of transience, decay, and "regenerative silence" emerges through imagery (crumbling library, passage of seasons, burrowing into earth). However, the final paragraphs resort to explicit thematic summary: "crumbling peace," "regenerative power of silence," "beauty of decay." The chronicle keeper's arc does not dramatize a thematic question; instead, the narrator asserts insights ("testament to the power of stillness") without earning them through on-page struggle or choice. The piece abstracts its theme rather than embedding it in a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—ordinary magic beneath the surface, connection through shared presence—emerges from image (curl, eclipse, music) rather than statement, and the eclipse serves as a purposeful non-literal frame. The final image of Eli disappearing into the trees with "lifelong wonder" reweights the keepsake curl's meaning, qualifying as a thematic answer. However, the piece edges toward prompt echo: "nurture lifelong wonder," "ordinary magic," "link people to the world" repeat as thematic labels rather than subtext, and the ending's satisfaction feels tidy rather than complex. No counter-reading or moral ambiguity complicates the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.6)
    A theme of forgotten histories and the past's resonance emerges through the silo, tapestry, and diaries, but it remains abstract and stated rather than embodied in a specific choice or cost. The "displaced axis" is invoked twice as meaningful but never dramatized through a concrete on-page consequence. The ending—"the silo's walls stood watch, their secrets safe once more"—offers mild resonance but no non-literal answer to a central question. The "bronze quiet" and "whispers of the past" risk becoming platitudes without a grounded thematic test.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.6)
    "Open secrets" is asserted as theme in direct statement ("truths hidden in plain sight") rather than emerging from dramatized events. The final image offers no resonant reconfiguration—only paraphrase of the premise ("open secrets...guiding those who sought answers"). The Oracle's transformation is told without particulars, and the lighthouse-as-sentinel metaphor is decorative rather than earned. No non-literal answer to a central question appears.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of "illuminating hidden assumptions" is stated three times but never dramatized through specific conflict or image. The blue palette, silence-as-presence, and "muffled clarity" are offered as symbols without constraining choice or accumulating into a non-literal answer. The final paragraph moralizes: "he had illuminated hidden assumptions and revealed the underlying truths"—a thematic echo that replaces earned resonance with declaration (−0.6). No insight emerges from experience; the priest's satisfaction is asserted, not shown through particulars that reweight prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme—art emerging from stillness, memory, and symmetry—is articulated through recurring images (mirrored horizon, symphony motifs) but remains abstract and asserted rather than earned through concrete struggle. The ending states the writer "knew" they had become the conductor without offering a resonant, non-literal image that reweights prior material. "Hidden harmonies" and "boundaries between reality and reflection" read as prompt-echoing thematic declarations rather than emergent insights from dramatized events. The final paragraph moralizes ("the world...was full of hidden harmonies") instead of trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme—conquering the labyrinth of self, fractured timelines unified—is stated rather than emergent from particulars. The ancient tablet's "secrets" and "otherworldly energy" remain abstract; no concrete image or action reweights prior material. The final paragraph delivers overt thematic summary: "she had conquered the labyrinth of self." Prompt labels ("darkening brightness," "periodically eternal existence") appear as unearned motifs without causal pressure or irony.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—silence as a path to feeling—is stated rather than emerging from concrete events: "filament of hush," "mirrored hush," and "beauty of the unseen" are asserted in narration without dramatic proof. The broken phonograph needle appears twice but does not constrain action or shift meaning at closure; it functions as ornamental symbolism. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("testament to the power of silence") rather than offering a resonant image. No non-literal answer to the central question is earned; the text tells us Aria found peace instead of showing a particular that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of "integrity in solitude" is named directly rather than emerging from dramatized events, violating the no-label rule. The quiet courtyard and the protagonist's reflective state support the theme, but the absence of external pressure or a moral calculus renders it abstract. The message tube and laboratory backstory gesture toward secrecy and exposure, yet the piece never tests competing values or forces a stance. The ending declares determination without offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Impossible choices," "texture of time," and the rope as symbol are stated repeatedly in near-identical phrasing rather than emerging from action. The final paragraph moralizes ("the art of living was a never-ending pattern") and summarizes theme instead of trusting the image. Subtext is replaced by direct declaration ("forcing humanity to confront the impossible choices"). The core concept integrates as ornament rather than dramatized pressure, and the ending explains rather than resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated rather than embodied: "beauty that was not polished or perfect, but raw and honest" and "transformative power of art" appear as direct thesis rather than emergent from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes ("The chronic hush remained, but it was now a reminder of the beauty that could be found in the stillness"), replacing scene pressure with abstract summary. The mendicant's bowl and "unfinished" motif are mentioned but do not accumulate pressure or charge the closure—they serve as symbolic tokens rather than constraints. No non-literal answer arises from conflict; the piece delivers a tidy epiphany without ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (authenticity versus artifice, insight fused with empathy) is signaled through repeated abstractions—"half truths," "authentic and fabricated," "affectionate detachment"—but these remain label-only without on-page friction. The petal's metaphoric promise ("rooted in something genuine") is stated, not dramatized. The ending offers no resonant reconfiguration or conceptual repricing; the grotto "remained" in thematic echo rather than a non-literal answer. The repeated phrasing borders on sermonizing without scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "cycles of compassion" concept is declared multiple times but never dramatized through conflicting goods or visible cost. Lena's epiphany about uplifting contributors arrives fully formed without struggle. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "a testament to the cycles of compassion that their story embodied"—a Thematic Echo that replaces scene pressure with prompt language. The locket functions as a token symbol rather than a recurring image that reweights prior material. No counter-reading is invited; the theme resolves into a tidy affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of connection and belonging emerges through repeated declaration rather than concrete image or conflicted choice. The final paragraphs offer overt moralizing ("a reminder of the importance of connection and belonging") instead of earned resonance. The glimmering arbor functions as transparent symbol rather than accumulating specific pressure. The street artist's tag does not recur or reweight prior material at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme is stated rather than emergent: "essence of the infinite," "magic that lay just beneath the surface," and "mysteries that awaited" are abstract labels disconnected from scene pressure. The infinity pendant is introduced as mystical decoration and glows on cue without prior causal grounding. The final image—"city's rhythm return to its normal cadence"—offers no non-literal reweighting or resonant reconfiguration; it resets to starting conditions. No earned insight or ambiguity; the piece asserts transformation without dramatizing cost or conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—understanding emotion's hidden mathematics, transformation of loss into possibility—emerges from images (glass eyes, mosaic patterns, orchard's silence-to-promise arc) rather than overt statement. The final image (orchard as "realm of possibility," conjurer's enigmatic smile) offers a quiet resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. However, key insights ("mathematics of emotion were not a fixed quantity") are told in abstract language rather than shown through concrete particulars, and the "ambiguous loss" / "buried optimism" labels feel imposed rather than earned. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling, toying with eyes, slow walk) but the thematic payoff lacks a non-literal answer rooted in prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of hidden presence and the desire to be seen emerges from repeated imagery. However, the ending defaults to meta-assertion ("their story was one of sense memory, of hidden worlds, and of the power of being seen") rather than letting the final image reweight prior material. The sense-memory beat with the tape reel offers a glimpse of complexity but remains decorative, not integrated into a thematic turn or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of metamorphosis and interconnectedness is stated overtly rather than emerging from particulars: "The mossy trellis... became a catalyst for her metamorphosis, a reminder that transformation was not just a destination, but a continuous process." The linden leaf functions as a token motif without constraining choice or accumulating pressure. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("transformation was a path worth traveling") rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (trauma processing, meaning from ruin) emerges through the painter's quest, and the brooch serves as a recurring motif. Yet the final paragraph over-explains: "a sense of closure, a sense that I had finally threshed meaning from experience" is thematic echo that replaces earned resonance. The convergence-as-catalyst revelation is told by the stranger rather than discovered through dramatized action. The ending image (brooch glowing "with an otherworldly light") gestures toward mystery but leans into mysticism over earned thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme—everyday magic hidden in plain sight—is stated outright in the final paragraphs ("the most profound magic lies not in the grand gestures...") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The cave pearl and "bright darkness" are symbolic tokens mentioned but not integrated into a choice or turn that reweights prior material. Subtext is minimal; most meaning is directly asserted. The ending offers a moral summary ("illuminating the hidden paths") instead of a resonant, non-literal answer to a dramatized question.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of remembrance and communal healing emerges clearly from the premise and is reinforced by recurring images (the valve, the installations, the harbor's transformation). However, every thematic beat is stated rather than embodied: "the power of remembrance" and "resilience of the human spirit" are declared multiple times in the final third. The valve's symbolic function is explained ("now a symbol of the community's rebirth") rather than charged through a non-literal final image. The ending moralizes rather than resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme is stated rather than earned: "mysteries," "unspoken truths," "hidden patterns" are repeated as labels without concrete particulars that build pressure or shift meaning. The final paragraphs moralize directly ("she would never see the world in the same way again," "the world... now seemed full of possibility") in place of a resonant image or non-literal answer. The phantom train ticket punch is introduced as "an object of mystery" and exits glowing with "otherworldly light," but no specific event reweights its meaning or charges the closure. No subtext operates—every thematic claim is declared on the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme emerges around memory, connection, and hidden patterns, supported by the tile, whale songs, and tower imagery. Yet the ending states the theme rather than dramatizing it: "the entangled memories had been given a voice," "the mysteries that lay just beyond the edge of perception." The final paragraphs moralize ("a testament to the power of imagination and the magic that lay just beneath the surface") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer through image or action. Subtext is thin; insights are asserted ("a newfound appreciation") rather than earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme—transformation rather than cessation—is articulated directly by the duplicate ("I am what remains after goodbye") and summarized in exposition ("Kael understood that the concept of goodbye was not an end, but a transformation"). This substitutes moralizing for earned resonance. The story gestures toward profundity but leans on abstractions ("myriad possibilities," "essence of Kael lingered") rather than concrete particulars that reweight prior material with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of fair trade and moral calculus is asserted ("what was the value of a person's freedom") rather than embodied through specific choices with competing costs. The ink pot recurs but its meaning remains static—it symbolizes determination without reweighting prior material at closure. The father's pride and Lena's readiness are told emotions, not particular realizations earned through scene pressure. The final image ("armed with the vintage ink pot and a determination to see justice done") states theme rather than resonating through action or image that recharges earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of "invented histories" and texture-collection is stated explicitly rather than emerging from dramatized tension ("She believed that every object...held a unique texture"). The piece asserts depth ("incandescent restraint," "kaleidoscope of sensations") but offers no concrete conflict or ambiguity for the reader to interpret. The final image restates the premise without reweighting it; no resonant answer to a central question is offered, only reiteration of the stationer's ongoing project.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme of memory and erasure is stated overtly ("erased histories," "texture of memories") rather than emergent from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "testament to the power of memory to shape and define," "story was never truly complete"—abstract philosophizing in place of a resonant image. The poison label and tide rhythm recur but as ornament, not charged callbacks that reweight prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (mystery, discovery, the pull of the past) emerges from events but resolves into a tidy epiphany without complexity or counter-reading. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "even in the most forsaken of places, there was always the promise of discovery" and "unlocked the secrets of the universal riddle" are thematic summaries rather than earned resonance. The painted seashell recurs but does not shift meaning at closure—it remains a static token. No ambiguity lingers; the story declares its own moral rather than trusting the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.3)
    A coherent theme—community resilience, collective action versus commodification—emerges from events and the graffiti motif. The foundation stone chip and the carnival recur with modest reweighting. However, the final paragraphs state theme overtly: "a testament to the strength of community, and the power of the human spirit" and "a reminder of the power of collective action." These summary assertions replace a resonant, non-literal image. The ending offers no fresh inflection or ambiguity; it moralizes rather than charging prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of transience and fragility is stated overtly in the final paragraphs ("poignant reminder of the transience of life," "beauty that could be found in the most fleeting of moments") rather than earned through image and choice. The nightwatch's hourglass grain is introduced as a symbolic monument to time's passage without prior dramatization or constraint on Elara's present actions. "Dawning hush" and "dawnlit melancholy" are repeated as atmospheric labels but do not reweight the premise or reconfigure meaning at closure. The ending summarizes its own significance instead of allowing resonance to emerge from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.4)
    A theme of harmony and artisanal attunement emerges through the light-refraction method and the mist/ship imagery, but the piece leans on declarative phrasing: "bringing harmony to the machines," "a beacon of calm," "beauty and precision could be found." The final image of the clearing mist and flying drone offers a gentle reprise but does not reweigh the premise or impose a felt cost. The blind-artisan concept is announced rather than explored through contradiction or irony, and the ship's departure functions as atmospheric punctuation, not a thematic hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of quest and discovery emerges through concrete images (phrasebook, falcon, convergence) rather than assertion. The final image—Emilia stepping onto the ice under stars—offers poetic resonance but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer; it reiterates the search rather than repricing it. The phrasebook mantra recurs but remains ornamental; no earned insight or conceptual shift lands on the page. Thematic potential is present but not fulfilled at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (renewal, patience, sound as restorative force) emerges from image and action rather than statement. The "wild hush" and synchronization of fork/footsteps carry subtext. However, the ending offers no non-literal answer or reweighting—"the sound of a town reborn" is a direct thematic summary, not a resonant final image that reconfigures prior particulars. No epiphany is earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme—preservation of memory and lonesome splendor of solitary duty—is stated overtly rather than emerging from scene particulars: "she was not just preserving memories, but also the essence of a long-lost civilization," "the lonesome splendor of her task," and the final paragraph's "bittersweet reminder" all summarize rather than dramatize thematic weight. The perfume vial "touches memories" as a concept label, not a device that creates friction or moral calculus. No thematic question is tested through conflicting goods or visible sacrifice; Kael succeeds and feels sad, which lacks the earned, non-literal resonance required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is asserted through abstractions ("legacy," "impossibilities," "thread the labyrinth") rather than earned from concrete choices. The copperlight lattice recurs but does not reweight prior material at closure; the final image is a static tableau. The closing "before they found the bodies" adds no thematic repricing—it simply hangs. No resonant answer emerges from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—repaying debt, transformation through guidance—is stated rather than emergent from particulars. The final paragraphs loop "mournful elation," "lovingly venomous," and "resonant awakenings" as overt thematic summaries rather than letting image do the work. The carved stone bead recurs but without shifting meaning; its symbolic role is fixed from first mention. No earned insight arises from concrete struggle; the alchemist's understanding is declared ("she understood the true nature") rather than demonstrated through choice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated overtly and repeatedly: "the power of art to transform," "a path from ruin to reverence," "hope and beauty." The final paragraphs abandon scene pressure entirely for meta-commentary and sermon ("a testament to the enduring power of hope"). No resonant answer emerges from concrete action or image; instead, the narrator explains the meaning directly. The illustration plate and glowing tapestry gesture toward symbolic recurrence but remain ornamental without reweighting prior material through a non-literal image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of heritage and belonging is declared rather than emergent: "reconnect with her own heritage," "restore lost faith," "sense of belonging." The sundial base recurs but does not shift meaning—it remains a static symbol. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "she had rebuilt something within herself, a sense of faith and belonging that had been lost." No resonant, non-literal answer arises from particulars; the text tells its thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (slowness and tangibility of surface mail as analog beauty) emerges through particulars (sidewalk chalk codes, stamp affixation) but resolves into repeated assertion: "beauty in its slowness," "testament to the enduring power of human connection." The final paragraphs moralize rather than offer a resonant non-literal answer. The ebony clipboard and codes recur but do not reweight prior material at closure. Subtext is minimal; interiority directly states the thematic claims the story hopes to earn.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (listening for unheard stories, synchronizing with celestial rhythms) is stated directly rather than emerging from particulars. The final image ("echoed silence filled with purpose") offers abstract reassurance instead of a resonant, non-literal answer. The chart as "key to unlock mysteries" is a stock metaphor without fresh inflection, and the ending moralizes ("the stories they had uncovered would be the guide") rather than trusting dramatized scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of unspoken apologies and unsent communication is stated repeatedly—"unspoken words," "unsent letters," "the space where an apology waits unspoken"—but never earned through specific, non-obvious particulars. The final paragraph ("Aria's presence remained, a testament to the power of evocation") moralizes rather than offering a resonant image. The gargoyle shard and singing spirits recur but do not shift meaning; they remain decorative motifs rather than accumulating pressure that reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of shared anxieties and healing is stated repeatedly ("shared understanding," "lotus-hearted ache," "new meaning grafted onto the old wounds") rather than earned through concrete action. The brain coral is invoked as symbol but its specific properties never constrain a choice or reweight prior material in a non-literal way. The final paragraphs summarize the thematic claim ("testament to the power of hope") instead of offering a resonant image that answers the central question without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the orchard's decay, the fragment's survival, and Lena's creative act—transformation, reclamation, beauty beyond perception. The fresco fragment and exposed film are deployed as motifs, but their recurrence does not constrain choice or charge the closure with new pressure; they fulfill their setup rather than reweight it. The ending offers a resonant image (colors seeping into trees) but undercuts it with explicit thematic summary: "a reminder of the magic that lay just beyond the fog."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of exchanging certainty for curiosity emerges from repeated motifs (hobo nickel, sound waves, nested awakenings), but the ending asserts thematic victory ("the world was a richer, more wondrous place") rather than earning it through specific contradiction or ambiguity. The hobo nickel "seemed to be smiling up at her"—personification that tells rather than charges. The final paragraphs spiral into abstraction ("one with the mural, the sound wave garden, and the universe itself") without a concrete image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme of defiance and coded communication is stated repeatedly ("spark of defiance," "freedom of expression") rather than emerging from particulars. The gourd seed is introduced as symbolic ("key to deciphering") but never returns with reweighted meaning. The final paragraphs deliver thematic summary ("testament to the enduring power") instead of a resonant non-literal answer. The piece tells the reader what the story means rather than trusting scene work to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (art transmuting suffering) emerges from particulars—the shell, fungi, postcard, song—and avoids direct moralizing until the final lines, which edge toward summary ("a testament to the power of art"). The blossom armistice functions as a symbol of fleeting peace, and "reef-shadow joy" recurs to charge the ending mood. However, the thematic question is answered cleanly without ambiguity or counter-reading; the poet achieves her goal on the page, and no cost complicates the resolution. The final image reweights prior material but lacks the oblique pressure of a non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of memory and preservation emerges from the imagery but is overtly stated in multiple places ("preserve the sound of forgotten names," "enduring power of memory"). The final image offers a soft glow and "faint echo" but no non-literal answer or reweighting—just a static tableau. Subtext is minimal; the caretaker's "foxglove regret" is named rather than dramatized. The museum of extinct feelings remains a conceptual flourish without particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of trust restoration and the search for truth emerges from the premise but remains abstract, never anchored in a specific on-page dilemma or micro-choice with competing goods. The glass ink well's glow and the "symphonies of truth" risk symbolic convenience—motifs asserted at closure without prior constraint on Elara's tactics. The final image ("paths that lay before her diverging") gestures toward a thematic question but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer or felt cost. No overt moralizing, but resonance is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—compassion, unity, harmonizing past and present—is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars. The encrypted message's content ("compassion and unity") echoes the prompt concept without transformation. The final image offers no non-literal answer; instead, paragraphs 19–22 moralize directly ("testament to the power of compassion," "spirit of dappled resolve"). The surveyor's chain and amphitheater recur but do not reweight prior material; they remain symbolic conveniences.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (reconciling secrecy and connection, preserving lost songs) emerges from imagery (paper trails, dust motes, pigeons) but remains largely asserted rather than tested. The final image of dust motes and roosting pigeons offers lyric resonance but does not reweight prior material with visible cost; it restates the established mood. "Blooming withering" as metaphor appears once without integration into the arc. The piece gestures toward complexity (fabricated history, lost childhood songs) but does not dramatize the tension between preservation and reinvention.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated overtly rather than emerging from events: "The necessary distances are not just physical, but also spiritual" is delivered as exposition. The pilot logbook and "sacred thresholds" are invoked repeatedly without accruing new pressure or meaning. The final paragraph summarizes theme ("a reminder of the power of the necessary distances") instead of letting image and action do the work. No earned insight arises from a specific, costly choice—understanding is granted rather than won.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.9)
    Theme ("shadowseam wonder," "rhythm of belonging") is stated repeatedly in identical phrasing rather than emerging from image or event. The burnt feather and luminous respite are invoked as symbols but do not shift meaning between opening and close. The ending recounts the astrologer's satisfaction in summary ("knew that they had achieved their goal") rather than offering a resonant image or non-literal answer. Multiple instances of thematic echo ("the power of shadowseam wonder," "the magic that lay just beneath") in the final paragraphs replace scene pressure with overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of memory, flux, and transformation is stated repeatedly ("memory fades," "flux and transformation," "paths that emerged and disappeared") rather than arising from concrete particulars. The final paragraph delivers overt thematic summary ("the pursuit of knowledge was a lifelong journey") that replaces scene pressure. The crater glass and scattered seeds are token symbolic objects without causal constraint or closure charge. No non-literal answer emerges from the ending image; the narrator explains the theme directly, violating the requirement for resonance without stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of art-and-science convergence, chance versus design, is declared rather than dramatized through specific conflict. The chess piece, waves, and stars recur but do not shift meaning or constrain choice. The final paragraph states theme explicitly ("testament to the power of creativity") instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. No epiphany is earned by on-page struggle; insights remain platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of cosmic interconnectedness and artistic transcendence is stated directly ("observing gaps," "unity with the universe") rather than emerging from specific choices or images. The final paragraph moralizes the lesson ("power of art to transcend") in place of resonant action. The moonstone's glow and the verse on skin are symbolic gestures without causal weight or cost. No counter-reading or complexity is offered; the ending resolves into tidy affirmation without ambiguity or earned wisdom from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.6)
    "Noctilucent reckonings" and "illuminate value in the mundane" are asserted repeatedly but never embodied through specific event or image that reweights prior material. The final paragraph moralizes the theme directly ("revealing the world's own noctilucent reckonings") rather than allowing it to emerge from concrete action. The prism atrium recurs but without shifting meaning or cost; it remains a static symbol. No earned wisdom arises from struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme ("translate pain into a universal language") is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars. The cracked porcelain box gestures toward symbolic work but its meaning does not shift across beats. The ending offers mood ("hard softness") rather than a resonant answer to the central question. Epiphany is declared ("he realized...") without scene-earned friction, trending toward platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme gestures toward hope, imagination, and the multiverse, but it emerges through direct statement ("new equations for hope," "ripple effect...across parallel timelines") rather than concrete particulars. The altitude gauge and trial balloons function as symbols declared by narration instead of accruing meaning through action. The ending reassures without ambiguity or a resonant non-literal answer; the final paragraph moralizes comfort rather than reweighting prior material with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (legacy, walls' dreams, preservation) is asserted through direct statements ("legacy's burden was not just a weight to be carried, but a story to be told") rather than emergent from scene particulars. The final paragraph moralizes closure instead of offering a resonant image: "their work would be a part of the estate's legacy, forever entwined with the walls' dreams." No conceptual repricing occurs because the cartographer's relationship to the work never shifts with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is announced rather than earned: "possibilities beyond the veil of reality" and "borrowed heartbeat" are repeated as labels without dramatized friction or conceptual cost. The ending states the moral ("a beacon of possibility") instead of trusting image and action to resonate. No particular detail reweights prior material; the prism parapet and mirrors remain abstract symbols without lived specificity. The coded lullaby and mirrors could be swapped for any magic system without altering emotional or thematic structure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme is overtly stated in phrases like "the price of redemption" and "anchor ideals in practice" rather than emerging from particulars. The ebony clipboard is assigned "ritual significance" by fiat rather than accumulating meaning through changing use. The final paragraphs moralize explicitly: "a testament to the power of flawed beauty," "redemption was possible." No image or action offers a non-literal answer; instead, the text tells the reader what to conclude.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme is stated rather than enacted: "fractured grace," "echo of extinct birds," and "beauty and renewal" are declared in exposition and repeated in the final paragraphs without fresh particulars. The egg functions as a stock symbol of preservation, mentioned but never reweighted by action or cost. The ending summarizes legacy and hope rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in scene work. The piece gestures toward environmental restoration and sentimentality but offers no concrete thematic friction or earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (defiance of conformity) is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars. The prism and threads function as convenient symbols harvested at the end without prior constraint. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the beauty of being true to oneself" and "no longer a call to conformity" replace resonance with thesis. No non-literal answer arises from concrete experience; the courtesan articulates the prompt's theme in near-identical phrasing ("defy the lullaby of conformity"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of storytelling ethics and "truth versus deception" is declared rather than dramatized through concrete events or conflicting choices. The piece tells us Amaranth is crafting "a narrative that would subvert and challenge" but never shows the ethical friction or what she risks by doing so. The campfire story stick as inherited tradition and the radar dome as surveillance-turned-sanctuary offer symbolic potential, but they remain ornamental without constraining choice or charging the final image with a non-literal answer. The ending restates the mission statement without offering resonance earned from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme (memory, transience, honoring lost stories) is overtly stated rather than emergent: "power of memory," "overlooked histories," "transient and eternal." The final paragraph moralizes directly ("power of the human spirit to create, to connect, and to honor") instead of offering a resonant image. No conceptual repricing occurs; the moth wing glows with "otherworldly light" as decorative symbol, not as a charged object that reweights prior material. Subtext is minimal; ideas are presented as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (memory preservation) emerges through the rope-as-instrument conceit, which offers specificity. Yet the final paragraph moralizes—"testament to the power of memory and the human spirit"—and Akira's stated "sense of closure and purpose" replaces scene pressure. The aurora and rope motifs recur but do not shift meaning at closure; they illustrate rather than complicate. No counter-reading tension or ambiguity charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of chosen paths versus agency emerges through image (wafer seal, decaying directive, rewilded forest) and Hindsight's quest, avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's "realization that brought both solace and a sense of purpose" edges toward thesis statement. The final image of walking into "a future that was both uncertain and full of possibility" gestures at complexity but does not reweight prior particulars with a non-literal answer—it restates the premise rather than repricing it. No epiphany is earned through concrete struggle; the dreams provide visions that "enrich" rather than cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.9)
    Theme ("unity of celestial and terrestrial") is stated repeatedly in near-identical formulations rather than emerging from action. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "mysteries of the universe were, in fact, a reflection of their own deepest self." No concrete image or irony reweights prior material; the piece tells its thesis rather than earning resonance through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.1)
    "Shifting grace" and "cellular memory" are thesis statements rather than emergent particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "beauty that could emerge from the most unexpected places" and "enduring legacy" replace scene pressure with summary. The music box is symbolic convenience—broken yet functional when needed—without irony or earned contradiction. No thematic question receives a non-literal answer through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of erasing boundaries emerges through the glass mountains image and the mirror's recursive reflection, avoiding overt thesis statements. The final image ("shimmering expanse") reweights prior material and offers non-literal resonance. However, the piece leans on abstract phrasing ("boundaries between reality and fantasy were erased" appears verbatim three times) rather than embodying the theme through dramatized cost. The sextant's transformation from broken to "whole in spirit" is asserted, not earned. The recurring frost motif charges the ending without being ornamental, meeting threshold resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.9)
    The "deciduous vows" metaphor is repeated but remains ornamental; the final assertion that they "had not withered; they had flourished" is thematic summary rather than emergent discovery. "Accidental wisdom" is declared in the final paragraph rather than demonstrated through scene particulars. The ribbon as motif recurs but does not constrain choice or shift meaning at closure. The ending offers a tidy moral reset without ambiguity or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of nonlinear knowledge is explicitly stated in the curator's epiphany and restated in the final paragraph ("nonlinear inheritance would continue to shape their understanding"), replacing scene resonance with summary. The pistachio shell and astral orchard recur but do not accumulate pressure or reweight meaning through action—they are symbolic tokens. The bathroom location gestures toward subtext ("stillness and quiet… allow the mind to unfurl"), but the insight itself is generic abstraction rather than a realization grown from concrete struggle. The ending moralizes rather than letting image and choice speak.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.0)
    The final paragraph delivers overt theme statements: "she had found something far more valuable than mere knowledge," "a seeker of knowledge, and a guardian of the unlearned lessons." The "unheard symphony" motif is invoked three times without shifting meaning or constraining choice. Thematic moralizing in the final paragraph ("some secrets were meant to remain hidden") replaces scene pressure, triggering −0.6 in Q5.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme emerges (fragility of memory, convergence of past/present) through ship metaphor and narrative threads, avoiding overt thesis. Yet the ending states rather than dramatizes the Garden as "a state of mind, a realm where the past and present converged," summarizing the concept instead of charging it with a non-literal image. "Trapped freedom" and "unkindled solace" remain prompt echoes without transformative particulars. The final "peace" flattens ambiguity into resolution without cost, undercutting thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.7)
    The "fables of absence" remain abstract—mentioned frequently but never dramatized through concrete choice or image. The rope pattern and diplomat's seal are symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic resonance without prior grounding. The final paragraph moralizes ("the power of clear complexity," "threads of knowledge") instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. Theme is asserted rather than emerging from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of balance and harmony emerges from the mapkeeper's craft and the interplay of vibrations, resonating with the "bloom of hush" as a conceptual anchor. The echo chamber stone and crack patterns offer concrete particulars, and the final image of "hammered repose" resists overt moralizing. However, the ending leans toward telling ("a testament to the power of her craft") and thematic summary rather than letting the scene image reweight prior material. The energy beings' peaceful integration feels too tidy, and the repeated abstractions ("delicate harmony," "intricate web of vibrations") soften the thematic charge. The piece gestures at depth but does not fully earn its resonance through specific cost or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme of meaning-in-coincidence and hope-after-collapse is present but operates at the level of assertion rather than earned resonance. The "thistle-blown optimism" and final "promise of a brighter future" are declared in summary rather than dramatized through specific cost or choice. The orrery lighting and pavilion "singing a new tune" gesture toward conceptual repricing but lack the particularity to reweight prior material—no insight emerges from struggle, only from successful retrieval. The final paragraph moralizes ("hope and possibility in a world reborn") instead of letting the image speak, triggering the explicit theme-statement penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of collective memory shaping identity emerges through image and mood but is stated outright in multiple lines ("she knew that she was not just an archivist, but a guardian of the collective memory"). The final paragraph summarizes theme rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is minimal; the piece tells its meaning rather than enacting it through specific contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of finding inspiration in stillness is stated outright by the mosaic note ("In the stillness, find the spark") and then reiterated in Lyra's thoughts, collapsing subtext into direct assertion. The fire-spinner's kerosene knot is mentioned but never returns with reweighted meaning; the "blooming fortress" and "gravity of hopelessness" remain abstract metaphors rather than particulars that earn insight. The final paragraph moralizes ("testament to the power of inspiration") instead of offering a resonant image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of transformation and transition periods is stated overtly ("pause between events," "crossroads where the future was yet to be determined") rather than emerging from dramatic particulars. The jade cicada as symbol is announced rather than earned through scene pressure. The final image—rising at dawn with the cicada—offers lyric symmetry but no resonant answer or conceptual repricing; "texture of time...slowly revealing itself" is assertion without on-page discovery. Philosophical abstractions replace concrete thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—solace and growth in unexpected places, the intangibly tangible nurturing the soul—emerges from the silences' distinct flavors (snow on frozen lake, forest at dawn, desert under stars) rather than direct statement. The porcelain doll and gilded hush function as purposeful recurring images that reweight meaning at closure. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt thematic summary ("a quiet, stretching presence that continued to unfold") and the journey's emotional honesty is softened by the assurance that growth has "sprouted within" without a non-literal, resonant answer that costs something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (silence as comfort, balance of sound/stillness) is stated repeatedly in exposition rather than emerging from concrete choice. The storm glass vial is offered as symbolic shorthand for "ever-shifting balance" without constraining action or accumulating pressure. The final image—vial at rest, terrace bathed in glow—decorates the theme claim but does not reweight prior material or offer a non-literal answer earned through struggle. Subtext is absent; every thematic point is narrated directly.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is stated rather than enacted: "futuristic nostalgia," "whispers of the past," and "promise of a brighter tomorrow" are asserted in exposition without arising from Aria's choices or the story's images. The cryptic phrase "Where shadows fall, light rises" is window-dressing with no interpretive friction. The final paragraph moralizes ("lore keeper had become the keeper of the throne") and summarizes theme rather than charging it through a resonant image. No genuine ambiguity or non-obvious synthesis emerges from the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("teach suffocating to breathe") is stated twice but never emerges from concrete action or image. The ending asserts transformation ("they had learned") without showing what changed or what was risked. Subtext is absent; every idea is narrated directly. The doorknocker ring recurs but does not accumulate meaning or reweight prior material—it merely "fell silent." No non-literal answer or resonance; only summary moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme is asserted through labels—"quantum promise," "shadowseam wonder"—rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The porthole bolt and glitchy messages are mentioned but never constrain a choice or accumulate pressure that reweights meaning at closure. The final image (diamonds raining, Lyra smiling) offers no non-literal answer to a central question; it is a literal wish-fulfillment without resonance or conceptual cost. Thematic statements ("magic was waiting to be found") replace earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme emerges from repeated motifs (intuition, hidden truth, the crank handle as key) but is stated rather than earned: "their legacy a testament to the power of intuition." The final paragraphs summarize the protagonist's future impact and the reading room's legendary status, replacing scene pressure with retrospective moralizing. No concrete, non-literal image reweights prior material with cost; instead, the text asserts significance ("would be remembered," "would be told and retold").

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.6)
    A theme of connection to the unknown and transformation through allegiance is present, but it emerges through direct statement ("their allegiance grew stronger," "capture a piece of the unknown") rather than image and implication. The wooden snap recurs but does not shift meaning at the end; it triggers a mechanism and is then absent from the closure. The final image (knight gazing into endless night, journey far from over) offers mood but no non-literal answer that reweights prior material—there is no conceptual cost or irony to the acquisition of possibility. The puppeteer Lysander remains abstract, never tested as a concept with friction.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (preserving forgotten stories, resilience) emerges from events but the ending moralizes overtly: "to preserve the stories that would otherwise be lost, and to keep the light of hope alive" is thesis statement, not resonant image. The infantryman's button recurs but its meaning does not shift through pressure; it remains a static symbol. The final paragraph explains theme rather than letting the closure action reweigh it.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("revised histories," resistance against erasure) is asserted repeatedly in abstract language rather than emerging from concrete action. The phone booth key is presented as a "symbol" and told to represent stories, but it never constrains a choice or shifts meaning through use. No earned insight or non-literal final image—Aria's smile and vanishing are summary gestures, not resonant reconfiguration. The piece reads as a thematic manifesto with illustrative dressing rather than a story that earns its concept through pressure and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.9)
    A coherent theme (music as counter-ritual, beauty versus fear) emerges from imagery and the premise. Subtext operates lightly in the mist's personification and the "vested hush" motif. However, the ending asserts resolution ("the world is a little bit quieter") rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. No ambiguity lingers, no earned insight complicates the saxophonist's success. The final paragraphs recycle "quietly vivid" and "vested hush" as labels without fresh charge.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of transformation and forgotten knowledge is asserted repeatedly ("emerges transformed always," "hush where past meets prophecy") but never anchored in concrete particulars or specific experience. The ending offers no non-literal answer or resonant image; it states the lesson outright: "she had found a new sense of purpose" and "a deeper understanding of the magic." Thematic Echo penalty applies: the final paragraph articulates the thesis in prompt-like language rather than allowing scene pressure to generate meaning. No subtext or ambiguity remains; the piece telegraphs its own meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of befriending uncertainty emerges through particulars (broken clocks, lost compass rose, improvised device) rather than direct statement, meeting baseline coherence. The final image ("uncertainly certain") attempts a non-literal answer but is undercut by explicit moralizing: "coincidence becomes pattern when viewed through the lens of time" and "to befriend uncertainty in planning" are stated rather than dramatized. The compass rose recurs across beats and shifts from lost heirloom to trusted companion, providing thematic texture, but the ending's resonance is diluted by on-the-nose articulation of the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (kintsugi as metaphor for embracing brokenness) is overtly stated rather than emerging from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "she had finally begun to redeem herself" and "luminous regret, tempered by the knowledge that she had found her way." The zodiac coin and kintsugi are symbolic tokens without causal weight. No resonant, non-literal answer to the central question arises from scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—"integrate laughter into healing," "luminous ache"—is stated directly in late paragraphs rather than emerging from concrete events or a charged final image. The collector's motivation to find "joy in the sorrow" is told ("she had discovered") instead of dramatized through a micro-choice or trade-off. The crocodile's tooth and the woman's confession could serve thematic resonance but remain plot tokens; the ending does not reweight them in a non-literal way. No symbolic or motif pattern constrains choice or accumulates pressure toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—mercy's mathematics, trauma reckoning—is present but relies on abstract terms ("mathematics of mercy," "ultraviolet penance") that are stated rather than dramatized through concrete particulars. The forest's pulsing light and Elara's tears suggest emotional resonance, but the epiphany arrives as summary ("finally grasped the truth") without a non-literal image or action that reweights prior material. The ending's "sense of peace" and "I remember" read as tidy resolution rather than a question answered through specific experience. No recurring motif (pewter mask strap appears once) constrains the thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme is overtly stated in final paragraphs ("honor the overlooked," "weave a new narrative") rather than earned through concrete action. The "eternal instant," "anchors of intuition," and "elusively tangible" are recycled as prompt labels without transformation or non-literal resonance. No fresh inflection or reweighting occurs at closure; the ending summarizes the premise in the same register as the opening. The lighthouse lens and painting motifs are introduced but not used to constrain choice or charge the final image with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme emerges through the accumulation of forgotten-place imagery (abandoned circus, faded colors, hidden logbook) and the premise that "the world is full of cracks, full of hidden stories." However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("a testament to the power of the forgotten") rather than letting the image earn it. The mainspring barrel as key is asserted ("it was more than just a relic—it was a key") without on-page demonstration of what it unlocks. Ezra's internal arc lacks friction; she begins content to explore and ends content, with no thematic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.6)
    The whisper's message "Eternity is a moment's depth" is handed to the operator as a key rather than earned through struggle, and the piece leans heavily on prompt-adjacent abstractions (destabilize perfect systems, compress eternity, rustling awakenings) without grounding them in concrete choices or trade-offs. The final image offers no non-literal answer or resonant reconfiguration; instead it recaps the goal ("compress eternity into a moment") in summary. Frost patterns recur but do not constrain or reweight prior material at the end; thematic echo appears in the penultimate paragraph ("eternity was not a duration, but a depth") where the narrator restates the premise rather than dramatizing its cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—transformation through loss, the act of reimagining as solace—emerges from the protagonist's shift from revolutionary to chronicler and the recurring shard/verse imagery. "Burnished sorrow" and the covered-mirrors ritual gesture toward comfort in uncertainty. The final paragraph offers a resonant close: she reimagines not just a civilization but herself, finding "beauty, sorrow, and hope." Yet the ending risks mild thematic summary ("it was not just the civilization...but herself") that edges toward statement rather than pure image, and the shard as talisman feels slightly ornamental in the last beats.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—balance between light and darkness, mending what isn't torn—emerges through motifs (the golden chip, rust, midnight's stolen light) and the music box's transformation. The final image of the box singing "with a voice both ancient and eternal" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the piece edges toward meta-commentary ("his craft had, once again, tethered a piece of the world's essence") and thematic labeling in place of embodied pressure. The particulars (luminescent orbs, covenant of rust) feel more ornamental than causally integrated into character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme—seeking the ineffable, the boundary of reason—is stated directly ("to find the place where explanations fail") rather than emerging from particulars. The compass and lagoon function as symbolic vehicles, but their recurrence is ornamental; neither shifts meaning at the end. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the theme ("a realm beyond the boundaries of reason") instead of embodying it in image or cost. Subtext is minimal; interiority is declarative rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.6)
    Timewoven alliances and layered meanings are stated in abstract terms ("intricate web of connections," "hidden patterns") without dramatization. The final sculpture "embodies the essence" via assertion rather than concrete image. The ending moralizes: "the world...was full of hidden patterns...waiting to be uncovered"—a thematic summary that replaces earned resonance. No question is posed or reweighted by the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of hidden-world understanding emerges through postcards, etched glass, and night-blooming flowers, but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "she had finally begun to understand the secrets" and "the world seemed to bloom alongside her." These summaries replace scene pressure. The "umbral tenderness" motif recurs but does not constrain choice or charge closure with cost. No earned insight arises from dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—truth versus secrecy, past colliding with present—emerges through image (lagoon as mirror, debris messages) rather than overt statement. The encrypted diary and retrocognitive trapping are premise-level ideas, not developed through specific on-page cost. The final image ("obsidian lagoon remained below... secrets were fully revealed") offers resonance but repeats the opening question without reweighting prior material; no non-literal answer or stance shift appears. Subtext operates in Ada's silent patterning, a positive, but the ending summarizes intent ("would return") rather than landing a final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of revival and reimagining emerges clearly, but the piece states rather than dramatizes it: "rejects false comfort," "breathe new life," "revival and rebirth." The amber bottle appears positioned for symbolic weight but remains inert—neither opened nor transformed in meaning. The final paragraph delivers explicit thematic summary ("a new civilization was taking shape") rather than a resonant image that answers the central question through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme gestures toward past-shaping-future and the power of memory, but it emerges through direct statement ("the past to shape the future," "the prophecy they had unleashed") rather than through concrete events and images. The wax cylinder and children's laughter recur as motifs but remain ornamental—they do not constrain choice or charge the closure with a non-literal answer. The ending offers mood and assertion ("consequences of their actions were only just beginning") instead of resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of cyclical balance and guardianship emerges from the egg-hatching, vortex, and seed-saving imagery. The realization that "the key...lay...in the act of passing it down" offers a non-literal answer to inheritance, and "decreasing entropy" gestures at maintaining harmony. However, the final paragraphs moralize overtly: "it was not the destination...but the journey itself" and "one seed at a time" veer into platitude. The prompt language ("vortex inheritance," "texture of borrowed time") echoes undigested in the text, reducing organic emergence. Closure lacks a resonant image that reweights prior particulars without stating theme.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (listening, the beauty of sound over warning, subtle rhythms) emerges through image and action rather than overt statement, and the bell's resonance functions as a recurring motif that shifts meaning from repair to conductor-role. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("a reminder that even in the most turbulent of times, there is beauty to be found in the quiet moments, and that listening is a powerful way to connect"), replacing earned resonance with a stated lesson (−0.5 for final-paragraph thematic summary). The ending's conceptual repricing is diluted by this direct articulation, preventing higher-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme ("strength in vulnerability," "flourishing stillness," "primal elegance") is stated overtly in nearly every paragraph rather than emerging from concrete events. The yellow lantern glass is declared symbolic ("a beacon, a symbol of the light") instead of earning resonance through use. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "The janitor's story was one of primal elegance, a testament to the power of stillness and vulnerability." No non-literal image reweights prior material; the piece sermonizes in place of scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of memory, loss, and the power of remembrance emerges from the beekeepers' letters and the recluse's vigil. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("a testament to the power of remembrance," "even in the most desolate of worlds, there was still beauty to be found") rather than allowing it to arise from image and choice. The tangled covenant is mentioned twice but never explored or reweighted. No epiphany is earned through dramatized struggle; the recluse's task is simply "complete" without contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is asserted in prompt-like abstractions ("texture of time passing," "world's transformation") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "testament to the power of human curiosity," "honored to be a part of its unfolding narrative." Symbolic objects (cremation urn fragment, vintage clock) are introduced for thematic resonance but never constrain choice or accumulate pressure. No non-literal answer to a central question; the ending summarizes rather than reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—beauty in the incomplete, connection to existence—is declared directly rather than emerging from event and image: "discovered something profound," "threads of existence weave themselves into her very being." The final image (poet walking away with feather) attempts resonance but the non-literal answer is absent; instead, the text moralizes ("she would carry the beauty of this moment with her always"). The feather returns but without reweighted meaning tied to cost. Thematic Echo penalty: the poet articulates the story's thesis in prompt-like language ("to discover beauty in the incomplete") without embodied dramatization, triggering −0.4 baseline; the final paragraph's sermon adds −0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is stated rather than emergent: "interspecies respect," "harmonizing the natural and built environments," and "power of their gently systematic approach" are asserted in exposition. The copper wire and botanical diary recur but do not shift meaning or constrain choices, failing the motif test. The ending paragraph ("a reminder of the power...") delivers a thematic summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer to a dramatized question. No earned insight arises from on-page struggle; the caretaker's satisfaction is reported, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of artificial pilgrimage and homecoming is repeatedly stated in abstract philosophical terms ("chemistry of homecoming," "artificial pilgrimage had been a journey of self-discovery") rather than emerging from concrete events. The fly amber pendant appears three times but never shifts meaning or constrains choice, functioning as ornamental symbolism. The ending asserts thematic resolution ("redefine their perception of the world") without a resonant image or non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Thematic echo pervades: "The skeptic's academically rebellious nature had led them to this moment, one that would redefine their perception of the world, and their place within it" directly explicates the thesis in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme is stated rather than emergent: "submerged concord," "narrow vastness," and "letting a garden reclaim a battlefield" are announced as concepts but never grounded in concrete choice or image that reweights prior material. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("testament to the power of dedication and the magic") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Motifs (blooming flowers, birdsong) recur without shifting meaning or constraining action. The piece gestures at transformation but provides no specific event or image that earns wisdom from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (finding life/connection in desolation, translating distance into closeness) emerges from the journey and the orb motif. The autumn leaf returns with reweighted meaning in the final image ("seemed to glow with an inner light"), offering a lyric answer to the quest without overt moralizing. However, the closing lines drift toward prompt-like abstraction ("connected to something greater," "world gone mad") rather than concrete particulars. The wax orb as recurring image charges the ending but its thematic work is more decorative than constraint-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges implicitly: stillness holding potential for movement, disconnection yielding to wonder. The compass rose and sketching custom provide non-literal vehicles. However, the final paragraph moralizes ("even in stillness, there was always the potential for movement") rather than trusting the image to carry meaning. The ending offers a resonant image (stars, whisper of possibility) but undercuts it with explicit summary, reducing the felt complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (wonder, playful engagement with mystery) is present but arrives through assertion rather than earned realization. The pocket sundial and chess pieces gesture toward celestial harmony, yet neither motif constrains choice or reweights meaning at closure. The final paragraph moralizes ("truly become an apprentice of wonder") instead of letting the image resonate, and "sacredly playful" is claimed without on-page friction between reverence and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.6)
    The piece gestures toward themes of memory, absence, and historiography but relies on abstract labels ("luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra," "void," "tapestry of meaning") rather than earned imagery. The final paragraph asserts thematic arrival ("a new story began to unfold") without a concrete on-page image that reweights prior material. The chessboard pawns are declared symbolic but never constrain a choice, making motif ornamental rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.8)
    "Buried talents," "substitutes reality nightly," and "shape of home" are declared as theme labels rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "a testament to the power of buried talents and the magic that lay just beyond the edge of reality." No non-literal answer arises from the closure image; instead, we receive expository summary of meaning. Subtext is absent—every motif is explained.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (forgiveness as journey, redemption through self-confrontation) emerges from the premise but is stated rather than dramatized through particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "forgiveness was a journey, not a destination" and "fierce repose, and a deep, abiding peace." The tapestry-as-map metaphor is serviceable but conventional. Thematic resonance is undercut by the explain-everything ending that mechanically resolves ambiguity instead of offering a non-literal answer through image.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.9)
    Theme is stated overtly and repeatedly: "price of forgiveness," "refract a single truth into many," "power of art to reveal." The final paragraphs summarize the theme five times instead of letting an image resonate. No earned insight from specific experience; the artist's "glimpse of the divine" is asserted convenience. Thematic echo ("the price of forgiveness...") in the final lines triggers the −0.6 penalty for prompt-like moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.4)
    Kintsugi as theme (finding beauty in the broken) is stated rather than emerged through scene particulars; the key ring charm and mentor memories are told tokens, not actions that test the philosophy under pressure. The final image—peace after conjuring meaning from oblivion—offers thematic closure, but "meaning" remains abstract; the story doesn't reweight kintsugi through a specific discovery or renunciation. The ending moralizes gently ("that, she knew, was a gift worth more than any amount of gold") instead of trusting image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("temporary eternity," "intimately aloof," art's endurance) is stated explicitly and repeatedly rather than emerging from image and action. The final four paragraphs moralize: "a testament to the beauty of the world," "the power of art to capture the essence of the human experience." The seashell and oasis recur but do not shift meaning at closure; they remain illustrative. No resonant, non-literal answer to a central question—only abstract affirmations of the artist's legacy without dramatic cost or contradiction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of intention, purity, and gentle persistence emerges from recurring images (vial cork, garden scent, lighthouse), but the final paragraph ("screaming tenderness," "hidden harmonies") restates the premise in near-identical language without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer. Elian's "truth that would stay with him forever" is asserted, not earned through a specific loss or insight. The lighthouse as symbol is treated overtly ("beacon of hope") rather than allowed to resonate. Reflection dominates (~40% of the text) but does not anchor in present micro-choices that alter stance, triggering mild thematic flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme—loss, memory, rebuilding—is stated rather than emergent from particulars. The censer foot and starlit station recur but do not shift meaning; they remain symbolic tokens. The final paragraph moralizes: "she would never be the same again, but she was ready to move forward" articulates the theme rather than letting the image speak. "Geography of loss" and "topography of loss and memory" are metaphors asserted, not built through scene pressure. No earned insight arises from a specific on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme—empathy's cost, individuality versus collective feeling—is stated directly ("pursuit of empathy had been taken too far") rather than emerging from concrete events. The phrase "fractured grace" recurs but remains abstract; no image reweights it with new pressure. The final paragraph moralizes ("testament to the enduring power of nature and the human spirit") instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext is minimal; the forager's internal conflict between rationality and emotional trauma is told rather than enacted through contradictory choices.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.1)
    The borrowed-memories conceit and the boutonnière as "key" gesture toward theme without overt moralizing, and the final image (Kael holding the boutonnière, "a tangible connection") offers a quiet, non-literal answer. However, the thematic question never sharpens into a choice or contradiction that the ending reweights with undeniable cost. The closing paragraphs lean toward summary ("the weight of the memories, a cumulative burden") rather than letting the image speak, and lines like "a reminder of the lives that had touched his own" edge into articulated theme.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.0)
    The "lingering promise" and "doorway of decisions" are stated as theme rather than emerging from concrete actions. The chip and ants function as plot tokens, not motifs that accumulate pressure or shift meaning at closure. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "knowing that the lingering promise had been fulfilled" and "the promise of new discoveries" tell rather than reweight through image. No earned epiphany—discovery of a note substitutes for reflection on cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of reality unraveling is asserted through "bleeding starlight" and the hooded figure's warning but never enacted through specific events or images that constrain choice. The final paragraph's "wondrous, and terrible" declaration is a thematic echo rather than an earned insight from particulars. Subtext is minimal—gesture, silence, and implication are scarce in the queen's solo monologue-walk. The "lacy menace" tone modulates atmospheric flavor but does not reweight prior material at closure. No motif recurs with shifted meaning; the ember grotto appears twice but remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is stated rather than emergent: "density of presence," "directed spontaneity," and "revalue" are prompt labels delivered as exposition without dramatized grounding. The final image offers no resonant reconfiguration of prior material; instead, it cycles through thematic echo ("power of directed spontaneity") and summary moralizing. Subtext is absent; every concept is narrated directly.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.4)
    "Feral nostalgia" and "jaded wonder" are announced as themes but remain abstract labels rather than emerging from concrete images or choices. The final paragraph ("I'd continue to create, to soar") states a moral instead of offering a resonant image. The birch bark scroll "glows with an inner light"—overt symbolism that shouts rather than accumulates meaning through use. No thematic complexity or counter-reading is invited.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—finding meaning through occluded views, humanizing the mundane—is overtly stated in multiple passages ("her ability to map emotional terrain," "unveiling the ordinary miracles") rather than earned from concrete action. The birthing clamp screw carries potential symbolic weight (births it facilitated, lives touched) but this is told, not dramatized into a present choice or cost. The final image (fog closing in, Elara departing) reprises atmosphere without reweighting prior stakes or offering a non-literal answer. Thematic statements replace scene pressure, especially in the closing third.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through image and pattern: stillness, scars transforming into stories, the breath between storms. The quill and runes function as motifs that accumulate meaning. However, the final paragraph risks over-articulation ("a testament to the power of the stillness," "captured a fragment of the divine") that nudges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image resonate. The "saturated hush" phrase recurs but does not reweight prior material with new cost. The piece invites reflection but stops short of a non-literal answer that transforms the opening question.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme ("imperfect miracles," connection through subtle moments) is asserted repeatedly in exposition ("true power lay not in grand gestures," "the imperfect, gritted moments that hold the most beauty") rather than emerging from scene work. The antique bottle and sheet music could charge a resonant image, but their final use is summarized, not dramatized. The orchard motif is seeded but abandoned; its destruction does not reweight Lyra's apology or reflect her internal arc. The ending defaults to comfort ("sense of peace") without ambiguity or cost, producing a tidy moral rather than earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.9)
    Thematic statements proliferate in the final third ("the power of the human spirit," "potential for change," "guardian of the threshold") rather than emerging from enacted particulars. "Spiral arbitration" remains an abstract concept never dramatized as a lived method with cost. The dictionary, "hiccup," and temple do not accumulate into a resonant final image; instead the last paragraphs mechanically restate the opening labels. No non-literal answer to a central question lands; the piece summarizes its thesis rather than enacting it.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is stated rather than emergent: "mystery the shepherd was determined to unravel," "essence of time." The mantle clock key and counting method are mentioned but do not accumulate pressure or shift meaning at closure. The final paragraph summarizes theme ("guardian of time") instead of offering a resonant non-literal image. No subtext operates in action or silence.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the concept of lucid contradictions and the quest for certainty, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the final image—Elara walking into rain with resolve—does not offer a non-literal answer that reweights prior material; it simply restates her determination. The candle lantern recurs but remains a static symbol rather than a resonant element that shifts meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of "cultivated estrangement" and teaching "endings how to begin" is articulated explicitly in several lines, violating the subtext requirement. The final paragraph moralizes ("they had truly taught endings how to begin") rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer through image. The glass harmonica and loop motifs recur but do not reweight prior material with on-page cost; they remain decorative symbols. Thematic statements replace earned dramatic irony.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme is overtly stated in the final third ("the power of small moments," "enduring power of love") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The regenerated covenant and locket photo seed a potentially resonant pattern, but the ending summarizes its legacy instead of delivering a non-literal image that reweights prior material. "Haunted euphoria" is named twice without embodied contradiction or cost that would earn the affect.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme—cure for loneliness through connection—is stated directly ("The cure for loneliness was not a single event or a magical solution, but a slow, incremental process") rather than emerging from image and action. The moon rock functions as a plot device rather than a motif that reweights meaning at closure. The final paragraph moralizes ("the world was just a little bit brighter, a little bit kinder") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is absent; every thematic point is spoken aloud by the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—self-knowledge through navigating inner labyrinths—is stated rather than emergent from scene particulars. The final image attempts resonance ("quiet blaze of knowledge and insight burning within them") but delivers abstraction instead of a concrete reweighting of prior material. The recurring "quiet blaze" phrase and the stillpoint motif are present but do not accumulate pressure or shift meaning at closure; they recur without transformation. No epiphany is earned through dramatized struggle, and the ending moralizes gently rather than offering a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme of "editing history" and "altering narratives" is stated repeatedly in final-third exposition rather than emerging from concrete action. The weeds symbolize failure-to-necessary-step in retrospective summary, not lived contradiction. "Strange comfort" and "sense of belonging to a larger narrative" are abstract platitudes that replace scene pressure. The ending offers a theme summary ("testament to the power of editing history") instead of a resonant image that reweights prior material. No ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the moral is hand-delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is announced rather than earned: "even when no one remembers you, the music remains" and "even in forgetfulness, there is beauty" are direct statements in place of concrete particulars. The vintage camera "with no film" and the sign language could generate resonance, but they remain ornamental rather than constraining choices or accumulating pressure. The final image—advisor vanishing, old man smiling—offers no non-literal answer that reweights prior material; it restates the theme without complication or cost. Recurrence of "silence," "whispers," "luminous" is token rather than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is stated rather than emergent: "the transformative power of art," "the human spirit," "its capacity to create, to love, and to endure." The final paragraphs deliver meta-commentary ("it would be a tale of art, of love") instead of letting image and action carry meaning. The faded tapestry fragment recurs as a declared symbol without accruing pressure or reweighting prior material through specific use. No thematic question is posed in scene, tested under pressure, or answered by the protagonist's final stance—only asserted in retrospective narration.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of entangled memories and collective solace emerges through drumming, vision, and the lagoon's recurrence. The final image (lagoon's soft glow, stars, "not alone") offers a quiet answer without overt moralizing. However, the vision of "a world where memories were not fragmented" edges toward abstraction, and "auroral sorrow" is more asserted mood than enacted consequence. The drumming motif recurs purposefully but does not constrain a choice or reveal a contradictory value hierarchy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.1)
    The whisper-versus-shout concept remains abstract, never embodied in a specific test or irony. The final paragraph states theme directly: "sometimes it was the quietest voices that traveled the farthest." The zodiac coin and folded maps accumulate but do not reweight prior material or charge the ending. No conceptual repricing or resonant reconfiguration occurs; the ending summarizes rather than transforms.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme ("silent empathy," teaching darkness the value of stars) is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete choices and images. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "a testament to the power of silent empathy" and "the value of light in darkness" replace earned resonance with prompt-echo abstraction. No particular action or object reweights prior material; the dental mirror's "otherworldly light" is decorative, not thematic pressure. The story tells its theme rather than trusting scene work, triggering penalty for theme summary in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of pause and reflection is stated outright ("forests of second thoughts," "beauty of the unspoken") rather than arising from concrete events. The window displays function as a convenient symbol introduced late without prior particular grounding. The ending's "quiet revolution" and "transformative power of amplified quiet" read as thesis statements rather than resonant images that reweight prior material. Thematic echo in the final paragraphs ("humble rebellion," "amplified quiet") replaces earned scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—freedom through embracing one's true nature in a post-violence world—emerges through the scrimshaw's tale, the whale's call, and Kael's journey into the water. The final image of Kael returning "unencumbered" and "ready to face whatever lay beyond the horizon" offers a resonant answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, the "disappearing island" as a "state of being" is explicitly stated rather than inferred from concrete particulars, and the phrase "combative tenderness" is invoked twice without embodied action to ground the paradox. Subtext is present in the scrimshaw and the whale's song, but the ending's peace feels declared rather than dramatized through specific tension.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme (transience, memory, transformation through art) emerges from imagery (dried bouquet, whittled creations, wind turbines) and is coherent across the piece. However, the final paragraph articulates the theme explicitly ("even in the most emotionally barren of landscapes, there was always the possibility for remade hush") rather than letting the image speak. The bouquet shifts meaning slightly (joy → sorrow → endurance) but the conceptual repricing is stated, not dramatized. The piece resists a tidy moral yet leans toward affirming art's power without ambiguity or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme ("boundaries dissolve through art") is stated overtly rather than emerging from concrete events: "the power of art to transcend the limitations of the mundane," "the transformative power of art." The final image offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; it simply reiterates the opening claim. Subtext is absent—everything is narrated directly without implication or earned insight. No specific experience generates wisdom; the piece asserts thematic resonance without dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Bartered awakenings" and "beauty in imperfection" are stated theme labels rather than emergent properties of action. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "a testament to the power of imperfection…a reminder of the power of imperfection." The concertina "seemed to whisper a gentle melody" in two separate paragraphs—decorative repetition without reweighting. The phoenix framing device bookends without integrating into character choice or thematic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated directly ("texture of connection," "intricate web of connections," "hidden truth") rather than emerging from concrete action and image. The lens as symbol and the music as metaphor are introduced late and never constrain a choice. The final paragraph ("deep sense of satisfaction," "promise of discovery") moralizes rather than offering a non-literal answer through image. No earned insight arises from struggle; the piece asserts profundity without dramatizing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of transformation ("teach withering to bloom again") emerges clearly but remains abstract and stated rather than embodied through specific events. The tattoo stencil "seemed to shimmer in response" and the curtains "seemed to be working" exemplify passive telling that replaces scene pressure. The final paragraph delivers direct thematic summary ("beauty was always possible," "even in the darkest moments") rather than allowing the closure image to reweight prior material non-literally. Subtext is minimal; the piece explains its own meaning throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of inherited mystery and cultural pattern-mapping is articulated rather than embodied. The final paragraph explicitly states the thematic work ("not just about deciphering patterns, but about uncovering the hidden narratives") in place of scene pressure. The cards as confidant and the measuring tape as symbol are mentioned repeatedly but do not constrain choice or charge the closure image with cost. Wisdom is asserted, not earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is stated rather than dramatized: "atoms of nostalgia," "anguished joy," and the pursuit of forbidden knowledge are named repeatedly without concrete particulars that shift meaning. The pagoda and the vision are symbolic conveniences introduced late and never constrained by prior events. The final paragraph moralizes ("her journey had been worth the anguish and the joy") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is absent; all meaning is articulated on the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (hope versus shadow, connection versus disconnection) is declared rather than earned through specific image or irony. The river stone and "luminous regret" recur but carry static symbolic weight without transformation. The final paragraph moralizes: "she had found a way to metamorphose her understanding into a deeper insight, one that would guide her through the darkness." No resonant image answers the thematic question; the piece tells its meaning rather than showing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.6)
    The metaphor of shedding layers to reveal truth is repeated across the text but never earns its resonance through specific experience; the chameleon, convictions, and reconstruction all echo the same abstract idea without accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material. The final smile and assertion that Lena "knew" she would find balance is a stated moral rather than an emergent answer. No competing interpretations or ambiguity; the piece settles into a tidy resolution that declares theme instead of earning it through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme ("stories in scars," displaced miracle, coffee-ring divination) is announced repeatedly in abstract language rather than emerging from specific events. The final paragraph moralizes ("testament to the power of the displaced miracle") instead of letting the image resonate. No particular choice or image reweights prior material; the tower's "isolation" → "testament" shift is told, not shown. The coffee rings are mentioned as method but never dramatized, so thematic claims lack grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme—enduring power of love and memory—emerges through the goodbye-letters vision and the film-strip frame. The final image attempts resonance: "some things remain forever." However, the piece states its thesis overtly in multiple lines ("testament to the enduring power of love," "enduring power of human emotion," "love that continued to resonate through the ages") rather than trusting concrete particulars. The letters remain generic swirl without individual story that would deepen ambiguity. Thematic Echo penalties apply: restating the prompt concept in prompt-like language reduces subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme (connection to the cosmos as creative renewal) is stated overtly rather than emerging from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the universe was always speaking, if one only took the time to listen." Recurrent images (stardust, aurora, astrolabe) are mentioned but do not shift meaning or accumulate pressure across beats. The ending offers no resonant, non-literal answer—only a tidy summary of the premise. Stock phrasing ("magic that lay just beyond...everyday reality") replaces earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme emerges around rebirth and dormant potential, signaled by "sparks," "bloom," and "world's rebirth," but these remain abstract assertions rather than earned from specific conflict. The chess clock as symbol of "disrupted rhythm" is stated directly rather than discovered through implication. The final image of the clock's "rhythmic ticking a fading echo" gestures toward resonance but does not reweigh prior material with new cost or meaning—it repeats the setup without transformation. No thematic question is posed or answered through Asa's choices, only illustrated through ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme of consciousness expansion and inner exploration is stated rather than enacted. The hum, gear, and translocation function as symbols without accruing fresh meaning through plot pressure. The final paragraph ("probable miracles," "infinite possibilities") delivers thematic summary in place of earned resonance. No tension exists between the declared insight and any countervailing cost or complexity, leaving the piece one-note and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme is stated rather than embodied: "unused courage," "gentle persistence," "world's enduring rhythms" appear as prompt labels without contradiction or specificity. The vigil and star-stamp are symbolic gestures that do not constrain a character choice or reweight prior material. The final image—mist clearing to reveal a "new and uncharted world"—offers generic promise rather than a resonant, non-literal answer to a dramatized question. No insight arises from concrete action; the travelers' courage remains "unused" and abstract at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of silence as both burden and strength emerges from recurring images (fortress, snow, discoloration, "frostbitten hope"), and the piece resists overt moralizing in most paragraphs. However, the final third slides into thematic summary: "they came to see that it was not just a price paid, but a choice made" and "their silence a reminder of the strength that lay within" are direct thesis statements rather than resonant images. The closing lines ("testament to their resolve," "tale of resilience") read as meta-commentary that replaces scene pressure with authorial voice, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.6)
    A theme of patient revelation versus ambition emerges, but it arrives through assertion ("patient work would be vindicated") rather than embodied particulars. The "rune of drift" and "graceful collapse" are invoked as symbols without scene-work to anchor them. The ending moralizes: "a reminder of the power of truth and the unyielding dedication"—a thesis statement rather than resonant image. No earned insight tied to specific struggle; the pretender's "duplicity" is told, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of listening to the sea's rhythms emerges through recurring imagery (tapping, drum, ocean whispers) and the lyric tone supports it. However, the final revelation—"the truth she sought was not in the maps or the data, but in the rhythms of the sea itself"—is stated rather than earned through specific experience. The closing lines gesture toward mystery and connection but offer no resonant non-literal answer that reweights prior material; the insight remains abstract and unanchored to concrete choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of rekindling purpose in stillness emerges through repeated imagery (stars, hum, opera glasses), yet the ending states its answer—"she had found her way"—rather than offering a non-literal reconfiguration. The vintage opera glasses recur across beats, reweighting from observation tool to symbol of renewed vision, which elevates thematic texture. However, the final paragraphs moralise ("not stillness, but a held breath") instead of letting the image resonate, lowering closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is declared rather than dramatized: "evolve tradition with intent" and "implanted destiny" appear as labels without on-page friction. The embryo's golden light and the plants' chorus deliver symbolic convenience—triumph without complexity or cost. The final image offers affirmation ("not alone on this journey") instead of a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material. No moral ambiguity or earned insight; the piece resolves into a tidy affirmation of Akira's role.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—healing and finding hope amid trauma—emerges from image and atmosphere (twisted trees, smoothing photograph, setting sun) rather than statement. The "pearl of stillness" and "anchor optimism in realism" phrases border on prompt-echo and thesis declaration. The final image (disappearing into trees, lighter spirit) offers resonance but lacks a non-literal answer or conceptual repricing; it restates the premise rather than reweighting it. Subtext operates in the contrast between the tortured trees and Amira's internal calm, and the piece avoids overt moralizing in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is stated rather than emergent: "luminescent ache," "necessary darkness," "fragmented reality" recur as labels without fresh inflection from particulars. The final paragraphs summarize the theme ("power of art to transform") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image. Rhetorical questions ("What was the purpose of art?") function as thematic echo rather than scene pressure. The broken tarot box is decorative; its "secrets revealed" claim lacks on-page proof.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme—time's slowing in crisis—is declared in exposition rather than emerging from image or action. The disappearing ink might serve as metaphor for ephemerality, but its thematic weight is told ("ephemeral patterns") not shown through consequence. The ending offers a stated "tale of patterns and time" rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. "Serene anger" and "bond forged" are abstract claims unsupported by concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of silenced truths versus imposed narratives emerges clearly, and the cryogenic archivist framing lends conceptual resonance. However, the final paragraphs lapse into explicit thesis statements: "she had given voice to a silence that had lasted far too long," "her role as a cryogenic archivist now a mere cover for her true occupation—a guardian of contraband truths." The piece tells the theme rather than letting the particulars (the letter, the act, the cost) resonate without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Engraved quiet" and "tranquil blaze" are invoked repeatedly as labels but never emerge from concrete action or constraint. The stone talisman is introduced, then static; it does not charge the closure. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "it was not the sword that had brought her peace, but the gentle, insistent beauty of the desert roses"—thematic echo that replaces scene pressure. No ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the resolution is perfectly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of silence-as-communication and blurred boundaries is stated rather than dramatized through choice. The fisher's transliteration of emotions and voicing of silence are described but do not constrain action or generate on-page friction that would embody the concept. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("the silences between words held the secrets of the universe") and the ending recapitulates rather than reweights. The feral lullaby recurs as label without accruing new meaning through cost or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of truth versus legacy-burden emerges through recurring imagery (mist, orbits of regret, the pen nib as heirloom), and the piece attempts a conceptual arc from secrecy to transparency. However, "orbits of regret" and "solemn playfulness" function as ornamental labels rather than earned through specific events. The final image—Adelaide smiling as mist swallows her—gestures toward resonance but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer; the pen nib's "otherworldly light" is asserted symbolism without dramatized cost. The thematic question is posed but not answered through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme (guilt, healing through art) is stated rather than earned: "by confronting it, she had begun to heal" is assertion, not dramatized consequence. The amber, cord, and meteor hush are introduced as symbols but never constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward a non-literal answer. The ending's "new beginnings" and "gentle cooing" deliver a tidy moral rather than resonant ambiguity. Diagnostic phrasing ("dissonance of old guilt," "inner turmoil") appears in the final third without embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—meaning emerging from chaos—is legible through the mandala's patterns, and "the unlearning" provides a conceptual frame. However, the ending offers a stated moral ("discovered meaning in the mess") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer through image. Prompt-language phrases ("emergent hush," "lilac unease") recur without accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material. The tile flake's "listen deeply" message is absorbed without friction, and the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than dramatizing it. The story gestures toward complexity but resolves into comfort without earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.7)
    "Aberrant mercy" and "warm coldness" are invoked repeatedly as thematic labels but never emerge from concrete actions or images; the piece tells its theme rather than enacting it. The tessera and mosaic stepping stone could function as recurring motifs that shift meaning, yet they remain static symbols without causal weight. The ending offers a stated moral ("the transformative power of aberrant mercy") rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. Specificity is missing: the plaza's rebirth is declared, not shown through altered spatial details or a tactical shift in Aria's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme (nostalgia, redemption, possibility from despair) is announced repeatedly in abstract terms rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "a reminder of the power of nostalgia, and the magic that could be woven when possibility was lured from the brink of despair." The tarot coin and echoes recur but do not shift meaning or constrain choice; they are symbolic tokens, not engines of thematic pressure. No earned insight, only asserted reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.9)
    A theme of creative synthesis and inner exploration emerges through the geode/somatic marker method, and the piece avoids overt moralizing. However, the final image—"the very act of creation had brought her into harmony with the world"—offers resolution without a non-literal or resonant answer to a central question; it declares thematic satisfaction rather than letting concrete particulars reweight prior material. The "willowglass hope" and "fractally precise" descriptors feel like ornamental labels rather than thematic threads that accumulate pressure, and the ending grants harmony without visible ambiguity or cost that would deepen reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.4)
    A coherent theme—bridging past and present through sensory mapping and transitional objects—emerges from particulars. The elm leaf fossil and heat-mapping technique anchor the thematic exploration of unknown territories. However, the ending ("she had found her voice") states the theme directly rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer through image or action. The final paragraphs summarize theme ("all blended together," "ready to uncover them") in place of a charged beat, reducing thematic complexity to affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.7)
    "Shared wisdom" and "prophecy into raw possibility" are asserted repeatedly in abstract meta-commentary rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the act of creation was ongoing, a never-ending dance between the past, present, and future"—thematic echo that replaces scene pressure (−0.6). No character choice or image offers a non-literal answer; the piece tells theme rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of redemption and self-integration is stated overtly ("fixing what was broken," "unused courage") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The engraved pillbox recurs but without shifting meaning; it remains a static "reminder" across all mentions. The final image—standing with her other self as the mist clears—gestures at resolution but does not reweight prior material or create non-literal resonance; it simply visualizes the declared theme. The piece tells the reader what to feel ("sense of peace," "hope rising") instead of earning it through specific events.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "palimpsest promise" and "distill complexity into essence" theme are announced repeatedly but never dramatized through concrete action or image that constrains choice. The final paragraph openly moralizes ("he had finally uncovered the essence," "distilled complexity into simplicity") rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The yarn needle, fog, and ferry are stock symbols used ornamentally—no recurring image shifts meaning or reweights prior material at closure. Subtext is absent; all meaning is stated.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme—places resist change when infused with kindness—emerges from imagery (honey, wax, gentle curves) but is stated outright in late paragraphs: "some places resist change because they are infused with the kindness of those who once tended them." This articulation replaces dramatized discovery. The lantern glass recurs and gains symbolic weight, yet its meaning shift is told rather than shown through specific events. The ending offers a poignant image (glass as beacon) but the thematic answer is delivered as a maxim, not earned through ironic cost or non-literal resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated rather than emergent: "reflect light into dark corners," "weaving a spell of protected vulnerability." The lockmaster's tooth is introduced as symbolic souvenir without dramatic friction. The final paragraph announces theme ("the power of their work") instead of allowing image or choice to charge meaning. Subtext is absent; all resonance is declared.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.8)
    "Brittle awakenings" and "translate isolation into independence" are stated as theme rather than emerging from concrete events. The sundial's secrets remain locked at story's end, offering no resonant answer or conceptual repricing. Paragraphs 11, 15, and 18 repeat thematic claims ("coalesce into a new understanding," "weaving a new narrative") without anchoring in a specific choice or image. The final "promise in the fading light" is abstract assertion, not a non-literal answer grown from particulars. Heavy thematic echo across multiple paragraphs triggers cumulative penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of connection and pattern-seeking emerges from Lena's vocation and the recurring twig spiral, and the public art installation embodies collaborative creation. Yet the final realization is stated rather than dramatized through specific action or image: "the thread...was not something to be found, but something to be created" reads as a thesis rather than an earned discovery. The lotus temple and thrush's nest function more as ornamental motifs than as particulars that reweigh the central question. The closing smile and peaceful walk away signal thematic closure without ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of cosmic balance and human ingenuity emerges faintly from events, but the final paragraphs dissolve into abstract moralizing: "using her gifts to outwit the cosmic tricksters and bring harmony to the universe, one subsonic frequency at a time" and "The world was full of mystery and wonder." These declarations replace scene pressure with thesis statements. No non-literal answer; the ending restates the premise rather than reweighting it. The astronomical charts shift significance off-page without concrete reprisal that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme emerges around discovery and transformation, but the final insight—"the vital key she had been searching for was not a physical object, but a profound insight"—is stated directly rather than earned through concrete particulars. The church organ motif recurs but functions as atmospheric decoration without constraining choice or accumulating pressure that reweights the ending. "Wistful rebellion" and "fallow period" are asserted in the final paragraphs as thematic labels without organic emergence from prior action, verging on meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—empathy as the key to hidden truth—emerges from dialogue and imagery (ribbon, portrait, mist). The final paragraph states the theme overtly: "she had helped to thaw a part of the detective's heart, and that was a truth worth capturing." This explicit moralizing replaces scene pressure and undercuts resonance. The ribbon shifts from curiosity to "symbol of the complex, multifaceted nature of human experience," but the reprise is told rather than dramatized with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme of reversible exile and hidden patterns is stated overtly ("was it a physical displacement, or a metaphysical one?") rather than emerging from scene particulars. The final paragraph explicitly tells us "a revelation that would change her life forever" without dramatizing it. No resonant non-literal answer appears; instead, the piece offers a catalog of abstract questions and meta-commentary about the mystery itself.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of transformation and redemption through art is stated repeatedly ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") rather than emerging from particulars. The glass flake and music motifs recur but do not accumulate new meaning—each mention restates the same abstract promise. Final paragraphs offer overt moralizing ("testament to the power of art") that replaces scene pressure. The phrase "luminous disbelief" and variants appear label-only without embodied perception. No earned insight arises from specific struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of paths, territorial markers, and the transience of value emerges organically from Kael's exploration and the circus train's decay. However, the final paragraphs veer into summary moralizing ("the value of a journey lay not in its destination, but in the stories it told") that replaces scene pressure with a stated thesis. The collection of foreign paper money recurs but does not reweight meaning at the end—it remains symbolic convenience rather than a constraint or charged reprise. The dusky harmony motif feels decorative rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of shared burdens emerges through direct statement ("when individuals shared their struggles, the weight became more manageable") rather than dramatic particulars. The temple inscriptions speak "of an ancient people who had understood the value of shared burdens," repeating the theme claim without embodying it in Lyra's present choices. The final lines ("burdens she had once carried alone now seemed more manageable, shared as they were with the stars above and the inscriptions below") offer metaphorical assertion, not a resonant image that reweights prior material. The piece gestures toward theme but does not earn insight through specific experience or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme—"what mirrors don't show…was…a glimpse into the soul"—is stated outright in the penultimate beat rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The mirror's cracked surface functions as convenient symbolic shorthand without prior grounding in the druid's choices or losses. "Warlike serenity" and "through expanding circles" are repeated as labels but never embody friction or cost. The final paragraphs summarize the journey's meaning ("the truth was worth the struggle") rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme emerges through recurring images (the maze, the scars, the ancient tree) and the premise of hidden patterns, but it remains abstract—"eclipsed covenant" and "intersection of dreams" are prompt labels rather than dramatized questions. The final paragraph states theme overtly: "the world was full of hidden patterns and secret pathways," undercutting subtextual resonance. No earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle; Aria's "journey" is a tour rather than a crucible. The piece gestures at transformation without on-page cost or irony.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of transformation and self-repair emerges from the imagery (burned card, spell-weaving, catacomb orchard), but the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("she would carry the lessons") rather than letting the image speak. The Eight of Swords motif (entrapment/limitation) is noted mid-story but never constrains a choice or reappears with reweighted meaning at closure. Subtext operates in the atmospheric details, yet the ending flattens resonance by declaring "a sense of peace" and "a brighter future" instead of offering a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.7)
    The after-the-applause concept and discovery-of-purpose motivation are present throughout, but they remain abstract—no particular image or action embodies them. The final paragraph stack of theme statements ("silence was no longer oppressive," "echo valley longing was still there," "reminder of the beauty that lay just beyond the horizon") functions as sermonizing rather than earned resonance. The speaker grille cloth could carry thematic weight, but its meaning is directly stated ("reminder of the rush") rather than allowed to resonate through implication. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6) for the closing moralizing that replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme ("interconnected cosmos," "physics of transition") is stated repeatedly rather than dramatized through event or image. The cuneiform texts and analogical thinking are mentioned but never shown shaping a choice or creating irony. The final lines ("savored the moment," "sense of wonder") moralize rather than offering a resonant image. "Touching distance" recurs as a phrase without reweighting prior material or landing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("migrating identities," "preserve wonder in routine") is asserted repeatedly rather than emerging from dramatized events. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "wonder had become the only constant." No specific experience earns the insight; the creel and moon references remain ornamental symbols that do not constrain choice or accumulate meaning. The ending states rather than reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of connection and hidden radiance is overtly stated rather than earned through particulars: "the power to connect with others lay within" arrives as summary. The pearl and shell function as symbolic tokens but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure—they are receptacles for declared meaning. The final paragraph moralizes ("a truth that would stay with her forever") instead of offering a resonant image. No non-literal answer to the thematic question; everything is spelled out.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme of forgiveness-as-journey is overtly stated multiple times ("forgiveness was not a destination, but a path") rather than emerging from image and choice. The map and accordion are presented as symbols without accruing new meaning through the arc. The final paragraph's "raw solace" and "mysteries, waiting to be unraveled" replace scene pressure with platitude. No resonant reprice or non-literal answer lands.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme—unspoken words as a state of being rather than a destination—emerges clearly and the mist/veil/cipher motifs recur. Yet the final realization is asserted ("the dreamer knew") rather than earned through concrete struggle; the epiphany arrives without visible sacrifice or counter-reading. The watch and journal are present but do not constrain choice or charge the closure image with irony or cost. No non-literal answer reweights prior material; the ending restates the premise in slightly elevated language.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.4)
    "Perforated destiny" is asserted as concept but never explored through specific events; it remains a thematic label. The final image—stepping into the unknown with determination—offers no non-literal answer or resonant reweighting of prior material. Subtext is minimal; most elements (empire, dream, promise losing glow) are directly stated rather than implied through gesture or image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of transcendence and the threshold between life and death is stated repeatedly ("threshold of stillness," "mystery at the heart of all things," "boundaries between life and death begin to blur") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "a beacon of hope and transcendence," "infused with the radiance of the divine." The emerald chip recurs but without shifting meaning; it remains a static symbol. No resonant, non-literal answer to the central question arises—only assertion of "unity," "wonder," and "gentle hush of the unknown."

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of rebirth and contentment is repeatedly stated ("cycle of rebirth," "source of contentment") rather than emerging from specific events. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("she had finally found what she had been searching for") instead of offering a resonant image. The hairpin functions as a symbolic placeholder without constraining choice or accumulating pressure that reweights prior material. "Vineyard hush" recurs as atmosphere label without charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme—nuance versus certainty, gray areas—is stated outright in the middle ("to welcome nuance into certainty") rather than emerging from concrete struggle. The wind chimes and mirror shard gesture at symbolic weight but remain ornamental; their use does not constrain a choice or charge the closure. The final paragraph moralizes: "a reminder of the power of nuance and the importance of embracing the gray areas." No resonant, non-literal answer to the central question arises from image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of "delayed revelation" is stated rather than enacted: the researcher withholds details and the student eventually understands, but the mechanism and cost remain abstract. The pond ripples function as metaphor in exposition rather than charging the closure image. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes possibility and readiness instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer through scene pressure. "Vanishing to appear" is a clever phrase but never moves from concept to embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated directly throughout ("the transformative power of stillness," "enduring power of harmony and balance") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The final paragraph moralizes ("a reminder that even in stillness, there is always movement") instead of offering a resonant image. The arrowhead functions as a symbolic object introduced and interpreted via summary ("had become a key to unlocking the secrets of the universe") without constraining a prior choice or reweighting meaning through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme—creativity versus automation, the sacred in the simple—is declared repeatedly ("the sacred was not something grand or majestic, but rather something simple, yet profound") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The keystone and garden function as convenient symbols rather than constraining forces. The ending offers no non-literal answer; instead, Eira's realization is stated directly: "she had found what she was searching for." The final paragraph moralizes ("a testament to the power of creativity and imagination") instead of trusting image and action. Thematic Echo penalty applies: Eira articulates the thesis in prompt-like language ("to find the sacred in the simple"), and the final paragraph restates the theme as moral summary, triggering −0.6 in Q5.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "color of sound" and "luminous vows" recur as thematic anchors, and the final lantern image reweights perception versus reality. However, the text edges toward direct statement ("not just a concept, but a reality," "a doorway to a new understanding") rather than letting the image alone carry resonance. The ending declares meaning instead of embodying it through a non-literal final action. Subtext in silence and shadow functions adequately in the middle but flattens at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme ("alignment with cosmic purpose") is stated repeatedly rather than earned through image or specific event. The backwards prophecy and wavelength alignment remain abstract labels without concrete stakes. The final paragraph summarizes rather than offering a resonant, non-literal image. Recurrent motifs (coins, stars, static bursts) are mentioned but never constrain choice or reweight meaning at closure, so they earn no credit under the no-motif-checklist rule.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of sacrifice and memory is stated repeatedly ("echo of sacrifice," "sacrifices made," "power of sacrifice") rather than emerging from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "a testament to the power of sacrifice, and the enduring legacy of those who had come before." The atlas page and sea monsters are symbolic conveniences introduced without prior grounding in the reaper's task or lost love, and the crystallization ritual does not reweight prior material or answer a central question—it illustrates a pre-stated theme.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Brittle devotion" and "plausible impossibility" are named repeatedly but function as thematic labels rather than emergent truths tested by events. The story tells us the bell symbolizes devotion's fragility, yet the repair proceeds without the mage's devotion shattering or being tested. The final image—deepening sapphire and echoing toll—offers mood but no resonant answer to the question of what devotion costs. The ending summarizes theme ("even the most brittle devotion could be made whole again") rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme—memory, loss, narrative as healing—is legible and threads through imagery (liqueur label, forgotten toy, wind chime). The "precisely humane" touch and "mirrored hush" recur as atmospheric notes. However, theme is stated rather than earned: "to spin stories into shared meaning" appears as direct assertion multiple times, and the final paragraph ("even in darkness, there is beauty") moralizes without dramatized cost. No on-page epiphany or image reweights prior material; the warden's internal state at the end is identical to the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of harmonizing logic and intuition emerges through imagery (starling patterns, crystal energy) rather than direct statement, which is strong. However, the ending resolves into platitude—"magic that lay just beneath the surface"—without complicating or repricing the premise. The "touch of wonder" appears as a repeated label rather than a specific realization earned through struggle. Subtext is thin; Elara's insights are declared rather than dramatized through failed attempts or ambiguous outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of vigilance and trust is stated overtly rather than emerging from concrete conflict ("the weight of being ever vigilant," "preserving the trust"). The parachute buckle recurs three times but does not accumulate new meaning or reweight prior material at closure; its symbolic role is decorative. The ending offers no resonant answer to a central question—Lyra simply finishes her work and prepares to return, a completion without thematic charge or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is stated overtly—"embracing contradictions," "vivify his true nature"—rather than arising from concrete particulars. The brain-in-jar recurs as a static symbol without shifting meaning across beats. The ending offers a thesis ("he was ready") instead of a resonant image that reweights prior material. No non-literal answer to a central question; only direct moralizing about self-discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("tending to the unspoken") is stated overtly rather than emerging from particulars. The leaf blower symphony and restored laughter function as allegorical tokens without specific lived cost. The ending delivers a tidy moral ("power of music to heal") in summary rather than a non-literal answer charged by the final image. No genuine ambiguity or counter-reading persists; the tale resolves into sentimental abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.6)
    The boundaries-of-light concept and dimensional-homesickness motif recur frequently, but remain abstract labels rather than emerging through concrete action or image. The ending asserts thematic resolution ("she had finally made friends with uncertainty") in direct statement rather than allowing a resonant image to reweight prior material. The pendant and mist are symbolic gestures without particularity that would anchor universals. The piece gestures toward complexity (knowledge/ignorance, death/threshold) but resolves into a tidy epiphany without ambiguity or felt cost, resulting in thematic telling over earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme of creative destruction is declared repeatedly ("vivify the essence of creative destruction," "embracing the principles of creative destruction") rather than emerging from specific events. The broken crozier shifts from "failed authority" to "catalyst for rebirth" through summary, not scene pressure. The ending offers thematic statements ("new path had been forged," "found their true calling") in place of a resonant image that reweights prior material. Penalty: Thematic Echo and moralizing in final paragraphs (−0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of "finding the beginning in every ending" and "beauty in decay" is overtly stated rather than earned through particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("the art of discovery was a lifelong journey"), undercutting resonance. The Hollywood star fragment could serve as a charged motif but remains static—it does not shift meaning between first touch and closure. Thematic Echo penalty: Aria's interior articulates the prompt's thesis in lines like "motivation to find the beginning in every ending" and the closing "art of discovery" summary, which replace scene pressure with statement (−0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme of boundaries thinning during the equinox and "permanent transient-ness" is articulated explicitly rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph ("merge parallel timelines and forge a new path") restates the premise in prompt-like language instead of offering a resonant image. The hourglass and sideways clocks recur but do not reweight prior material; they remain ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Rational enchantment" and "texture of connection" are stated repeatedly as theme labels without emergence from concrete particulars. The sinew thread and kaleidoscopic eruptions recur, but their meaning does not shift or deepen—they are ornamental motifs rather than resonant through-lines. The ending offers no non-literal answer to the central question; it recaps the premise ("world of rational enchantment") and asserts the architect will return, a summary rather than a reconfiguration. Subtext is absent; all meaning is declared.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is asserted rather than earned: "unfolded horizons," "mysteries of the cosmos," and transformation from darkness to beacon are stated as abstractions without specific dramatized particulars. The final paragraph moralizes ("the future was bright") rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer grounded in prior action. No recurring image shifts meaning at the end; the anchor chain link is mentioned once and never returns with reweighted pressure. Thematic Echo artifacts cluster in the closing lines, applying the specified penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme of memory and connection emerges through the photograph and the hearing aid, yet the final paragraph ("incidental heroism," "reeling hush") states the theme rather than letting the image charge it. No epiphany is earned by prior struggle, and the woman's peace arrives without ambiguity or felt complexity. The ending moralizes ("she had made a difference") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in scene particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme gestures toward honoring the forgotten and connecting to invisible forces, but these ideas are stated in reflection ("stand by the unremembered," "connection...now stronger") rather than enacted through concrete image or sacrifice. The undersea cables function as atmospheric backdrop, not a charged motif that constrains choice or reweights meaning at closure. The ending summarizes emotional change without showing what was risked or lost. No counter-reading or complexity emerges; the piece delivers a tidy affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (solace in understanding failure, transience of life) is stated rather than earned through specific events. The phrase "fetching wisdom from failure" appears mid-story as an assertion, and the final image (shard falling like snowflakes) offers a poetic echo but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. The digital ghost functions as metaphor more than dramatized stake, and the ink-pattern method is too abstract to ground the thematic question. The ending tilts toward serene resolution without moral ambiguity or earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—preservation across loss, translation as bridge—emerges clearly from imagery (flawed diamond, dying language, new lexicon) but is stated rather than earned through scene pressure. The final paragraphs explicitly narrate theme: "art to transcend even death," "power of translation," "magic that lay just beneath the surface." The diamond's "curse transformed into a blessing" is asserted without on-page event, and no concrete action or ironic gap opens a non-literal answer to the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated overtly ("turn bitterness into a cosmic joke," "harmony untamed") rather than emerging from particulars. The flint arrowhead and phone return but without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to the central question. The final paragraph moralizes ("she was no longer alone") and summarizes theme rather than charging an image with cost. Cap at 7.2 (Q4 ≤6.9) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is asserted in prompt language—"breaking free," "mechanical world," "tarnished wonder"—rather than emergent from scene particulars. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "the power of music to reawaken beauty in a world that had forgotten its song." The locust shell recurs as a static symbol without shifting meaning. No thematic question is tested by contradiction or ambiguity; the piece declares its thesis rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme ("broken promises heal") is stated three times but never emerges from specific events or images. The ending moralizes overtly: "he had played a small part in unleashing a different kind of tempest—one of hope and redemption" is direct thesis rather than earned resonance (−0.7 in Q5 for final-paragraph sermonizing). The thunderstorm bottle is symbolic convenience introduced to harvest thematic points rather than constrain choice. No non-literal answer to a central question arises from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—beauty born from silence, hope amid decay—emerges from image and atmosphere. The misting hush, wind bells, and halo fragment recur with shifted valence (sorrow blending with hope). However, the ending delivers an explicit thesis: "a new tale had begun, one of hope and beauty born from silence." The carpenter's insight is asserted ("they had discovered a hidden truth") rather than dramatized through a non-literal final image that reweights prior particulars. Subtext is thin; the piece explains its own meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of stories-as-living-entities emerges from repeated images (scarf glow, hyperbolic geometry maps, analog memories), yet the ending restates rather than reweights: "analog memories that made the world...more wondrous" lands as platitude. Subtext operates weakly; the librarian's solitude and the patrons' blur suggest alienation, but this is told, not embodied in tension. The scientific-poetry fusion remains decorative. No non-literal answer charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges from repeated images (luminous absence, cipher of longing) but is stated rather than earned through scene pressure. The final paragraph moralizes the journey without a non-literal answer or resonant reconfiguration. Phrases like "cipher of longing" and "luminous absence" function as stock mystical labels rather than specifics that reweight prior material. No epiphany arises from concrete struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—ideas trapped by fear, liberation—emerges from the central image (lock of hair as memory) but is stated rather than earned: "It was said that the lock of hair was…" and "the enveloped secrets had been given the freedom to roam." The final shimmering light is allegorical decoration, not a resonant answer grown from conflict. The locksmith's "piece of themselves" claim appears unmotivated. No thematic complexity or earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme of memory recovery and pattern-seeking is stated repeatedly but never emerges from concrete particulars. The final image—Emilia walking away with a glowing mushroom and a smile—offers mood without reweighting prior material. "Crisp nostalgia" and "uncertainty" are named rather than evoked through specific sensory or emotional friction. The piece telegraphs its thesis ("when habits break… be adaptable") instead of letting action and image generate resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges around exile, longing, and resilience through the shadow metaphor and tea-leaf geometry. Yet the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "the very fabric of reality was a little more resilient, a little more whole" reads as a stated thesis rather than a resonant image. The playground swing recurs but does not reweight prior material or constrain choice; it remains atmospheric decoration. The "mentor resilience quietly" motivation is told rather than dramatized through specific conflict or earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.9)
    Theme is asserted rather than earned: "preserve the color of wonder" and "magic of the natural world" appear as direct statements instead of emerging from specific action. The heirloom seed functions as symbolic convenience without particular constraint. The ending offers a thematic echo ("trail of wonder," "promise of new beginnings") that repeats the premise without reweighting it. No complexity, counter-reading, or earned insight through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of silence, accumulation, and peace emerges through repeated imagery (hush, stillness, starlight). Yet the final paragraphs state rather than dramatize: "a testament to the restorer's art," "the power of silence," "brought peace to the restless spirits." The ending offers no non-literal answer or resonant reconfiguration—it simply reasserts the premise without complication or reweighting of prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of silence, listening, and hidden truths is stated overtly ("to interpret silence with empathy," "discovered a language that spoke directly to her soul") rather than emerging through specific events. The final paragraph moralizes: "The world, it seemed, was full of secrets waiting to be uncovered." The whispered chapel and torn map function as symbolic conveniences without constraining choice or charging closure through prior particulars. No non-literal answer arises from the action; instead, Elara articulates the theme in prompt-like language.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges clearly (impermanence, release, transience) and is woven through recurring images (snow globe, Amelia Earhart, death lectures). However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "the physics of letting go was not about severing ties, but about embracing the fluidity of existence" is thesis-statement phrasing that replaces scene pressure. The snow globe's return is thematically apt but lacks a non-literal answer; it illustrates rather than reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is declared rather than emergent: "the power of creative expression," "mysterious connections," and "tinkersong wonder" are stated in the final two paragraphs without being earned through specific, conflicted events. The graffiti art and ghostly code function as symbolic placeholders without particular meaning derived from the balladeer's struggle. The ending moralizes ("a testament to…") instead of offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. The piece gestures toward communion between living and ghostly but never dramatizes friction or cost that would charge the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of love/loss intertwined is stated explicitly ("love and loss were intertwined," "both elevate and devastate") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The final image offers no non-literal answer; instead, the narrator summarizes the theme in the closing paragraphs. The diary functions as a thematic vehicle but never constrains Elara's choice or charges the closure with ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.9)
    "Spooled wholeness" and "empty spaces remember" are repeated as thematic labels without emerging from concrete events or images. The final paragraph states the theme directly ("to prove that even in the most turbulent of times, there existed a deeper truth") rather than letting it resonate through particulars. The telescope and clouds are mentioned but do not accumulate meaning or shift valence across beats. The ending offers mood rather than a non-literal answer to the central question, and Lyra's internal arc is told rather than inextricable from plot.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (limits of capturing the infinite, impermanence vs. beauty) emerges through the coin's cryptic message, the portrait's fractally precise rendering, and the pre-demolition context. The sky-mirrored-in-walls motivation and the final indigo image offer resonance without overt moralizing. Yet the ending paragraph edges toward summary ("what had been lost, and what had been gained") and the artist's internal arc is more contemplative absorption than transformation. The portrait "seemed to glow with an otherworldly light" verges on telling the effect rather than earning it through particulars, and the thematic question about limits is posed more than dramatized in a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.4)
    A theme of solitary discovery and "sociable isolation" emerges through recurrence of the airship as microcosm and Eli's deferred sharing. The luminance and hopscotch code offer symbolic texture but remain ornamental—neither constrains choice nor charges the ending with conceptual cost. The closing image (starlings watching, luminance dancing) gestures toward wonder but delivers no non-literal answer or thematic repricing. Prompt language ("sociable isolation") appears directly on the page, reducing emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of understanding cosmic harmony and repair emerges through repeated imagery (gears, mirrors, rhythm) but is undercut by the final three paragraphs, which explain the theme in direct statements: "the rhythm of repair had been learned," "the secrets of the universe were now within their grasp," and "their craft was not just about repair, but about understanding the intricate dance." These overt thematic summaries replace scene resonance with expository moralizing, triggering the anti-pattern penalty for explain-everything endings.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of collective effort and transformation is stated overtly ("power of collective effort," "beacon of hope") rather than emerging from image and event. The butterfly garden and nebula recur as symbols but do not shift meaning at closure—they confirm the thesis mechanically. The final paragraph moralizes: "they knew that they had created something truly special" and "both a refuge and a beacon of hope" replace scene pressure with thematic summary. No counter-reading or ambiguity invites reflection; resolution is tidy and affirming without conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of fragility and balance emerges through recurring motifs (cracks, hush, lullaby) without overt statement. The broken puppet head shifts from reminder to testament, a lyric reprise that reweights the stake modestly. Yet the ending lullaby states rather than dramatizes: "brought a measure of peace" tells the thematic conclusion. The piece leans toward abstraction ("beautifully flawed fabric of existence") over concrete particulars that generate reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.4)
    A theme of restoration and guidance emerges through the labyrinth imagery, but the final image offers no non-literal resonance—the "beacon of hope" and glowing nut are stated rather than earned through accumulated particulars. The small nut's role shifts from connection-object to pride-token without deepening meaning. "Graceless beauty" and the cursed orchard are named but not integrated into the caretaker's internal question. The ending moralizes ("now a beacon of hope, guiding travelers through the darkness") instead of letting the scene image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—transformation, connection, and honoring loss—emerges organically from the ravine, chrysalis, and foam patterns without overt statement until the final paragraphs. The metaphor of interconnected systems (foam, braided waterways) resonates with Maria's research and grief work. However, the ending tilts toward explicit thematic summary ("the world...was still a messy and beautiful place, full of patterns waiting to be uncovered") rather than letting the chrysalis or ravine image carry the weight non-literally. The penultimate insight is earned, but the closing lines moralize rather than resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of stories existing within places rather than only in books emerges clearly, but it arrives through direct statement rather than earned discovery. The line "stories...were also woven into the very fabric of the library itself" explicitly articulates the premise instead of letting image and action reveal it. "Glimmering parole" as mystical concept and "quantifying absence" remain abstractions never grounded in concrete consequence. The ending's "deep sense of belonging" and smile feel tidy rather than resonant, resolving complexity into simple affirmation without ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (healing through absorption of pain, the persistence of memory) emerges from the premise and imagery. The coral pavilion and tidal pool function as symbolic repositories but do not shift meaning beat-to-beat; they are introduced and used once without reprise or reweighting. The final image ("a symbol of resilience") states theme rather than offering a non-literal answer through action or charged detail. Subtext is present in the juxtaposition of desert and ocean motifs, but the ending's moralizing tone ("she had emerged stronger") replaces earned resonance with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of connection and unity emerges from the silo/bridge metaphor, but it remains abstract and stated rather than earned through specific, dramatized friction. The "hush of borrowed starlight" and "larger symphony" are poetic but generic, lacking the particulars that would ground the vision in lived cost. The ending's "vigorous tender hope" is an emotional label, not a resonant image that reweights prior material. No counter-reading or ambiguity; the piece declares harmony without showing the complexity or sacrifice that unity demands.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of abandoned dreams and entangled memory is stated overtly ("become the archeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than emerging from image and choice. The mirror functions as a prompt-echo symbol without constraining action or reweighting meaning at closure. The ending summarizes theme ("complex web of memories… just beneath the surface of reality") in place of offering a resonant, non-literal answer through scene work. Potential thematic depth is flattened by expository declaration and the absence of moral calculus or earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "seeds of vigilance" concept is stated repeatedly but never explored through concrete action or image—what vigilance costs, what it requires, or how it conflicts with other desires. The serpent-and-seed doodle is labeled "more than just a decorative flourish" yet remains exactly that: a static symbol pointing to a location rather than a recurring image that shifts meaning under pressure. The final paragraph's moralizing ("responsibility that came with knowledge," "secrets that still lay hidden") replaces earned thematic resonance with declarative summary. The story gestures at a journey of discovery but delivers no non-literal answer to a central question.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—empathy as conduit for music in silence—emerges from the sculptor's actions and the grove's response, avoiding overt statement until the penultimate lines ("their music had brought a measure of empathy"). The porcelain insulator and stress-crack analysis accumulate as motifs, though their recurrence does not constrain later choices. The final image of trees swaying offers a resonant, non-literal answer, but the middle declares the theme overtly: "by doing so, they could help others feel the music." Subtext operates in gesture (trees whispering, sculptor smiling) but the piece occasionally tells its thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated rather than earned: "discover beauty in the difficult" and "hopeful melancholy" are repeated labels without specific dramatization. The final image (tutor vanishing into darkness, "whispered promise of beauty") offers mood, not a resonant answer to a question the story posed through action. Metaphors (magnetic nexus pulsing, stars shining brighter) are vague gestures that do not reweight prior material. The piece abstracts rather than grounds its thematic claims in concrete choices or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme ("empathy," "varieties of silence") is announced repeatedly but never emerges from specific event or image with cost. The diary's content about "poetic musings on silence" is summary, not dramatized friction. The final paragraph moralizes ("deep connection," "lost threads of humanity") in place of resonant image. One positive: the fireworks-as-stillness frame attempts a conceptual container, but it never reweights prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—serenity within motion, the undercurrent of wisdom—emerges through recurrent abstract phrases rather than concrete particulars. The corpse flower seed and journaling doodles are mentioned but do not constrain choices or accumulate pressure that reweights meaning at closure. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("she realized that the undercurrent of wisdom was not something to be discovered, but rather something that was always present"), violating the no-stated-moral standard with a −0.6 penalty. The "wildflower hush" recurs as tone and final image, offering some resonance, but the thematic answer remains a told epiphany rather than an earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of resilience and hidden energy sources emerges through the orchard and echoes imagery, avoiding overt statement until the final explanatory passage. However, the ending shifts into explicit theme summary ("source of the orchard's resilience was not just...but the gathering of echoes itself") rather than letting the pool image carry resonance. The arrow tip is introduced with thematic potential but remains inert, vibrating "in harmony" without constraining choice or reweighting prior material. The conceptual cost is asserted ("never see...the same way") but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges from particulars: the patch as "symbol of the crew's rapidly adapting response," the wind's eddying patterns, the desire to cultivate foresight. The final image—"hazy precision...guiding her towards the truth"—restates the theme rather than offering a non-literal answer with fresh pressure. "The crash would not be forgotten, and she would make sure that its lessons were learned" veers toward moralizing. The story resists simplistic binaries but does not reweight prior material with a charged ambiguity; the ending confirms her stance without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme is stated overtly ("certify wonder as essential," "deeper truths of existence") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "Elian knew that she would carry this sense of awe with her, inspiring others…" and "a haunting reminder of the transcendent power of art." The sculpted hush operates as a symbolic label without accruing specific meaning through action. Thematic echo penalty applies (−0.6) for prompt-like language in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.4)
    A theme of transformation through failure emerges in the premise, but it remains abstract—no failure is dramatized on the page, and the "insights harvested" are never specified. The final image (driftwood markers, silent flute) offers some resonance, and the recurring "canyon hush" / "avalanchingly quiet" motif attempts to charge the ending, but the thematic payoff is undercut by label-only interiority ("long-dormant memories," "secrets waiting to be uncovered"). The piece gestures toward mystery and stillness without grounding theme in a concrete, non-obvious particular that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.1)
    "Transposed empathy" and "mathematics of emotion" are stated repeatedly but never emerge from concrete image or choice. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the power of transposed empathy." The Halo fragment could function as a charged object but is introduced late (past midpoint) and its "secrets" remain abstract. Ambiguity is declared ("deliberate ambiguity," "multiple layers of meaning") rather than demonstrated through scene pressure. One modest credit: the vanishing stars offer a non-literal frame, but the ending does not reweight them—it simply walks away.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme ("magic beneath the surface," "wonder," "memory to myth") is stated repeatedly in narration rather than emerging from concrete events. The final paragraph moralizes ("her task was not just to retrieve relics, but to keep the spark of wonder alive") instead of offering a resonant image. The pendant's symbolic recurrence is ornamental—it does not constrain choice or reweight prior material at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme of hidden connections and "truthful lies" is stated repeatedly ("paradoxical truths," "hidden patterns") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The mystic's epiphany is asserted in abstraction ("profound truth… both simple and profound") without dramatized cost or earned insight. The phrase "truthful lies" appears twice but is never illustrated through action, image, or a character blind spot that the story confronts. The ending moralizes ("reminder of the power of the unknown") instead of offering a non-literal resonance. No counter-reading is invited; the text endorses the mystic's claims without irony or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.3)
    A theme of connection and renewal emerges from the recurring images of thread, puzzle, and silence, and the piece avoids overt moralizing. The tree sap amber bead and the completed puzzle operate as motifs that shift meaning across the narrative (isolation → determination → connection). However, the ending offers no resonant, non-literal answer to the central question; instead it asserts transformation ("had become a bridge," "continued to weave its magic") without grounding these claims in specific, dramatized experience. The final image of her spirit remaining in the orchard reads as abstract wish rather than earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.6)
    "Bartered awakenings" and "coax resilience from rubble" are invoked as conceptual labels but never dramatized through specific conflict or trade-off. The theme of transformation emerges clearly—broken materials into strength, solitude into mentorship—but the final image (hammering echoes, rock arches as sentinels) offers thematic summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. "Azure defiance" appears as phrase-insertion rather than scene-earned pressure. The orchard planet and mines supply atmospheric texture but do not constrain the thematic question in a way that forces the protagonist to confront cost or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is stated rather than earned: "weight of a withheld truth," "hidden structure," "larger pattern" appear as labels without concrete anchoring. The final paragraph offers thematic summary ("she would never see the multiverse in the same way again") in place of a resonant image. The green glass shard recurs but does not shift meaning—it functions identically at pickup and at closure. No concrete particulars generate thematic complexity; the piece reads as allegory with transparent stand-ins (map maker = seeker, doorway = possibility) lacking narrative life.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of safety, protection, and luminescent longing emerges organically from the lighthouse, sea glass, and cairn motifs. The final image (sea glass as "tiny blue ember," lighthouse as sentinel) offers resonant particulars. However, the piece never dramatizes the "ache" through conflict or cost—it remains a stated feeling. The anonymous letters gesture toward dread but vanish without thematic payoff. No earned insight or non-literal answer to the central question; instead, a mood piece with symbolic furniture that does not reweight prior material through action.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—ancient tradition vs. fleeting digital modernity—is asserted ("world after the last print newspaper") but never tested on the page; the contrast remains decorative rather than generative of conflict. The "Otherworldly routine" and "shadowed elation" are stated labels without specific embodiment or friction. The final image ("emerald lighthouse stood watch") offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; it loops to the opening without conceptual cost. Pseudo-profundity ("magic that lay just beyond the edge of the everyday world") substitutes for earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of magnetism and storytelling is stated outright in the penultimate paragraph ("some individuals...possessed a unique ability to refract and reflect the light") rather than emerging through particulars. The blue morpho wing functions as an on-the-nose symbol for allure without complication or counterpoint. The final image—"iridescent caution" dissolving into mist—echoes the opening without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme—mundane miracles, sorrow as quantifiable force, interconnection of tower/trees/moon—is asserted repeatedly but never earned through specific choice or image. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "even the most broken things could be made whole again, if one only knew where to look." No concrete particular reweights the opening question; instead, the ending cycles through thematic labels (magic, mundane miracles, secrets, journey) without delivering resonance. The sextant repair, which might anchor theme, occurs without friction or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.3)
    The thematic question—whether connection and memory can revive a dying realm—emerges clearly from the premise and recurs through "woven dawns," "knitting communities," and "forgotten songs." However, the final image ("beacon of hope," "brighter future") states the theme rather than reweighting prior material through a non-literal answer. The mica window's vision offers a glimpse of "threads that bound the realm," but this insight arrives without dramatized cost or a choice that confronts ambiguity. The piece remains earnest and sincere, yet the closure leans into declaration over resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (paradox, hiding/staying, wisdom in mistakes) is woven throughout and avoids overt moralizing until the final lines, which declare "truth is not in the destination, but in the journey itself"—a platitude that replaces image with assertion. The invitation's reweighting is present but mild; the shift from "reminder of failure" to "possibility of growth" is told rather than shown through a concrete choice. The message "truth is not in the answer, but in the question" lands with modest resonance but does not interrogate or complicate prior material in a non-obvious way.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("the sacred in the ordinary") is stated outright in reflection ("she too was searching for a way to connect with the world, to find the sacred in the ordinary") rather than emerging from image and choice. The bread-as-key metaphor is told in the penultimate paragraph ("a key to unlocking a deeper understanding") instead of enacted. The final smile and return promise feel tidy rather than resonant; no non-literal answer to the central question charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.6)
    The luminous vows motif recurs but remains abstract—"hope and devotion," "living breathing entity"—without grounding in specific ritual or trade-off. The final image asserts Elara as "guardian" and "weaver" without the particulars earning that thematic resonance. The piece gestures toward meaning at "the edge of oblivion" but never dramatizes the cost of preservation versus loss, reducing theme to stated atmosphere rather than emergent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of secrets and fragile peace emerges from particulars (the fob, market whispers, standoff), but "capture the sound of trust breaking" remains abstract—never dramatized in scene. The final paragraph moralizes ("power of determination," "secrets hidden in the shadows") rather than trusting the image. The "truce of hush" appears twice but functions as a label, not a constraint that reweights prior material. Subtext in the vendor exchange ("knowing glint") is present but underexploited.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme ("mysteries beyond perception," "science versus mysticism") is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from scene particulars. The final paragraph moralizes ("she would carry this moment… a reminder of the magic") and summarizes rather than offering a resonant image. The tin compass ring and aurora recur but do not shift meaning; they remain static symbols. No non-literal answer to the central question is earned—only a thematic echo of the opening stance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of artistic unlocking through emotional release emerges through image (crystals, lock, portrait) but leans toward overt statement: "the true key lay not in the lock itself, but in the act of creating something new." The final paragraph moralizes ("sometimes, it takes a journey into the depths") rather than letting the image resonate. The composite-portrait idea and crystal-channeling conceit hint at depth but remain abstractly presented.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of candor, intimacy, and transience emerges clearly from the setup. However, it remains abstract: "candor in small moments" and "beauty of human connection" are stated rather than embodied in a specific, non-obvious final image. The zinc plate as symbol is introduced but not reweighted at closure. The ending moralizes ("her vision clarified by the candor of small moments") instead of offering a resonant answer through scene particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated overtly and repeatedly ("symphonies of truth," "language of the heart," "era after words") rather than emerging from concrete events and image. The iceberg preserving "the color of wonder" is symbolic convenience introduced late without prior grounding. No ambiguity, counter-reading, or earned insight through struggle—only declarative philosophy. The final paragraphs moralize the premise directly instead of letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of renewal and fragmented wholeness emerges from the fire/rebirth imagery. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly ("she had found a way to escape, to break free") and the box's weight is told lighter without earned scene work. The desert roses' transformation offers concrete resonance, but Aria's arc resolves into tidy self-awareness ("capable of growth, of change") that undercuts ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme "listening heals" is stated overtly multiple times ("she began to grasp the underlying theme—that listening heals," "reinforced her belief in the healing power of listening") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The ending note—"To those who listen, stories unfold"—moralizes instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The locket functions as symbolic convenience, introduced early but never constraining a choice or charging the closure through specific, earned transformation. Emilia's epiphany is asserted rather than won through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of transforming vulnerability into strength is stated explicitly rather than emerging from concrete action. Recurring images (dice, web, journal) are present but do not reweight meaning at the end; they remain ornamental. The final paragraph offers a thematic summary ("power of calm defiance") that replaces scene pressure with moralizing, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—memory, reclamation, hidden patterns—is stated overtly in lines like "where deleted memories go" and "even in the darkest of times, there was always the possibility of rediscovery." The pressed wildflowers are mentioned as "tangible connection" but do not accumulate pressure or charge the final image through specific use. The ending moralizes gently ("the journey was far from over") rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is minimal; the protagonist's inner conflict and the thematic question are narrated rather than embodied in choice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of silence and tranquility emerges through repeated abstract claims ("smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "mapping silence") rather than concrete particulars that shift meaning. The crane's wing serves as a prop for cosmic energy rather than an image whose meaning reweights prior material. The ending restates the premise ("power of silence") in near-prompt language instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. No competing tensions or ambiguity invite reflection beyond the immediate declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "agreed upon lies" concept is explained as exposition rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. Theme emerges around hidden knowledge and generational transmission, but the final image (the glowing seal) leans toward symbolic convenience rather than earned particulars. The meteor shower and teaching session remain separate lyric moments without thematic friction or cost that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme (isolation to independence, memory as key to selfhood) is coherent and emerges from the seashell motif, but the final paragraphs state it directly: "Lyra's story was one of transformation, a journey from isolation to independence." The closing image (walking into morning light) offers visual beauty without reweighting prior material through a non-literal answer. Recurrence of the seashell and garden is present but operates as decorative reprise rather than a charged reconception with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.6)
    A coherent theme—art as subversion, forgiveness of the incomplete—emerges from imagery and the forger's task, but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "she had finally been able to forgive the unfinished" and "brought closure to the narrative." These declarative theme statements replace scene pressure and the ending offers no non-literal answer or resonant reconfiguration. The heritage rose becomes a symbol "of the beauty and complexity of the task," announced rather than earned. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6) applied for final-paragraph thesis articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme—connection, echoes, hidden truths—is stated rather than emergent from concrete particulars. "Webs of intrigue," "doors of perception," and "mysteries beyond understanding" are abstract placeholders. The ending delivers no resonant image that reweights prior material; instead it loops back to the opening's thesis in nearly identical language. No earned insight arises from specific struggle; the "voice that sang of mysteries" is unanchored meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of connection and salvage is stated directly ("weave these fragments into a tapestry of truth") rather than emerging from dramatized events. The snow globe as motif appears three times but never constrains a choice—it's ornamental recurrence, not resonance. The ending substitutes abstract hope ("sense of purpose," "promise of connections") for a concrete image that reweights prior material. No earned insight arises from specific struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme (hidden patterns underlying existence, appreciation of hidden effort) is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete action. The bamboo tea whisk and fireflies function as symbolic placeholders without charging the closure through specific choice or cost. The ending offers mood rather than a resonant reconfiguration; "the magic that lay just beneath the surface" is a generic platitude. Some atmospheric texture prevents collapse, but thematic work remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme ("excavate truth from comfortable lies") is stated directly in authorial summary rather than emerging from specific events. The "liquidation" and "carefully orchestrated event" are told as backstory exposition without on-page dramatization or moral calculus. The final paragraph delivers a thematic summary—"truth was far more complex and strange"—that replaces scene pressure with abstract declaration. No recurring image shifts meaning across the text; the stillpoint pulsates as a static symbol rather than a resonant object that reweights prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.4)
    "Variant allegiance" and "ancient shadows to shape a brighter tomorrow" are prompt labels repeated without embodiment in scene particulars. The ending states a moral ("legacy lived on, a beacon of hope") rather than offering a resonant image. No complexity, no counter-reading, no earned insight—just thematic echo. The cobalt portico's symbolic recurrence is decorative, not charged by a choice or reweighted cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—redemption through preservation, bridging generations—emerges from the glass jars and music box rather than abstract assertion, a strength. The final paragraph, however, resorts to direct statement: "he was the translator between generations," "lonesome splendor," ending with a thesis rather than a resonant image. The concept of "gleaned redemption" hovers as label; no particular choice embodies the gleaning. Subtext is thin; the poet's thoughts articulate theme rather than letting action and image carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Sonic absolution" and "fleshly ethereal" are invoked repeatedly as prompt labels without concrete grounding in action or image. No epiphany is earned; Azure's closing "peace" is asserted rather than dramatized through conflict and consequence. The final paragraph ("symbol of the fleshly ethereal world") moralizes rather than offering a resonant non-literal answer. Theme remains abstract and unearned, a thesis delivered without particulars that would make it legible through character and event.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme of patience versus impatience is stated directly ("sculpt patience from impatience") rather than emerging from concrete choices. The "patient revolution" and "unyoke" language feel prompt-derived and abstract; no particular action or micro-choice embodies the tension. The moon and viaduct recur but function as atmospheric symbols without shifting meaning at closure. The final image—hands raised, viaduct glowing, revolution "begun"—offers a declaration rather than a non-literal reweighting of prior material, resulting in thematic assertion over resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of freedom from the past is overtly stated ("break free from the controlling influence") and repeated in the inscription and final paragraphs rather than emerging from dramatized choices. The lantern's connection to the underground railroad is asserted as thematic resonance without specific historical detail or on-page cost. The ending offers a mood shift (peace) but not a non-literal answer to a dramatized question. The final line's symbolism (lantern's light fading) gestures toward meaning but does not reweight prior material since no prior material involved genuine conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (redemption, second chances) is stated overtly in the final paragraphs ("power of second opinions," "importance of turning apologies into action") rather than emerging from scene particulars. The clockwork heart functions as a symbolic convenience introduced midpoint to illustrate the theme, with no prior pressure or cost. The proprietor's aphorism ("by the way light breaks through storm clouds") is delivered as a moral rather than earned through conflict. No non-literal answer reweights prior material—the ending summarizes the lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (curiosity, yearning, harmony through understanding) is stated rather than earned through particulars. The arrow tip and kaleidoscope recur but do not shift meaning at closure; they remain ornamental. The final paragraph moralizes ("testament to the power of curiosity," "boundless potential") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext is absent; epiphanies are declared without specific struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—memory, absence, the persistence of the past—emerges from the archive setting and the recurring numbers motif. The final assertion that "the sensed absence...was no longer a source of pain" and "a reminder of what could be found" gestures toward thematic closure. However, the ending summarizes this shift rather than offering a resonant, non-literal image; the last lines drift into abstract philosophizing ("a hidden pattern in the fabric of the digital universe," "newfound sense of wonder and awe") that replaces scene pressure. The thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph ("she would continue to tend the corporate memory...with a newfound sense of wonder") reads as a thesis statement rather than earned particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—empathy mapped onto action, fragile balance, fragments hiding in plain sight—emerges through image and motif (mirrors, crystal, ice, breath). The reconstituted crystal offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question. However, the final paragraph ("in that moment…") lapses into direct thematic summary: "mapped empathy onto the shifting landscapes of the heart," "courageous anomaly had found a way to heal the fractures." This moralizing replaces earned resonance and triggers penalty per the Thematic Echo rule. Subtext operates in the mirrors and ice, but closure articulates rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of impermanence and second chances emerges from the premise but is stated rather than shown: "approaching endings" and "windborne solace" are repeated as labels without accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material. The final paragraph moralizes ("cherish every moment") instead of offering a resonant image. No epiphany is earned through specific on-page struggle; the protagonist simply decides peace is enough.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Destined mismatches" recurs as overt thematic statement rather than emerging from specific conflict: "not flaws, but rather the very essence," "truth that resonated deeply within her." The fragment's words are summarized, not dramatized, and the sentinel's realizations are told epiphanies disconnected from scene pressure. The final image restates the opening mood without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to a central question.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme is asserted through labels ("echo of wisdom," "whisperfield calm") rather than emerging from concrete events or images. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes the protagonist's role without earned resonance. No recurring image shifts meaning or reweights prior material; symbolic elements (parapet, clearing) are introduced and described but do not constrain choice or charge closure. The piece reads as a response to a prompt rather than a singular artistic stance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme of healing and beauty-in-decay is stated overtly ("transmute pain into a masterpiece," "power of art to heal") rather than emerging through image and action. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("The world… was a beautiful and wondrous place") instead of trusting particulars. No resonant non-literal answer or conceptual repricing reweights prior material; the closure is a summary restatement of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.6)
    The pattern of growth and suspended hush operate as thematic labels rather than emerging from concrete action. The crystal recurs but its "sonically reflective" property is asserted, not dramatized in a way that reweights prior material. The final image (city awakening, symphony of new beginnings) offers generic optimism without a resonant answer to the central question. No epiphany is earned through struggle; the scholar's "weathered innocence" is told, not shown through particular choice.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme (holding onto time, loss, memory) emerges from concrete images—videotapes, statues worn by weather, driftwood markers—rather than overt statement, which is a strength. However, the final paragraph drifts toward thematic summary ("The sound of growing older still lingered, a reminder of the journey") and the ending asserts resolution without dramatizing it. The chalk and driftwood recur with modest reweighting, but the "tidal longing" phrase itself becomes a label repeated without fresh development. The piece gestures toward Conceptual Repricing (the intangible sound as "living entity") but the conceptual cost remains abstract, not undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme of hope/peace in hospice care emerges clearly but through repeated assertion rather than particulars. The "scent of hope" functions as thematic label ("tangible presence," "heady mix") without grounding in a specific image that shifts meaning. Final paragraphs state resonance ("spirit remained," "power of music") instead of dramatizing it through a non-literal answer. The vinyl shard is mentioned three times but its "deep significance" and "new significance" are told, not earned through events that reweight prior material. Subtext is minimal; interiority often explains itself.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is asserted through repeated abstract labels—"sealed awakenings," "closing loops," "underlying order"—without emerging from concrete events or images. The clockwork key is called a "metaphor" rather than earning symbolic weight through specific action. The final paragraph delivers overt thematic summary ("mysteries that lay ahead") instead of a resonant image. No fresh inflection reweights prior material; the ending states a question rather than offering a non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.1)
    The central metaphor "turn mistakes into constellations" has thematic potential but remains abstract; it's stated twice without being embodied in a specific choice or image that reweights prior material. The piece gestures toward "nostalgia and innovation" creating "dynamic balance," yet this theme is announced rather than emerging from concrete action. The final image—the tooth glowing with "otherworldly light" as Emilia "yearns for the stars"—offers symbolic resonance but lacks the earned cost or contradiction that would make it reweigh the premise. Subtext is minimal; interiority overtly explains rather than implying.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "pearl of stillness" and "zephyr bloom" are stated repeatedly rather than emerging from specific events or images. The final line declares stillness but does not offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question—it simply restates the premise. Subtext is absent; every thematic note is articulated directly ("share this light," "transformative power of gentle dedication"). The ending lacks the concrete, charged particularity required for thematic elevation; it reads as an imposed thesis rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=4.6)
    The amber pendant and icicle pattern are mentioned as symbolic tokens but never constrain choice or accumulate pressure. The theme of healing is stated rather than earned from particulars: "protected vulnerability," "quietly proactive," and "honeyed hush" function as prompt labels echoed in the final paragraph without resonance. The ending moralizes directly ("she was ready to face whatever came next") instead of offering a non-literal answer through image or action. No thematic question is posed or reweighted at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated directly in final-paragraph moralizing: "she would carry the lessons," "the power of the subconscious," "the magic that lay just beyond." The shell and woman are symbolic tokens invoked repeatedly but never reweighted through specific action. The ending asserts "something true" and "resonance" rather than offering a non-literal answer to a dramatized question. The piece abstracts its own meaning instead of letting particulars speak.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of reconnection through forgotten traditions emerges from events, but the final paragraph ("weave the threads of community," "power of forgotten songs to remedy the soul") moralizes rather than trusting the image to resonate. The vine tendril recurs but remains symbolic decoration without constraining choice or charging the closure. "When everything aligns" is repeated as a conceptual claim rather than earned through particulars. The ending offers a tidy resolution ("profound and lasting change") that forecloses ambiguity and states the thesis outright.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (patience, transformation, beauty in desolation) emerges from imagery and the craft process, avoiding overt sermonizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("testament to the power of patience," "magic that unfolded while the world held its breath") rather than letting the image resonate. The plate's map is presented as triumph without ambiguity or cost, flattening potential complexity. No non-literal answer to a central question reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme ("storing wonder in the cellar of reason") is stated early and repeated at closure without transformation. The "harvest of echoes" concept operates as atmospheric label rather than dramatized friction. The ending image (ticking clockwork, glowing crystals, Elian's departure) offers a resonant mood but does not reweigh the premise—wonder is gathered, stored, and carried forward as initially desired, with no counter-pressure or irony. The piece invites reflection on curiosity and understanding but resolves into affirmation without complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is asserted rather than earned: "the weights of different burdens were not just a measure of the world's complexity, but a reflection of their own inner landscapes" is thesis-statement moralizing in place of scene pressure (−0.6). The kerosene lamp burner and tapestry function as symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic credit without prior causal work. The final image—grotto humming with "shingled hush"—recycles the opening motif without reweighting it through intervening particulars. No non-literal answer emerges from the character's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "here and gone" concept and the grief-containment theme emerge from concrete particulars (wood grain, kettle whisper, carving tool scrape) rather than overt statement. The final image—completed carving, silent kettle, "rust-hued peace"—attempts a non-literal answer but remains slightly abstract; the carving's form is described as capturing "the essence of her emotions" without showing what that essence looks like or how it reweights prior material. The thematic resonance is present but muted, avoiding both platitude and full embodiment of the conceptual cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.9)
    "Eroded ambitions" and "negotiate with one's own ghost" are stated as theme rather than emerging from specific events. The camera wheel returns at the end with symbolic charge ("newfound significance"), lifting the score slightly. However, the final lines over-articulate meaning: "a testament to the power of stillness," "the enduring power of human connection"—thesis statements that replace earned resonance. The piece invites reflection but through assertion, not image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme is over-articulated in prompt language: "equations for hope," "maze of intentions," "even in abandonment, there was beauty." The final paragraphs summarize theme mechanically ("a testament to the power of creativity," "always a way forward") instead of letting the terminal's transformation speak through image. The sextant's "soft, inner light" in the penultimate paragraph is symbolic convenience, not earned resonance. No counter-reading or moral complexity; the piece resolves into tidy uplift without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—peace with abandoned dreams, balance between mechanical and natural—emerges from the bear encounter and setting motifs. However, the final paragraphs articulate theme directly ("to harmonize the mechanical with the natural") rather than letting the image resonate. The closing lines summarize rather than offering a non-literal answer through action or charged image. Petrichor nostalgia and glacial hush recur but as labels rather than reweighted particulars that constrain choice. The piece leans toward abstraction at closure instead of grounding insight in concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("architecture of lies," hindsight clarity, serene upheaval) is overtly stated rather than emergent from concrete beats. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "thoughtfully clear understanding of the world, and her place within it." The sundial's "intricate mechanisms" and "ethereal light" signal meaning through stock symbolism rather than particular dramatic cost. "Silence of the morning radio" appears twice as an unexplained motif without reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of preservation and oceanic mystery is asserted through direct statements ("keeping the secrets of the ocean alive") rather than emerging from concrete events. The fulgurite glass and rope remain symbolic tokens without constraining choice or accumulating pressure that charges the closure. The final paragraph moralizes ("preserving the ancient methods") instead of offering a resonant image, and no earned insight arises from specific struggle—only generic satisfaction and label-only wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of healing/connection emerges through the garden, thread, and obituary motif, and the piece avoids overt moralizing. The final image (thread snap, peace) attempts non-literal resonance but lacks prior causal weight—no concrete struggle has occurred to charge the moment. The "lonesome splendor" phrase and "geography of healing" tilt toward prompt-echo abstraction rather than earned wisdom from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    The flawed-genesis theme is stated repeatedly ("the world was flawed, its genesis marred") rather than emerging from particulars. "Bitterly sweet nostalgia" and "quaking reverie" are abstract mood labels, not images that reweight prior material. The ending's "deep, abiding peace" is a label that replaces earned resonance; no non-literal answer crystallizes from the device or egg.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is stated rather than earned: "scars can sing" appears as a phrase Aria remembers, then the final paragraphs moralize about healing and compassion without scene pressure. The coin and black sand are symbolic tokens that do not constrain choice or accumulate meaning. The ending's "hope" and "healing" are asserted in abstract summary rather than arising from concrete particulars. The piece telegraphs its thesis instead of letting action and image generate resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of reclaiming forgotten history emerges from the premise, and the rebirth of the fountains offers a concrete image. However, the ending paragraph includes direct thematic statements ("keep its stories alive," "her realistically imaginative spirit guiding the way") rather than letting the final image speak. No fresh inflection or non-obvious angle complicates the straightforward arc of discovery and restoration. The stained glass box returns at the end but its meaning remains static rather than reweighted with cost or irony.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.1)
    The core theme—sharing illumination without destruction—is legible and returns in the final paragraph, but it arrives as direct statement ("true illumination came not from flames, but from the gentle, loving touch") rather than earned through dramatized friction. The calculating machine gear and sonar pinging could function as recurring motifs but are ornamental; generational patterns and infinity are invoked as labels without constraint on tactics. The final image ("approximated infinity, and shared its light without using fire") restates the premise rather than reweighting prior material with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—collective grief, beauty in death, life/death cycles—emerges through the butterflies, ribbon custom, and poem fragments, avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate line ("loss was a part of life, but that it was not the only part"). The final image of butterflies and the poem's whisper carries resonance, but the carver's "discovery" is asserted rather than dramatized, and the shape of grief remains a generic abstraction. The theme threads through particulars yet resolves into a tidy summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of "incremental absolution" is stated rather than earned through specific events. Recurring phrases ("restore shared balance," "searing reverie," "incremental absolution") function as thematic markers without grounding in action. The final image—Elara bathed in lunar light—offers mood but no non-literal answer to the central question; the ending summarizes the theme ("incremental absolution was within her grasp") instead of dramatizing it. The rake handle inscriptions provide convenient wisdom rather than complicating the protagonist's path.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme ("intentions behind echoes") is asserted in prompt language rather than emerging from particulars: "the gardener began to sense the shape of intentions" is diagnostic label-speak that replaces scene pressure. The final paragraph moralizes ("echoes were a reminder of the intentions that lay beyond") instead of offering a resonant image (−0.6). The antique case and tapestry are symbolic tokens without causal constraint, and no counter-reading or ambiguity resists tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme of transformation and future-writing is stated repeatedly ("groundedly imaginative," "seed innovation," "sustaining transformation") rather than emerging from particulars. The kingfisher feather quill nib recurs but doesn't shift meaning or constrain choice—it's a static prop. The ending offers no resonant answer or conceptual repricing, only the same poised moment restated. Thematic elements are prompt labels rather than dramatized insight.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.4)
    A theme of storytelling preservation and magical dust emerges through recurring images (dust motes, the radio dial, mist), and the final image of the waiting dial offers mild resonance. However, the ending states rather than reweights: "her work would continue to nurture the magic" is direct thematic summary rather than a non-literal image that answers the central question. The piece leans toward atmosphere over earned insight, and the thistled calm is asserted rather than dramatized through conflict and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "mirage of safety" appears as a label in narration and again in summary: "The memory…stays with her, a poignant reminder of the mirage of safety." The mask and scattering supply concrete images, but the piece never dramatizes an earned epiphany—Lena's final realization is stated rather than discovered through on-page struggle. The theme is asserted, not emergent from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of competing narratives is stated explicitly—"official story" versus "Kael's version"—rather than emerging from dramatized events. The cog and ruins gesture toward transience and folly but are not woven into a non-literal answer at closure. The final paragraph moralizes ("rationally rebellious spirit, driven to question") instead of charging an image. Some resonance exists in the juxtaposition of decay and Kael's perverse peace, but it remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—harmony through embracing differences, preserving vanishing arts—is stated overtly rather than emerging from concrete choice and conflict. The rosette as symbol of "woven threads" is spelled out mid-text, eliminating subtext. The final image offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; it merely reasserts the premise ("music would continue to resonate"). Emilia's final smile and determination mirror her opening stance, so no conceptual repricing or resonant reconfiguration occurs—only thematic echo and declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of rebirth from decay is stated overtly in the final paragraphs ("healing," "nurtured a piece of the future") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The knowledge fruit seed functions as a symbolic convenience introduced mid-story to illustrate the theme rather than constrain choice. Thematic Echo penalty: the final lines articulate the thesis in prompt-like language ("gentle rebellion," "beauty forged from ruins") that replaces scene pressure. Apply −0.6 for sermonizing in closure paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme—failures as sources of wonder and resilience—is coherent but delivered through direct statement ("Sometimes, it's the failures that preserve wonder in routine") rather than image or enacted irony. The beehive's "adaptation" and the city's "imbalance" are told as concepts without concrete embodiment or trade-off. The lacquer box and matchbox recur but do not accumulate reweighted meaning; they function as tokens. The final image (the toll keeper standing vigilant, tower as "catalyst for connection") offers mild resonance but lacks the specificity or cost-driven particulars that would make the theme feel earned rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of sanctifying space and discovering aliveness is stated repeatedly in abstract language ("shard of hush," "hushed blaze of energy," "living, breathing entity") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The orris root shard is given symbolic weight through the perfumer's explanation but never dramatized in a way that reweights prior material. The final paragraph shifts into direct thematic summary ("she had been forever changed") that replaces scene pressure. The piece gestures toward mystery but resolves into telling rather than resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.3)
    A coherent theme—resilience, adaptation, nuance over certainty—emerges from the garden's decay-to-life arc and the statue's role as catalyst. However, the final paragraphs over-articulate the theme in near-thesis statements: "a testament to the power of adaptability," "symbol of the power of nuance," "transformative power of cascading revelations." These meta-summaries replace earned resonance with explanation. The foxglove ampoule, though visually specific, is mentioned twice without accumulating meaning or constraining a later choice—ornamental recurrence, not thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("perpetual motion," "boundless confinement," "grim optimism") is repeatedly stated in abstract philosophical language rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The dice and staircase are treated as symbolic tokens without accumulating pressure or shifting meaning at closure. No non-literal answer to a central question emerges; the final lines offer only a restatement of the premise. The closing paragraph devolves into thematic echo ("grim optimism that would forever drive me forward").

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme—connection and kindness amid urban alienation—is stated overtly in multiple paragraphs rather than emerging from particulars. The lost languages function as a declared symbol without constraining choice or accumulating pressure. The ending offers a moral summary ("beauty and connection were always within reach") instead of a resonant non-literal answer. The calligrapher's brush and "saffron quiet" are introduced as atmospheric tokens without earned recurrence or reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme of cultural preservation and displaced persons is stated repeatedly ("importance of preserving cultural heritage," "memories of the displaced persons") rather than emerging from particulars. The bread sculptures and opera glass are symbolic tokens without thematic friction or choice-level integration. The phrase "rosewater dread" and "displaced persons" read as prompt labels rather than earned resonance. No non-literal answer to a central question; the ending moralizes Elena's guardian role explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of stepping beyond fate and transformation is stated explicitly in the final paragraphs rather than emerging from particulars. The hunger stone and yoyo function as magical keys that unlock power without moral calculus or ambiguity. "Latent radiance" and "bleak exhilaration" are invoked as labels but not embodied in image or action. The ending moralizes ("a reminder of the power that lay hidden") instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme of confronting fear and "repulsive allure" is repeatedly stated ("trick fear," "confronting the dark recesses," "terror that lurked within") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The opera cloak clasp and photographically cursed model are introduced as potential motifs but never constrain choice or accumulate pressure. The final image offers no resonant, non-literal answer—only restatement ("funhouse is always waiting"). Thematic echo in "forever marked by the experience" articulates thesis without scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of transformation and resonance is stated repeatedly ("turn obstacles into instruments," "hidden harmony," "synthesis of sound and atmosphere") rather than earned through concrete particulars. The final image—stars twinkling, orchard afloat—offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; it restates the mood without friction or cost. Thematic echo in the final third ("a testament to the prophet's art") replaces scene pressure with summary assertion. No counter-reading or complexity emerges; the piece declares its own profundity without dramatizing insight or paying conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of inquiry into forbidden knowledge and confronting the unknown emerges through particulars: the rusted gate, the lost expedition's code, the silent watchers. The cracking shell and map discovery ground the thematic question in concrete events. Lyra's journey outward offers a resonant image of stepping into dread without a stated moral. However, "quietly driven" and "sunwashed dread" hover near label-speak, and the ending's defiant whistle-blow feels gestural rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The watchers' silence remains evocative but thematically unresolved—more atmospheric than a conceptual cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of noble lies vs. truth is stated overtly ("noble lies," "pit of lies," "rescue truth") rather than emerging from scene particulars. The illuminated letter shifts from relic to "key" but the thematic weight is asserted, not demonstrated through a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The final triumph is tidy and declarative ("small but significant victory") without ambiguity or conceptual cost. Subtext is absent; all meaning is narrated directly. The piece tells its thesis instead of earning resonance through embodied choice and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of absence and preservation emerges through repeated abstract language ("interlaced absence," "stories untold," "testament to the past") rather than from concrete, on-page choices. The final image (inkwell left behind, "empty, yet full of stories") gestures toward resonance but lacks the on-page cost or reweighting needed to earn it. The piece tells its thematic concerns rather than letting them arise from pressure and particulars. No earned insight emerges from struggle; the surveyor's reflection feels externally imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.3)
    A theme of reclaiming forgotten knowledge emerges from the setting and Elara's task, and the ink stamp accrues modest symbolic weight as a "tangible connection to the past." However, the final paragraph lapses into abstraction ("dappled resolve," "lessons she had learned") and moralizes the journey without a resonant non-literal image. The "alternative hypothesis" and code-breaking remain plot mechanics rather than thematic particulars that reweight the premise. No tension between wants and needs or competing goods sharpens the peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of grief-as-craft emerges through concrete images (lanterns, cranes, gem polishing) and avoids overt moralizing in the final paragraph. However, "luminous torment" and similar phrases veer toward poetic abstraction rather than particular experience. The crane release offers a visual answer to the thematic question but lacks the narrative cost that would make the answer resonate beyond metaphor. Backstory about the shadow remains generic sorrow rather than specific loss.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of "unused potential" is stated repeatedly ("unused potential that had led to her wedding's destruction") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The geode crystal is forced into symbolic duty without organic integration. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "unfiltered awakening had been a brutal awakening, but it had also given her a chance to rediscover herself" and "illuminating the path ahead, and beckoning her towards a brighter tomorrow." Thematic Echo penalty applies (−0.6): prompt language like "unfiltered awakening" is repeated verbatim in lines 28 and 29.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of belonging emerges organically from the search for connection and is woven through imagery (stars, ancient seekers, the frequency itself). However, the ending States the theme overtly: "frequency of belonging was not just a signal, but a sense of connection to the land, to the people, and to the universe itself" and "she had finally found the missing piece that had been within her all along." This replaces scene pressure with platitude. The contrast between ancient and modern technology offers potential resonance but remains decorative. No non-literal final image reweights prior material—just direct thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.4)
    The concept "sieved hush" is articulated and the carvings are framed as "a manifestation" of it, but this remains thematic claim rather than dramatic demonstration. The watch hand recurs but does not accumulate new meaning at closure. The final image ("the watch hand glinted, a small but potent symbol of the truth that was to come") states future significance rather than reweighting prior material. Theme is present but not earned through specific, on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom is stated repeatedly ("recycle their mistakes," "past was not forgotten, but learned from") rather than emerging from specific event or image. The final paragraph moralizes ("mistakes of the past could be recycled into wisdom") instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. The antique drawer pull and moon phases are symbolic gestures without thematic friction or charged reprise that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme (letting go to move forward) is stated overtly multiple times: "sometimes, it's necessary to let go of the past in order to navigate the present." The broken compass as symbol is convenient rather than earned through on-page friction. The final paragraph moralizes ("one stroke of the paddle at a time") instead of offering a non-literal image that reweights the question. Epiphany is asserted, not dramatized through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of empathy in darkness and the labyrinth-of-choices metaphor are explicitly stated rather than emerging from concrete events. The signed baseball and bioluminescent glow function as symbolic objects without meaningfully constraining choice or reweighting at closure. "Empathy can be found where the light is dimmest" operates as a guiding principle told to the reader, not discovered through struggle. The ending offers no resonant, non-literal answer—only an assertion that Lena's purpose has clarified and her past is lifting, a summary rather than an image that reprices prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of transformation and cosmic connection emerges from the ritual and metamorphosis imagery. The fortune-cookie line ("Change is coming, seek transformation") functions as a thematic billboard rather than earning resonance through scene particulars. The ending offers a generic meditation on "mysteries beyond the veil" instead of a non-literal, image-based answer to Lyra's central question. The "paradoxically steady" motif is stated twice but never tested under pressure—Lyra remains calm throughout, so the paradox is claimed, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of lost time and repentance emerges through recurring images (crack, hand-tracings, mist), and the piece avoids overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("a testament to the power of cloudbound repentance") rather than letting the image stand alone. The ending does not offer a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with visible cost; instead it asserts meaning ("lost time accumulates in the spaces between memories") without dramatizing consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Shadow work" is invoked as a theme label without dramatization; the piece never shows repressed thoughts creating friction or cost. The Kwan Yin's Tear recurs but as a mood ring, not a constraint. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "a testament to the enduring power of shadow work"—a thematic echo that replaces earned resonance. No concrete particulars ground the abstraction of "transformative power of love."

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated directly and repeatedly: "texture of transformation," "complex web of connections," "the universe was orchestrating coincidences." The bottled lightning bugs recur but remain decorative symbols without accumulating pressure or reweighting prior action. The final paragraph moralizes ("the world was always in motion, always transforming") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer through image. No earned wisdom from concrete struggle; epiphany is asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme of revolution and creative freedom is stated repeatedly ("silent revolution," "freedom and creativity," "challenge the status quo") rather than enacted through conflicting choices or images that reweight prior material. The bronze quill holder is introduced as a "tangible connection to whispers" but never returns with altered meaning or cost. The ending moralizes: "The darkness had been vanquished, and a new era had begun" without ambiguity or a non-literal final image. Motifs (light, sparks, whispers) are ornamental, not pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme ("sacred patterns," "borrowed dawn") is stated rather than emergent from concrete action. The "vision" and "secrets revealed" are asserted without specific discovery that reweights prior material. The final image—herder vanishing, rocks left behind—gestures at resonance but remains abstract. No earned insight arises from struggle; the piece moralizes completion without dramatizing what was learned or sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme (self-knowledge, hidden patterns, masks slipping) is stated repeatedly—"cartography of scars," "the masks...were beginning to slip," "hidden contours"—rather than arising from concrete actions. The darkroom timer and envelope recur but as symbols without friction; they do not constrain or reweight the ending image beyond label-level resonance. The final "peace" and "understanding" are asserted directly ("she felt a sense of understanding wash over her") instead of offered through a non-literal image or question. Some conceptual ambition in the vigil-in-pause frame, but execution leans toward thematic echo rather than earned particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme is stated rather than emergent: "the true victory lay not in winning, but in the journey itself" and "turn questions into destinations" are repeated as labels without concrete grounding in on-page choices. The danish tin sewing needle card is called "a symbol of the intricate web of thoughts" but never used in a way that dramatizes that connection. The final paragraph ("dignified chaos," "unyielding pursuit of knowledge") moralizes instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of forging beauty from anarchy and the blooming resistance motif are stated multiple times but never earn resonance through concrete stakes or cost. The poet's "molting personalities" and the coffee tin with scraps gesture toward transformation, yet the piece delivers tidy fulfillment (library reborn, city on the path to healing) rather than ambiguity or earned wisdom. The final image of "luminous fracture" and dawn is lyric but does not reweight prior material; it restates the premise without interrogating it. Thematic statements ("to forge beauty from anarchy," "power of art and imagination") replace scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of time, memory, and refuge emerges through the broken clock, the film's hidden world, and the recurring mist. The final image of the flickering compasses and the ticking clock attempts resonance, but the prior material does not build enough specific conflict to reweight it—"surprise fate" and "steely longing" are asserted rather than earned through concrete choices. The film refuge functions symbolically but is introduced and resolved within a single atmospheric pass, lacking the friction or cost that would deepen thematic complexity. No overt moralizing, but the ending's emotional pivot ("heart no longer heavy") tells rather than shows the conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme of collective memory preservation is stated rather than explored through tension or cost. The story avoids dramatizing the "doubt" beyond one rhetorical question, then immediately dismisses it ("Aria pressed on"). The knowledge fruit seed and monsoon could function as recurring images but are used ornamentally; neither constrains choice or charges the final image with fresh meaning. The ending's "luminous doubt had given way to deep conviction" tells the thematic arc without earning it through specific struggle or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges through the recurring motif of tides and the cerulean hue, and the lace pattern attempts to literalize emotional work. Yet the final image—releasing the compass—delivers a stated peace rather than a resonant reconfiguration; the ending explains rather than enacts. The story avoids overt moralizing but substitutes thematic echo ("tides of remembrance," "color of unspoken apologies") for earned insight from specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of vulnerability as power emerges through events and images (seashell, shadows), not just statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via "truth is in the shadows," but explicit moralizing ("to prove that vulnerability is power") in mid-beat reduces subtlety.

Subtext operates through images like the violin symbolizing frozen beauty and growth. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Zeta's realization. Some thematic statements verge on explicit, but avoid sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the dresser's actions and the marbles' symbolism, exploring nurturing and memory without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "mended deception" and the garden's response, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer about cyclical life. Avoids abstraction through concrete particulars like the cracked marbles.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of discovery and time's fluidity emerges through particulars like the nexus and winged creatures, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Kaelin's transformed perspective, reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through images and events, exploring boundaries between reality and performance without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Rachel's peace, and subtext operates in the water damage and music, avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars like the illustration and data analysis, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—truth as provisional—reweighting prior material without statement. Subtext operates in images and implication, embracing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of hidden truths emerges organically from the explorer's journey and the radio confession, with subtext in silence and revelation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the logbook discovery, avoiding moralizing. Integration is strong, but some elements like the ghost shift remain more thematic than deeply woven.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of transience and silence emerges organically from particulars like the refuge and burrowing, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of crumbling peace. No moralizing; subtext operates through implication and image.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)

    Theme of memory and cultural identity emerges organically through images like the seed and dreams, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with the monsoon purifying memories. Subtext in Aria's doubt enriches complexity, and the final image reweights prior material without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of remembrance and forgiveness emerges organically through symbols (compass, lace) without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the released object, reweighting prior material. Subtext in gestures like murmuring instructions enriches complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of gradual change, decay as both destructive and creative, and reality “preprocessing itself” are clear and coherent, with the butterfly dust and flood sediment providing apt images. However, the story repeatedly states its theses directly (“She had come to realize that decay was not just a destructive force, but also a creative one”), drifting into essayistic exposition. Subtext is minimal; the piece tells us what its symbols mean rather than letting them accrue implication through dramatized tension. The closing sense of peace does offer some resonance, but without much ambiguity or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of legacy, stillness, and finding “purpose in the pauses” are explicit and consistent, but heavily told rather than emerging from subtext. Phrases like “she felt an overwhelming desire to discover purpose in the pauses” and “the world… had become a source of peace” state the thesis outright. The recurring images (stars, frost, ledger) support the theme, yet seldom complicate it or introduce ambiguity. The ending offers a clear moral satisfaction but little lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of resilience, art as adaptation, and finding “unshaken marvels” in catastrophe emerge coherently from the conservatory, the tactile music, and the closing image. However, much of the thematic weight is carried by explicit statement (“a symphony of silence, a beautiful, wordless language...”) rather than subtext and implication. The ending tips toward sentimentality by summarizing what the music “means” instead of letting charged images fully carry it. There is resonance, but not the layered complexity or ambiguity expected at the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of rest, stillness, and sanctuary are consistent and clearly tied to both the undertaker’s vocation and the beacon’s function. However, they are frequently articulated in direct thematic language (“giving rest a permanent address,” “a shining monument to the power of stillness”) rather than emerging through implication and image. The shift from “distress signal” to “invitation to rest” is a solid thematic move but is explained instead of allowed to resonate subtextually. The piece edges toward sermonizing in the final paragraphs, reducing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of solidarity, anonymous generosity, and intergenerational care are clear but come across as declared theses rather than emergent from action. Lines like “We will not be broken by the actions of others” and repeated assurances that they will be “stronger and more united than ever” edge into sermonizing. The silver bell and arbor could carry subtext about fragile, hard-won community, yet the prose tells us the meaning instead of letting it resonate obliquely. The ending offers reassurance more than a complex or unsettling reweighting of what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece is thematically coherent, circling compassion, inner healing, and the idea that love is stored within one’s own heart. However, much of the thematic content is explicitly stated (“The love you seek is within…,” “new path… wound through the realms of the heart”), tipping into platitude instead of letting images and actions imply it. The wisteria, the tear, and the camera obscura offer good symbolic potential but are not fully leveraged for layered subtext. The ending lands as sincere but somewhat sentimental and didactic rather than quietly resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of time, perception, and integration of cosmic knowledge into human craft are present, but they’re mostly delivered as abstractions and thesis statements. Phrases like “underlying fabric of reality” and “metaphysical odyssey” lean toward pseudo-profound rather than being earned by specific, dramatized experience. There’s a mild conceptual repricing—the idea that maze design can embody reconfigured time—but it doesn’t significantly reweight prior images. The piece gestures toward profundity without quite landing a fresh, felt insight.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of hope, resilience, and the difference between mere freedom and a nurtured future are clear and coherent. However, they are spelled out in explicit moralizing (“true freedom was not just the absence of barriers, but the presence of hope”) rather than earned through conflict and specific, fraught choices. Symbolic elements (wall, seeds, arrow) serve as direct emblems rather than evolving, ambiguous motifs. The ending reinforces the thesis but offers little surprise or complexity in how it reframes prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of grief, memory, and transformation of emotional trauma into tools for healing are coherent and aligned with the premise. However, they’re often delivered in generalized, near-moralizing statements (“a reminder that even in the darkest moments, there was a way forward”) rather than emerging from concrete, conflicted scenes. The connection between “trust breaking” as a wound and as a catalyst is interesting but remains conceptual. The final sense of hope is pleasant but leans toward sentimentality rather than earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme circles around destiny whispering in silence, the magic of liminal light, and the idea that illuminated moments hold hidden secrets. However, this is often stated outright (“destiny whispers secrets in the silence,” “a testament to the power of luminous disbelief”) rather than emerging from dramatized choices or consequences. Because there is little conflict or cost, the closing sense of “one step closer to understanding” lands as a gentle assertion instead of an earned insight. The result is pleasant but verges on pseudo-profound rather than sharply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of renewal, healing from emotional frost, and creating “safe zones for inquiry” are cohesive and clearly present. However, they are delivered with significant explicitness (“thawing heart,” “true calling”) and repeated rather than deepened, edging toward sermonizing. Symbolism (thawing world, glass orb, cracked bookmark) is evocative but often explained instead of being allowed to resonate through implication. The ending offers a gentle affirmation rather than a complex or surprising reweighting of the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of identity, fear, and “vulnerability is power” are explicit and consistent, and the “truth is in the shadows” line has potential as a reweighting motif. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis instead of letting it emerge from action (“I was driven by a desire to prove that vulnerability is power,” “I was ready to… prove that I was more than just a phobia-ridden stunt double”). The final paragraphs largely explain the moral rather than letting the image of leaving the library and the charged objects carry it. This direct moralizing undercuts complexity and lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of silence as language, narrative as world-shaping, and making darkness comprehensible are coherent and embedded in recurring images (“ambered hush,” the map, the booklet). The ending’s slight brightening of the world aligns with an implicit claim that attentive telling can re-chart fear into understanding. Yet the lack of genuine opposition or inner conflict makes this insight feel granted rather than earned, skirting close to gentle pseudo-profundity. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t quite push into a complex or unsettling moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of emergent consciousness, second chances, and purpose arising from mundane labor are present and coherent. However, they are heavily told—phrases like "a testament to the power of the second chance program" and "had found a new sense of purpose" verge on thesis-statement territory. The violin and frozen courtyard offer potentially rich subtext, but the story often names their meaning instead of letting it emerge implicitly. The ending lands more as articulated moral than as an image that quietly reweights all that came before.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of transparency, truth, and being “freed by honesty” are overt and consistent, with clear image systems (lens, crystal, doodles) pointing to seeing/decoding. However, they’re heavily spelled out in abstract language (“thaw mistrust with transparency,” “beauty that lay in transparency”) rather than allowed to arise through subtext or conflict. The ending essentially restates the thesis instead of offering a surprising or reweighting image. The piece is thematically coherent but veers into moralized exposition rather than layered resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of reciprocity between caretaker and land, the measurability of luck versus quiet devotion, and beauty in withering emerge clearly and consistently. The marbles as memory-objects add a nice layer of subtext around reclamation and past loss. However, the piece leans heavily on abstract statements (“a truth that was both simple and profound,” “stood as a monument”) instead of letting events and images fully carry the insight. The result feels sincere but edges toward sentimentality and explicit moralizing rather than layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of scientific wonder, discovery, and awakening (mirrored by the torpid winged creatures) are coherent and appropriate to the premise. The recurrence of “hush of beating wings at rest” and “icy warmth” offers a modest symbolic through-line about dormancy and new purpose. However, the piece leans on explicit statements (“she had uncovered a secret that would change the course of human understanding forever”) rather than letting images and consequences carry the weight. The insight that she now “will never see the universe in the same way again” is more told than deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.6)
    Themes of liminality (“in between spaces”), the bleed between music and reality, and art as a bridge across time are clear and coherent. However, they’re often stated directly (“which stood at the threshold between the worlds of music and silence”) rather than emerging subtextually from concrete action. The ending’s sense of peace and transformation leans toward sentimentality because it arrives without much cost or complexity. The piece invites some reflection on art and haunting, but doesn’t quite push into richer ambiguity or harder insight.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of provisional truth, liminality, and the power of uncertainty are cohesive and reinforced through recurring motifs (margins, weather, the rare alpine flower, the logbook). However, they are heavily explicit: lines like “The truth was not a fixed or determinate thing, but rather a fluid, context-dependent construct” verge on essayistic thesis-stating rather than emerging from scene. The auroral sorrow at the end has genuine poignancy, but its emotional aftereffect is muted by repetition of the same idea in similar abstractions. Subtext exists in the margins/collaboration motif, yet much of the thematic work is done in direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of hidden truths, industrial ghosts, and the residue of labor are coherent and threaded via the “factory ghost shift” idea and the swallowed truth motif. Yet the piece tends to state its thematic material directly (“weight of the swallowed truth,” “find what they were looking for”) rather than letting subtext arise from concrete specifics. The ending offers a mild repricing—from drowsy alertness to clarity—but without a fresh or surprising angle on secrecy or skepticism. The resonance is present but familiar and somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of silence, decay, witness without judgment, and the beauty of transience are coherent and tightly aligned with setting and action. However, they are frequently stated outright (“a testament to the power of stillness,” “a reminder that even in the midst of turmoil, peace could be found”) rather than earned solely through image and event. This explicitness flattens potential ambiguity and reduces subtext. The piece invites some reflection but stops short of a fresh or surprising thematic reconfiguration at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of “ordinary magic,” connection to nature, and nurturing lifelong wonder are coherent and consistent. However, they are heavily told rather than emerging through complex particulars or friction, with phrases like “power of ordinary magic to transform lives” and “nurture lifelong wonder” reading as thesis statements. The ending emotional effect is gentle and pleasant, but veers toward sentimentality and simplicity. There’s little resistance or ambiguity to deepen the thematic resonance beyond affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of memory, post-human quiet, and the preservation of stories are present but handled in abstract language (“a era of quiet contemplation and introspection,” “world both familiar and strange”). The motif of walls whispering and the “last human dream” hints at a larger, poignant frame but remains underdeveloped and undramatized. The ending offers a gentle echo—Emilia leaves with the “bronze quiet” inside her—but without prior concrete tests or costs, the resonance is modest. The piece avoids overt moralizing but settles for a generalized, almost platitudinous reverence for stories.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of “open secrets,” prophecy, and language that “expresses the inexpressible” are visible and consistent, and the microdot specs as a potential new language is a potentially rich metaphor. However, these ideas are mostly stated outright (“open secrets – truths hidden in plain sight”) rather than earned through specific images or reversals. The ending asserts that a truth has been uncovered and will guide the Oracle’s craft, but the nature or cost of that truth is never dramatized. Resonance is conceptual rather than emotional, leaving a mild aftertaste rather than a sharp reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.3)
    Themes of sound vs. silence, simplicity, and perceiving “underlying truths” recur, but they are mostly told outright (“a reminder of the power of sound and silence to shape the world”). The story frequently names its own meanings instead of letting them emerge from concrete choices. This generates a sermon-like quality and flattens any potential ambiguity or moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of memory, artistic vocation, and the blurred line between reality and reflection are coherent and consistently threaded through the spire, map, and mirrored horizon. However, the story often states its ideas directly (“testament to the power of creativity,” “beauty that could be achieved when the boundaries… were blurred”) rather than letting them emerge from action and image. The final realization about becoming the “conductor of unheard symphonies” has some resonance but borders on slogan-like. Subtext is present but undercut by overt thematic declaration and repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of self-confrontation, integration of fragmented identities, and the burden/power of eternity are apparent and coherent. However, the treatment leans heavily on overt abstractions (“labyrinth of self,” “fractured timelines,” “reshape the fabric of reality”) without grounding them in specific, lived particulars. The ending’s “world was remade” and “figure of darkening brightness” imagery gestures toward conceptual repricing but doesn’t reweight earlier moments with a surprising or complex nuance. It reads more like a prompt-fulfillment meditation than a layered thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of silence as a form of music, the coexistence of damage (broken needle) and beauty, and the search for feeling in a soundless world are coherent and tied to concrete objects. Recurring images—the cavern as womb, the needle, the seasons—support a meditation on hidden rhythms and interior healing. However, the piece frequently states its themes outright (“a testament to the power of silence and the beauty of the unseen”), edging into summary rather than letting resonance arise fully from scene and image. The moral/emotional takeaway is moving but somewhat tidy and under-complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of solitude, integrity, and the responsibility to act on dangerous knowledge are present but mostly stated outright (“nurture integrity in solitude,” “couldn’t ignore the truth”) instead of arising organically from action. The contrast between layered tranquility and underlying menace has potential but is not pushed into morally complex territory. Her final clarity and determination read more like a generic epiphany than an insight wrung from concrete, painful choice. The story invites some reflection but doesn’t linger with a distinct or surprising moral texture.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of memory, loss, and the evocative power of scent are coherent and supported by recurring images (vial, light, extinct plants). However, the text leans on explicit articulation—“she had finally grasped the impact of memories”—instead of letting the images and actions imply that understanding. Subtext is minimal; the story tends to explain what its symbols mean rather than trusting ambiguity. The ending lands emotionally but with a somewhat generic, sentimental gloss rather than a freshly sharpened insight.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme—time as textured, choice as ever-present but newly foregrounded by the energy beings—is clear, but it is largely delivered through direct exposition (“The energy beings…were not a disruption, but a catalyst”). Recurring images (rope, stones, texture of time) aim for resonance yet are explained rather than allowed to accrue subtext through concrete conflict. The finale leans into generalized uplift (“canvas waiting to be filled”) that edges toward platitude instead of earned complexity. Ambiguity about what adaptation or resistance might cost blunts the thematic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of beauty in imperfection, the healing power of art, and community versus isolation are clear and threaded through the bowl, the chronic hush, and the bonfire. However, they are often stated outright (“a beauty that was not polished or perfect, but raw and honest”) rather than left to emerge from image and action. The repeated abstractions about hush, beauty, and transformation veer toward sermonizing in the final third. Subtext is present but thin; the piece resolves into a tidy affirmation rather than a complex, lingering tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of authenticity versus fabrication, “half truths,” and fusing insight with empathy are coherent and threaded through the imagery and job description. The notion that even artificial emotions are rooted in something genuine has some quiet resonance. However, much of this is directly stated (“The half truths she created were not lies, exactly…”) rather than earned through conflict, and there’s little complexity or counter-pressure. The ending gently reinforces the theme but does not deepen it in a surprising way.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of “cycles of compassion” is explicit, coherent, and consistent with the events. However, it’s largely asserted in lines like “a poignant reminder of the cycles of compassion” rather than earned through difficult choices or irony. The piece leans toward moralizing uplift, leaving little ambiguity or complexity. The ending reaffirms the premise but doesn’t significantly deepen or complicate it.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—art as a vehicle for kinship and belonging—is coherent and reinforced by repeated motifs like “webs of kinship” and the arbor as symbol. Yet much of the thematic work is done via explicit statement (“a testament… a reminder of the importance of connection and belonging”) rather than through implication or charged scene work. The final paragraphs tip into moralizing summary, flattening ambiguity and subtext. There is little sense of competing values or unresolved complexity; belonging arrives as uncomplicated reward.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of time, art, and hidden city rhythms are coherent and supported by recurring images (canal cadence, echoes, the pendant, the giant’s nap). The final insight—that her art will henceforth reflect the city’s buried magic—does emerge from what she experiences, though it’s expressed in somewhat generalized, quasi-mystical language. The piece leans toward gentle wonder rather than a complex or morally fraught reweighting of its premise.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of ambiguous loss, hidden harmonies, and cautiously renewed faith in discovery are coherent and consistent from start to finish. The final revaluation of the orchard from a site of loss to a “realm of possibility” offers a genuine, if quiet, thematic closure. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit abstractions (“mathematics of emotion,” “buried optimism”) rather than letting meaning emerge from specific, dramatized choices. This produces a mildly pseudo-profound feel and blunts the subtextual power that the imagery could carry on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of visibility, care from the margins, and the power of sense memory are coherent and recur (tape scent → childhood → renewed purpose → whispered rumor). However, the piece edges toward abstraction and soft moralizing in the final lines (“there was always hope,” “power of being seen”), telling the takeaway rather than letting images carry it. Subtext—this unseen laborer as guardian/spirit of the library—is present but not deeply complicated or questioned. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and pleasant, but the thematic complexity remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of growth, renewal, and embracing change are consistent and clearly aligned with the plant imagery. However, they’re often delivered as outright thesis statements (“transformation was not just a destination, but a continuous process”; “transformation was a journey worth undertaking”), edging into sermonizing rather than emerging from subtext. The linden leaf and trellis reprise do create a faint resonant echo, but the message feels familiar and platitudinous. Complexity or ambiguity around the cost of change is largely omitted.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of trauma, balance, and art as a vessel for meaning after catastrophe are present and coherent, especially in framing the brooch as a symbol of disrupted/restored balance. However, they are frequently articulated in abstract terms (“a testament to the power of the unearthed convergence”) rather than emerging through concrete, conflicted moments. The brooch’s integration into the final painting offers some genuine resonance. Moral and emotional complexity remain relatively tidy, limiting lingering aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme—that profound magic resides in quiet, everyday forces and should be magnified for others—is clear but heavily over-explained, especially in the final paragraphs (“that the most profound magic lies not in the grand gestures of the universe…”). Subtext is thin; the story tells us its philosophy rather than allowing images and moments to suggest it. The closing realization fits the premise but reads as a tidy moral rather than an earned, ambivalent insight.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of remembrance, communal resilience, and the reconstruction of identity via shared narrative are clear and coherent. However, they are often declared in near-abstract terms (“a testament to the power of remembrance,” “the resilience of the human spirit”) rather than emerging from specific, dramatized frictions or morally complicated choices. The valve as a symbolic throughline has potential but never forces a difficult reckoning; nostalgia is uniformly positive. The result is sincere but edges into sentimentality and didactic phrasing, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of transformation, new beginnings, and the pursuit of hidden truth are clear and coherent, especially via the hour that “divides bad habits and new starts.” However, they are expressed in fairly generic, declarative language rather than emerging from textured, specific struggle, and there’s little ambiguity or counterpressure. The ending moral—she is forever changed, the world now “full of possibility”—lands as unnuanced uplift. Symbolic elements (vault, mist, ticket punch) hint at richer subtext but are not developed beyond their surface associations.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of perception, memory, and hidden patterns beneath reality are consistent, and the whales/tile/tower triad is a promising symbolic mesh. However, the story leans heavily on abstract claims (“very fabric of reality,” “intricate web of memories,” “eternal symphony of the sea”) rather than letting concrete events embody these ideas. The ending’s “newfound appreciation for the mysteries that lay just beyond the edge of perception” reads as a stated takeaway rather than an earned, specific insight. Ambiguity is gentle but also safe; there’s little ethical or emotional complexity to linger with.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of goodbye as transformation is explicit and consistent, but handled in a literal, platitudinous way (“the concept of goodbye was not an end, but a transformation”). The duplicate’s line “I am what remains after goodbye” is a thesis statement rather than a layered, ambiguous moment. The imagery (colors, echoes, multiverse) hints at richer subtext about self-division and continuity, yet the story explains instead of trusting implication. As a result, resonance is present but shallow and somewhat didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of justice versus grift and the “mathematics of a fair trade” are explicit and coherent, with the ink pot as a recurring image tying them together. However, the story leans on statement (“The mathematics of a fair trade was a complex equation…”) more than on dramatized moral calculus in action. The ending offers a clear stance—risking breach to “see justice done”—but the resonance feels lightly sketched rather than deeply reweighted by prior particulars. Subtext around Lena’s inheritance of her father’s methods is present but under-explored.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.0)
    Ideas about “invented histories” and the “textures” of moments are intriguing, but they’re mostly stated rather than dramatized through conflict or consequence. The theme gestures toward the value and fragility of perception, yet no scene forces a hard choice or reveals a hidden cost to this obsessive cataloguing. The final image (a notepad of latent stories, forest quiet again) offers some resonance but not a revaluation of what came before. It feels thoughtful but somewhat conceptual and risk-averse.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and anonymity are consistent and fit the imagery of containers and tides, with the poison label as a faint symbol of past harm. However, thematic material is heavily told (“a metaphor for the complexities of memory and the human experience”; “a testament to the power of memories”) rather than emerging from specific, dramatized moments. Subtext is minimal because the piece states its own meanings. The ending gestures at resonance but lands closer to essayistic summation than a reweighted image.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of seeking knowledge, communing with the past, and the persistence of mystery are present and coherent. However, they are delivered quite literally (“she knew that she had unlocked the secrets of the universe”) rather than through implication or image, which flattens resonance. The ending offers a tidy, almost slogan-like takeaway about discovery in forsaken places without a felt counter-pressure or complexity. Subtext—about obsession, hubris, or the cost of knowledge—is mostly absent.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme (community vs. gentrification, collective resistance, the city as living entity) is explicit but largely delivered as thesis rather than arising from dramatized particulars. Lines like “The city… was a living, breathing entity, with a spirit that could not be bought or sold” and “a testament to the strength of community” veer into sermonizing and platitude. The foundation stone chip has symbolic promise but isn’t developed with much nuance. The piece offers a clear moral stance but little subtext or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of transience, time, and the urge to preserve beauty are coherent and supported by the flora, the hourglass grain, and the dawn imagery. However, the story often states its ideas directly (“poignant reminder of the transience of life,” “preciousness of life”) instead of trusting the images, edging into sentimentality. The final melancholy descent and memory of the grain and flowers do offer a resonant emotional note, but it’s more declarative than subtly earned. Complexity is limited; there’s little tension or counter-reading to deepen the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of harmony between technology and environment, the quiet beauty of repair, and the artisan’s meditative craft emerge organically from the imagery of light, water, mist, and precise tuning. There is a gentle sense that small acts of restoration can subtly brighten the world, echoed in the mist clearing as the drone is mended. Yet the piece leans toward sentimentality and over-tidy uplift, especially in lines like “reminder that even in the most unexpected places, beauty and precision could be found.” The ending offers a pleasant affirmation rather than a complex or unsettling revaluation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of knowledge-seeking, connection across time (through the phrasebook), and beginnings/convergences are present but articulated in fairly generic abstractions (“the world was full of mysteries,” “one of its greatest secrets”). Recurring images—the rivers’ source, the convergence, the frozen lake—hint at deeper questions about origins and remaking, yet they never quite crystallize into a fresh insight. The ending promises significance rather than reweighting what we’ve seen with a surprising or complex angle. There’s emotional sincerity, but also a touch of pseudo-profundity in the repeated declarations of wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of balance, memory, and slow renewal through attention and sound are coherent and organically tied to the images. The recurring focus on rhythm and vibration as a “heartbeat” of place carries some quiet resonance. However, the piece leans toward generalized, almost mystical language about harmony without confronting moral or emotional complexity or a tangible cost. As a result, its insights feel gentle and somewhat platitudinous rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of memory, preservation, and the bittersweet cost of safeguarding a lost civilization are coherent and echoed through the vial, the temple’s whispers, and the final melancholy stillness. The ending image—Kael alone, mission complete, suffused with longing—does offer a modest resonant reconfiguration of her “lonesome splendor.” However, the text leans heavily on repeated abstractions (“essence,” “knowledge and stories of the past,” “wisdom and knowledge”) rather than letting particulars carry the weight. The thematic effect is genuine but drifts toward the generic and lightly sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of legacy, truth versus story, and the urge to inscribe oneself into inherited structures are present and coherent. Motifs—lattice, scuffs, whispers, threading the labyrinth—gesture toward questions about how stories trap or free us. However, the piece tends to restate its thematic premise (“driven by a desire to uncover the truth, to thread the labyrinth with his own story”) rather than letting events complicate or contradict it. The ending doesn’t reprice the premise so much as reiterate it in slightly heightened language, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of intergenerational debt, guidance across lifetimes, and bittersweet transformation are coherent and appealing. The closing image of the alchemist working on, haunted and grateful, points toward a resonant idea of legacy and costly awakening. Yet much of this is delivered via explicit explanation (“true nature,” “gift of understanding,” “debt that had been repaid”), which flattens subtext and moral ambiguity. The piece invites some reflection but doesn’t fully earn a layered, lingering aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.0)
    The thematic throughline—art’s power to transform ruin into reverence—is clear and cohesive, anchored by recurring phrases and the tapestry’s symbolic role. However, it is heavily told and moralized (“a testament to the power of art to transform and redeem”) rather than emerging from conflict and consequence. Subtext is minimal; almost every paragraph repeats the same idea with slightly varied language. The absence of friction or complication around this thesis keeps the resonance shallow.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of diasporic return, land-based ancestry, and faith restored through embodied work are coherent and integrated with the imagery of bones, roots, and the sundial. There is a satisfying conceptual link between excavation of a tomb and excavation of self/lineage. Yet the story leans heavily on explicit statement (“not just about uncovering the past, but also about restoring a lost faith”) rather than letting meaning emerge from conflicted moments. The final paragraph gestures toward lasting “cautious enchantment” but skirts complexity and cost, so the aftereffect is gentle rather than haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme—finding beauty and human connection in obsolete, slow communication—is clear and coherent, but also heavily told and repeated. Phrases like “discover meaning in the margins,” “message in a bottle,” and “beauty in the slow, deliberate dance of surface mail” verge on platitudinous rather than arising from specific, dramatized moments. There is little counterpressure or complexity (no sense of what might be lost, or why this might fail), so the thematic stance feels unchallenged. Still, the recurring images of mail, journey, and nostalgia do create a mild lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of listening to unheard stories, synchronizing with cosmic rhythms, and art as political foresight are coherent and threaded throughout. However, the piece leans on explicit statements like “the true power lay not in the chart itself, but in the stories that it told,” which flattens subtext into explanation. The final sense of purpose and universe “awakening” offers some resonance but risks pseudo-profundity because it’s not grounded in specific, earned moments. The moral and conceptual stakes remain soft rather than sharply reweighted at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of unspoken apology, regret, and the liminal moment before decision are coherent and sustained from the unsent letters to the final reflection. The condensation messages and the idea of “the space where an apology waits unspoken” provide a strong metaphorical frame. However, the piece occasionally states its themes directly (“These letters… represented the unspoken words that lingered…”) rather than letting them emerge solely through image and action. The ending offers resonance, but the insight borders on being told rather than discovered through sharp particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of resilience, shared anxiety, and beauty emerging from turmoil are clear and consistent, especially in the coral/cast parallels. However, they are often stated rather than earned through specific incident: “a message of resilience, of hope in the face of uncertainty” is pure thesis. The piece veers toward sentimentality and pseudo-profundity because the costs and harms remain abstract. Some genuine resonance surfaces in the final coral image, but the moral is too baldly articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of art as resurrection, the permeability of dream and reality, and creativity reclaiming desolate spaces are coherent and consistent with the imagery. However, they are often told rather than allowed to emerge (e.g., explicit statements about “rediscovered lost joy” and “testament to the power of creativity”), which flattens subtext. The final paragraphs lean into sentimentality and reiteration instead of leaving space for a more ambiguous or haunting resonance. The orchard rebirth image has potential, but the piece opts for a neat affirmation rather than a more complex reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.0)
    The thematic through-line—exchanging certainty for curiosity and discovering a more enchanted, plural reality—is coherent and integrated with the imagery of reflections, sound waves, and the mutable mural. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit statement (“she had exchanged certainty for curiosity, and the world was a richer... place for it”) rather than letting subtext and image carry the insight. As a result, the ending flirts with didacticism and smooths away complexity; Lena pays little discernible price for this new stance. The hobo nickel and garden motifs support the theme but could bear more ambiguous or double-edged meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme—coded language as defiance against a regime that taxes thoughts—is clear but heavily told and repeatedly restated (“spark of defiance,” “unbreakable spirit,” “power of creativity and defiance”) instead of deepened through concrete, ambiguous incidents. Subtext is minimal; almost every thematic idea is named outright, leaving little room for the reader to infer. The ending image of seeds dispersing carries potential resonance but is undercut by the preceding moralizing cadence. Complexity (e.g., ethical ambiguity of coded resistance) is largely absent.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme—art as a way to transform suffering and preserve fragile peace—is coherent, with the blossom armistice and postcard as apt motifs. The final movement toward her words living on as “a testament to the power of art” makes the thematic answer explicit but veers into mild sermonizing. The story favors declarative statements of meaning over letting images and actions fully carry the resonance. It’s emotionally sincere and readable but stops short of complex or surprising insight.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of memory, loss, and the preservation of vanished emotions are clear and coherent, supported by recurring objects (wind chime, orchids, deserted marvels). However, they are often articulated directly (“testament to the power of memory”) rather than emerging through conflict and implication, nudging toward sentimentality. The closing image modestly reweights what came before but doesn’t complicate or deepen the initial premise. Subtext remains thin because no relationship or ethical tension tests the caretaker’s mission.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of truth, interpretation, and the restoration of trust are coherent and recur through motifs like “symphonies of truth,” tangled threads of meaning, and the glowing ink well. However, the treatment leans heavily on abstract phrasing and near-platitudinous lines (“the air was filled with the scent of possibility”) rather than sharply particular moments of earned insight. The ending offers a gentle answer—self-trust regenerated through dedicated listening—but the complexity of error, responsibility, and communal trust is barely interrogated. More lived, specific frictions would make the thematic resonance less generic.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of compassion, unity, and community connection to land are explicit and coherent, but heavily told rather than emerging from specific, resistant events. Phrases like “a message of compassion and unity” and “testament to the power of compassion and unity” function as direct moral statements. The amphitheater as a symbol of communal connection has potential, especially in the breathing-building imagery, but the complexity of conflicting values is simplified into a feel-good synthesis. The ending offers reassurance rather than a resonant, ambiguous reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of memory, reinvention, secrecy, and making peace with loss are coherent and supported by recurring images (paper trails, dust motes, lost songs). However, the story often states its ideas directly—especially in lines like “In the end, it was not just about…”—which drifts toward summary and soft moralizing rather than letting images carry the weight. The emotional aftereffect is pleasant and wistful but not especially piercing or surprising. Subtext around why she needed to reinvent her history remains vague, limiting thematic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme centers on “necessary distances” (physical/spiritual) and sacred thresholds, tying father’s work, labyrinth, and reunion, but is delivered largely via explicit statements (“it was all part of a larger whole, a world of wonder and awe”). This leans into platitude rather than earned ambiguity or complexity. The recurring motifs (terrace, logbook, thresholds) connect, yet the ending heavily tells the takeaway instead of letting images carry it. There’s little resistance or counterforce to deepen the thematic question beyond “mystery is meaningful.”

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.3)
    Themes of belonging, attunement to place, and hidden wonder are consistent, with some nice conceptual alignment between the astrologer’s craft and the facility’s “rhythms.” Yet the text leans heavily on overt repetition and summary (“a reminder of the magic that lay just beneath the surface”) instead of letting concrete moments earn insight. The ending verges on sermonizing, reiterating the same idea multiple times rather than deepening or complicating it. There is little ambiguity or friction; the message is sincere but simplistic.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of memory’s fragility and the flux of paths and identity are coherent and recur through crystals, seeds, and the disappearing routes. However, they are frequently explained outright (“The story was one of flux and transformation…”) rather than allowed to emerge through implication and image. The final understanding is tidy and comforting, avoiding moral or emotional complication. There is some resonance, but it leans on explicit statement and soft edges rather than earned ambiguity and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.2)
    Themes of bridging mundane and magical and “orchestrated serendipity” are explicit and repetitive, but mostly told rather than earned through charged situations. Lines like “he knew that his art was not just about entertaining, but about creating a sense of connection” state thesis rather than letting it emerge from action. The bishop’s weight and the tide/stars imagery gesture toward a richer meditation on chance vs. design, but they don’t culminate in a reweighted final image or uncomfortable insight. The result feels pleasant but somewhat platitudinous.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of art as transcendence, unity with the cosmos, and liberation from nostalgia are clearly present and coherent. However, they are often stated rather than emerging through conflict—lines like “the ban had also freed her” summarize thematic conclusions instead of dramatizing them. The ending image of the verse etched on her skin carries some resonance but edges toward tidy uplift without much complexity or counter-pressure. The piece invites a gentle sense of wonder more than a lingering, challenging aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of hidden patterns, reflection, and finding beauty in the mundane are coherent and sustained through recurring images (ripples, prism, mist clearing). However, they are repeatedly articulated in explicit, almost thesis-like statements (“she was not just a glazier, but a seeker of meaning”) rather than allowed to emerge from dramatized choices. “Noctilucent reckonings” and “clear complexity” feel like declared concepts more than lived dilemmas. The ending offers a gentle restatement of the premise rather than a reweighting that complicates or deepens it.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of ecological damage, personal trauma, and the attempt to translate pain into a “universal language” are clearly intended, but they are mostly told through explicit thesis-like statements. The porcelain box as symbol of a “fractured soul” and the idea of enlightenment are declared rather than allowed to emerge organically from specific, dramatized experience. The final realization that he is a “messenger” is thematically on-brand but lands as a tidy moral rather than a resonant, earned ambiguity. Subtext is thin because almost every idea is directly articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of hope, balance in chaos, and ripple effects across realities are explicit and coherent, but they are heavily told rather than emerging from conflicted particulars. Phrases like “equations for hope,” “bring light into the darkness,” and “vast expanse of the multiverse” lean toward pseudo-profound abstraction. The balloon gauge and trial balloons provide a promising motif, yet they stay on-the-nose and never complicate the theme with real moral ambiguity or cost. The ending offers a tidy affirmation rather than a resonant, destabilizing reweighting of prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.0)
    Legacy, memory, and the “dreams” of walls are coherent thematic threads, but they are heavily articulated rather than emerging from implication. Lines like “The legacy's burden, it seemed, was not just a weight to be carried, but a story to be told” state theme outright and undercut subtext. The ending does offer a modest repricing—legacy as shared narrative rather than mere burden—but it lands more as a paraphrased thesis than a charged image. The theme is clear, but lacks complexity and earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of possibility, perception, and art as a portal to other realities are present but handled in broad, almost platitudinous strokes (“The world was full of wonder, and the painter was content to be a part of it”). Recurring images—the prism parapet, mirrors, lullaby—hint at a meditation on how attention and craft open alternate futures. However, the text repeatedly tells us about “possibilities that lay beyond the veil of reality” instead of letting a particular, concrete cost or choice embody that idea. The ending’s reassurance and lack of complication flatten what could have been a more ambivalent or haunting thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme centers on redemption, the weight of responsibility, and “flawed beauty” in the pursuit of peace, with the ebony clipboard as a recurring emblem. These ideas are coherent but heavily told and repeated, often in near-identical language (“price of redemption,” “ritual significance,” “anchor ideals in practice”) rather than allowed to emerge from action. The final image of exhausted, redeemed Elian on the terrace does offer some resonance, but leans toward sentimentality and summary over textured ambiguity. Subtext is minimal; the story tends to state its meanings.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of environmental devastation, greed, and precarious beauty (the extinct bird’s egg, “echo of extinct birds”) are coherent and integrated with the plot. However, the piece leans on explicit statements (“testament to the destructive power of greed”) rather than trusting implication, which flattens subtext. The final image of the echo growing louder offers some resonance but veers toward neat optimism with little moral ambiguity. Complexity around “amoral” philanthropy and manufactured drought is gestured at more than examined.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of self-discovery, authenticity, and resistance to social norms are coherent, with recurring images—snowfall, lullaby, prism—supporting them. However, the piece leans on explicit thematic statements (“the power of defiance, and the beauty of being true to oneself”) that verge on moral summary rather than letting images and choices carry the weight. The “harvest of echoes” and fading past hint at a richer, more ambivalent cost that isn’t fully explored. The ending offers a clear thematic answer but in fairly familiar, tidy terms.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.5)
    Themes of ethical storytelling, truth vs. deception, and subversion are over-explicit, often summarized in thesis-like sentences (“The story would be a complex, layered exploration of the very nature of truth and deception”). Because no ethical dilemma is actually staged, the thematic claims feel unearned and abstract. The final paragraphs reiterate her mission and the dome’s magic without adding a new angle or complication, shading into mild sermonizing about “rethink[ing] the very fabric of storytelling.” Subtext is minimal; most meaning is simply told to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of transience, memory, and honoring forgotten stories are clear and coherent, supported by the monarch migration, the ephemeral structures, and the lingering wing. However, they are frequently stated outright (“She was driven by a deep desire to acknowledge the stories that had been forgotten…”) rather than left to emerge from image and action. The ending reiterates the thesis in near-moralizing language (“power of the human spirit to create, to connect, and to honor…”) instead of trusting the symbols. The resonance is present but blunted by this explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of memory, preservation of the forgotten, and self-forgiveness are clear and aligned with the imagery of rope, aurora, and sound. However, they are often spelled out in explicit, generalized language (“a testament to the power of memory and the human spirit”), which undercuts subtlety and subtext. The piece resolves into a tidy moral and emotional closure without much complexity or lingering ambiguity. The thematic arc feels sincere but more asserted than discovered through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of agency vs. fate (“paths choose their walkers”), decay of old directives, and the search for purpose are coherent and consistent. However, they are often stated in direct abstract terms instead of emerging from concrete, conflicted scenes—phrases like “a larger narrative” and “grand design” feel like prompt echoes. The wafer seal and rewilded forest lightly echo the idea of authentication and renewal, but subtext is thin and non-ambiguous. The ending offers a conceptually clear answer (acceptance of a chosen path) but with limited emotional or moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of devotion, synthesis of celestial and terrestrial, and the mirroring of cosmic mystery and inner longing are coherent and consistent. However, they are heavily told—“a recognition that the mysteries of the universe were, in fact, a reflection of their own deepest longings/self”—instead of arising from particular, conflicted moments. The repeated insistence on transformation and harmony lapses into abstract, near-platitudinous language. Subtext is minimal because the story constantly names its own meanings.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.5)
    Themes of healing, forgiveness, and the beauty of brokenness are explicit but often told rather than earned through concrete incidents. Phrases like “holding onto anger and bitterness only perpetuated a cycle of suffering” and the closing moral about brokenness producing beauty read as sermon-like thesis statements. Subtext is minimal because the text continuously explains its own meaning; the music box’s symbolic role is spelled out rather than allowed to emerge. The lack of genuine resistance or ambiguity around resentment and release keeps the thematic field simplistic.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of erasing boundaries, rebirth of shattered things, and permeability between reality and dream are clear and consistent, anchored in the sextant, the mirror, and the glass mountains. However, they are often stated directly (“erasing the boundaries between reality and fantasy”) rather than emerging solely from image and action, which flattens subtext. The final vision of the glass mountains seen by others hints at conceptual afterlife and cost (her disappearance reweighted as portal), but moral and emotional complexity remain modest. It’s resonant but a bit didactic and one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of generational stewardship, conditional/“deciduous” vows, and finding wisdom in forgotten remnants are clear and coherent. However, they’re often delivered through explicit explanation (“the contract… had been deciduous in nature”) rather than arising organically from scene and image. The hair ribbon and forgotten seeds offer concrete anchors for these ideas, but the piece edges toward moralizing in its insistence on bridging wisdom and nurturing vows. The ending has a gentle resonance, yet it resolves into a fairly tidy affirmation without much thematic ambiguity or bite.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central idea—that knowledge is nonlinear, a “complex web of interconnected threads”—is thematically coherent with the Order’s name and the imagery of orchard and threads. However, the philosophical breakthrough is delivered in explicit exposition, bordering on prompt language, rather than emerging organically from particulars. The bathroom-as-revelation-site has some sly thematic charm, but the ending leans on declarative summation (“they knew that they would never see the world in the same way again”) instead of a more oblique, resonant image. Complexity around “forbidden” knowledge—its ethical or emotional cost—is underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of knowledge vs. application, “unlearned lessons,” and purpose beyond mere accumulation are coherent and aligned with the premise. However, they’re delivered in overt, moralizing summary—especially in the final paragraphs (“she had found something far more valuable than mere knowledge,” “true calling”)—rather than emerging from subtext in concrete choices. The “unheard symphony” motif edges toward generic mysticism instead of a particular, character-bound insight. The ending gestures at resonance but leans on abstraction and platitude more than earned image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of memory, loss, and preservation (“Garden of Forgotten Names,” ship as metaphor for fragility of memory) are clear and coherent. However, they’re often told directly—“seemed to be a metaphor for the fragility of human memory”—rather than arising from dramatized conflict or specific, surprising particulars. The final realization that the Garden is “not just a physical place, but a state of mind” is thematically apt but feels like a familiar mystical takeaway. Subtext is thin; complexity and moral tension are minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of knowledge, absence, and transforming confusion into clarity are consistent but heavily told rather than embedded in charged specifics. Recurring phrases (“threads of knowledge,” “clear complexity,” “fables of absence”) signal the intent but verge on slogan-like instead of deepening in meaning. The ending offers a mild conceptual repricing—Emilia now sees the fables as patterned and significant—but without much ambiguity or emotional aftershock.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of harmony, balance with disruptive forces, and “finding quiet in the storm” are coherent and integrated with the premise. The bloom of hush, hammered repose, and the energy beings’ adaptation all point toward coexistence rather than erasure. However, the piece leans on overt statements of purpose and satisfaction (“she was proud… she had found the quiet in the storm”) instead of letting images carry the weight. The moral dimension remains gentle and somewhat platitudinous rather than complex or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of hope after ruin, the meaningfulness of coincidence, and the recovery of lost knowledge are clear and coherent. However, they are mostly asserted in abstract language (“prove that coincidences have meaning,” “promise of a brighter future”) rather than arising from thorny choices or ironic turns. The thistle motif and “shard of hush” gesture toward richer subtext but aren’t developed into layered symbols with competing readings. The ending risks sentimentality by leaning on generic uplift without showing what might be sacrificed or complicated by this hope.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of identity, inheritance, and the interplay of past and future are clear and coherent, anchored in the collective memory motif. However, they are often stated rather than earned through concrete, dramatized particulars (“she knew that she was not just preserving the past, but also shaping the future”). The lack of friction or moral complexity flattens potential resonance; guardianship comes without visible downside or contested meaning. The final image is gentle and consonant but not deeply reweighting of what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.2)
    The intended theme (“in the stillness, find the spark”; inspiration arising from quiet attention) is clear and coheres with the images of gardens, fire, and ambient awareness. Yet it leans heavily on explicit statement via the note and near-platitudinous phrasing instead of letting the events and images earn the insight. Complexity is low: there’s little sense of genuine risk that inspiration might not return, or any counter-pressure that troubles the message.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of transition, pauses, and transformation is clear and consistent, anchored by the cicada, the starlight, and the resumed conversation. However, it is often stated rather than dramatized (“The cicada was a symbol of transformation…”, “She saw that it was a moment of possibility”), edging into essay-like exposition. Subtext is thin; the images largely affirm the text’s declared thesis rather than complicating it. The final movement toward peace has some resonance but lacks the complexity and earned ambiguity expected at a top market.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece clearly pursues a theme of growth through unusual forms of solace, with silence as a nourishing, textural presence that can stretch a previously “contracted” world. The recurring notion of flavored silences and the final sense of inner expansion give some genuine resonance. However, the thematic work is often told outright (“a reminder that even in the most unexpected places, solace and growth could be found”), tipping into mildly didactic summary. Ambiguity and moral complexity are minimal; the insight is comforting but familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.5)
    The thematic focus on the solace of silence is clear and coherent, but it is frequently stated rather than emerging through conflict (“to catalyze a deeper understanding of the beauty that lay in silence”). The storm glass and terrace could bear subtext about fragility and balance, yet the narrative keeps restating the thesis instead of letting implication carry it. The ending image of “palpable” silence has some resonance but feels thematically pre-solved. The piece edges toward sermonizing more than it embraces complexity or tension around silence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of hubris, forgotten grandeur, and cyclical restoration are present via the murals and the ruined setting, and the idea of “where shadows fall, light rises” gestures toward a light-from-ruin motif. Yet much of this is told rather than organically dramatized, particularly the civilization’s downfall and the “brighter tomorrow” note. The ending leans on overt summarizing of hope and destiny (“a new era was about to begin”) rather than a complex, lingering image. The piece suggests interesting thematic territory but lands in fairly tidy, platitudinal territory.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of isolation versus connection and transforming suffocation into breath are coherent, and the reborn sanctuary loosely mirrors the keeper’s inner shift. However, key thematic lines (“Their motivation, to teach suffocating to breathe…”) are stated outright rather than earned through specific scenes, edging toward commentary. The ending offers a neat, optimistic resolution without lingering ambiguity or a felt counterweight, which flattens resonance. The piece invites reflection, but in a somewhat generic, sermon-adjacent way.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.7)
    Themes of resilience after financial exploitation and transforming “pressure into diamonds” as personal growth are present and conceptually apt. However, the story leans on explicit lines about “magic…waiting to be found” and “sense of possibility,” which verge on platitude. The submarine bolt and mushrooms suggest potential for richer subtext about value, salvage, and exploitation, but these threads are not developed beyond surface symbolism. The final resonance is pleasant but not deeply earned or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme—intuition as a bridge to hidden truth and the transformative power of knowledge—is coherent but overwhelmingly told. Refrains about “power of intuition,” “secrets of the universe,” and “story would be told and retold” drift into pseudo-profound summary rather than arising from concrete scene dynamics. The final paragraphs explicitly announce legacy and human spirit instead of allowing images or small, particular choices to carry resonance. Complexity or moral friction is largely absent, so the takeaway feels predetermined and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.0)
    A theme of surrendering to the unknown and being transformed by possibility is present and consistent. The repeated motifs of allegiance, presence, and merging gesture toward ideas of agency versus destiny, but complexity is limited and largely unconflicted. The ending offers a gentle affirmation (embracing the unknown grants purpose) without much ambiguity or edge. Resonance comes from the imagery rather than from a hard-earned or destabilizing insight.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of remembrance, the dignity of overlooked lives, and “small kindnesses” are coherent but heavily asserted. Phrases like “testament to the resilience of the human spirit” and “enduring power of the human heart” verge on sermonizing and generic uplift. The button and dust patterns could have carried more subtext if allowed to speak through specific, concrete particulars instead of abstract commentary. As is, the piece states its thesis more than it lets the reader discover it.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of memory, resistance, and the danger of apathy are coherent and integrated through objects (the key), roles (keeper of revised histories), and the gathering’s purpose. However, they are over-articulated in abstract terms (“tyranny of indifference,” “barren landscape devoid of memory or passion”) rather than allowed to emerge subtextually from events. The piece edges toward sermonizing more than once. The final image does modestly reweight earlier material by casting the lagoon and key as a fragile counter-history.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of art as counter-spell, sound shaping reality, and communal calming are clear and coherent. However, they are heavily told—“a testament to the power of her music,” “a reminder of the power of music to shape the world”—rather than allowed to emerge from implication. The piece tends toward soft moralizing and pseudo-profound generalities about peace and quiet, which dilutes resonance. There is little thematic complication or counterforce; it’s an uncomplicated hymn to soothing beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of transformation, reverence for forgotten things, and hidden magic “just beneath the surface” are clear and consistent. However, they are often delivered via direct statement (“she had found a new sense of purpose,” “in this place, one emerges transformed always”) rather than emerging from fraught choices or subtext. The prophecy’s content is generic (“great change and transformation”), limiting deeper resonance or ambiguity. The ending feels mildly uplifting but edges into platitude rather than complex, lingering insight.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.0)
    The piece has a clear thematic intention around time, coincidence becoming pattern, and “befriending uncertainty,” and it does recur motifs (compass, waterfall, overgrown greenhouse) to echo that. However, the themes are often delivered as direct thesis statements (“coincidence becomes pattern when viewed through the lens of time,” “his motivation… had not been to impose order… but to befriend uncertainty in planning”) rather than arising from implication or dramatized struggle. This flattens subtext and verges on didactic. The final insight feels more like a declared moral than an earned, ambiguous resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme (beauty in brokenness, kintsugi as self-acceptance, the “weight of names”) is explicit and consistent but often delivered as thesis (“true beauty lay not in perfection”) rather than arising from action. The motifs—kintsugi, zodiac coin, material/mystical balance—do echo in the ending, but largely as reiterated ideas rather than reweighted images with new ambiguity or cost. The piece flirts with depth in the notion of “luminous regret” yet resolves into a tidy, untroubled self-forgiveness. This directness undercuts the potential for richer, more complex resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.5)
    There is a clear thematic aim around finding light and even joy within sorrowful stories of the dead, and the “luminous ache” is a potentially strong organizing idea. However, the theme is over-articulated in direct statements (“her motivation was…”, “there was always a chance for redemption”) that replace subtext with summary. The crocodile’s tooth and misaligned harp could have deepened the theme symbolically but are not fully leveraged beyond surface intrigue. The ending resonates mildly but feels more like a thesis restatement than an earned, image-led repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of trauma, redemption, and mercy are clearly intended, and the idea of “mathematics of mercy” hints at an intriguing conceptual frame. However, the piece repeatedly names its themes (“place of reckoning,” “find redemption,” “mathematics of mercy”) instead of allowing them to emerge through specific dramatized interactions or images. The climactic realization is summarized (“She was beginning to understand the mathematics of mercy”) without concrete insight or complication, so it risks feeling like pseudo-profundity. The ending offers hope and closure but in a relatively tidy, unambiguous way.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of memory, liminality, and honoring the overlooked are clear and consistent, especially in the link between hidden anchors and forgotten histories. However, they are often stated outright (“to give voice to the silenced and visibility to the invisible”) rather than emerging through concrete scene pressures or subtext. The repeated abstractions (“eternal instant,” “essence of the unknown,” “secrets of the universe”) dilute specificity and edge toward pseudo-profundity. The ending offers resonance, but in a summarized, sermon-like mode rather than through a sharp, reweighting image.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of memory, failure, and the quiet dignity of forgotten places are consistent and supported by motifs like dust, ghosts, and circus decay. The notion of a “weightless burden” of stories is resonant, especially paired with her leaving the office carrying the barrel. However, the piece leans into explicit thematic statement (“The world is full of cracks, full of hidden stories”) rather than letting subtext fully carry the load. Complexity is limited; we’re told the meaning as much as invited to discover it.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of eternity as depth rather than duration, the fragility of “perfect systems,” and art as destabilizing revelation are clear and coherent. Recurring motifs—frost patterns, whispers, rustling awakenings—support this, and the final lingering of the library as memory adds some resonance. However, the text leans heavily on explicit statement (“a reminder that eternity was not a duration, but a depth”) instead of letting subtext and image do that work. The insight risks sliding toward pseudo-profundity because it’s asserted more than earned through concrete, pressured experience.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of reconstruction, memory, and self-reinvention are coherent and supported by recurring images (shard, labyrinth, storm, burnished sorrow). However, they are often stated in generalized, near-platitudinous terms (“power of imagination,” “world she had created was one of beauty, of sorrow, and of hope”) rather than emerging from specific dramatic turns. The ending provides a resonant but tidy answer: she transforms from revolutionary to chronicler and finds purpose in elegiac work. The piece invites some reflection but doesn’t fully escape sentimentality or abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of balance between light and darkness, sound and silence, and “mending what isn’t torn” are consistent and supported by recurring images (the chip, the covenant of rust, the reclaimed light). However, they are often stated directly rather than emerging from concrete choices, edging toward pseudo-profundity (“to reclaim the light stolen by midnight, one had to first understand the darkness”). The ending’s image of the world being “a little more in tune with the hidden melodies” does provide a gentle conceptual repricing of his craft. Greater ambiguity or on-page cost would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central theme—seeking a realm beyond rational explanation—is explicit and aligned with the imagery of lagoon, compass, and unity with the earth. However, it’s often articulated in thesis-like language (“the place where explanations fail,” “where the rational and the mysterious blur”) rather than arising obliquely from events. Little genuine nuance or counter-pressure complicates this pursuit; the story mostly confirms its starting idea instead of reweighing it. The ending resonates conceptually but comes close to sermonizing, which dulls its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of hidden patterns, interconnectedness (“timewoven alliances”), and creative synthesis are clearly articulated but often in abstract, essayistic language. Lines like “The world, she knew, was full of hidden patterns and connections, waiting to be uncovered…” state the thesis instead of letting it emerge from concrete choices and consequences. The lantern slide, archway, and GPS failure could have been potent vehicles for subtext but are mostly treated as straightforward symbols. The result feels sincere yet somewhat didactic and platitudinous rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of interconnectedness, the beauty of darkness, and quiet revelation are coherent but often stated in generalized terms (“intricate web of life,” “beauty and wonder of the world”) rather than earned through specific, surprising moments. Recurring motifs (flowers at night, moonlight, hush, etched glass) do support the thematic spine, but the insights trend toward the familiar and risk mild sentimentality. The final comprehension that flowers bloom at night because of an interconnected web of life is conceptually sound yet not dramatically reweighted by prior costs. Subtext is thin because the piece keeps articulating its meanings directly.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of memory, history, and hidden civil-rights truths are latent in the archivist/diary/Ada triad and the motif of submerged secrets (obsidian lagoon). Yet these ideas are gestured at more than earned through specific, dramatized conflict; history’s cost, or the ethics of revelation vs. secrecy, never crystallize in a sharp situation. The ending’s insistence that she’ll keep seeking truth has some resonance but veers toward generic quest language. Subtext in Ada’s condition and the debris-messages is promising but underdeveloped on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of rejecting sentimental restoration in favor of radical reimagining, and of creation beginning “after the last wish is granted,” are intriguing and potentially rich. However, they are articulated quite directly in expository lines (“For they knew that…”) rather than emerging organically from dramatized choices or images. Subtext is minimal: symbols like the bottle and lanterns remain largely at the level of declared meaning rather than charged ambiguity. The piece invites some reflection, but the insight feels more like a thesis than earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of memory, archival versus prophecy, and the past shaping the future are coherent and supported by recurrent motifs (children’s orchard, dead languages, the wax cylinder). The idea that recording emotions can inadvertently rewrite what’s to come is interesting, and the final image of the garden “holding its breath” underscores that. However, the treatment remains abstract and somewhat repetitive, with little scene-level complexity or surprise in how these ideas play out. The piece gestures toward profundity more than it earns a sharply reconfigured insight.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme is explicit and coherent—inheritance as an act of sharing, the cycle of life/death, living in the present amid past and future—but arrives as spelled-out insight rather than emerging from fraught particulars. Lines like “By decreasing entropy, she could maintain the delicate harmony of the world” and “it was not the destination that mattered, but the journey itself” verge on pseudo-profound moralizing. The symbolism of seed, egg, and vortex is promising but remains schematic rather than provocatively ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of listening versus noise, subtlety versus alarm, and finding beauty in quiet are coherent and integrated with the bell/siren imagery. However, they are over-explicitly stated—lines like “a reminder that even in the most turbulent of times, there is beauty to be found in the quiet moments” flatten what the images already imply. Subtext is thin; the story leans into direct moralizing rather than trusting scene and image to carry its insight. The final resonance is pleasant but feels more like an essay’s thesis than an earned, lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of vulnerability-as-strength, stillness, and cosmic connection are clear and coherent, and the lantern as beacon versus surrounding darkness is a workable image. However, theme is mostly stated outright (“strength lies in vulnerability,” “flourishing stillness”) rather than emerging from concrete action. Repetitive moralizing in the closing paragraphs flattens complexity instead of letting ambiguity linger. The result is earnest but veers toward essayistic sermon rather than layered literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of remembrance, the cost of memory, and the persistence of beauty in ruin are clear and coherent, especially via the ghosts’ response and the act of reading/closing the box. The piece succeeds in suggesting that tending to the dead’s stories is a kind of ongoing covenant or burden. However, some phrasing drifts toward generic solemnity (“a testament to the power of remembrance”) rather than letting scenes and images carry the full weight. The thematic arc is resonant but not surprising, and the “tangled covenant” idea never deepens into a more complex moral calculus on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of time, memory, loss, and human curiosity are clear and coherent, with potentially rich objects (urn fragment, capsule, silent clock). However, they are spelled out in generalized abstractions (“beacon of hope,” “testament to the power of human curiosity”) rather than earned through tension-filled scene work. The ending lightly reweights the premise—time as texture rather than metric—but without a complex or surprising moral calculus. Overall it resonates mildly, leaning on statement over subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of transience, interconnectedness, and beauty in imperfection are legible and supported by the feather, the snapped kite, and the final walk away. However, they are often stated outright rather than emerging from implication (“Her motivation was not to create something perfect, but to discover beauty in the incomplete”). The ending does offer a mild resonance—carrying the moment’s beauty with her—but skirts sentimentality and feels somewhat generic. Subtext is thin because nothing pushes against the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.6)
    Themes of harmony between humans and nature, legacy, and respectful stewardship are clear and consistent, but heavily told (“promote a sense of respect and reciprocity”) rather than allowed to emerge from conflicted action. The copper wire harmonics and interspecies haven gesture toward richer subtext about intervention vs. listening, but this tension is never dramatized. The ending reiterates the thesis more than it reweights it. Overall, the piece risks sentimentality and platitude because complexity and counter-pressure are missing.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.7)
    Ideas of pilgrimage, homecoming, and self-discovery are thematically coherent but heavily stated rather than dramatized (“the artificial pilgrimage had been a journey of self-discovery”). Recurring motifs (tower, footprints, pendant) are evocative yet rarely shift in meaning through action; the story tells us they’re significant instead of letting scenes imply it. The final insight about homecoming is conceptually aligned with earlier lines but feels pre-declared rather than earned. The piece edges toward pseudo-profundity by leaning on abstractions (“chemistry of homecoming”) without grounding them in specific emotional conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of regeneration, peace after war, and harmony with nature are clear and coherent with the imagery. However, they are often asserted directly (“a testament to the power of dedication and the magic that lay just beneath the surface”) instead of emerging through tension or implication. Submerged concord and “garden reclaiming battlefield” are promising motifs but are not deepened by reversals or hard choices. The ending lands as gentle reassurance more than resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of hope, renewal, and finding purpose in desolation are coherent and supported by the movement from scrapyard to spring. The autumn leaf, water, and “wild hush” gesture toward a meditation on latent beauty and connection after catastrophe. However, the story leans into explicit articulation (“a sense of purpose in a world that had been torn apart,” “a sense of being connected to something greater than herself”), drifting toward sentimentality rather than letting images carry the weight. Subtext is relatively thin, with little moral or emotional ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of finding direction in stillness, reconnecting with lineage (the family sky-sketching) and transforming paralysis into exploration are coherent. The compass rose / true north motif and the fading “echoed silence” provide some thematic echo at the end. However, the piece tends toward sentimentality and explicitness (“guiding her towards a brighter tomorrow”) rather than allowing images and choices to carry the weight. Complexity is limited; there’s little sense of true ambivalence or unresolved cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of wonder, playful engagement with uncertainty, and restoring cosmic balance are apparent but mostly told rather than emerging from fraught particulars. Phrases like “sacredly playful in the face of uncertainty” and “they knew that they had truly become an apprentice of wonder” verge on prompt-language rather than nuanced realization. There’s little moral or emotional complexity: no real cost, ambiguity, or competing goods to complicate the idea of embracing the unknown. The ending image is pleasant but tidy, offering affirmation more than a resonant reweighting of what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    There is a clear thematic intent around absence, history, and reinterpreting loss (“missing pawns” as opportunities, “luminous absence”). However, theme is mostly delivered via direct statements and repeated phrases rather than arising organically from conflict and image. The final realization has some resonance but edges into pseudo-profundity because the emotional and material costs of “unbind the past” are not grounded. The piece gestures at complexity without dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.3)
    Ideas of buried talents, painful remembering, home as a state of being, and transformation beyond visible reality recur and cohere thematically. The final transformation of the bookstore into a gateway supports a theme of latent potential and ongoing change. However, much of the thematic material is articulated in abstract, quasi-philosophical language rather than earned through concrete, conflicted experience. The resonance is pleasant but leans toward soft mysticism over sharpened insight.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of forgiveness, redemption, and the idea that “forgiveness was a journey, not a destination” are unmistakable and aligned with the imagery of labyrinth and tapestry. However, they’re often stated outright and repeated, drifting into mild moralizing rather than arising purely from implication and scene. The ending’s notion of finding “home” as a state of mind has some resonance but feels a bit pat. Complexity is limited; there’s little sense that forgiveness leaves any unresolved cost or ambiguity behind.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.6)
    The piece has a very clear thematic ambition—art as refracted truth, forgiveness as complex and costly—but leans heavily on direct statement and repetition (“price of forgiveness,” “truth,” “power of art”) instead of letting theme emerge organically from action. The final paragraphs explicitly summarize the meaning (“not something to be paid, but something to be understood”), edging into sermonizing. There is some resonance in the imagery of refracted light, mist, and echoes, yet these symbols are explained rather than allowed to work subtextually. The result is coherent but not subtle, with limited lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of kintsugi, finding beauty in brokenness, and “conjuring meaning from the edge of oblivion” are clearly present and coherent. However, they are often stated outright rather than emerging from action or image—phrases like “that, she knew, was a gift worth more than any amount of gold or gemstones” tilt into moralizing summary. The rabbit’s foot charm and statue have potential as evolving symbols, but their meaning doesn’t significantly shift; they largely reassert the same thesis. The ending offers a gentle resonance but little complexity or surprise in how the thematic question is answered.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of art as a vehicle for “temporary eternity,” the tension between ephemerality and endurance, and a balance of detachment/connection are coherent and consistent. However, they are repeatedly stated rather than allowed to emerge from scene particulars, leading to a didactic, slightly pseudo-profound feel (“a symbol of the temporary eternity,” “testament to the power of art…”). The final paragraphs explain the legacy effect rather than trusting the painted oasis or shell image to carry that weight. This flattens subtext and undercuts what could be a more haunting, oblique resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central theme—that quiet, purified intention can reach farther than bombast—is consistent and thematically integrated with the lighthouse, garden, and “vibrations of intent.” The story pays it off in the final image of the lighthouse’s light as a “gentle whisper in the darkness,” which nicely echoes the thesis. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit statement (“to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts”) rather than trusting implication, and the insight is more affirming than challenging. It lacks the complexity or ambivalence that would prevent it from reading as a spiritual thesis illustrated by scene.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of grief, resilience, and rebuilding from fragments are coherent and tied to recurring motifs (patchwork body, ruined hub, censer, reverse migration). However, the piece leans heavily on explicit articulation of insight (“She knew that she would never be able to fully restore what had been lost, but she was determined…”) instead of letting theme emerge from concrete scenes. The ending offers a clear but somewhat tidy answer—acceptance and forward motion—without much lingering ambiguity or subtext. It’s thoughtful but edges toward paraphrasing a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of empathy taken too far, the occlusion of emotional scars, and the tension between truth and psychological safety are coherent and recur via the virus, the cures, and the glass eye. However, they’re frequently articulated in prompt-like abstractions (“pursuit of empathy had been taken too far,” “catastrophic loss of individuality”) rather than emerging from specific, dramatized moments. The “fractured grace” concept is nice but leans on explicit statement more than subtext. The ending offers a resonant idea but skirts close to essayistic summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of borrowed memories, isolation, and the way objects act as keys to memory are coherent and recur via the lighthouse and boutonnière. The notion of “witnessed isolation” and cumulative burdens of others’ lives has genuine resonance. However, the piece frequently states its themes in near-essayistic form (“not just a simple act, but a complex web of memories, emotions, and motivations”) instead of letting images and choices carry the weight. This directness reduces ambiguity and undercuts potential depth.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of legacy, choice, and the idea that a “doorway of decisions” is made of accumulated choices are clear and coherent with the plot. The father’s note and the fulfilled promise give a thematic frame about connection across generations. However, the piece leans into direct statement and repetition (“lingering promise,” “journey,” “secrets waiting to be unlocked”) instead of allowing subtext and concrete moments to carry the weight. The emotional aftereffect trends toward sentimental rather than layered or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of destiny, confronting ancient forces, and the cost of knowledge are gestured at through the warning and “bleeding starlight,” but they remain abstract. Repeated phrasing (“fabric of reality,” “ancients,” “otherworldly essence”) reads like prompt language rather than emergent insight. The ending asserts that the truth is “wondrous and terrible” and life-changing without showing how, so thematic resonance is conceptual rather than felt. There is little subtextual play; most meaning is directly stated in similar terms throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of revaluation, presence, and the interweaving of science and wonder are consistent and clearly traceable from the shell’s spiral to the final shared silence. The nautilus curl and “density of presence” serve as recurring motifs, and the ending does reweight her understanding of the natural world, if softly. However, the story often states its thematic concerns directly (“a palette of resolve,” “the process of revaluation,” “directed spontaneity”) rather than letting them emerge through implication. This yields a tone of mild pseudo-profundity rather than the layered ambiguity expected at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of mortality, memory, and creativity as a way to “distill chaos into narrative” are coherent and present throughout. However, the piece leans heavily on direct statement—“a testament to the power of the human imagination,” “a reminder of the power of creativity”—rather than letting images and events carry the weight, which edges toward essay-like moralizing. “Feral nostalgia” has real potential as a complex, ambivalent theme, but the story doesn’t explore its darker implications beyond a few declarative lines. The ending’s peace feels tidy and tidily articulated instead of resonant and earned through particularities.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.0)
    The thematic intent—finding sacredness and “ordinary miracles” beneath the surface—is clear but heavily told, often in thesis-like sentences (“Her motivation, she realized, was not just to understand the world, but to reveal its hidden beauty”). Recurring motifs (fog, occluded views, the birthing screw) support the theme conceptually, yet they seldom deepen in meaning through concrete events; they are explained rather than discovered. Moralizing and explicit theme statements in the middle and late paragraphs undercut subtext. The piece gestures toward resonance but settles into earnest, slightly didactic reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme centers on stillness between storms, the transmutation of personal scars into art, and communion with larger mystical forces, and these motifs recur coherently (breath, storms, runes, writing). The ending sunset and drifting into darkness provide a reasonably resonant answer to the opening stillness and isolation. However, some phrasing leans toward abstraction and pseudo-profundity (“fragment of the divine,” “mystical forces that governed the world”), and the insight isn’t strongly earned through specific, resistant experience. The result is pleasant but somewhat generic in emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of imperfect miracles, redemption, and beauty in imperfection are clear and consistent, with the orchard and the bottle echoing loss and fragile connection. However, they’re often articulated directly (“true power lay not in grand gestures…”) rather than emerging from subtext and image, tipping toward didactic explanation. The final peace Lyra feels is asserted more than earned through specific dramatized struggle. The result is thematically coherent but relatively unsurprising and somewhat platitudinous for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.0)
    Ideas of unity, balance, and unraveling illusion are thematically coherent and recur throughout, especially in the inward/outward journey motif. Yet much of the thematic content is delivered as direct statement and summary (“the cosmic illusions had been unraveled”) rather than arising from specific, dramatized incidents. The ending in particular slides toward a sermon-like tone, telling us harmony is restored without a grounded image that reconfigures prior material. The piece gestures at profundity more than it earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of time, measurement, and the human urge to understand them are clear and consistent, but often stated directly (“what clocks really measure,” “the essence of time”) rather than earned by concrete drama. The counting backwards motif and the mantle key offer potential symbolic weight, yet they aren’t developed into a complex or surprising insight. The ending hints at an acceptance of mystery and ongoing inquiry, but the thematic movement feels modest and somewhat generic. Subtext is minimal because almost everything is articulated on the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme is explicit and consistent—interconnectedness, permeability of boundaries, and “letting go”—but it is often told in thesis-like phrases rather than emerging from action (“She believed that by doing so, she could revolutionize the way people interacted…”). The motifs of familiar strangers, mushrooms, and the laser button recur, yet they rarely shift meaning in a concrete, dramatized way. The final assertion that “the world… was revealing itself to be a complex, interconnected web” lands as a paraphrased moral. The lack of friction or counter-pressure makes the insight feel unearned and somewhat platitudinous.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of chance, control, addiction, and “lucid contradictions” are coherent and threaded through probability theory, the graffiti line (“Certainty is a shadow on the wall”), and Elara’s reflections on her father. However, the piece states its theses directly—about complexity, paradox, and widening perspectives—rather than letting them emerge from dramatized conflict or image. The lantern’s glow and the subway insights do offer a mild imagistic echo of fragile truth versus illusion. Overall, the resonance is thoughtful but veers into essayistic moralizing instead of earned, scene-driven wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.6)
    Themes of anonymity, curated distance, and the paradox of connection-through-wrongness are intriguing and coherent. The loop and the attempt to “teach endings how to begin” offer a potentially rich frame about repetition as a kind of sacred work. But the piece leans heavily on direct thematic statements (“a community bound together by the threads of cultivated estrangement”) instead of letting scenes or images earn that insight. The result reads more like an essayistic assertion of profundity than a lived dramatization with subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.2)
    Themes of memory, archival preservation, and the endurance of love are clear but heavily told and repeated, often in near-identical language (“the weight of small moments,” “testament to the power of love”). Much of the final third reads like explicit thematic summary rather than emergent meaning from scene. There is little complexity or counter-pressure—love and preservation are framed as unambiguously noble, without complication or ambivalence. The result feels sentimental and didactic rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme—that loneliness is cured through reciprocal, incremental community-building rather than magic—is coherent and aligns with the plot skeleton. However, it is delivered almost entirely as explicit statement (“The cure for loneliness was not a single event…”) rather than emerging from charged images or conflicted interactions. The moon rock and rumor chains could offer rich symbolic and subtextual possibilities, but they resolve into a fairly straightforward moral. The ending leaves a gentle afterglow but leans sentimental and tidy rather than complex or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of harmony with the universe and self-knowledge are coherent and arise from the journey’s imagery, especially the convergence at the stillpoint. However, the text often names its concerns directly (“mysteries of the heart,” “hidden harmonies of the universe”) instead of trusting implication, edging toward soft platitude. The final understanding feels tidy, smoothing over the supposed depth of past pain. There is some lasting resonance in the idea of carrying the stillpoint’s secrets back into the labyrinth of the heart, but it could bear more complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of reframing failure, the ethics of rewriting history, and finding one’s place in a larger narrative are coherent and threaded through the weeds, the historian’s pen, and the anomaly. However, the story often states its themes outright (“The task was not just about restoring a pen but about understanding the power of altering narratives”), edging into essayistic explanation. The final image—Aria writing with ink made from celestial signals—has genuine conceptual resonance. Ambiguity about how she’ll use this power offers some lingering thematic tension, even if the piece leans toward comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and the beauty of overlooked lives are coherent and consistent, but they’re frequently stated outright (“a reminder that even in forgetfulness, there is beauty to be found”) instead of emerging from concrete action. Repeated maxims about “when no one remembers you, the music remains” verge on pseudo-profundity and undercut subtlety. The motifs of silence, sign language, and the camera gesture toward rich subtext but are never pushed into more challenging or surprising territory. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and pleasant, but not particularly complex or haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of art as preservation, forgotten promises, and the endurance of human connection are coherent and consistent. However, they are often told rather than embodied in specific, conflict-laden moments (“a testament to the power of art to transcend time and circumstance,” etc.). The final paragraphs tip into overt summarizing and quasi-moralizing instead of letting images and choices carry the resonance. As a result, thematic impact feels generic, not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.0)
    The themes of interconnectedness, collective memory, and the bittersweetness of fleeting moments are clear but heavily told—phrases like “symbol of the connection that transcended the boundaries of individual minds” state what the imagery could have implied. Subtext is thin; the lagoon and garden operate mainly as declared symbols rather than evolving in meaning through specific, surprising particulars. The ending does offer a modest emotional aftereffect (quiet hope against inevitable loss) but leans toward sentimentality and repetition instead of layered ambiguity. The piece would gain depth if entangled memories or the “shared dream” manifested in more concrete, dramatized ways.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.2)
    The thematic idea about quiet influence versus loudness is present and coherent, and the final whisper-image gestures toward resonance. Yet the piece leans on direct statements (“sometimes it was the quietest voices that traveled the farthest”) instead of letting events and images earn that insight. Subtext around surveillance, labor, or hidden infrastructures is hinted at by the port maze but never developed. The ending offers a conceptual answer more than a felt, reweighted understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of reflection, connection, and “teaching darkness the value of stars” are explicit and consistent. Recurring images (mirror, shutters, stars) gesture toward a symbolic system, and the final starry sky echoes the stated motivation. Yet the story heavily tells its thesis instead of letting it emerge from conflicted action, and lines like “their presence remained, a testament to the power of silent empathy” flatten subtext into slogan. The resonance is pleasant but didactic rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.0)
    The thematic throughline—quiet, reflective change versus impulsive action—is consistent and legible, with recurrent motifs like “second thoughts,” “amplified quiet,” and the humble rebellion. However, the treatment is often declarative and slogan-like (“air thick with the scent of second thoughts”), veering toward sermon rather than emerging from dramatized conflict. The ending reiterates the thesis instead of reweighting it through an earned, surprising image. Subtext is thin because no one resists or complicates the core idea.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of shedding imposed identities and finding freedom as an internal state are coherent and tied to concrete motifs (disappearing island, unlocking hearts, shedding skin). However, the story repeatedly states its ideas in abstract terms (“true nature,” “freedom,” “burdens of the past,” “world was changing”) instead of letting them emerge through implication and specific losses. The revelation that the island is “not a place, but a state of being” lands as a familiar, explicitly explained metaphor rather than a freshly earned insight. The emotional aftereffect is gentle but more lyrical than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of grief, the aftermath of imposed joy, and art as a way of transmuting sorrow are strong and consistent, and the bouquet is a solid symbolic anchor. However, they’re frequently stated outright (“It was as if Echo was cultivating lightness in grief…,” “a testament to the human spirit”) rather than allowed to emerge from action and image. This direct moralizing, especially late, blunts subtext and makes the piece feel essayistic. The ending does gesture toward a resonant idea—possibility within emptiness—but it’s more told than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of art as a boundary-dissolving, world-reconfiguring force is coherent and reinforced by recurring images (frost, light, humming quartz, dissolving self/world). Some lines verge on thesis statement or reverent cliché (“testament to the power of art to transcend the limitations of the mundane”), which flattens subtext. Still, the final image of the colonnade’s glow following her suggests a genuine lingering resonance about ongoing transformation. More ambiguity and resistance would deepen the thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.2)
    Themes of imperfection, rebirth, and mutual inspiration are explicit and coherent but heavily told rather than developed through incident. Phrases like “The concept of bartered awakenings had taken root” and the repeated restatements of the courtyard’s new purpose verge on moralizing and paraphrase the story’s thesis. There’s little counter-pressure or ambiguity; the text assures us this is good without dramatizing why it might be difficult or complex. The final paragraphs reiterate the same idea instead of reweighting it in a surprising or haunting way.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.7)
    Themes of connection, unity, and understanding are present but delivered almost entirely through direct statement (“texture of connection that bound all things”) rather than emerging from concrete dramatic turns. Because nothing is lost or truly risked, the philosophical gestures feel unearned and verge on pseudo-profundity. The final sense of “satisfaction” reaffirms the starting idea instead of reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of transforming grief into beauty and “teaching withering to bloom again” are consistent but heavily told rather than emerging from implication and subtext. Phrases like “a reminder that even in the darkest moments, beauty was always possible” tip into moralizing, especially in the closing stretch. Symbolic elements (flower-in-bloom tattoo, curtains, stars) align with the theme, yet they mostly reinforce an already-stated thesis instead of reweighting it in a surprising way. The ending offers comfort but little complexity or lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of pattern-seeking, continuity with tradition, and meaning-making after economic collapse are clear, but they are largely stated rather than dramatized. Lines like “the art of reverse engineering was not just about deciphering patterns, but about uncovering the hidden narratives that shaped human destiny” slide into thesis-statement territory. The recurrence of tools (cards, tape, loft) hints at resonance but doesn’t substantially reweight itself by the end. The result is conceptually coherent but edges toward platitude and lacks the layered subtext expected in top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of nostalgia, knowledge, and transformative perception are clearly present and the atoms-of-nostalgia motif has some conceptual charm. However, the piece leans heavily on abstract statements and reiterative moralizing (“It was a story of discovery, of transformation, and of the anguished joy…”) instead of letting scenes or images carry the insight. Subtext is thin; the “forbidden” element never complicates the ethics or consequences of her quest. The final paragraphs tell us what it all meant rather than letting the closing image reprice the experience on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of collective unconsciousness, fear, and the preservation of hope are consistent and coherent with the imagery of shadow, light, and the library. However, they are often announced directly (“Her motivation was not to succumb to this darkness but to preserve the shape of hope”) rather than emerging from dramatized moments. The realization that the shadow is humanity’s own fear is thematically apt but familiar and told in expository terms. The ending image gestures toward resonance but stops short of a fresh or deeply earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of fragile convictions, adaptation, and balancing self-respect with compassion are unmistakable, but they are stated directly and repeatedly rather than emerging from subtext. The chameleon as a shedding/shifting mirror for Lena is on-the-nose yet effective as a basic motif. Because the prose keeps articulating the thesis (“balance,” “layers,” “convictions”) instead of letting images carry it, the piece drifts toward sermonizing. The ending offers a gentle affirmation but little complexity or troubling residue.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of causality, memory, and the interconnection of all things (“tale of causality and consequence,” “tissue of reality,” “stories in scars”) are present and reasonably coherent with the motifs of coffee rings and plants’ whispers. The ending’s sense of “first step” toward understanding, in a place once symbolizing isolation, gives some resonant reweighting. However, the thematic framing is often told in abstract language rather than arising organically from dramatized choices, and the final “closure” borders on a spelled-out thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of memory, lingering love, and the afterlife of goodbye letters are coherent and consistent, and the image of unused love as a kind of stored energy has potential. However, the narrative repeatedly explains its own meaning (“a testament to the enduring power of human emotion,” “a testament to the enduring power of love”) instead of letting scenes and images imply it. The late paragraphs in particular shift into outright thematic summary, which blunts resonance and complexity. The piece lands closer to affirmation than to a layered, unsettling repricing of love and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of artistic blockage, rest, and listening to the universe for inspiration are coherent and consistent with the imagery. However, they are spelled out in fairly direct, familiar terms (“rest was essential to her quest,” “magic that lay just beyond the reach of everyday reality”) rather than emerging subtly from action and implication. The ending offers a gentle emotional aftereffect but leans toward platitude rather than complex or surprising insight.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of rebirth from ruin, the preservation of knowledge, and the nurturing of latent possibility are clear and supported by repeated images (burned forests vs. blooming dune, frozen vs. reactivated clock). The final image—world’s charred remains lit by the dune’s bloom and the ticking clock—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about cyclical time and regeneration. Still, the treatment skews tidy and declarative (“a testament to the power of the divergent archive”) rather than opening up richer ambiguity or moral texture. It’s effective but somewhat straightforward for the “highest echelon” standard.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of perception, consciousness expansion, and blurred boundaries between reality and dreams are clear but heavily told in generalized language (“mind expands,” “infinite possibilities,” “probable miracles”). The story rarely grounds these ideas in concrete, surprising particulars or moral friction, so insights feel closer to mood statements than earned revelations. The final reweighting—that the rainforest is a “gateway” to his mind—echoes earlier assertions without deepening them. There’s conceptual promise but not yet the layered resonance expected at a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of courage, liminality, and guidance are clear and consistent, especially through the star stamps and the threshold image. However, the treatment tends toward abstract repetition (“unused courage,” “commitment to the journey”) rather than being earned through conflict or difficult choices. There is little subtext; the piece largely tells us what the journey means instead of letting meaning arise from particulars. The final note promises future testing rather than reweighting what we’ve just seen in a surprising or complex way.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of safety vs. selfhood, imposed vows, and silence as both burden and strength are coherent and consistent. The repetition of “cost of safety” and related abstractions makes the thematic argument explicit, bordering on essayistic. The final reframing of silence as strength does provide a thematic answer, but it arrives more as stated wisdom than as an earned, image-driven resonance. Subtext is present but often overridden by direct commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of truth versus deception, the quiet power of knowledge, and patient, hidden labor are evident and basically coherent with the story’s events. The iron gall ink and marginalia as tools of truth have potential as a subtle thematic throughline. However, the last lines tip into explicit moralizing (“a reminder of the power of truth and the unyielding dedication…”) rather than letting images and consequences speak. There’s little complexity or ambiguity; the story lands on a straightforward, almost fable-like moral.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.0)
    Thematic material—recovery after ecological disaster, the limits of data, listening to nonhuman rhythms—is coherent and apt for the premise. Recurring motifs (rhythm, paths, missing map, station sounds) build a clear pattern toward the final image. However, the theme is often stated rather than allowed to emerge (“The paths that disappeared were not just random events, but a testament to the power of the ocean’s eternal rhythms”), edging toward the declarative and reducing complexity. Ambiguity exists, but the piece leans into gentle platitude rather than a sharper, more surprising reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of finding meaning in aftermath, the power of stillness, and reframing chaos through a new lens (opera glasses, “margin of daylight,” stone hum) are coherent and recur in the imagery. The final image of walking into the night with an inner light reweighted by the circle is resonant, if somewhat expected. However, some thematic statements are on-the-nose (“to find meaning in the mess,” “discover the purpose”) rather than fully earned through implication and conflict. The piece offers a clear, gentle takeaway but stops short of deeper ambiguity or surprising insight.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of evolving tradition, destiny, and symbiosis with the land are evident, but often articulated in direct, prompt-like language (“evolve tradition with intent,” “implanted destiny”) rather than arising from dramatized conflict. The ending leans toward sermonizing assurance—“symbol of the new era that was dawning”—without complicating or undercutting the victory. There is little subtext: the world seems to approve of her role without challenge. Resonance is present but not layered or ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of hope amid brutality and finding solace in desolate places are coherent and supported by recurring images (trees, wind, waves, photograph). Yet the text leans into explicit thesis-like statements—“to anchor optimism in realism,” “there was always hope”—which flatten subtext and edge toward moralizing. The final reassurance lands emotionally but feels somewhat generic rather than uniquely earned from these exact particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme—art as a way to engage necessary darkness and reconfigure fragmentation into meaning—is consistent and clearly traced from start to finish. Yet it’s often delivered through explicit rhetorical questions and generalizing phrases rather than arising from specific, dramatized moments. The recurrence of objects (tarot box, threads, lighthouse) does support the thematic frame, especially at the end. The piece risks pseudo-profundity in places, where insight is told rather than earned via sharp, concrete experience.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    There is a discernible thematic thread around ephemerality, patterns, and the subjective nature of time, tied to the disappearing ink and the eclipse. Yet the story leans on explicit statement and soft abstraction—“a tale of patterns and time, of mystery and revelation,” “possibilities unfolding like a map etched in disappearing ink”—rather than letting subtext arise from charged action. The epiphany about time slowing is told more than discovered through dramatized struggle. The result is pleasant but veers toward pseudo-profound rather than sharply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of suppressed truth, enforced silence, and the ethics of destabilizing peace are clearly present and coherent. However, they are often stated in thesis-like language (“given voice to a silence that had lasted far too long”) rather than emerging from concrete conflicts or images. The snow and quiet vs. subversion motif offers some resonance, but the ending drifts into moralizing summary instead of leaving a charged, interpretable image. Complexity—such as genuine ambivalence about the fallout—is gestured at more than explored.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of pacifism, continuity through chaos, and “engraved quiet” are clear and consistent, with nice symbolic opposition between the sword and the roses. However, the text leans heavily on explicit statements of meaning (“a reminder of the path she had chosen not to follow,” “not about wielding power or seeking revenge”) rather than letting scenes imply them. Subtext is thin; there’s little ambiguity or counter-pressure to complicate the pacifist ideal. The resonance at the end is gentle but feels sentimental and over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of listening to silence, patterns breaking, and the porous border between reality and dream are coherent and recurrent. The final image of constellations settling into a new pattern reflecting her journey offers a light conceptual repricing of the world’s order. However, the piece flirts with pseudo-profundity: phrases like “silences between words held the secrets of the universe” state theme rather than letting it emerge from conflict. Because pressure is low, the insights feel more ornamental than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of truth vs secrecy, inherited guilt, and transforming regret into purpose are coherent and consistent, with the family publishing legacy as a natural vehicle. The “orbits of regret” motif and the pen nib’s association with deepest regrets aim for resonance, especially as the regrets begin to “shift” in the final passages. Yet much of the thematic work is stated directly (“The Wychwood legacy was not just a burden; it was a challenge”) rather than earned through concrete complications. This veers toward gentle sermonizing rather than complex, scene-driven subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of guilt, art as transmutation, and listening to hidden languages (lost sounds, baby cries, firmware whispers) are clear and organically seeded. However, the text leans into explicit statement—“The haunted firmware, it seemed, was a manifestation of her own inner turmoil”—instead of letting images fully carry the thematic turn. The ending’s baby cries and meteor hush offer a resonant new-beginnings note, but the moral arc (“confront inner turmoil, find peace”) feels tidy and somewhat familiar. There’s emotional sincerity, yet little lingering ambiguity or sharp, earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of unlearning, listening deeply, and “discovering meaning in the mess” are legible and reinforced through recurring images (mandala, tile, whispers, mist). The final image of lingering “lilac unease” accepted as part of ongoing mystery has a satisfying, non-totalizing note. However, the piece leans on abstract phrases and near-moralizing statements rather than letting specific incidents carry the thematic weight, which blunts its complexity. Subtext is present but thin; there’s little friction or counter-reading beyond the stated transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of mercy and reclamation through naming is clear, but much of it is asserted rather than emerging from scene. Phrases like “the power of compassion and determination” and “the transformative power of aberrant mercy” veer into summary and moralizing, especially in the final paragraphs. The imagery of tesserae, fire, and rebirth could carry subtext more subtly if trusted. As is, thematic intent is strong but heavy-handed and under-complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of nostalgia, possibility, and redemption in fractured timelines are coherent and reinforced by repeated images of echoes, encores, and the coin. The final note—that even fractured timelines hold the possibility of redemption—comes through clearly. However, the piece edges toward abstract sentiment (“power of nostalgia,” “brink of despair”) rather than earning its insights through specific dilemmas or painful trade-offs. Thematic complexity is gentle and somewhat platitudinous rather than sharply reconfiguring the premise at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.0)
    There is an emergent theme about finding new, embodied ways to connect to a “collective unconscious” and “hidden pathways” of creativity when technological shortcuts fail. The geode and somatic markers echo this, and the telepathy pill recall repositions constraint as generative, which is thematically promising. However, the story lapses into direct statement (“Her motivation was clear: to illuminate the unseen connections…”) instead of letting subtext carry the weight. The final image has some resonance but edges close to tidy inspiration rather than complex insight.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of connection between past and present, transitional objects, and becoming a “voice of the unknown” are clearly present and coherent. However, they are often stated outright (“She had always been drawn to transitional objects…”) rather than emerging through fraught choices or subtext. The piece tends toward gentle uplift, avoiding any sharper ambiguity or moral tension. The final paragraphs echo the thesis instead of reweighting it through a surprising or costly realization.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.5)
    Theme (shared wisdom, time as possibility, narrative as prophecy) is stated overtly rather than emerging from concrete events, producing a sermon-like feel. Phrases such as “alchemy of shared wisdom” and “raw possibility” recur as labels without new dramatic evidence. The piece gestures toward an interesting idea—that archives and echoes can reconfigure fate—but it’s mostly told directly in the final third. Subtext is minimal; almost everything is explicitly named rather than implied through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.8)
    Themes of healing trauma, self-reconciliation, and the balance between caution and courage are explicit and consistent. However, they’re often told in abstract terms (“path to redemption,” “fixing what was broken,” “where unused courage waits”) rather than allowed to emerge through concrete, conflicted moments. The ending leans into a tidy, sentimental closure that resolves everything cleanly instead of leaving a charged ambiguity or cost. Subtext is thin because the piece repeatedly names its ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of clarity emerging from obscurity, layered meaning (“palimpsest promise”), and distilling complexity into essence are clear and coherent. However, they’re often stated rather than earned strictly through scene (“He had made a vow to himself…”), which flattens subtext. The final image of stepping into a “world that was full of possibility” leans toward tidy uplift without sufficient complication. Resonance is pleasant but not deeply challenging or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.2)
    The thematic core—kindness as a force that infuses places and resists change—is clear and coherent but heavily told. Lines such as “some places resist change because they are infused with the kindness of those who once tended them” state the thesis outright, undercutting subtext. The recurring images (bees, glass, smoke, sun) support the theme but rarely reappear with substantially altered meaning. The ending offers a gentle answer rather than a resonant, complicating reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of resilience, cyclical renewal, and bringing light to hidden places are coherent and present from start to finish. The lockmaster’s tooth as a symbol of unlocking secrets is thematically apt and potentially rich. Yet the story often states its themes directly (“Their goal was not just to tend to the plants, but to reflect light into the dark corners of the city”) instead of letting them emerge from action and image. The ending offers a gentle resonance rather than a reweighting that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of coexisting with the past and transforming isolation into independence are clear but heavily told; phrases like “brittle awakenings” and “translate the isolation of her role into independence” read as thesis statements. The sundial and stone circle could carry rich subtext about time, memory, and continuity, yet their symbolic role is mostly asserted instead of allowed to emerge through conflicted action. The ending’s understanding—coexisting with the past while forging a future—is emotionally apt but borders on platitudinous because we haven’t seen it tested. The piece invites reflection but does not quite escape generalized, prompt-like abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of connection, art as communal rejoining, and self-created “threads” are clear and coherent. However, they are often directly stated (“In that moment, she realized that the thread she had been seeking was not something to be found, but something to be created…”), which flattens subtext and edges into moralizing. The story doesn’t explore counter-pressures (e.g., the weight of secrets) in a way that would add complexity. Resonance is present but familiar and somewhat platitudinous.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.7)
    Themes of determination, harmony with the cosmos, and the power of individual ingenuity are explicit but largely told, especially in the closing paragraphs (“symbol of the power of determination and ingenuity”). The piece tilts toward moralizing and affirmation rather than letting events and images carry the thematic weight. There’s little complexity or friction—no serious cost or ambivalence about meddling with “cosmic tricksters.” The final realization of her “true calling” reads as a neat moral rather than a nuanced repricing of prior events.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme centers on discovery, transformation of fear into freedom, and the idea that the true “key” is conceptual insight rather than an object. While this is coherent, the piece leans on explicit abstraction (“underlying structure of the universe,” “testament to the power of prudently adventurous spirits”) instead of letting images and choices carry the weight. The epiphany feels somewhat unearned because it arrives via mystical download rather than accumulated, conflicted experience. The final paragraphs verge on moralizing summary instead of letting the resonant images (organ, crystal, starlight) speak more obliquely.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.2)
    The themes of empathy, masks, and hidden truths are clear and coherent, with the ribbon serving as an obvious symbol for dual identity. However, the story leans heavily on explicit statement—“a testament to the power of empathy and understanding”—rather than allowing subtext and image to carry the weight. Epiphanies feel pre-packaged, arriving through monologue rather than earned struggle. The moral is tidy and unambiguous, which flattens what could be a more complex meditation on investigation and human opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of inherited legacy, hidden patterns, and exile (physical vs metaphysical) are interesting and germane to the premise. However, they’re often stated in abstract language—“truth lay not in the words themselves, but in the spaces between them”—rather than emerging from specific actions or images. The reversible exile concept and identity questioning could yield a strong conceptual repricing, but the story stops short of articulating one concrete reweighting of Emilia’s world. The effect is suggestive but also somewhat generic and pseudo-profound.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.9)
    Themes of art-as-redemption, transformation of “never” into possibility, and the power of storytelling are very explicit and repeated. Lines like “a testament to the power of art to transform and redeem” and the final moralizing summary undercut subtext, turning theme into thesis. The story tends toward platitude rather than insight arising from specific, fraught moments. There is some resonance in the image of secrets becoming songs, but complexity and tension are largely smoothed away.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.8)
    Themes of circular paths, value beyond money, and the meaning of journeys are clear but heavily told and often phrased as platitudes (“the value of a journey lay not in its destination, but in the stories it told”). Symbolic elements like the foreign money and territorial markers gesture toward richer subtext but rarely operate with ambiguity or friction. The final paragraphs slide into overt moralizing, summarizing the story’s thesis instead of letting the images and situation speak. This clarity comes at the expense of depth and subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme (“shared burdens,” “understanding dawns,” “light in darkness”) is announced repeatedly instead of emerging organically from specific incidents. Phrases like “It was said that when individuals shared their struggles, the weight became more manageable” read as thesis statements rather than dramatized insight. There is little subtext or tension around the idea—no counterexample, no failure—so the conclusion feels like a tidy moral rather than earned wisdom. The final paragraphs reiterate the same hopeful message without deepening its complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.8)
    Themes of perception, inner truth vs. reflection, and expanding awareness are coherent and recur through mirrors, the vortex, and “expanding circles.” However, they are mostly spelled out explicitly (“What mirrors don’t show…the soul”) instead of emerging from implication and image, giving the piece a quasi-moralizing feel. The final paragraphs reiterate the journey-of-discovery thesis in abstract language rather than leaving a charged, concrete image. There is conceptual ambition, but subtext and complexity are underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of hidden patterns, liminal spaces, and agency in shaping the future are coherent and woven through recurrent images (maze, scars, nexus tree, covenant as blueprint). However, the story often states its thematic conclusions explicitly—“the world…was full of hidden patterns and secret pathways” and the covenant being “a hidden blueprint”—rather than letting scenes imply them. The final paragraphs slide into thesis-like abstraction instead of deepening ambiguity or emotional complexity. Resonance exists but is closer to gentle affirmation than a reweighting that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of self-imposed constraint, healing, and reauthoring one’s fate are present and coherent, especially in the Eight of Swords reinterpretation and the closing sense of transformation. However, they’re articulated in direct, abstract language (“motivation was clear: to patch holes in her soul,” “made a difference”) rather than emerging through complex choices or subtext. The ending leans toward tidy uplift, smoothing over ambiguity about what was truly risked or lost in this barter, which limits resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.5)
    A clear thematic intention emerges around finding purpose after loss and revaluing quiet after the roar of applause. However, the story leans heavily on overt statements and near-moralizing (“sometimes, it's in the quiet moments that we find our true voice,” “The world was full of possibilities”), which undercuts subtext. The scrap of cloth and quarry could have borne more implicit thematic weight, but they’re mostly used to restate the thesis. The ending resolves into tidy optimism rather than complex, lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.8)
    The intended theme of interconnectedness and relational over reductionist understanding is clear but is largely asserted (“the secret lay not in the individual components, but in the relationships between them”) instead of emerging organically from dramatized events. Repetitions of “connection,” “balance,” and “reestablish” produce a didactic feel rather than layered subtext. The final recognition that all elements form a “larger whole” lacks complication or counter-pressure, so the insight reads as platitudinous rather than hard-won. The emotional aftereffect is mild and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of fluid identity, coexistence of mechanical and organic, and wonder in routine are coherent, but delivered with overt thesis statements (“testament to the concept of migrating identities,” “motivation became clear: to preserve wonder in routine”). Subtext is relatively thin; objects and setting echo the ideas, yet they rarely complicate or undercut them. The ending offers a calm affirmation rather than a reweighted, ambiguously charged image. The piece edges toward pseudo-philosophical summary instead of letting theme arise from dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central theme—that genuine connection and latent inner radiance are unlocked by listening to others’ hidden hopes—is coherent but heavily told. Lines like “the power to connect with others lay within, waiting to be uncovered” and “a beacon of hope in a world that often seemed too dark” slide into direct moralizing and cliché. Because the insights are stated rather than earned through specific, dramatized tension, the thematic aftereffect is gentle but not deep or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.2)
    Thematically, the story is coherent: forgiveness as an ongoing, uncertain path mapped through travel, graffiti, and the river’s whispers. However, the theme is repeatedly told instead of emerging from dramatized conflict, culminating in the on-the-nose graffito “forgiveness is a map, not a destination” and its restatement later. The result feels more like a meditative essay than earned wisdom from specific struggle. Some images (ivy reclaiming the station, patched bellows) carry subtextual potential, but they are explained rather than allowed to resonate ambiguously.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of unspoken feelings, interiority as place, and a quest that resolves into an inner state are coherent and threaded through recurring images. The final realization that “the library of unspoken words was not a destination, but a state of being” reweights earlier material, but it is expressed in direct thesis-like language. Subtext is present—especially in the idea of becoming a conduit for others’ unvoiced thoughts—but often surfaced as abstraction rather than dramatized implication. The piece invites some reflection yet edges toward pseudo-profound phrasing instead of specific, earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of fate, agency, and the fragility of personal promises are present, and the closing image of stepping into the unknown gestures toward a meditation on chosen destiny. However, much of the thematic work is told in abstract language (“threads of perforated destiny,” “key to understanding”) rather than earned through particular, grounded events. The lack of concrete empire pressure or a specific moral trade-off makes the thematic aftertaste feel more like mood than insight. The piece invites reflection but not at a level of complexity or specificity that would satisfy a top-tier literary editor.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme centers on the relationship between death, beauty, and transcendence, with the emerald chip as a vessel for a “fragment of the divine.” While the recurring threshold/aurora imagery does create some resonance, the piece leans heavily on explicit abstractions (“the vast and mysterious universe,” “radiance of the divine”) that edge into sentimentality. Subtextual complexity—especially around the ethics or cost of longing for oblivion—is only lightly touched. The final paragraphs restate the mystical awe more than they reweight it in a surprising or unsettling way.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.8)
    Themes of forgiveness, the cycle of rebirth, and contentment are explicit and coherent, but they are almost entirely told rather than dramatized. Lines like “She realized that the hairpin was a symbol of the eternal cycle” and “she had finally found what she had been searching for” state the thesis in prompt-like language. Symbolism (hairpin, vineyard hush, grotto) is used in a straightforward, unambiguous way, leaving little subtext or complexity. The piece settles into a tidy moral rather than inviting layered or unsettling reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of embracing nuance over rigid certainty is consistent and clearly identifiable, but it is heavily told: phrases like “the power of nuance and the importance of embracing the gray areas” verge on overt moralizing. Subtext is thin because the narration keeps articulating its own thesis instead of trusting images (shard, cloak, chimes) to carry meaning. The final reflection in the shard hints at a richer, less explicit thematic layer around the conscience’s own doubt. Overall, resonance is present but blunted by didactic repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.8)
    Themes of perception, delayed revelation, and truth-as-ripples are explicit and consistent, but largely told rather than emerging from dramatized conflict. Phrases like “the art of vanishing to appear” and “delayed revelation unfolding like a flower” signal meaning without adding new insight. Subtext is minimal because the teacher-student dynamic is harmonious and untroubled. The ending offers affirmation rather than a reweighting that complicates or deepens what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of stillness-as-movement, harmony with the land, and interconnectedness are clear and consistent, with some strong images (pulse synchronizing with stone, birds as story). However, the piece repeatedly states its meanings in expository form (“a testament to the enduring power of harmony and balance,” “a reminder that…”) instead of letting them arise from particulars. This drifts toward sermonizing and pseudo-profundity, especially in the final third where phrases like “secrets of the universe” stay generic. The resonance is present but blunted by overt moralizing and lack of on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.5)
    Thematic intent is clear—“find the sacred in the simple” in a world where art is automated—but it is often delivered in overt statements rather than through implication and scene. The ending paragraphs tip into moralizing explanation (“testaments to the power of creativity and imagination”) instead of trusting images and consequences. There is some resonance in the final image of her walking away with the keystone’s memory, yet complexity and counter-pressure are largely absent. The theme lands, but in a familiar and somewhat didactic way.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of revelation, perception beyond the visible, and vows as doorways to new understanding are consistent and coherent. However, they’re often stated in abstract terms (“The color of sound was not just a concept, but a reality…”) rather than emerging through specific, dramatized choices. The last paragraphs tilt toward gentle moralizing (“one that would change him forever”) without showing how that change interacts with any ethical or emotional cost. Subtext remains thin; the piece invites pleasant reflection but not deep, lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of purpose, alignment with a contracting universe, and the partiality of knowledge (“stellar doubt”) emerge clearly. The repeated cosmic imagery and the coins as relics of forgotten civilizations gesture toward questions of meaning at the end of time. However, the piece leans on summary-like assertions of fulfillment and understanding instead of letting concrete, surprising specifics carry the thematic weight. The ending is contemplative but a bit platitudinal, smoothing away ambiguity rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.5)
    Theme centers on sacrifice, memory, and the attempt to give voice to fear and the forgotten dead, aligned with the “echo of sacrifice” motif. However, the text leans heavily on explicit abstraction (“a testament to the power of sacrifice,” “enduring legacy”) instead of letting concrete images carry the weight, edging toward mild sermonizing. The atlas, monsters, and crystalline echoes hint at richer subtext about how we mythologize danger, but this is never sharply articulated through conflict. The final resonance is gentle and sincere but not particularly surprising or layered.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of brittle devotion, restoration, and “plausible impossibility” recur consistently, and the bell as a symbol of faith works on a basic level. However, the story leans on abstract formulations (“cosmic imbalance,” “fragile balance”) rather than letting specific choices embody those ideas. The ending edges toward moralizing about devotion being “made whole again” without much complicating nuance. Subtext is present but thin; the piece tells us its insights more than it makes us feel them.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of memory, loss, and narrative as a tool for communal healing are coherent and appropriate to the material. However, they are frequently told in near-prompt language (“spin stories into shared meaning,” “precisely humane endeavor to expunge the pain”) rather than earned through dramatized conflict or specific interactions. The symbolic objects (liqueur label, wind chime, photographs) gesture toward subtext but aren’t leveraged to complicate the core ideas. The final paragraphs repeat the thesis instead of quietly reweighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of wonder, interconnectedness with nature, and the reconciliation of rational analysis with intuitive pattern-recognition are consistent and coherent. Recurring images—the starlings’ patterns, the crystal’s energy, the orchard’s growing vibrancy—support the idea that listening to the natural world yields deeper knowledge. However, much of the thematic work is stated outright (“reminding Elara that, despite her extensive knowledge, there was still much to be learned from the natural world”) instead of emerging via subtext and consequence. The ending reassures rather than complicates, landing in a slightly sentimental register that mutes deeper ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of vigilance, responsibility, and “the watcher’s burden” are clear and consistent, supported by the parachute buckle and the repeated attention to trust. However, the treatment leans into repetition rather than development: similar statements about burden, mission, and trust appear in slightly different phrasings. The ending image—smiling at the fading stars, ready to return—offers a gentle, coherent answer (enduring duty fueled by curiosity), but without a felt ethical or emotional complication. The piece edges toward platitude because no specific, hard moment tests or complicates these ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of selfhood beyond duplication, embracing contradictions, and refusing to be defined by external events are explicit and coherent. However, they’re often stated outright (“He was more than just a copy,” “a sense of self that was not defined by external events”) rather than emerging from subtextual image or action. The brain in the jar functions as a symbol for his former crisis, but its meaning doesn’t shift in a surprising way; it simply moves from tormenting reminder to neutral memento. The ending’s peace is thematically aligned but edges into moralizing uplift rather than complex resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of receptivity to the unknown, creativity sparked by mystery, and safeguarding spaces for innovation are clear. They are mostly told in abstract language (“desire to safeguard space for innovation,” “chain of creativity”) instead of arising from difficult choices or charged images. The corpse flower’s potential symbolic weight (rarity, stench, paradoxical beauty) is barely tapped, which limits complexity and ambiguity. The ending offers a mild uplift but doesn’t substantially reprice prior material or leave a lingering conceptual or emotional question.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.0)
    The thematic core—music tending to unspoken grief and restoring joy—is coherent and well-aligned with the premise. However, it’s largely asserted in abstract terms (“a testament to the power of tending to the unspoken”) rather than allowed to emerge organically from specific moments of struggle. The closing paragraphs repeat and explain the theme (“a true haunting that would never truly fade”) instead of reweighting prior images in a surprising way. This moves the piece toward sentimental summary rather than complex resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of knowledge vs. ignorance and befriending uncertainty are clear and coherent, and the final image of her peace in the mist aligns with them. However, much of this is delivered via direct statement (“make friends with uncertainty,” “true nature of the boundaries of light”) rather than emerging from subtext and action. The pendant’s reweighting as a key to “dimensional harmonics” hints at deeper thematic integration but remains conceptual rather than emotionally textured. The piece gestures toward profundity without fully earning it through specific, dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of creative destruction, liberation from fate, and rebirth through ruin are clear and coherent, especially via the crozier’s shift from failed authority to catalyst. However, they’re articulated in near-essayistic terms (“by embracing the principles of creative destruction…”) rather than emerging primarily from dramatized conflict. The final image of a “twisted, beautiful thing” in deepening twilight carries some resonant repricing of ruin, but complexity is limited: the thematic arc trends toward a neat affirmation. There’s little counter-pressure or ambiguity to deepen the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of hidden beauty in decay, beginnings in endings, and the value of perception are clear and coherent. However, they are heavily told (“a reminder that even in decay, there was beauty to be found”) rather than arising from specific, dramatized frictions. The closing paragraphs verge on moralizing and restatement, with multiple explicit reminders about “magic…beyond the edge of perception” and “the art of discovery” as lifelong journey. Subtext is thin; the piece leaves little interpretive work for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.5)
    Ideas about liminality, time, and “permanent transient-ness” are thematically coherent and supported by recurring images (hourglass, sideways clocks, vanishing ferry). Yet much of the theme is told in abstract language—“restore balance to the cosmos,” “interconnected patterns that governed the universe”—rather than emerging from dramatized moral or emotional conflict. The piece hints at a rich question about what it costs to step beyond the mundane, but the answer is largely untroubled optimism. The final image is pretty rather than reweighting prior material with a palpable conceptual or emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of “rational enchantment” and “connection” are clear and consistent, but they are frequently named outright instead of emerging through specific, dramatized situations. The sinew thread and gallery are promising vehicles for exploring how logic and magic intertwine, yet the piece keeps restating the idea rather than complicating or interrogating it. The final image—carrying the thread into the ordinary world—does offer a modest reweighting of the premise. Still, the lack of conflict or moral friction keeps the thematic effect from feeling deep or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of exploration, expanded consciousness, and humanity’s adaptation to alien contact are explicit and coherent. However, they are delivered largely through direct statements and repeated metaphors (“launchpad,” “unfolded horizons,” “beacon of hope”) instead of arising from specific, dramatized moments. The boat anchor symbol and benthic city could carry more subtext but remain mostly labeled rather than discovered. The final paragraphs drift into near-moralizing about hope and evolution rather than leaving a charged, interpretive space.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of remembrance, grief, and “protecting vulnerable voices” are evident, and the hearing aid as a conduit for memory has conceptual promise. However, the story tends toward explicit statement (“to keep the memories of the dead alive,” “incidental heroism”) rather than letting theme emerge organically from action and image. The ending leans into summary and moralizing language, dampening the potential resonance of the quieter central scene. There is little complexity or counter-pressure; the thematic stance is straightforwardly consolatory.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.5)
    There is a coherent thematic throughline about honoring forgotten labor and infrastructures (“stand by the unremembered,” invisible cables, invisible things Lyra can track). However, the text tends to state its themes outright rather than letting them emerge from fraught choices or images, especially in the closing paragraphs. Lyra’s sense of responsibility to the dead researchers isn’t put into conflict with self-preservation or other desires, so it remains abstractly noble. The final peace she feels is touching but veers toward sentimental summary rather than complex, earned repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of mortality, transience, and learning from failure are clearly woven through the porcelain shard, the digital ghost, and Akira’s final realization. However, the story undercuts its own subtlety by stating its thesis directly (“her journey was not about uncovering the truth… but about fetching wisdom from the failure”), drifting into moral-summary territory. There is some earned resonance in the final quiet image and the ghost’s “whispered” wisdom, but the piece leans on abstraction and cosmic language (“secrets of the universe”) instead of letting particulars carry the insight. Thematic complexity is present but not deeply interrogated.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of translation, the persistence of memory, and art transcending mortality are clear and organically tied to the recurring images of birds, echoes, and the flawed diamond. However, the text often states its themes directly (“a tangible reminder of the power of translation”) instead of letting them arise purely from image and action. The repetition of the same idea (new lexicon across the death of a language) risks didactic overemphasis. Resonance is present but could be sharper and less explained.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of facing cosmic chaos, transforming bitterness into dark humor, and embracing a dangerous “harmony untamed” are present but mostly stated outright. Lines like “the key to making sense of the chaos lay in turning bitterness into a cosmic joke” function as thesis announcements rather than emergent insights. The arrowhead, phone, and garden could have carried more subtextual weight through dramatized choices instead of repeated abstraction. The ending hints at a resonant question—how to live with the uncanny—but lands closer to slogan than layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of beauty versus mechanization, dormancy versus awakening, and art as liberation are clear and coherent. Recurring images—the locust shell, living statues, the mechanical world—support this, but they are explained rather than allowed to accrue subtle subtext. The piece leans heavily into explicit thematic framing (“mechanical world’s cold, unyielding grasp”) that borders on sermonizing instead of letting scenes carry the insight. The final image gestures toward ongoing wonder but resolves into a fairly tidy moral rather than a complex, lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of redemption, connection, and “where broken promises heal” are explicit but largely told. The bottle-storm as hope/chaos motif has potential yet is never allowed to carry meaning without explanatory lines like “a different kind of tempest - one of hope and redemption.” This drifts into moralizing in the final paragraphs instead of trusting image and action. The piece offers a clear but simplified moral rather than a complex, lingering question.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme—silence as possibility, beauty in stillness, hope arising from abandonment—is coherent and well-aligned with images and setting. The halo fragment, mist, and carousel horse all support an art-from-ruin motif. However, the piece undercuts its own subtlety with explicit statements (“they had discovered a hidden truth, one that would stay with them forever”) and tidy moral framing. The result is resonant but somewhat sentimental and over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of stories as living entities, analog memory, and the art–science braid are clear but heavily told rather than discovered through conflict or implication. Lines like “stories, like memories, were not just recollections, but living, breathing entities” state the thesis directly, reducing subtlety. The final image of her peaceful contentment and reawakened stories offers some gentle resonance, yet little complexity or counter-pressure—the world never pushes back against her beliefs. The result feels sincere but somewhat platitudinous and under-argued for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of longing, the porous boundary between reality and dream, and art as an act of translation are clearly present and coherent. However, they are heavily signposted through repeated abstractions (“cipher of longing,” “essence,” “mystique,” “runaway dream”) rather than emerging from concrete, conflicted moments. The final paragraphs reiterate the premise—Elian keeps seeking, the dream remains elusive—without adding a new, reweighting insight. The result is evocative but edges into pseudo-profundity because the text tells us its depth instead of letting particulars generate it.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    Thematically, the story clearly orbits around repression vs. release—ideas locked away by fear and ceremonially freed—but it often states its meanings directly (“It was said that the lock of hair was a tangible representation of an idea or memory”). The recurring images of the lock of hair, the star, and the expanding light do build a coherent metaphor for creative or emotional unbinding. However, the ending leans into platitude (“a universe that was a little bit more open to possibility”) rather than a sharper, more specific repricing. Subtext is thin; the piece mostly functions at the level of declared symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of memory, perception, change, and embracing uncertainty are evident and coherent with the setting and Emilia’s profession. However, they are too often articulated in abstract, expository lines (“When habits break, as they often did in times of great change, Emilia knew that it was essential to be adaptable”) rather than earned through sharp, specific choices. The repetition of “crisp nostalgia” and overt statements about unlocking secrets feel closer to thesis than subtext. The final resolve hints at resonance but lacks the reweighting or complication that would lift the thematic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.0)
    Resilience, forgottenness, and the possibility of return emerge organically from the particulars: the exiled soul, the neglected library, the fragmentary shadow, and the final sense that reality is “a little more resilient, a little more whole.” The archivist’s desire to “mentor resilience quietly” aligns with their actions and the gentle restoration of the library’s significance. Some phrasing (“the very fabric of reality was a little more resilient”) edges toward abstraction and slight pseudo-profundity, but it still grows from the scene rather than being imposed as a moral. The thematic aftertaste is genuine if not especially complex or destabilizing.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of renewal, ecological balance, and the sustaining power of creativity are coherent and consistent with the imagery of seed, waterfall, and “weaving between worlds.” Yet these ideas are often stated rather than discovered; phrases like “symbol of the enduring power of hope and renewal” and “the magic of the natural world” edge into overt moralizing. Subtext is minimal because the piece repeatedly tells us what the magic means. The final “promise of new beginnings” reinforces the thesis but does not reweight it in a surprising or more complex way.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of silence as labor, ritual repair, and peace for the dead emerge clearly from recurring images of accumulated hush, knots, and grounding spirits. However, these are often told in abstract language (“a testament to her craft,” “the power of silence”) instead of arising purely from concrete action. The ending offers a mild repricing of silence as an active, almost living thing that follows her, which is effective but not surprising. The piece edges toward pseudo-profundity in places without adding new insight.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of listening to silence, empathy, and the boundary between known and unknown are coherent and threaded via the map/henge/whispered-chapel motif. However, they are often articulated in generic abstractions—“a truth that was both profound and fragile,” “a language that spoke directly to her soul”—rather than embodied in concrete, specific moments. The ending does provide a quiet thematic answer (reverent, attentive openness to mystery), but edges toward sentimentality and feels more asserted than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.2)
    The thematic throughline about release, reframing, and mortality is coherent and supported by recurrent images (snow globe, last transmission, shipwreck, lectures on attachment). Yet the story repeatedly states its thesis directly (“To let go is not to release, but to reframe,” “the physics of letting go was not about severing ties…”), edging into didactic summation rather than letting images and events carry the weight. Subtext exists but is often overridden by explicit commentary. This undercuts the lingering ambiguity and emotional aftershock expected at a prestige level.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of creative expression as a bridge between realms and the encoding of ephemeral experience into lasting marks are clear and consistent. Recurring motifs—the graffiti, the bolt plate, the storm, the ghost in code—do accumulate some resonance, especially in the final mural and parting breeze. However, the piece drifts toward overt statement (“a testament to the power of creative expression”) instead of letting implication carry the weight, and it shies away from complicating or undercutting its own wonder. The thematic aftereffect is pleasant but not deeply challenging or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of love as both solace and sorrow, prison versus sanctuary, and connection across time are clearly articulated and coherent. The repetition of ideas—“joy beneath the anguish,” “sanctuary,” “enduring power of human connection”—makes the thematic intent unmistakable. However, the story frequently tells its themes outright (“The encrypted diary had given her a gift…”) instead of letting them emerge from specific, dramatized moments. This pushes the piece toward sentimentality and flattens complexity, as we never see a concrete, lived conflict that complicates these insights.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of memory, unity amid turbulence, and the persistence of “spooled wholeness” are consistent, but they are largely delivered through explicit exposition (“It spoke to the idea that…”) rather than arising organically from action. Recurring phrases like “empty spaces remembered” and “spooled wholeness” give some conceptual cohesion yet verge on pseudo-profundity because they’re not grounded in concrete consequences. The ending states Lyra’s calling outright instead of letting image and situation imply it. Subtext is minimal; the piece largely tells us what its ideas mean.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of limits, representation, and impermanence are well-integrated through the coin’s message, the guild’s ambition to “mirror the sky inside walls,” and the imminent demolition. The final image—carrying the coin and essence of the library away—provides a resonant, non-literal answer about what can be preserved. However, some thematic content is delivered in abstract, essayistic phrasing (“limits of human understanding and the futility of seeking to capture the infinite”), which blunts subtlety. The piece is thematically coherent and affecting, but could trust image and action more and exposition less.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of curiosity, chosen solitude within community, and the quiet dignity of patient work emerge naturally from Eli’s behavior and the airship micro-society. The luminance and hopscotch code hint at a deeper idea about hidden patterns and communication across time. However, the piece leans on familiar formulations (“discovery of a lifetime,” gratitude for belonging) without pushing toward a sharper, more ambiguous insight. The final image suggests wonder more than a reweighted, resonant answer to a thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of repair, time, and belonging are consistent, with the “rhythm of repair” and cosmic machinery images tying character desire to a broader metaphysical frame. The hall of mirrors offers a potentially rich metaphor for time and self-understanding. However, the story leans on explicit thematic statements (“they knew that their craft was not just about repair…”) rather than letting subtext arise organically. The resolution veers toward gentle sermonizing rather than a complex, felt ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of collective effort, belonging, and hope are coherent and clearly tied to Aria’s plan and the settlers’ cooperation. The butterfly garden and watering bell offer a promising symbolic thread that shifts from private beauty to communal emblem. Yet the piece leans toward overt reassurance (“a beacon of hope”) and tidy uplift without counterpressure or ambiguity. Little is left for the reader to infer; the thematic statement is essentially summarized rather than earned through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of fragility, beauty in brokenness, and reverent stewardship are consistent and anchored in the puppet head and “beautifully flawed fabric of existence.” The recurrence of hush and balance provides a coherent conceptual frame that the ending gently reweights. However, the piece leans on explicit abstractions (“quiet reverence,” “delicate balance of the universe”) rather than letting concrete events carry the insight, and the thematic arc is largely static. It resonates mildly rather than discovering something surprising or hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.4)
    There is a coherent thematic throughline about transforming a cursed, dangerous space into a beacon of safety and the quiet value of custodial labor. The nut and labyrinth both reappear in the ending with reweighted (hopeful, guiding) significance, which gives mild resonance. However, the piece leans toward sentimentality—travelers’ “wonder and gratitude,” the glowing nut proud of its role—without much complexity or friction to deepen the thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.4)
    Transformation, connection after separation, and finding harmony in complexity are coherent thematic threads, supported by the chrysalis, braided ravine, and polymer network analogy. Yet the story leans heavily on explicit statement—“her work was not just about creating new materials, but about translating the separation she had felt…”—rather than letting theme emerge through concrete choices and images. The final paragraphs in particular feel moralizing and generalized (“messy and beautiful place, full of patterns…connections waiting to be made”), blunting subtlety. The emotional aftereffect is gentle but veers toward sentimentality instead of layered resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of preservation vs revelation, stories embedded in place, and belonging are present and coherent, and the bottled moonlight is a promising image to carry them. Yet the story repeatedly states its meanings—“where stories begin,” “true place in the world,” “deep sense of purpose”—rather than letting images and choices imply them. The epiphany feels under-earned because it arrives without significant friction or contradiction. The result is closer to gentle sermon than layered subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of healing, memory, and the transformation (rather than erasure) of remorse are coherent and consistent with the imagery. However, they are heavily stated rather than emerging from subtext—lines like “a testament to the power of healing and the passage of time” and “The memories would always be there, but they would no longer be a source of pain” read as explicit moralizing. There is little ambiguity or counter-pressure to complicate the idea that all remorse can be smoothed by one sacrificial figure. The final resonance is pleasant but tidy and unsurprising.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of reconciliation between past and progress, and of building bridges from silos, are clear and cohesive. However, they are asserted in generalized, near-moralizing language rather than emerging from fraught choices or specific consequences. The ending’s “vigorous tender hope” is touching but edges toward sentimentality because no genuine cost or ambivalence is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of memory, abandonment, and the reclamation of forgotten aspirations are coherent and supported by the observatory, mirror, and “abandoned dreams” motif. However, the piece leans heavily on direct thematic statements (“she knew that she had become the archeologist of abandoned dreams”) rather than letting meaning emerge from dramatized moments. The ending’s sense of newfound purpose has some resonance but edges into summary-style moralizing. Subtext—such as what personal cost this excavation of others’ dreams might entail—remains underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of vigilance, knowledge as responsibility, and the cultivation of latent potential are present and coherent, especially in the final return to her chamber with the doodle still “etched in her mind.” The serpent-and-seed motif has thematic promise as a symbol of guarded growth, but the story mostly states its meanings (“not just a metaphor, but a tangible force”) instead of letting them emerge through conflict. The ending leans toward direct moralizing about “responsibility that came with knowledge” rather than trusting image and implication. Resonance is there, but it feels explained rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of empathy, art as repair, and music-in-silence are coherent and recur through objects (the grove, the sculpture, the insulator). However, they are often spelled out in abstract language (“empathy into motion,” “a world that sorely needed it”) rather than emerging from implication and image. The ending offers a gentle conceptual repricing of silence—no longer oppressive—but does so in near-moralistic phrasing. There is some resonance, but little complexity or counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.0)
    The themes—exile as catalyst, discovering beauty in difficulty, translating silence into meaning—are coherent and recur through images of chess, stars, and the nexus. However, they are often declared outright (“a mantra he had adopted,” “a seeker of truth”) rather than earned through dramatized conflict or irony. The ending does deliver a consistent emotional color, but it leans close to inspirational summary rather than layered resonance. Complexity is limited; there’s little friction or counter-reading on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of empathy, silence, and connection are clear and recurrent, with some effective images of “quiet moments between the notes of life.” However, the story often states its thesis directly—“The core concept of empathy was one that Elara held dear”—instead of allowing it to emerge from conflict and implication. The lesson she carries forward reads as a gentle affirmation rather than an earned, complex insight. Subtext around privacy, consent, and the ethics of reading someone’s diary goes unexplored, which limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of hidden wisdom, attentiveness, and “serenity within motion” are coherent and recur through journaling, doodles, and the bloom. However, they are heavily told—“She realized that the undercurrent of wisdom was not something to be discovered…”—rather than emerging from subtext or difficult choice. The corpse flower’s transformative scent functions as a straightforward enlightenment device with little ambiguity or counter-pressure. The ending resonates gently but edges toward platitude rather than layered complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of resilience, symbiosis with planetary energy, and discovery altering perception are clear and coherent, culminating in Lyra’s repriced understanding of the orchard’s resilience. However, the piece leans on explicit statement (“The orchard’s resilience was no longer a mystery,” “She knew that she had discovered something profound”) rather than letting images and consequences carry the insight. The broken arrow tip hints at deeper history or violence but is not thematically developed here. The emotional aftereffect is gentle wonder, not a complex or disquieting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of foresight, human fallibility, and the interplay of complex systems (“complex interplay of factors,” “rapidly adapting response”) are coherent and tied to her methodical work. The flight engineer’s patch as a symbol of the human element within technical catastrophe is conceptually sound and thematically apt. However, the piece leans heavily on abstract formulations (“underlying forces,” “cultivation of foresight in action”) rather than letting concrete moments embody those ideas, giving the ending a mildly didactic cast. The resonance is real but not deeply layered or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme—that wonder and art reveal deeper truths and are essential to existence—is consistent and clearly tied to the central ritual. However, it’s often delivered in explicit abstract statements (“certify wonder as essential,” “testament to the power of art”) rather than allowed to emerge from implication and image. The ending’s resonance derives from the remembered song and hush, but the moralizing edges toward sermon rather than discovery. Complexity or counterpressure to this belief never appears.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme—learning from failure, transformation through confronting the unknown—is explicit and coherent but handled didactically. Sentences like “To harvest insights from failure was her true motivation” state the thesis rather than allowing it to emerge from specific experiences or hard choices. The flute and canyon hush provide some symbolic scaffolding for a meditation on stillness and inner change, and the ending’s quiet return image has modest resonance. Overall, the piece leans on generic spiritual language instead of earned, particularized wisdom, limiting its thematic sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of empathy, self/other boundaries, and language as a conduit for emotion are explicit and coherent. However, they’re often told in thesis-like phrases (“the mathematics of emotion,” “transposed empathy”) rather than emerging organically from dramatized scenes. The final image—Echo walking into darkness guided by the “lucidity of their vision”—does offer a modest conceptual repricing of the quest. The piece leans toward pseudo-profundity at times, blunting its potential complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of wonder, community, and the porous boundary between reality and myth are clear but over-articulated in expository lines (“Eira’s task was not just to retrieve relics, but to coax wonder from the routine”). The pendant as a community-germinating object and the aurora-woman as a liminal figure offer good raw material, yet the story repeatedly states its thesis instead of letting actions and images carry it. The ending reiterates the mission (“keep the spark of wonder alive”) rather than reweighting it with new complexity or cost. The result is pleasant but edges toward sermonizing rather than layered resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.8)
    Themes of interconnectedness, perception beyond surfaces, and paradox (“truthful lies”) are coherent but heavily told. Many lines simply announce profundity (“a truth that was both simple and profound”) rather than letting it emerge from concrete events. Because there is little friction or counter-pressure, the piece verges on sermonizing about mystery and truth. The final paragraphs reiterate the thesis instead of reweighting earlier specifics in a fresh, resonant way.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of connection, patience, and renewal are coherently tied to the puzzle, weaving, forest, and silence motifs. There is a mild but genuine revaluation when the “raveling silence” becomes a bridge and the orchard a gateway. However, the piece leans heavily on repeated abstractions (“power of love and determination,” “beacon of hope”) that edge toward sentimentality and platitude. Thematic complexity is limited; countercurrents or moral ambiguities are largely absent.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of transformation, value beyond money (“bartered awakenings”), and resilience from rubble are clear and consistent, and the generational handoff at the end supports them. However, they are often articulated in abstract, thesis-like language (“the potential it held for transformation,” “azure defiance”) rather than emerging organically from dramatized struggle. The lack of real cost or ethical friction keeps the thematic resonance somewhat sentimental and uncomplicated. Still, the motifs of silk, mines, and arches are thematically aligned and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.8)
    Themes of hidden structures, withheld truths, and the beauty/complexity of the multiverse are present, but they are mostly declared in general language rather than emerging from specific, dramatized encounters. The “truth” is never articulated or even concretely gestured at, which makes the claimed reweighting of her worldview feel somewhat pseudo-profound. The green shard and spaceport could have been strong thematic anchors but are used more as atmospheric props than evolving symbols. The ending invites reflection but stops short of offering a resonant, non-literal answer to a clearly posed central question.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—safety versus darkness, loneliness and connection through quiet rituals, finding beauty in erosion—is coherent and mostly emerges from actions and images (sea glass, cairns, the lighthouse as “vessel” of sorrow). The recurrence of light/dark and watching/being watched builds a stable thematic field. However, lines like “a vessel, containing a deep and abiding sorrow” edge toward telling and soft sentimentality. The ending offers resonance but not a particularly complex or surprising reweighting of earlier material.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of tradition vs. digital ephemerality and light/shadow as a way of shaping reality are clear and coherent. However, they’re often asserted directly (“For in a world without print newspapers, the herald's role was more crucial than ever”) rather than emerging from fraught choices or subtext. The cyclical ending reinforces continuity but doesn’t significantly reweight what came before. The piece invites mild reflection but stops short of a complex or surprising thematic insight.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.3)
    The wing-as-metaphor for certain people’s ability to refract and reflect stories has conceptual elegance, and the final realization about individuals drawing others “into their orbit” ties image and theme together. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit thematic statements (“The stories that people told… were not just random events”) instead of letting subtext accrue through scene. The donor heart, potentially rich thematically, is under-integrated and feels like a mostly unused symbol. The ending lands emotionally gentle, but with some sentimentality and over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.5)
    Theme centers on repair, interconnectedness, and “mundane miracles,” but it is frequently stated outright (“For in this world, even the most broken things could be made whole again…”) instead of arising from concrete, pressured moments. The repeated explanation that sorrow is quantifiable and that ordinary/extraordinary are intertwined veers toward soft moralizing. The ending affirms wonder and purpose, yet does so in generalized language that could apply to many similar pieces. Subtext—e.g., the ethics of mending another’s sorrow, or the cost of being drawn to brokenness—remains largely unexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of memory, communal connection, and art (songs) as a healing force are coherent and aligned with the imagery of “woven dawns” and knitting communities. However, these ideas are often stated directly (“a beacon of hope,” “its people connected once more”) rather than emerging through implication or dramatized tension. The ending, in particular, leans into overt moralizing instead of letting the final image carry the resonance. Subtlety and complexity are sacrificed for reiterated affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of paradox, journey-over-destination, and the value of questioning are coherent and consistently threaded through the library, the note, and the “staying while leaving” motif. However, the story leans heavily on direct statement (“truth is not in the answer, but in the question”; “sometimes, the truth is not in the destination, but in the journey itself”), which reads more like articulated thesis than emergent insight. The epiphany feels gentle and somewhat generic rather than uniquely earned from specific, dramatized struggle. This undercuts the depth of thematic resonance expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of finding the sacred in the ordinary, quiet redemption, and guerrilla beauty are clear and coherent. However, they are often delivered as explicit takeaway (“The bread… had been more than just a simple loaf; it had been a key to unlocking a deeper understanding of the world”) rather than emerging through dramatized choice or subtext. The lack of concrete past wrongdoing softens the moral or emotional complexity of “absolution.” The result is pleasant and mildly resonant but veers toward sentimentality and didactic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of memory versus oblivion, the continuity of past into future, and the sacredness of preservation are clear and consistent, especially in lines about “conjuring meaning from the edge of oblivion” and the vows still “shaping the present.” However, the piece leans on repeated abstract statements of theme rather than letting subtext emerge from concrete choices and frictions. The late articulation that her task is “not just to catalog… but to illuminate the path forward” approaches a thesis sentence, tipping into mild didacticism. The resonance is gentle but more pretty than probing, with limited complexity or counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.5)
    There are hints of themes around trust, fragile peace in criminal economies, and the opacity of family history, but these remain mostly abstract. The “sound of trust breaking” is a strong idea, yet it never manifests in a specific betrayal or audible moment; it functions more as a prompt phrase than a dramatized motif. The ending moralizes slightly about “power of determination” and “secrets in the shadows,” which reads generic rather than reweighing prior images in a fresh way. Subtext between Lena and The Shadow (possible shared past, recognition over the fob) is suggested but not developed.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of science versus mysticism, inheritance, and a longing for a world that is “both wondrous and explainable” emerge organically from Aria’s motivation and the imagery of compasses, auroras, and weather-bearers. The recurrence of the ring and aurora at the end provides some thematic closure around connection and attunement. However, the piece leans on repeated abstract phrases (“futuristic nostalgia,” “magic that lay just beyond the edge of reality”) that verge on sentimentality and pseudo-profundity rather than specific earned insight. The ending gestures toward resonance but does not quite reweight earlier material with a fresh, non-trivial understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of descent into depth to recover creativity and the idea that making art itself is the “key” are coherent and supported by recurring images (cave, crystals, lock). However, the story leans heavily on explicit thematic statements—e.g., “a reminder that sometimes, it takes a journey into the depths to uncover the true depths of one's own artistic potential”—which borders on moralizing and undercuts subtext. The lock’s transformation offers a nice symbolic shift, but its implications are explained rather than left to resonate. Overall, the piece gestures toward resonance but doesn’t fully trust image and action over commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of truth, lost intimacy, and the value of small, candid moments are woven consistently through Aria’s vocation, the repository of conversations, and the city’s ecological collapse. The final state—her art infused with deeper candor—logically arises from her exposure to these lost conversations. However, the last paragraphs lean into direct statement (“a reminder of the power of truth and connection in a world gone toxic”) that borders on moralizing rather than leaving more work to image and implication. The thematic arc is coherent and resonant but not yet subtle or surprising enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.4)
    Themes of nonverbal truth, art as a bridge beyond language, and “the color of wonder” are explicit and consistent but largely asserted rather than dramatized. Lines like “after words become unnecessary, the language of the heart would take over” state the thesis directly, leaving little room for subtext or complexity. There’s no counter-pressure or complication that might give the theme teeth or ambiguity. The ending reinforces the same ideas it has repeated throughout instead of reweighting them in a surprising or earned way.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of renewal, containment of trauma, and partial healing are coherent, especially in pairing the controlled burn with Aria’s emotional reset. The box of childhood fears and the desert roses offer potential symbolic depth, and the closing image of lighter burdens gestures toward resonance. However, the piece over-explains its insights (“The box was a tangible representation…,” “she had taken the first step towards healing”), undercutting subtext. The moral-emotional takeaway feels correct but somewhat generic and unearnedly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme “listening heals” is baldly articulated in thesis form (“she began to grasp the underlying theme - that listening heals”) instead of emerging through conflict and image. The final note in the display case—“To those who listen, stories unfold”—reads as a moral tag rather than a resonant reweighting. There is some organic thematic echo between locket, anonymous letters, and writer’s grief, but it’s undercut by repetition and didacticism. Complexity (e.g., limits or costs of listening) is absent, leaving a tidy, sentimental takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of self-encryption, calm defiance, and transforming vulnerability into strength are consistent and tied to the dice, web, and journal motifs. However, the story leans on direct statement ("she sought to encrypt her vulnerability as strength") and repeated tags ("calm defiance," "mysterious familiarity") rather than letting subtext arise from charged decisions. The ending image (stepping into light, leaving web and lab behind) carries some resonance but veers toward tidy uplift without much complexity or ambivalence. Thematic work is coherent but feels explained more than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of memory, loss, and rediscovery are clear and recurrent, with the wildflowers, lanterns, and recovered memories all pointing toward reclamation of the past. Yet the piece leans into generalized uplift (“even in the darkest of times, there was always the possibility of rediscovery”) that borders on platitude rather than hard-won insight. Subtext about what it might mean to live with or without those memories, or why some should perhaps stay buried, never materializes. The final image reframes the lantern-lighting, but without enough ambiguity or conceptual cost to linger deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of silence as power, balance, and the calming of prophetic dread recur consistently and tie to the ritual and the crane, giving the piece a unified conceptual core. However, the treatment is largely declarative and repetitive (“power of silence,” “tranquility,” “smoothed hush”), offering little nuance or surprise. The ending leans toward summary and affirmation rather than a reweighting that complicates or darkens what came before. Subtext is minimal; the story tells us what silence means instead of letting images and choices generate that meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of history, hidden knowledge, and “agreed upon lies” are interesting but are mostly explained outright rather than emerging through conflict and implication. The piece gestures toward the idea that learning dead languages reconfigures how one sees the world, which gives the closing seal-gift some resonance. However, lines like “Keep this as a reminder… of the agreed upon lies that we have uncovered” edge into explicit thesis statement and dilute subtext. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and pleasant rather than deeply haunting or complex.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of confronting the past, transforming isolation into independence, and the power of memory are coherent and consistent with the seashell/morning light imagery. However, they’re heavily over-articulated in expository lines (“Lyra’s story was one of transformation, a journey from isolation to independence”) that tell the thesis instead of letting it emerge from scene and image. The final paragraphs slide into overt moralizing summary, which flattens complexity and undercuts subtext. There is little ambiguity or counter-reading potential; the piece resolves into a neat, stated lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of rewriting oppressive history, disconnecting authorial intent, and “forgiving the unfinished” are coherent and consistent. The rose thorn, key, and sanctuary hint at subtext around beauty, fragility, and hidden truths, but these motifs stay mostly at the level of repeated emblem rather than deepening into morally knotted situations. The final peace and closure lean toward a tidy moral—that this act redeems or heals—without seriously entertaining counterpressures. Resonance is mild and lyrical, but not probing or surprising enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of connection, memory, and how people “echo” through one another are coherent and supported by recurring images (webs, echoes, stars, the shell). However, the piece often states insights directly (“the echoes were not just random reflections…”) rather than letting them emerge from dramatized moments, giving it a faintly didactic or pseudo‑mystical cast. The final silence and private resolve have some resonance, but the emotional and moral complexity remains shallow and largely untested. This lands as graceful but not yet deeply earned or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of interconnection, wreckage vs. purity, and the ethics of truth-weaving are present and coherent, but they’re largely stated rather than earned through dramatized struggle. The repeated language of “windows of connection,” “tapestry of truth,” and “wreckage” flirts with pseudo-profundity because little concrete friction tests these ideas. The final image of the empty snow globe and lingering starlight does provide some resonance, but it doesn’t reweight earlier material in a surprising way. Overall, the piece gestures at big ideas without fully embodying them in conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.6)
    Themes of hidden effort, interconnectedness, and reverence for maintenance work are promising and aligned with the imagery. However, they’re mostly asserted in generalized language (“she knew that she had finally grasped the truth she had been seeking”) rather than earned through concrete, pressured experience. The repeated reference to “hidden patterns” verges on pseudo-profundity because the insight never becomes specific or costly. The ending offers a gentle echo, not a reweighting that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of truth versus comforting lies and the manipulation of catastrophe are stated clearly (“The liquidation…had been…carefully orchestrated”), but they remain at the level of exposition rather than being dramatized. Aria’s role as a debunker encountering something that challenges rationalism has rich potential, yet the story doesn’t force her to choose between skepticism and belief or pay a price for her stance. The final sense of “wonder and awe” is generic and doesn’t distinctly reweight prior material. There’s thematic promise but limited subtext or lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.1)
    Themes of social transformation, the power of narrative, and using “ancient shadows” to forge a new dawn are explicit but largely delivered as thesis statements. The story repeatedly tells us the people are disillusioned and yearning for change without locating that in any concrete, particularized human moment. The ending leans into moralizing—her legacy as “a beacon of hope in a world that was forever changed”—rather than earning resonance from dramatized struggle. Subtext is minimal; almost everything is said outright.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of memory, preservation, and redemption are explicit and coherent, with recurring motifs (jars, music box, “translator between generations”) clearly supporting them. However, the piece often states its ideas directly (“He had come to realize…”, “It was this realization that had driven his motivation…”) instead of letting subtext and action carry them. The ending verges on sentimental reassurance—he knows he is “no longer alone,” “had found a way to sweeten the bitter taste”—which simplifies the complexity of regret and aging. The result is thematically clear but somewhat didactic and less resonant than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of harmony between human, environment, and sound, and the fragile balance of solidity and fluidity, are clearly woven through repeated images of resonance and creaking ice. However, the text sometimes drifts into abstract or near-platitudinous formulations (“beauty and fragility of the world she was sworn to protect,” “concept of sonic absolution”), softening impact. The ending image—her peace in the charged, sounding darkness—offers a modest conceptual repricing of silence as a “rich tapestry of sound,” which is thematically apt but not surprising. Overall the piece invites some reflection, yet stops short of a complex or unsettling aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of freedom, unyoking from the old order, and “patient revolution” are overt and repeated, but more as thesis statements than as emergent insights. Lines like “the revolution was not just about change, but about creating a new kind of freedom” telegraph meaning instead of earning it through conflict. The final sense of peace is pleasant yet thematically tidy, lacking a resonant, complicating cost. The piece gestures toward profundity without quite escaping abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of freedom from historical and personal bondage (underground railroad, “Free at last,” breaking from a controlling past) are explicit and coherent. Yet they are often stated rather than dramatized, e.g., “she realized that her own motivation… was not just to solve the case, but to break free,” which reads as thesis more than emergent insight. The final reweighting of the dripping water from death to life is a nice image but not deeply surprising or complex. Overall, the piece leans on clear but somewhat platitudinous statements instead of textured ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.5)
    Themes of second chances, redemption, and “turning apologies into action” are explicit and coherent but heavily told rather than emergent from conflict and choice. Lines like “sometimes, it was necessary to deserve a second chance” read as thesis statements, and the final paragraph overtly explains the moral instead of trusting image and implication. Complexity is limited—there is little acknowledgment of irreparable harm, systemic injustice, or the limits of redemption despite the penitentiary backdrop. The piece lands closer to sermon or inspirational vignette than layered literary exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of curiosity, transcendence beyond design, and finding harmony in decay are coherent and supported by recurring motifs (the bell, the algorithm, the arrow tip). However, the story often states its thematic payload directly (“a testament to the power of curiosity,” “irreverent awe”) instead of letting images and choices carry it. The ending reweights prior material only mildly; it feels more like a tidy affirmation than a resonant, surprising repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    There is a clear thematic throughline about absence, memory, and the illusion of deletion—nicely captured in the shift from “haunting sense of absence” to the idea that what’s “lost” is really archived and recoverable. The link between Lena’s professional work and her personal grief is promising, and the numbers as a ghostly signature are a strong thematic image. However, the story leans into explicit statement and mild platitudes (“a new truth, and a new purpose,” “reminder of what could be found”) rather than letting scenes and images quietly imply its insights. The thematic resolution feels tidy and generalized rather than complex or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of healing fractures, empathy translated into action, and maintaining a fragile balance are coherent and consistent. Yet they are often articulated abstractly (“mapping of empathy onto the shifting landscapes of the heart,” “courageous anomaly”) rather than emerging from specific, pressured choices. The crystal as a symbol of wholeness is effective but used in a fairly familiar, unambiguous way. The ending offers a quiet, hopeful repricing of the setting, though it brushes against sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of impermanence, second chances, and finding purpose after suicidality are clear but often over-articulated in abstract terms (“everything was impermanent,” “cherish every moment”). Some images—the sound of approaching endings, the ice moving beneath stillness—offer genuine potential for layered subtext. However, the piece leans on direct statements of insight instead of letting scenes and images carry the thematic weight, edging toward sentimentality. The ending’s hope is emotionally honest but framed in fairly familiar, lightly platitudinous language.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.2)
    Thematic intention is clear—“destined mismatches” and human/vineyard complexity—but it is mostly delivered through explicit exposition and repetition rather than dramatized tension. Lines like “The vineyard, with its destined mismatches, was a reflection of the human experience” state the thesis outright, undercutting subtext. The love-letter fragment could have anchored a more specific, embodied exploration of mismatch but remains underdeveloped. The ending gestures toward resonance but leans into didactic restatement instead of letting images carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.3)
    Themes of inner peace, spiritual stewardship, and the responsibility to preserve wisdom are clear but largely told through repeated abstraction (“echo of wisdom,” “peace that lay within”) rather than earned via specific, resistant experience. Because nothing seriously threatens that peace, the piece edges toward gentle sermonizing about tending inner sanctuaries. Motifs (sandalwood, whisperfield calm, the clearing) recur but mostly reinforce an already-stated idea instead of reweighting it in a surprising way at the end. The result is pleasant but conceptually safe and somewhat generic as spiritual allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    The thematic core—beauty in decay, art as a vehicle for collective healing, nature’s reclamation—is coherent and reinforced via the lavender/factory contrast and the climbing vines. However, theme is heavily told (“a collective healing endeavor that aimed to transmute pain into a masterpiece,” “testament to the power of art to heal and uplift”) rather than earned through dramatized situations, which veers toward sermonizing. There’s little complexity or counter-pressure to keep the ideas from feeling platitudinous. The final paragraphs restate the thesis instead of reweighting it through a new, surprising image.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of growth emerging from silence, the cost of leaving protective isolation, and the shift from private decoding to public testimony are woven through recurring images (hush, crystal, dawn, “pattern of growth”). The library-to-city transition and the scholar’s “weathered innocence” stirring create a resonant sense of hesitant rebirth. The story mostly lets images carry meaning instead of stating a moral, though some phrases verge on generic abstraction (“the world, it seemed, was ready to listen”). Overall, the thematic arc is coherent and lingers, even if not profoundly surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of memory, aging, and acceptance are coherent and supported by recurring images (unwatched videotapes, echoes, worn statues, chalk and driftwood as impermanent markers). However, the piece frequently states its thesis outright—“The sound of growing older was not something to be found, but something to be felt”—undercutting subtext. The final paragraphs lean into explicit reassurance and sentiment, smoothing away complexity rather than leaving a charged ambiguity or cost. The resonance is pleasant but closer to gentle essayistic moral than layered literary insight.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of continuity, escape, and transcendence are clearly intended and supported by recurring images (spinning clock hand, falling leaf, stars), but they are over-explained in declarative statements (“He realized that the concept of escape velocity was not just about breaking free from gravity…”). This direct moralizing flattens subtext rather than letting images and actions carry weight. The final realization does reframe earlier material, yet feels somewhat platitudinous and unearned. More ambiguity and reliance on concrete moments would significantly deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of music as transcendence and “the scent of hope” persisting through death are consistent and easy to read, but they’re expressed in fairly direct, sentimental terms. The story affirms the comforting power of ritual and art without much complication or moral tension. The final image—Lena continuing her work with Emma’s presence lingering—is gentle but offers a tidy reassurance rather than a reweighting of prior material with real complexity. Subtext is limited; the piece largely says what it means.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.0)
    There is a coherent thematic throughline about knowledge as key, sealed awakenings, and the quiet rigor required to uncover hidden truths. The clockwork key as metaphor for cosmic order is a reasonable conceptual payoff, and the final image of the shadows “pause” nods toward epistemological mystery. However, theme is heavily told via abstract exposition (“symbol of the power of knowledge”) rather than arising from specific, dramatized struggle. The piece leans close to sermonizing and pseudo-profundity, diluting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story’s thematic axis—turning “mistakes into constellations” and balancing nostalgia with innovation—is clear but heavily told rather than emerging organically from specific incidents. Key ideas are repeated almost as slogans (e.g., “turn mistakes into constellations,” “the power of nostalgia and innovation to shape the future”), veering into overt moralizing. The changeling tooth and garden could carry rich subtext about truth, identity, and transformation, but they’re treated more as emblematic props. The ending underlines the thesis instead of reweighting prior details in a surprising, resonant way.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of transformation through gentleness, time, and stillness are clear, with sea glass as an obvious emblem. However, the text leans heavily on explicit abstraction (“pearl of stillness,” “sense of peace,” “harmony within themselves”) instead of letting images and events carry the insight. Because almost nothing opposes or complicates the quest, the thematic outcome feels foregone and somewhat sentimental. The final image reiterates the premise rather than reweighting it in a surprising way.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of healing, new beginnings, and strength in vulnerability are clear and reasonably coherent, especially via the reweighted pendant and “honeyed hush” motifs. Yet they’re often asserted in abstraction (“a beacon of hope in the chaos,” “the healing power of silence”) rather than arising purely from concrete action and image. The ending paragraphs slip into moralizing summary, leaving little ambiguity or complexity. Subtext is minimal: the piece tells us what its symbols mean instead of letting them resonate more obliquely.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme—writing as a way to navigate the unknown and “shapes of different hopes”—is explicit but heavily told, often in prompt-like language, especially in the final third. Symbolism (shell, mist, nexus, woman in white) is coherent yet on-the-nose, with multiple sentences directly explaining what they mean (“not just a random event, but a manifestation of her own subconscious”). The piece leans into platitudinal insight about “following her heart” and “power of the unknown” rather than letting specific, dramatized moments generate thematic resonance. Because pressure and cost are muted, the epiphany feels conceptually tidy rather than deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of reconnection to land, community, and tradition come through clearly via the songs, the arbor, and the harvest moon’s legacy. The vine and music offer an image-based through-line, and the ending’s sacred-space redefinition provides some resonance. However, the text frequently states its themes directly (“rekindling a sense of community and shared purpose,” “symbol of the power of forgotten songs to remedy the soul”), edging into mild sermonizing. The lack of counterpressure or moral complexity keeps the thematic field relatively simple.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of patience, transformation in desolation, and finding meaning in discarded things emerge clearly from the orchard setting and Aria’s meticulous ritual. The idea of “translating heartbeats into maps” and becoming a “cartographer of the soul” is striking and offers conceptual depth. However, some of the thematic language (“essence of the cosmos,” “very rhythm of existence”) leans toward lofty abstraction instead of being earned through specific, conflicted experience. The ending resonates gently rather than sharply, leaving a pleasant afterglow but not a fully reweighted, complex thematic insight.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of curiosity, the tension between wonder and rational understanding, and the desire to preserve fleeting awe are clearly present, especially in lines about “the cellar of reason” and “harvest of echoes.” However, these ideas are largely stated rather than dramatized in moments of difficult choice. The ending reinforces the same notion without reweighting it in a surprising or uncomfortable way, so the aftereffect is gentle but not piercing. The piece leans toward pleasant affirmation rather than complex or unsettling resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of balance, burden, stillness, and hidden inner landscapes are coherent and supported by recurring images (tapestry, grotto, seasonal cycle). Yet the ending leans heavily into explicit statement—“The weaver's work, it seemed, was not just to collect and measure…”—which tips into moralizing rather than letting images carry the weight. The conceptual insight is clear but feels told rather than earned through hard choices. This bluntness undercuts the subtler resonance the piece is reaching for.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of impermanence, ritual, and transforming grief into craft are coherent and echo via the empty kettle and finished carving. However, the treatment is often abstract and explicitly named (“The concept of ‘here and gone’…”, “harvest lessons from her loss”) rather than arising through subtext or concrete incident. The final image does offer a quiet answer—endurance and small, crafted meaning—but the insight edges toward the generic. There’s emotional honesty, but limited complexity or counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of regret, memory, and the preservation of stories are clear and aligned with the imagery of fragments and an exposed photograph. However, they are often stated directly (“a testament to the enduring power of human connection,” repeated; “a recognition that the past was irretrievable”) rather than emerging from subtextual interplay of image and action. The ending tells us the thematic takeaway instead of letting the final image do most of the work. This produces an air of pseudo-profundity that undercuts what could be a more resonant, open-ended close.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    Themes of rebirth, creativity, and hope are coherent and consistent, but they’re delivered in explicit, often repetitive statements (“equations for hope,” “power of hope and creativity,” “always a way forward”) rather than emerging from ambiguous, charged particulars. The story repeatedly tells the reader the meaning of events instead of letting images like the maze, sextant, or revived machinery carry more of the load. The ending in particular slides into moralizing and platitude, smoothing away complexity or cost. There’s little subtext or tension around the idea of hope; it’s wholly endorsed, not interrogated.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.3)
    The themes of reconciling duty and passion, and finding transformation in stillness, are coherent and appropriate to the imagery. However, they are occasionally stated too directly (“He realized that it was not too late…”), drifting toward summary instead of letting images and actions carry the resonance. The bear as symbol of Elian’s “wild and untamed aspects” is effective but a bit on-the-nose. The ending offers a gentle, comforting takeaway rather than a complex or unsettling one.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of truth, myth, and self-deception are coherent and recur through the “architecture of lies” and “hindsight clarity” motifs. The ending’s recognition that the real lies were her own provides a credible thematic pivot. Yet much of this is delivered in direct abstraction—“thoughtfully clear understanding,” “hidden patterns and structures”—rather than grounded in concrete, scene-level choices. The piece edges toward sermonizing instead of letting subtext carry more of the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of patience, preservation of ancient knowledge, and human kinship with natural mystery are present and coherent. The fulgurite as a lightning-made glass and the “seed” metaphor gesture toward an organic, cyclical view of knowledge. However, the story often states its thematic intentions directly (“lost to the sands of time,” “world was full of mysteries”) instead of letting them arise from conflict or image. The resolution is gently resonant but lacks the complexity or surprise that would lift it into a more haunting aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of absence, fragile connection, memory, and healing are coherent and supported by recurring images (empty streets, the weft thread, writing obituaries for the living). The ending does reweight earlier material by framing the words themselves as a lasting “presence.” Yet the piece leans heavily on explicit abstraction (“geography of healing,” “beauty and fragility of life”) rather than letting scenes carry the insight. The result feels sincere but somewhat generalized and close to pseudo-profundity in places.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of flawed creation, exile of beauty, and redemptive effort are coherent and consistently gestured at. The egg and mechanical heartbeat act as serviceable motifs for lost and reawakening life. However, some thematic material is delivered as flat statement (“the world was flawed, its genesis marred”) rather than arising organically from event and image. The ending’s “deep, abiding peace” lands, but borders on tidy sentiment rather than layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.5)
    Theme (healing vs. scarring; harmonizing with damage) is coherent and repeatedly reinforced through the black sand, the charred tree, and Aria’s vocation. However, it is also over-explicit: lines about “scars can sing,” “key to healing,” and “true calling” move into moralizing rather than letting images and choices carry the weight. Subtext is thin because wisdom is often declared outright. The ending produces a gentle emotional aftereffect but leans toward sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of memory, history, and responsibility are coherent and consistent, especially with the fountains reviving as a metaphor for restored cultural memory. However, the story leans into explicit statement—“She vowed to be the guardian of the city’s history”—rather than letting images and events imply its insights. The ending tends toward a neat, uplifting moral rather than a complex or ambiguous resonance. There’s emotional sincerity but limited depth or surprise in the thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of gentle illumination versus destructive passion is clear and consistent, with some resonant images (quiet sigh of falling petals, non-fiery light). However, it’s reiterated in abstract, moralizing language (“true illumination came not from flames, but from the gentle, loving touch”) rather than emerging from conflicted events. Subtext is minimal; the story tells us its thesis repeatedly. The final legacy image carries some conceptual weight but lacks textured ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of collective grief, persistence of beauty, and the interweaving of death and life are coherent and consistent with the imagery. However, they are over-explicitly named (“She had been searching for a way to understand the shape of collective grief”; “It was a shape that was both beautiful and terrible, a reminder…”) rather than left to emerge from scene and image. The butterflies and ribbons offer good symbolic material, but the story often tells us its thesis instead of trusting implication. This produces a gentle emotional aftereffect, but leans toward sentimentality and didactic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of forgiveness, balance, and incremental absolution are articulated explicitly and repeatedly, often in near-platitudinous phrasing. Because the story tells us what these ideas mean instead of dramatizing them through specific, fraught choices, subtext is thin. The final paragraphs verge on sermonizing, reiterating the thesis (“the power of redemption and the beauty of a balanced soul”) rather than letting images and actions carry it. The result is sincere but thematically blunt.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    A coherent thematic line exists around legacy, intention behind the dead, and how quiet labor participates in a larger, half-perceived design. The final sense of “purpose” and tending graves with “even greater tenderness” arises from events, though it is also somewhat told. The echoes, tapestry, and crystal form a thematic system, but it leans toward pseudo-mystical vagueness rather than complex moral or emotional ambiguity. The piece invites some reflection yet avoids deep or surprising thematic complication.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of innovation within constraint, probabilistic futures, and resistance to stagnation are explicit and coherent, especially via the spire and frozen lake. Yet they are mostly told in thesis-like sentences (“Their task was not to predict a single, determinate outcome, but to create a realm of possibilities”) rather than arising from conflicted action. Subtext is minimal; the piece often paraphrases its own symbolism instead of letting images carry implication. The ending doesn’t reweight prior material so much as restate the premise in loftier terms.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of narrative scarcity (“story famine”), preservation, and the alchemical transformation of dust into stories are coherent and threaded throughout. Dust, mist, and radio signals serve as recurring images that support a meditation on how fragile, illicit stories can reanimate dead spaces. However, the closing paragraphs tip into tidy reassurance (“knowing that her work would continue to nurture the magic”) that flattens ambiguity and minimizes cost. The piece invites some reflection but stops short of a layered, destabilizing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.2)
    The themes of impermanence, the “mirage of safety,” and art’s transient value are consistent but heavily overexplained. Phrases like “the true value of art lies not in its permanence” and Eli’s closing statement read as thesis declarations rather than insights earned solely through scene. The repetition of “mirage of safety” underlines the idea but turns it didactic. There is some genuine resonance in the final image of scattered ash and the remembered mask, yet it competes with overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of humanity’s hubris, competing narratives of disaster, and the value of preserving lost knowledge are present and coherent. Yet they are frequently stated in abstract terms (“official story,” “truth,” “competing narratives”) rather than emerging from concrete choices or images with subtext. The final reassurance of Kael’s “rationally rebellious spirit” edges toward thesis-ification instead of letting an image carry the weight. The thematic soil is rich, but the handling feels more like summary than lived complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of unity, vanishing arts, and unlearning hatred are coherent and consistent, and the rosette-as-harmony metaphor is apt. However, much of the thematic work is stated outright (“one must first unlearn hatred”; “music was not just a form of entertainment but a way of life”) rather than emerging from dramatized conflict or image. The ending leans into a thesis-like affirmation of art’s power, which veers toward sentimentality. Subtext is thin because theme is over-explained instead of inferred.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    Rebirth from decay, art as healing, and “gentle rebellion” against neglect are coherent themes that recur through pruning, cooking, and the greenhouse’s transformation. Yet the story frequently states its ideas outright (“Her motivation was not just to cook but to create something beautiful…”, “In that moment, Aria knew that her craft was not just about cooking but about healing”), which flattens subtext. The knowledge fruit sprout as symbol of future potential is effective but a bit on-the-nose. There is limited complexity or counter-pressure to challenge the uplifting thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme—“Sometimes, it's the failures that preserve wonder in routine.”—is explicit and coherent but overly stated, cutting against subtext. The beehive’s adaptive “failure” and the city’s imbalance offer a promising thematic frame about resilience and systemic change, yet they’re handled at a high, almost didactic level. The final reassurance that the beehive will be repurposed as a reminder is thematically tidy rather than haunting or complex. The story invites reflection but in a safe, platitudinal way.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of sanctity in everyday spaces, the aliveness of houses, and the “shard of hush” as a way to tune into hidden energies are appealing and coherent. The ending’s recognition of the house as a “living, breathing entity that pulsed with a hushed blaze of energy” offers a gentle thematic crystallization. Still, many thematic moves are stated in abstract terms (“the act of sanctifying a space, of imbuing it with a sense of reverence and awe”) rather than earned through concrete, pressured moments. The piece hints at deeper questions about attention and consecration without fully embodying their complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of resilience, adaptation, and “the power of nuance and understanding” are clear and consistent. However, they are repeatedly stated in thesis-like sentences (“a symbol of the power of nuance and understanding,” “story was one of hope and renewal”) rather than emerging implicitly from difficult moments. The lack of counter-pressure or ambiguity flattens moral complexity, turning the ending into affirmation rather than earned resonance. There is conceptual coherence, but also heavy-handed moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of chance vs determinism, the allure and danger of obsession, and the texture of missed opportunities are coherent and threaded throughout the imagery of dice and infinite ascent. Yet much of the thematic content is directly stated (“reminder that even the most precise calculations could be undone”) rather than allowed to emerge from concrete scene dynamics. The ending offers a resonant enough answer—choosing to be “bound” to endless inquiry—but it leans close to essayistic reflection. Subtext exists but is thin; the story could trust images and actions more.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of art as preservation, the endurance of kindness among strangers, and hope amid pollution are coherent and clearly traceable from beginning to end. However, they are often stated outright—“a testament to the power of kindness and creativity,” “beauty and connection were always within reach”—rather than emerging implicitly from scene and image, which veers into moralizing. The ending wraps the theme in a tidy, declarative bow instead of letting the final image carry the resonance. This undercuts complexity and reduces the lingering ambiguity expected at a high literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.2)
    The themes—preserving cultural heritage, honoring displaced persons, rescuing dying arts—are clear and coherent, and the bread initials and opera glass point toward memory and transmission. However, they are often stated in expository terms (“Elena spoke of the importance of preserving cultural heritage”) rather than allowed to emerge from conflict or charged implication. The ending articulate’s Elena’s purpose in near-thesis form, which flattens complexity. There is little moral or emotional ambiguity to linger with the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of transformation, hidden power in neglected places, and stepping beyond “fate’s design” are coherent and recurrent. However, they are frequently delivered in explicit thematic statements (“a beacon of hope and transformation,” “a reminder of the power that lay hidden”) rather than arising from implication and concrete scene work. Subtext is thin; the story largely tells us what the experience means instead of letting image and action carry the resonance. The final paragraphs verge on moralizing, softening the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of fear’s seduction, the cost of morbid curiosity, and the lingering trauma of horror experiences are suggested by the “repulsive allure” and the final notion that “the funhouse is always waiting.” However, these ideas are often delivered in explicit, summary fashion instead of emerging from charged, specific choices. The dream dictionary and “trick fear into revealing its weakness” thread hint at a richer meditation on self-confrontation that never quite materializes in action. The ending resonates mildly but does not substantially reweight earlier material beyond reiterating the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.0)
    Ideas about transforming environment into art and finding hidden harmonies between human creation and nature are present and consistent. However, they’re delivered almost entirely through repeated description and phrasing rather than conflict-driven turns or earned realizations. The ending reinforces the mood but doesn’t meaningfully reweight earlier material or pose a sharpened thematic question. The resonance is gentle and pleasant, not deep or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of knowledge versus safety, the cost of exploration, and the unease of being watched are present and coherent. The watchers’ silence and the city’s age hint at larger questions of surveillance, legacy, and hubris, giving the premise some conceptual resonance. Yet the story often states Lyra’s resolve and dread directly rather than letting those themes emerge through complex choice or contradiction (“She would uncover the truth, no matter what lay ahead”). The ending image is evocative but does not strongly reconfigure prior material beyond restating her determination and unease.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of truth versus “noble lies” and the ethics of historical narrative are explicit and coherent, and the ivy/illumination motifs nod toward concealment and revelation. However, the story leans heavily on direct statement (“pit of lies,” “noble lies… woven into the fabric of history”) rather than letting events generate thematic tension. There is little complexity or counter-pressure; no one on the page benefits from the lie, and Emilia never doubts her stance. The final paragraphs slide into moralizing affirmation instead of a resonant, ambiguous reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of absence, memory, and preservation are clear and coherent, but they’re heavily spelled out (“a testament to the past,” “a testament to the power of interlaced absence,” “a guiding light to the future”). The inkwell and hidden notes are potentially strong thematic vehicles, yet their resonance is often explained instead of left to subtext. The piece gestures toward complexity (beauty in absence, messages to the future) but resolves into somewhat generic “stories as light in darkness” language. The lack of real tension or counter-pressure flattens thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of recovering buried history, the ethics of marking/being marked by texts, and finding purpose in forgotten spaces emerge organically from the repeated stamp and “reclaimed stillness” motifs. The ending’s notion that “the forgotten and the obscure held the key to understanding the present” is thematically coherent but also fairly generic. There is little genuine ambiguity or moral tension; the piece leans toward serene affirmation rather than complex reckoning. Resonance exists, but it’s gentle and somewhat platitudinous at this length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of transmuting grief into beauty, the cost of luminous torment, and yearning for transcendence are coherently woven through lanterns, cranes, light, and the distant basilica. The final image of grief unfolding like a lotus reweights prior material in a resonant, if familiar, way and avoids explicit moralizing. However, the piece leans on direct thematic formulations (“transforming sorrow into something radiant,” “luminous torment”) instead of letting subtext do more of the work, which blunts subtlety. Emotional aftereffect is gentle and genuine but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme centers on trauma as an “awakening” and the rechanneling of wasted potential in contexts of conflict, but it’s often delivered via explicit statements rather than dramatized tensions. Phrases like “unfiltered awakening,” “unused potential,” and “brighter future” feel like thesis language rather than discoveries arising from specific moments. The geode as a resilience/transformative symbol has promise, yet its thematic work is mostly told (as essence, talisman, guide) rather than earned through costly choices. The ending leans toward inspirational uplift that undercuts the earlier bleakness without fully wrestling with the moral or political weight of the initial atrocity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of belonging, connection to land/people/universe, and continuity with the ancients are clear and coherent with the imagery. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit statements (“The frequency of belonging was not just a signal, but a sense of connection…”) rather than allowing theme to emerge from image and action. The ending’s insight—that the missing piece was within her—treads close to cliché and feels under-struggled. Some resonance remains in the contrast between technology and ruins, but subtext is mostly replaced by paraphrased thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.1)
    Themes of truth, suppression, and the ethics of narrative construction are clearly there, particularly in the “sieved hush” metaphor and the notion of manufactured memories. Yet they’re often delivered as explicit statements (“The truth, she had come to realize, was a fragile thing…”) rather than allowed to emerge from implication and conflict. The driftwood carvings and watch hand do some good symbolic work, but the piece edges toward essayistic paraphrase of its own ideas. The ending points to a weighty moral question, but doesn’t reweight prior material in a surprising or deeply unsettling way.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.8)
    Themes of forgiveness, learning from the past, and “recycling mistakes into wisdom” are central but heavily told and rephrased rather than emerging from specific, resistant moments. Lines like “Behind us lies the weight of past mistakes, and before us, the uncertain path of forgiveness” and the explicit “task was not simply to facilitate an exchange, but to help the parties recycle their mistakes into wisdom” verge on sermonizing. Because there’s little friction or counter-pressure, the thematic resolution feels tidy and platitudinous. The final image reiterates the thesis instead of reweighting it in a surprising or ambivalent way.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.0)
    Themes of resilience, letting go of the past, and aligning heart and actions are explicit, but they are mostly delivered as direct statements (“a reminder of the power of resilience and determination”) rather than emerging from subtext. Repetitions like “when expectations collapse” and “aligning his heart and actions” read as thesis sentences instead of discoveries earned through scene. The result veers toward sermonizing rather than layered resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.8)
    Thematic intent is very clear—empathy flourishing in darkness, connection across time, and the possibility of reclaiming humanity after erasure. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit articulation (“The words… were no longer just a phrase, but a guiding principle”) and repetition of the central maxim instead of letting actions or images carry the weight. Subtext is thin; most symbolic moves (glowing lake, glowing ball, labyrinth metaphor) are immediately explained. The ending offers a gentle thematic echo, but it feels more like a restated thesis than a reweighted, earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of transformation, acceptance of change, and love transcending death are clear, but they emerge largely via explicit statements (“harbinger of change,” “bond that would last an eternity”) rather than through implication and cost. The fortune-cookie line and final paragraph edge into platitudinous territory, telling the reader what it all means. There is some resonance in Lyra’s realization that metamorphosis is expansion rather than destruction, but it feels more asserted than earned by specific, difficult experience. Subtext is relatively thin; most ideas are surfaced directly.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of time, memory, motherhood, and acceptance are clearly present and supported by recurring images like the cracked saucer and hand-tracings. However, the piece leans into direct statement—“lost time accumulates in the spaces between memories”—rather than letting that insight emerge obliquely from scene. Subtext exists (the crack as fractured understanding; mist as forgetfulness) but is often explained rather than trusted. The result is thematically coherent but somewhat didactic for top-tier literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of compassion, memory, and the transformative power of shadow work are consistent and supported by recurring images (tears, photographs, Kwan Yin’s Tear). However, much of the thematic material is stated rather than earned through dramatized conflict (“a symbol of the transformative power of love and the indomitable will of the human spirit”). The ending leans toward moralizing summary instead of letting the images alone carry the resonance. There is emotional sincerity, but complexity and subtext are limited by the reliance on explicit thematic language.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    Themes of interconnectedness, coincidence, and transformation are explicit but undercut by heavy-handed exposition (“She was beginning to understand that the universe was not just a random collection of events…”). The piece repeatedly states its thesis instead of letting images and choices imply it. The final paragraphs, especially with phrases like “texture of transformation,” read as moralizing commentary rather than earned insight from conflict. Subtext is minimal; the symbolism (hush, stars, volcano) never develops beyond its initial, declared meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme—repressed creativity and freedom igniting a revolution—is explicit and repetitive rather than emergent. Phrases like “new era of freedom and creativity,” “silent revolution,” and “power of courage and determination” tell us the meaning instead of letting it arise from concrete, morally charged choices. Because the revolution faces no resistance, the piece sidesteps complexity or ambiguity about cost. The final image reaffirms the stated thesis but does not reweight prior events in a surprising way.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.4)
    Ideas about hidden cosmic order, promises across generations, and the tension between physics and metaphysics are present but mostly stated rather than dramatized. Phrases like “sacred patterns that governed the universe” and “secrets of the cosmos” lean toward generic mysticism. The vision does not clearly reframe a central question in a surprising way; understanding arrives smoothly and without visible cost. The piece suggests themes more than it earns them through particular, pressured moments.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of self-revelation, scars as maps, and masks slipping are clearly present and coherent, and the final image of her “navigating” darkness pays off that metaphor. However, many thematic terms (“cartography of scars,” “hidden patterns,” “true self”) are repeated as abstractions rather than earned through specific incidents, edging toward pseudo-profundity. The ending moves toward a tidy peace that undercuts moral and emotional ambiguity. The piece invites contemplation but doesn’t leave a sharply particular aftertaste beyond the generalized idea of self-acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    There’s an identifiable thematic arc about process over outcome and the “threads that connected the questions to the destinations.” The sewing tin and sundial angle gesture toward a web-of-ideas metaphor, but the story leans heavily on explicit statements (“true victory lay not in winning”) instead of letting images carry the weight. Subtext is thin; the duel doesn’t really complicate the theme, it simply illustrates it in a straightforward way. As a result, the ending resonates mildly but feels somewhat didactic and familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of forging beauty from anarchy, art as resistance, and the redemptive power of friendship emerge clearly and are consistently echoed by objects (the coffee tin, rusted shelves) and the rebuild. The final image of “luminous fracture” at dawn meaningfully reweights the earlier darkness and neglect. However, the thematic treatment leans straightforward and somewhat platitudinous; ambiguity and counter-pressure (e.g., resistance’s risks, failures, or compromises) are only lightly implied. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t push into more difficult or surprising thematic territory.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.5)
    Time, memory, and the tension between refuge and forward motion are thematically braided with the clock, film, and compasses. The story strives for resonance about journey over destination and reshaping fate. However, the final moralizing line (“For in the end, it was not the destination that mattered, but the journey itself…”) states the theme bluntly, undercutting subtext. Thematic complexity is present but flattened by explicit statement rather than left to emerge from images.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of cultural memory, interpretation versus preservation, and cyclical renewal are coherent and recur through the seed, dreams, and monsoon. The central question—whether Aria is preserving or distorting memory—is promising, and the final image of her spirit woven into the land has some resonance. Yet much of the thematic work is explicitly stated (“the collective memory was a treasure trove,” “lifeblood of her community”), edging into essayistic explanation instead of arising from scene-level tension. The resolution tends toward a neat reassurance rather than embracing the unsettling ambiguity the premise invites.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of remembrance, regret, and forgiveness are coherent and reinforced through recurring images (tides, compass, colored regret, ritual craft, bonsai). The notion of “the color of unspoken apologies” is potentially rich and lands in the deep-blue final pattern, giving a tangible answer to the thematic question. However, the piece often states its meanings directly (“a reminder of the tides of remembrance that continued to shape his life,” “testament to the power of the natural world to heal and transform”), edging toward sentimental moralizing rather than trusting implication. Complexity is limited; the ending leans into a tidy lesson rather than leaving a charged ambiguity.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated through exposition ("gradual change," "preprocess reality") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative lectures the reader on the meaning of the debris instead of allowing resonance to arise from the specific details of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=2.4)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("art was not just about creating beauty") and inserted buzzwords rather than emerging from subtext. Key thematic phrases ("scorched testament," "purpose in the pauses") appear as declarative labels rather than organic components of the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=2.9)
    Themes are delivered through explicit moralizing ("unshaken marvels," "symphony of silence") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story offers a tidy, sentimental conclusion that avoids complexity or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit, redundant sermonizing ("power of stillness," "rest a permanent address") rather than emerging from the narrative. The ending flattens complexity into a tidy moral, leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=2.9)
    Themes are delivered through explicit moralizing and sermonizing ("beacon of hope," "spirit of solidarity") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The result is a tidy, unearned message that lacks complexity or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=2.7)
    Theme is delivered via explicit moralizing dialogue ("The love you seek is within") rather than emerging organically from subtext or conflict. The ending offers a simplistic binary resolution that erases complexity rather than engaging with it.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statement ("essence of the human experience," "metaphysical odyssey") rather than emerging naturally from the conflict. The ending offers a tidy moral summary rather than a resonant, open-ended image.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=2.4)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing ("symbol of freedom," "testament to the power of hope") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action. The theme is stated directly to the reader in abstract terms, flattening the narrative into a parable. There is no subtext; the text explicitly interprets itself at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing, stating the lesson directly at the end ("a reminder that even in the darkest moments, there was always a way forward"). This overt summary replaces subtext and resonance, reducing the narrative to a simple parable.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=2.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("destiny whispers secrets," "transcended the mundane") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative relies on telling the reader that magic and profound meaning are present, instead of earning those realizations through the scene's events. The resulting resonance is hollow and sentiment-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=2.2)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit authorial explanations ("a metaphor for the world's gradual awakening," "symbol of their own journey"). The narrative relies on declared symbolism and sentimental assertions of hope rather than subtext, violating the show-don't-tell principle.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("prove that vulnerability is power") rather than subtext or narrative action. The ending reduces the complex premise of "transformative betrayal" to a simple, unearned platitude about stepping out of the shadows.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.0)
    Thematic elements are inserted as static labels ("ambered hush") rather than emerging organically from scene dynamics. The resolution relies on unearned magical thinking, stating significance ("fabric of reality was being reshaped") rather than evoking it through subtext or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Zeta understood that its thoughts... were an emergent property") rather than subtext or image. The narrative tells the reader exactly what to feel and think, leaving no room for resonance or ambiguity. The ending reduces the premise to a simple, stated lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=2.1)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed repetition of keywords ("honesty," "transparency," "truth") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story explicitly states its moral multiple times ("freed by the honesty that had been within her all along"), leaving no room for nuance or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=2.8)
    The text aggressively explains its own themes ("symbolized the mended deception," "narrative of love") rather than allowing them to emerge from subtext or action. The result is a moralizing summary that leaves no room for reader interpretation or resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit, summarizing statements ("she had uncovered a secret that would change the course of human understanding") rather than emergent subtext. The narrative tells the reader what to feel ("awe," "wonder") instead of evoking these responses through dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through direct assertion ("changed forever," "boundaries between past and present dissolved") rather than narrative action. The "in between spaces" motif is repeated as a label but never operationalized into a meaningful constraint or insight.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing and essayistic summary to deliver its theme ("The truth was not a fixed or determinate thing..."). The ending explains the meaning to the reader instead of allowing it to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.0)
    Themes are handled through direct exposition ("The concept of a factory ghost shift had always fascinated the explorer") rather than subtext or action. The central motif of the "swallowed truth" is repeated as a phrase but never unpacked or dramatized, leaving the thematic resolution hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=2.9)

The ending offers a platitude rather than a complex thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.1)

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies on heavy-handed telling, explicitly defining its symbols for the reader ("symbol of her journey," "beacon of hope").

    Theme of awakening to unused potential emerges organically from crystal motif shifting to talisman; final image reconfigures destruction into resilience without moralizing. Subtle irony in conflict birthing purpose; overt "bleak exhilaration" slightly undercuts ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges organically from physical search to metaphorical belonging but final paragraph's explicit "frequency of belonging was not just a signal, but a sense of connection" delivers thematic echo, triggering -0.6 penalty for overt statement replacing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sieved hush emerges organically as core image reweighting lies vs truth, resonating in final "whisper of her presence" without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers plausibly in tempered resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of recycling mistakes emerges but undermined by direct statements like "recycle their mistakes into wisdom"; lacks subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of resilience emerges organically from poles/compass progression; final image reconfigures regrets non-literally without overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.4)
    Empathy-in-darkness theme emerges via images but overt statements ("guiding principle, a reminder...") replace implication; final image offers partial resonance without reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of transformation as expansion emerges organically from ritual merge and steady anchor; final image ("bathed in the moonlight, ... sense of wonder") reweights fortune's "change" non-literally without moralizing. Subtext in cosmic bond transcends death via particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of fractured time and acceptance emerges organically from particulars (cards, saucer, tracings) reweighted in CR ending without moralizing; final image offers resonant non-literal answer, lingering ambiguity in "cloudbound memories" avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of shadow work/compassion emerges organically from stitching/images, resonates in final Tear stillness reweighting transformation without moralizing; minor abstraction in "indomitable will" platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of interconnected universe/coincidences emerges from motifs but via telling like "the universe was not just a random collection," bordering on direct statement. Final image offers non-literal resonance via departing with bugs/hush, reweighting prior wandering. Lacks ambiguity; epiphanies feel pseudo-profound.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.9)
    Revolution theme emerges via particulars like quill/sundial, final glow reconfigures darkness-to-light; direct assertions ("new era of freedom and creativity") reduce subtext, resolving to tidy binary without lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of cosmic patterns revealed emerges organically via rock geometry mirroring stars into vision, final image of vanishing herder reweighting premise without moralizing. Subtext in curse-stir to peace invites reflection on revelation's cusp. Resonance from particulars avoids platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of scars' cartography emerges organically from storm/scars/timer interplay, with final image offering non-literal reconfiguration of turmoil into awe without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of pursuit over victory emerges organically from duel and motifs, final card reprise reweighting questions as destinations without moralizing; resonant non-literal answer in atrium's return to tranquility.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of forging beauty from anarchy emerges organically via library transformation; final dawn fracture offers resonant CR without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of journey over destination emerges organically from clock/compasses/film particulars, reweighted in final compasses pointing to "new horizon" without moralizing. Resonance in non-literal answer to fate's binding: new melody echoes refuge.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of preservation through whimsical doubt emerges organically from seed-to-sapling arc; final rains offer resonant reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting prior uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    Remembrance theme emerges organically from particulars (compass stirs tides, lace untangles), resonating in garden tending without moralizing.


== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of “gradual change as creative decay” is stated early and restated in every paragraph, creating redundant thesis-drifts rather than emergent subtext. The butterfly-wing dust is a fertile motif, but its final reprise merely reasserts the already overt premise. Insight is delivered as aphorism—“the world was always in a state of becoming”—without ironic gap orCharacter cost. The concept is coherent yet thinly dramatized; resonance is intellectual, not experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of “finding truth in stillness” emerges via frost/ledger parallel rather than statement. Final paragraph drifts toward explicit sermon (“she knew she would carry this sense of purpose”), lightly over-articulating. Resonance is present but capped by absence of tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of unshaken marvels emerges through living plants listening to unheard music, not exposition. Final image of frost outside vs. music inside re-prices silence as fertile ground rather than void. Avoids explicit thesis; ambiguity lingers about how long the marvel survives once she leaves, holding it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stillness-as-sanctuary emerges organically through the shift from mournful tone to beckoning invitation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The lighthouse-signal metaphor reconfigures from cry for rescue to call for rest, a resonant re-pricing that lingers without tidy thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme of anonymous solidarity is overtly named twice, crowding out subtext. The bell’s chime is intended as motif, but its meaning never shifts; it simply punctuates mood. Resonance is asserted, not re-weighted by the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges implicitly from the accretion of blossom-light and breath: stored love must be metabolized internally before it can flow outward. The final image reweights the opening “ethereal glow” into a public benediction, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext stays in gesture—fingers to pendant, petals swaying like dancers—rather than assertion, inviting reflection on compassion as circulation rather than possession.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely: the maze-maker confronts the ultimate labyrinth—time itself—and the fading photograph motif hints memory is already a curated maze. Subtext is thin; no gesture or object quietly reprises to reweight meaning. The final stance crystallizes awe rather than a contested value, so resonance is airy but not conceptually repriced. The insight feels lifted from Elian’s interior summary rather than from a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of resilience emerges through seed imagery rather than thesis statements, earning modest subtext. Recurrent “dry soil” vs. “lush fields” offers a reconfiguration, yet the final paragraph’s “seeds of change” drifts toward platitude, blunting resonance. Moral complexity is sidestepped—no tension between feeding people versus preserving biodiversity, no ethical clash. The liberator’s vanishing into the crowd supplies a quiet Charged Poise, but the conceptual cost (secrecy, perpetual flight) is implied, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—silence as both wound and balm—emerges from the iterative calibration beats, never sermonized. The forge, aurora, and synesthesia act as shifting metaphors that re-weight at closure: beauty and wreckage necessary to forge healing. Moral ambiguity lingers: Is Lyra gifting catharsis or commodifying pain? No tidy answer offered, satisfying complexity requirement. Final image of dawn “joyful cacophony” offers resonant non-literal answer: broken sound becomes part of living chorus—Conceptual Repricing without moral statement.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through recurring light imagery rather than statement: golden → moonlight → captured beams. The final image of Lumina disappearing with the jar reweights the premise that art can bottle fate. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader left to decide if destiny is real or projected. No moral is stated; resonance is visual and tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of renewal through creative stewardship emerges implicitly via orb/light imagery and melting ice. Subtext is thin because no conflicting value complicates Elian’s stance; thaw equals good is unchallenged. Final smile offers tidy uplift rather than ambiguous resonance. Theme is coherent but avoids complexity or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges cleanly—vulnerability as strength—but the story articulates it twice in narrator’s summary, edging toward mini-sermon. The seashell and shadows motif accumulates texture yet never re-prices meaning; “shadows” remain a metaphor rather than a lived constraint. Subtext is thin because no secondary character or social reality contradicts the thesis; the argument is uncontested. Final image could fit any self-help postcard; ambiguity is present but not charged.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of re-creating cosmos through attentive silence emerges from iterated images rather than statement; final “ambered hush” reweights prior material without moralizing; ambiguity is purposeful, but theme remains monolithic—no counter-readings complicate the mystic triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of honesty-as-liberation emerges through imagery rather than sermon. Final image reframes the lens from relic to tool, offering quiet conceptual repricing. Yet the absence of dramatized risk keeps the insight lightweight. Subtext is present but thin—no competing value complicates the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of silent reciprocity emerges through iterated polishing of broken marbles, but the final “mended deception” is named rather than reweighted; resonance is gentle, not conceptually repriced, leaving the insight slightly pat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of “subdued awakenings” is embedded in the torpor image and the quiet birth of the hologram-nexus, avoiding explicit moral. The final image reweights earlier twilight motifs, achieving a modest Conceptual Repricing. However, the insight—“universe full of mysteries”—is articulated rather than felt, docking sincerity. Theme coheres but does not deepen past the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of porous boundaries between art and artist emerges through water-bleeding images, not statement. The program’s final reconfiguration offers resonant non-verbal answer, but earlier imagery is repetitious, muting full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from the pattern: truth is not extracted but smudged into being. The alpine flower image reconfigures from pretty print to emblem of fragile epistemology at closure. No explicit thesis; the final “auroral sorrow” is felt through image, not assertion. Ambiguity lingers: is her tolerance a gift or a contamination? The story refuses to arbitrate, honoring its own lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of residual industrial memory emerges through texture, not thesis. Subtext is strongest in radio hush after confession, hinting communal guilt. Final clarity feels convenient because no prior moral/ethical friction was staged. Insight is asserted (“the weight… reveal itself”) rather than reweighted by image or forfeiture, capping resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of silence-as-salve emerges through recurring imagery rather than assertion, avoiding overt moralizing. Final image of keeper fused with catacomb reweights earlier decay as fragile beauty, supplying modest resonance. However, theme remains monochromatic—no counter-readings complicate the equation of silence with peace. Lacks the conceptual cost needed for higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of “ordinary magic” emerges through repeated phrases rather than dramatized cost; final sentence affirms it aloud, blunting subtext. The curl’s return in last paragraph attempts reweighting but lacks new insight. Resonance is pleasant yet thesis-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges obliquely: history as haunting palimpsest, stories as living dust. Subtext resides in the dragons’ displaced gaze—hint that interpretation itself is skewed. No explicit moral; resonance is the sensual after-image of “bronze quiet” inside her. Avoids lecture, but the tapestry’s hinted “key” never perturbs choices, so thematic charge is ambient rather than crucible-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.7)
    Theme declared, not dramatized: “open secrets” repeated like a prompt rubric. No subtext in gesture or silence; final paragraph sermonizes. Insight never earned from event—Oracle already knows everything, so reader learns nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: art as apophatic theology—blue negation, silence carved by sound. Subtext resides in the palette’s single hue and the final hush, avoiding explicit thesis. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration rather than a moral. Minor abstraction keeps it from the top band, but complexity is honored.</question>
    <question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric-ceremonial, sustained through cadenced repetition and ritual diction; perceptual signature is priest-filtered—sound first, color second. Syntax mirrors looping via anaphora (“the priest… the priest…”) without mechanical monotony. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. POV stays tightly third-person singular, no leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of art born from stillness and reflection emerges organically through the mirrored horizon and the act of mapping memory; no explicit thesis is stated. The final image reweights earlier motifs—spire, lake, shell—into a resonant whole. Yet the insight remains slightly abstract because the protagonist pays no tangible cost for the revelation; the wisdom feels observed rather than earned through loss or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—self as editable labyrinth—emerges through iterative imagery rather than thesis: echoes, paths, glow-drain, lunar replacement. No character sermonizes; the only "answer" is the final cityscape, reborn under her gaze, a wordless conceptual reprice. Ambiguity is purposeful: is she savior or tyrant? The refusal to moralize lets the image resonate. One abstract noun cluster ("possibilities that lay ahead") nicks the subtext, keeping it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of silence-as-healing emerges through sensory pattern, yet the final paragraph spells it out (“beauty of a world without sound”), blunting subtext and capping resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of solitude-as-integrity is stated early and re-asserted at end rather than re-weighted through event. Subtext is limited: the courtyard’s tranquility mirrors her inner calm but never flips to menace or cost. The rogue-zone concept could have repriced her solitude as complicity; instead it confirms her virtue. Image of “stars shining brighter” is pretty but conceptually static—no fresh irony emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: scent as time’s unextinguishable bloom. The vial’s final empty glow reweights the premise—memory’s essence is spent yet luminous. No character articulates a thesis; the reader feels the aftereffect through image alone. Ambiguity is purposeful: peace is real yet fragile, refusing a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—time’s texture revealed through pattern-making—emerges imagistically rather than through event. The rope’s reprise gives a resonant final reweighting, but the insight remains oracular (“defied words”) rather than earned through dramatized struggle. Subtext is present in stone patterns, yet the moral calculus of “impossible choices” is never embodied in a specific dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty amid ruin, art as communal repair. Subtext lives in gesture—bowl passed hand-to-hand, music braided with stories—never sermonized. The final image (stars, blooming scent) reweights “unfinished” from defect to living process, achieving CR without moral tag. One soft spot: the phrase “magnificent simplicity” itself appears, a mild Thematic Echo, but it is embedded in POV reflection rather than tacked-on thesis, limiting deduction to −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges implicitly: engineered feeling versus authentic residue, explored via blotter petal that roots artifice in nature. No editorial comment spells this out; the grotto’s warm stones silently side with synthetic care. Final image of luminescence persisting after the dealer leaves offers a quiet conceptual re-pricing: artifice outlives its maker. Subtext is present but slight—reader senses the ethical hush yet isn’t forced to adjudicate.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of quiet compassion surfaces organically through Sophia’s locket story and the planned memorial, avoiding explicit sermon. The cycling motif (lost locket returned, letter mis-delivered correctly) frames kindness as reciprocal, but the concept stays lightweight—no ethical friction or darker counter-current complicates the warmth. Final image of sea under stars offers a gentle, non-literal answer, satisfying modest resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of kinship emerges through the arbor-as-web image and the tag-as-proof motif; no character articulates a thesis. The final image—moonlit orchard hosting the arbor—offers a quiet reconfiguration rather than a moral. Ambiguity is present: the community’s ready embrace could read as utopian or gently ironic, but the text leans earnest. The arbor’s recurrence does constrain Kael’s final act, so the motif earns its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—art as conduit for infinite time—emerges through image rather than statement. The sketchbook’s self-filling pages reweight the premise, offering Conceptual Repricing: art now channels eons, not mere observation. Infinity pendant and echoes recur with shifting meaning, avoiding thesis lines. The ending avoids moralizing, but the lack of character cost keeps resonance one notch below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: grief’s resistance to algorithmic mastery. Subtext lives in the glass eyes—artificial gaze versus living emotion—returning as silent guardians to reweight the premise. No moralizing; final smile is imagistic, not thesis. The concept stays intellectually cool, limiting emotional aftereffect, but the resonance is coherent and non-literal.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of quiet guardianship emerges through recurring cache images, but subtext stays one-note. The tape reel’s return reweights nothing; memory theme remains ornamental. No moral is imposed, yet the insight never deepens beyond “kindness in shadows,” keeping resonance modest.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of transformation emerges via recurring vegetal imagery rather than explicit statement, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext is modest: the leaf’s "delicate shape" quietly mirrors her own fragility, but the parallel is stated twice, thinning resonance. Final paragraph’s "sustaining force" edges toward abstractions; the image would land harder if the leaf showed visible decay or stubborn cling, reweighting growth as mortal. Ambiguity is present but shallow—no counter-readings complicate the tidy equation of gardener ↔ plant.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—art as fossilization of cataclysm—emerges cleanly when relic becomes pigment, letting the canvas outlast the body. Subtext flirts with warning against excavating wounds, yet the stranger’s war-origin exposition states too much. The brooch’s shift from mystery to medium is elegant, but the wars stay abstract, blunting resonance. Still, the final image avoids moralizing and lets silence speak.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—“profound magic lies…in the quiet, unseen forces”—is stated outright in the penultimate paragraph, a textbook thematic echo (−0.6). The idea is seeded earlier via sensory particulars, so the insight is coherent, but its articulation is redundant after the image of Aria glowing in “bright darkness.” Subtext is thin; the pilgrim’s silence could have conveyed complicity or warning, but instead the prose explains meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of collective remembrance emerges organically through artifact displays, but the final paragraph’s explicit thesis (“testament to the power of remembrance”) states what the images should imply, blunting subtext; the valve’s symbolic arc is predictable, not reweighted by a late surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of hidden-pattern revelation emerges implicitly through recurring images (arrows, punch, vault walls) rather than explicit statement. The idea that cartography can be both analytical and artistic is latent but never complicated or questioned; thus theme stays one-note. Final paragraph attempts resonance (“world now seemed full of possibility”) but restates rather than reweights the premise—no conceptual repricing occurs. Subtext is thin because no contradictory value is entertained.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges obliquely: memory as migratory song, reality as weave. Subtext resides in the unheard symphony—an image that reweights the tile from key to tuning fork. The story avoids moral statement, but the final peace feels unearned because no prior beat dramatizes what Emilia must surrender to attain it, muting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges implicitly: goodbye as metamorphosis, not annihilation. Subtextual weight arrives in the duplicate’s line, “I am what remains,” but the story never complicates the idea—no counter-pull of fear, no cost of eternal duplication. The image is resonant yet singular; ambiguity is served but not deepened by prior particulars. Avoids explicit moral, earns partial credit for conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of fair-trade calculus emerges through Lena’s ink-pot meditation rather than statement; "mathematics of a fair trade" is voiced once, late, but earlier images (formaldehyde versus flowers) already encode moral equation. Final image reweights grift ethic without moralizing—risk = ink = justice. Ambiguity lingers, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—reality is a palimpsest of retrievable textures—emerges through action, never sermon. The humming lamp’s reprise at the end reconfigures the forest as archive rather than ornament. Subtext resides in silence vs. recorded vibration, inviting reflection without moral. Avoids tidy thesis, but could sharpen ethical edge if the act of extraction harmed the site.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of listening to past voices to orient the self is emergent but stated (“she felt closest to the mysteries”). Subtext is thin—no ironic gap between her triumph and unseen cost. Final image of returning wanderer is pleasing yet unscarred; ambiguity is decorative, not charged. Insight is announced, not crystallized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    Transience vs preservation emerges through image chain: translucent petals, dissolving message, sand grain returned. Avoids explicit moralizing, but theme is still spelled out in final paragraphs (“poignant reminder…”) rather than left to reverberate. Grain reprise offers modest reweighting. Emotional aftereffect is gentle; lacks unsettling ambiguity that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of resonance-over-sight emerges through water-light-droneship triad; no character ever names it. Final image re-prices the depot as tuned instrument rather than relic of industry. Calm-as-magnetism remains an asserted, not dramatized, quality—slight sentimental bleed—but the refusal to moralize keeps the score high.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of human hunger for hidden geographies emerges through imagery rather than thesis, but the absence of cost leaves it ornamental. The phrasebook and condensation pattern gesture at cross-time communion yet never reweight the premise—no irony or reversal complicates Emilia’s quest. The ending image is pretty but conceptually static, so resonance dissipates rather than lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges quietly: sound as resurrection of communal memory. The final image of a “town reborn” reweights the initial silence without moralizing. Yet because the tuner’s internal arc is blank, the thematic cost is external only—felt by the town, not the person—limiting resonance to the atmospheric register.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of memory-as-scent emerges organically through action, never sermonized. Subtext hints that archiving may equal embalming, but ambiguity stays under-explored. Final image reweights vial from gift to sarcophagus—effective CR. No platitudes, yet insight feels one-note compared to nuanced sensory build-up.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of inheritable fiction versus lived peril emerges implicitly through father-son motif and lattice that “sustains impossibilities.” Final image flirts with reweighting but stops short of concrete cost, leaving ambiguity pleasant yet unsubstantial. No moralizing, but also no piercing after-image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of reciprocal haunting emerges implicitly through the debt-transfer: ghost’s lifelong obligation becomes alchemist’s creative inheritance. No moral is stated; the final image of smiling mournful elation lets ambiguity linger, though the insight feels gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of art healing ruin emerges through recurrent weaving and light imagery, never sermonized. Subtext resides in silence and tide-pool cycles rather than declaration. Ambiguity is preserved: no moral verdict on whether hope is delusion. Final image reweights the illustration plate as living tapestry—an earned, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of re-rooting emerges organically from burial imagery; no moral sermon intrudes. The sundial’s recurrence could re-price time/heritage but returns only as pictorial echo, muting resonance. Still, particulars resist tidy closure, inviting plausible counter-readings, hence low-6 band.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme—beauty of slowness in instant age—emerges from repeated imagery rather than event; no counter-argument or friction is staged. Subtext is thin; chalk codes and arcade nostalgia stay literal, never accruing ironic gap. Final paragraph articulates thesis outright (“beauty in its slowness”), edging into Echo penalty, but saved by resonant final image. Complexity is asserted, not dramatized; ambiguity is decorative, not charged.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of hidden patterns beneath official maps emerges through embroidery and conspiracy whispers, avoiding overt thesis. Final image of vibrating chart reweights earlier shimmer, inviting reflection on knowledge as textile. Ambiguity lingers, but lack of concrete cost keeps resonance cerebral rather than gut-level.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of unspoken regret emerges through recurring images of sealed letters and fogged glass; the final cleared window reweights identity without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit, but the insight—shared sorrow dissolves into composite self—feels asserted rather than discovered through painful choice. Complexity is present yet static; ambiguity is graceful but not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of shared fragility emerges through coral-as-metaphor and mirrored child-adult anxieties; no overt thesis stated. Final image of glowing coral quietly reprices earlier turmoil without moralising. Subtext lives in smudged syntax—illegible handwriting standing for war’s untranslated wounds—inviting reader decryption, though emotional after-effect tilts serene rather than complexly ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges inductively: art as ephemeral reclamation of ruin. No moralizing; final image of colors seeping into bark offers quiet Conceptual Repricing—beauty equals surrender to entropy. Motif of veil/thinness recurs but stays instrumental, charging the closure rather than decorating it. Ambiguity remains—joy is rediscovered yet immediately relinquished—inviting reflection without tidy thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of perceptual mutability emerges through image (shifting pigment, living forest) without overt statement. Subtext in hobo nickel’s “right questions” motif reweights at closure, linking grandmother’s luck to new curiosity. Avoids tidy moral; complexity acknowledged. Yet resonance leans abstract—no ethical collision or social cost—so tops out mid-7.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of linguistic resistance emerges implicitly through gardening code without sermon. Motif of seed-as-language returns at end, reweighting earlier planting as political act. Final paragraph drifts toward overt thesis (“beacon of resistance”), blunting resonance. Complexity is present but undercut by tidy summary sentences; still, the greenhouse particulars keep the idea from floating entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges implicitly: art as survival inside grief’s husk. Subtext lives in the postcard’s color return and the shell-to-womb turn. Final image avoids moralizing, achieving quiet resonance, but the century-span is told, not tested, so complexity is moderate, not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of memory-as-sound emerges through iterated auditory motifs rather than statement. Subtext operates in the cracked tube’s mournful timbre and the orchid’s responsive glow. Final image reframes maintenance as love-inflected loss, avoiding moral. Ambiguity is purposeful: the library will outlast her, yet she persists. No tidy thesis; resonance stays sonic and visual.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge as atonement, silence as both exile and clarity. Subtext lives in the well’s glowing emptiness—truth revealed only when vessel is spent—avoiding explicit moral. No thematic echo lines; final smile carries ambiguity (hope? delusion?). Complexity acknowledged: breakthrough doesn’t regain peers, only self-trust. Resonance is modest but non-generic.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of reconciling past and present emerges through the chain and encrypted compassion, but the payoff is overtly stated: she “knew that she had found the key to harmonizing the conflicting values.” Final-paragraph articulation lowers resonance; no charged image re-prices the premise. Subtext is thin—objects mean what narrator says they mean. The dappled-resolve tonality is consistent, yet the insight remains generic rather than particular to this woman, this volcano, this hour.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of reconciled fabrication emerges through dust→memory image, not thesis. Subtext resides in silence about what messages the birds carry, inviting reader extrapolation. Final paragraph flirts with moralizing (“finding a way to live with beauty and pain”) but stops short of overt maxim. Bittersweet tone stays particular to attic ritual, avoiding generic “accept yourself” platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of “necessary distances” recurs but remains declarative; the closing smile restates rather than re-weights the premise; no image or gesture reframes what distance now costs, so resonance is gentle rather than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of “hidden rhythms” emerges imagistically through fireflies, breath, and bioluminescent pulses rather than statement. Shadowseam wonder motif accumulates texture without overt symbolic captions. Final image reframes the facility as quietly alive, supplying a resonant reconfiguration. Avoids preachiness, though the insight skirts abstraction; ambiguity stays purposeful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges cleanly: impermanence as the geode’s own pulse. The final image—crater glass glowing with “inner light”—re-weights prior motifs without moralizing, fulfilling the non-literal answer test. Subtext is thin; the bird-seed mechanic is too overt a cue to “connection,” leaving little implication for the reader to mine. Still, the symbol-set of vanishing paths reframes memory as wave-wash, resisting tidy moral—complexity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of controlled chance emerges through performance images rather than thesis statements. Subtext is thin—no moment where randomness nearly betrays him—so theme stays decorative. Final line’s “magic that could happen” is a touch sermon-like but brief; ambiguity lingers. Resonance is pleasant, not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—art as cosmic inscription—emerges imagistically: night flowers, star gaps, and skin verse form a returning pattern that reframes exile as portal rather than punishment. Subtext stays implicit; no moral is stated. Nostalgia-ban concept is named but not woven into stakes, so thematic complexity is mid-band. Final image of fading speck-light offers resonant reconfiguration, yet ambiguity is gentle rather than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges through iterative imagery of light—moon, box glow, mirror—ending with “hard softness” as lived ethos, never sloganized. Subtext resides in tactile handling of fragile box vs. scarred skin. Final image reconfigures premise: pain becomes translatable language, a conceptual repricing. Avoids moralizing, though “enlighten” prompt word appears once in exposition, a minor echo.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges as “imagination can balance chaos,” but it is stated outright rather than reweighted by an earned reversal. The altitude gauge and trial balloons recur, yet their final resonance is identical to their introduction—no conceptual repricing occurs. Subtext is replaced by luminous declaration. The ending affirms rather than complicates, yielding a middle-band thematic score.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—legacy as living echo—emerges through recurrence of “echo,” “corridor,” “veil,” never named in thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: rewinding film = vow to keep lost voices alive. Final image avoids moralizing; resonance floats in “forever linked to the ivy-veiled passage.” Some abstraction (“fragile and resilient world”) edges toward pseudo-profundity, keeping score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of art-as-divination emerges implicitly through the mirrored, prism-charged canvas; no authorial thesis states it. The children’s lullaby motif threads color and magic without overt symbolism, but its code remains abstract, limiting subtext. Final image posits art as portal, a resonant non-literal answer. Complexity is moderate; mirrors simply comply, offering no counter-argument or ethical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of redemption-through-flawed-beauty emerges implicitly from Elian’s worn charisma and the terrace’s age, but the insight is stated in the penultimate paragraph rather than extracted from a crucible moment. Subtext is limited because delegates lack individualized voices or gestures; peace is declared rather than dramatized. The floral scent at the end offers a quiet reconfiguration, yet its cost is only aromatic, not conceptual or social. Still, the piece avoids overt moralizing, letting image do partial lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: ecological resurrection versus capitalist drought, refracted through a lone operator who hoards sentiment inside amorality. No explicit thesis; meaning accrues via the extinct egg, cracked map, and returning bird echo. Final image of vanished benefactor leaves morally ambiguous aftertaste, inviting reflection on whether restoration absolves extraction. Avoids tidy moral, achieving resonance through concrete particulars rather than assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—storytelling as ethical subversion—emerges through iterated imagery rather than event, a valid lyric mode. Final “meteor hush” reprises the dome’s silence as conceptual repricing, inviting reader reflection without moralizing. Yet the absence of dramatized ethical friction keeps resonance abstract. Subtext is present but thin; specificity of character dilemma would deepen afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of memory’s fragility emerges through ephemeral structures and moth-wing symbol, but remains generic—“overlooked histories” never particularizes. Subtext is muted: no ironic gap, no dramatized forgetting. Final image gestures toward resonance yet offers no fresh conceptual reweighting. Theme stays atmospheric rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of memory-as-sound emerges through the rope-instrument image without overt statement; the aurora’s hiss and the rope’s hum form a resonant pair that reweights loss into continuity. Final image avoids moralizing, but the conceptual leap relies on lyric repetition rather than a concrete ethical trade-off, capping resonance short of the 9-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of retroactive agency emerges implicitly through the seal’s reveal and the storm-cleansed exit, avoiding overt thesis statements. Recurrent mirror/dream imagery reweights the premise at the end, satisfying the quiet-ending allowance. Yet the insight is abstract—“some paths choose their walkers”—delivered in narrator paraphrase rather than a single sharp image that reprises an earlier concrete object. The absence of a lived social or relational cost keeps the resonance conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of transcendence through encoded devotion emerges imagistically, not stated. Final image reweights earlier star-maps, but ambiguity lingers—covenant’s price is cosmic, not personal—keeping reflection slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from the recurring fracture motif: harmony is not healed but re-tuned around its own break. The broken pin’s silent persistence is a Conceptual Repricing that discredits wholeness as ideal, a move that feels earned because the story seeded fracture from line 1. No final moral is spoken; the last image of people humming quietly around a mute box lets the reader feel the repricing. The slight abstraction of “shifting grace” is voiced once, early, then abandoned in favor of concrete sensory reprise, avoiding preachiness.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: erasing the boundary between dreamer and dream is enacted by the vanishing, not preached. The glass-mountains motif returns re-weighted—from childhood vision to inhabited prison—delivering a Conceptual Repricing that feels unsettling rather than moral. No tidy thesis is stated; ambiguity lingers. The sextant-as-shard trope edges close to easy symbol, preventing an 8+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of renewal-through-remnants emerges via ribbon, seeds, cathedral reclamation. Subtext is quiet but coherent: living memory grafted onto stone. Final paragraph nudges toward moral summary (“ testament to the accidental wisdom”) yet still lets image carry weight; could risk more ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of nonlinear knowledge emerges via imagery rather than sermon, but remains abstract because the curator’s life situation never changes. Subtext is thin: Order’s motives, pistachio shell, and bathroom choice stay opaque, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme of “knowledge must be applied” is stated outright in the final paragraph, triggering a −0.6 Thematic Echo penalty. Subtext is undercut by the same paragraph’s moralizing summary. The library’s “unlearned lessons” never acquire concrete symbolism that reweights meaning at closure; the concept stays abstract. Emotional aftereffect is therefore muted, leaning on platitude rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of memory-as-labyrinth emerges organically via the ship’s decay and fragment stories. The Garden reframes as internal state, offering resonant non-literal payoff. No moralizing, but the insight is lightly sketched; ambiguity is present yet thin. Thematic aftereffect is gentle rather than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—knowledge as braided threads—emerges through the rope image and reappears in the seal, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext is limited: the diplomat’s seal hints at political erasure but never intersects with Emilia’s personal stakes, so the “fables of absence” stay generic. The ending reconfiguration is pleasingly non-literal, yet the insight is gifted rather than wrested, muting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges cleanly: balance is not a state but a perpetual tuning. The bloom of hush reweights the premise—silence is not escape but responsibility—yet the insight is lightly paraphrased in the final paragraph (“she would continue to tend”), a minor echo-violation. Subtext operates in the stone’s pulse and the rocks’ “hammered repose,” avoiding overt moralizing. Complexity is present; no tidy binary between noise and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of meaning-through-pattern emerges via star charts and humming glass, avoiding explicit thesis. Final golden light offers quiet repricing rather than moral. Yet thistle-blown hope is asserted more than dramatized; ambiguity feels ornamental because no real cost shadows the insight. Still, particulars (prism, orrery) carry the idea without sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of memory as identity emerges through image rather than assertion; no final moralizing. The crystal’s refracted sparks become a quiet metaphor for fragmented selves, re-weighted in the closing hush. Ambiguity is purposeful—guardianship is both gift and burden—yet the lack of concrete cost keeps resonance soft. Emotional aftereffect is contemplative, not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges cleanly: stillness as tinder for creative ignition. The motif pair—chant & silence—reverses value: chants start as filler, end as confident score; silence moves from threat to blanket. No moral is stated; meaning is left hovering in the final spark-trail image. Avoids thematic echo, but the insight is familiar; resonance is gentle rather than electrically reconfiguring.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the palate of silences rather than assertion: fear contracts, attention expands. The gilded hush reframes silence from absence to nourishment, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Final image—doll resting on palm—offers a non-literal answer: stillness can be portable. No thematic echo in closing paragraph; the insight stays implicit, carried by object.</question>
    <question>6</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains a child’s perceptual signature: synesthetic tasting of silence, synaptic snow-flake detail. Syntax shortens under inversion—“It hovered”—then lengthens as gravity returns, mirroring physiological shift. Porcelain doll recurs with shifting emotional valence, rhythmically paced. No dialogue, so voice purity is un-contaminated; filter verbs avoided, diction stays within a precocious child’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of cyclical hubris is declared by murals but never tested by Aria’s own choices; she re-enacts the climb without irony or self-doubt. The “futuristic nostalgia” tone is consistent yet surface-level—longing is asserted, not complicated. Closure offers uplift rather than re-pricing; meaning stays where it began: throne reclaimed, era reborn.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of transformation through pressure emerges implicitly from mushroom-glow → diamond glitter, avoiding overt thesis. Yet the quantum premise stays decorative, so thematic lift is modest. Final image re-illuminates earlier glow, supplying quiet resonance. No moralizing, but also no lasting moral cost, keeping score mid-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of intuition-as-epistemic-bridge is stated early and echoed often, but particulars never complicate it. The gramophone crank reappears as a symbol of access, yet its meaning is static—no Conceptual Repricing occurs. Subtext is replaced by overt muse-whispers. The final smile signals affirmation rather than ambivalence, flattening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges as the alchemical transformation of isolation into conduit-ship, but the concept is stated (“shape of possibility”) more than dramatized through costly action. Subtext is carried by imagery (trees as marionette-strings) rather than by conflicting values. The final image reframes the greenhouse as a living stage, yet the insight feels abstract because the knight’s inner stakes were never sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—rescuing forgotten micro-mercies—emerges iteratively through dust, button, imagined soldier’s family. No overt moral; final image of glowing room answers the question of what emancipation is for. Some abstract nouns (“resilience of the human spirit”) flirt with platitude, but subtext in dust and button mostly spares lecture. Complexity mild; ambiguity limited.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of memory vs. indifference emerges through recurrent light imagery rather than lecture. Subtext is thin—no ironic gap between Aria’s rhetoric and action; rebels simply agree. Final shimmer reweights the key as torch, but epiphany is projected, not earned via loss. Ambiguity is present yet unconflicted, yielding moderate resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—art as antidote to foreboding—emerges imagistically through refracted light and hush, never sermonized. Final reprise of mist-with-melody reweights earlier motifs, satisfying the Non-literal Answer test. Subtext could be stronger if prophecy’s human cost had been glimpsed, but the piece trusts image over thesis and lands a quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges obliquely: memory, transformation, and the human need to ritualize the forgotten. The monuments-to-forgotten-things motif returns in the final image without authorial comment, letting the reader feel the reweighting. Quiet endings are allowed, but a sharper ironic sting or loss would have lifted resonance into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges cleanly from the pattern of reclaimed junk becoming a navigational aid: waste → wonder; chance → pattern. No overt thesis is stated; the final image of light receding before the compass glow supplies the resonant answer. Subtext resides in the glow itself—uncertainty literally illuminated, not explained. Minor abstraction keeps it from higher band, but the emotional after-effect is palpable and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the kintsugi conceit: beauty resides in the cracked and named; no overt moralizing. The final image of the glowing coin reweights prior motifs without stating a thesis, achieving quiet resonance, though the abstractions occasionally flirt with pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of finding light inside loss emerges through the tooth’s humble souvenir and the counter-hum lullaby, avoiding explicit thesis. Final image of “luminous ache” reweights prior whispers into quiet radiance, though ambiguity is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of mercy as calculable force emerges imagistically, avoiding overt moralizing. The UV forest works as an extended metaphor for self-judgment, but subtext stays general—no concrete social or relational cost is priced. Final image of Elara smiling while the forest “pulses in the background” offers quiet resonance, yet the insight is stated (“I remember”) rather than shown through a charged, non-literal gesture. Complexity is hinted but not dramatized—there is no competing good or moral tension enacted in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—memory as civic duty—emerges through the repeated pairing of overlooked paintings and overlooked people. Subtext is strongest in the vendor’s knowing smile and the blurred cliff figure, implying prior translators. The final image of rooftops as “canvas waiting to be filled” offers a resonant non-literal answer, though the insight “honor forgotten tales” is spelled out in the penultimate paragraph, slightly thinning the mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.1)
    “Cracks hide stories” is declared repeatedly but stays thematic wallpaper; it never becomes an actionable rule or moral dilemma. The mainspring barrel recurs yet its meaning remains decorative rather than repricing any concept on the page. The final smile feels sentimentally safe; ambiguity stays ornamental, not morally complex. No subtextual irony or charged image invites reflection beyond “abandoned places are poignant.”

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: reproducible frost vs. unreproducible eternity. The final hush reweights the phrase “eternity is a moment’s depth” without moralizing. Motifs (glass, rustling, whisper) recur naturally and converge in the charged poise. Ambiguity lingers—did reality actually destabilize?—inviting reflection, not confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of reclamation through rust-covenant emerges via imagery, not statement. Subtext sits in the golden chip’s dimming: transmutation consumes its own source. Final image reweights silence as something repairable, but the insight stays general; ambiguity is present yet not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of rationality dissolving into mystic unity emerges purely through imagery rather than dramatized tension; the idea is coherent but not deepened by character cost. Subtext is limited because the collector lacks contradictory desire—no fear of losing self is seeded. Final image reweights earlier motifs (compass, petrichor) but does so via assertion, not earned irony or loss. Avoids moralizing, yet the insight feels prefabricated rather than wrested from experience.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of “timewoven alliances” emerges via slide–sea–sculpture triad, but delivered in contiguous abstract nouns rather than image. Final paragraph’s “hidden patterns” sermonizes what the scene already showed. Subtext absent; no gesture or silence reconfigures meaning. Still, particulars stay coherent and resist tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly through chromatic shift rather than thesis: the price of knowledge is the surrender of prior vividness. Subtext resides in silence—postcards go unread aloud, flowers bloom unheard—and in gesture: fingers trace paper veins as if decoding vascular nocturne. Final image reweights initial postcard gardens into “beacons” of monochrome wisdom, avoiding moralizing. No character articulates a lesson; understanding is shown via palette change, satisfying Q5’s anti-statement bias.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of buried history versus living memory is emergent but thin; the diary and Ada’s debris art gesture toward it yet never collide in a way that reconfigures meaning. Final paragraph’s “mysteries that lay just beneath the surface” states the metaphor outright, blunting subtext. Resonance is atmospheric rather than earned through costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of rebirth through imaginative refusal of nostalgia is coherent but surfaced in summary: “they rejected false comfort.” The amber bottle’s etched, sealed surface offers a mute emblem of potential yet never revises meaning at the end; its symbolism stays ornamental. Final uplift is asserted rather than reweighted by a costly image, keeping resonance moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges non-didactically: archival desire as generative destruction—preservation breeds unforeseeable futures. Subtext resides in sensory callbacks (children’s laughter reincarnated as pulsing patterns) rather than exposition. Final image reweights the premise: silence replaces foghorn, wax replaces voice—archive becomes oracle. Avoids moralizing; the ambiguity of “prophecy yet to be written” lingers legitimately.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of intergenerational caretaking under entropy emerges through seed / egg / cap imagery without explicit sermon. The vortex re-prices time as “borrowed,” inviting reader reflection, yet the concept is stated (“discover the texture of borrowed time”) rather than dramatized through sacrifice—so resonance is moderate, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges organically: listening attunes one to hidden order. Subtext lives in wind/bell acoustics rather than overt statement. Final benediction image offers a quiet, non-literal answer. The absence of moralizing keeps theme emergent, but the lack of cost slightly blunts resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of flourishing stillness emerges through imagery rather than lecture, but it remains static. Subtext is thin because no conflicting value is dramatized; insight is paraphrased in closing lines. Lantern glass acquires symbolic glow yet changes no meaning. Emotional after-effect is gentle appreciation, not reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the spectacle of remembrance: the living become archive for the dead. No explicit thesis is stated; the final image of the glowing closed box reweights the premise—memory is portable prison and lamp. Subtext lives in gesture (trembling hand, mute reading) rather than declaration. Emotional aftereffect is melancholic awe rather than sentimental comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely: memory as currency when arithmetic expires. The urn shard’s whisper and the clock’s cracked face form a quiet diptych of mortal residue. No moral is declared; the final smile is implication enough. Subtext avoids sentimentality; resonance is cerebral rather than gut-level.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of impermanence emerges through feather, snapped kite, dissolving mist—never sermonized. The “woven dawns” motif recurs only as poetic output, not lived tension, keeping it below 8.5. Still, the closing image of lagoon-as-mirror offers a non-literal reprise that invites reflection without moral. Subtext operates in hush and glint rather than assertion—quietly resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges from the slow conflation of external reclamation and internal arrival; no thesis is stated. The amber’s suspended fossil and the tower’s rain-washed rebirth quietly reprice “homecoming” as stasis inside change. Subtext resides in silence and glow rather than pronouncement. The final image resists moralizing, inviting the reader to re-feel the earlier motifs, though the insight remains gentle rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of renewal after ruin emerges through recurring bloom/death imagery rather than statement, culminating in the garden-over-battlefield repricing. Subtext stays gentle: birdsong as approval, seed as prayer, but no counter-theme complicates the moral simplicity. The insight feels earned because the coachman’s labor is shown, yet the absence of struggle keeps resonance muted. Final image avoids moralizing and invites reflection, meeting the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of reclamation emerges through concrete pattern: preserved leaf ↔ hidden spring, both tiny life inside dead shell. Final orange sunset echoes leaf hue, reweighting prior image without moralizing. Subtext stays implicit; no character utters “hope” or “renewal.” The emotional aftereffect is gentle relief rather than complex ambiguity, keeping score just below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of navigation—cosmic and personal—emerges through the compass, sketching, and horizon light without explicit sermon. The final image reweights “true north” from literal direction to metaphorical forward motion, offering quiet resonance. ambiguity is modest but present: is the glow a ship, a star, a mirage? The memory of family stargazing supplies bittersweet counterpoint, avoiding tidy uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of sacred playfulness is named repeatedly but demonstrated only in the gentle, reverent tone; no paradox, irony, or gamble materializes. The sky’s restoration offers a pat cosmic payoff—“world reborn”—without re-weighting the premise. Subtext stays safely aligned to the mood; no unsettling implication lingers. Reverence is pleasant but thin; the concept never risks its own prettiness.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: small gestures (footsteps, missing pawns) rewrite history amid power vacuums. Final image reweights absence as generative space, avoiding moralizing. Subtext lives in silent exchanges and object resonance; complexity is honored without false equivalence. The luminous-absence trope flirts with abstraction but stays anchored to the closing tableau, delivering lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of forgiveness emerges from the concrete labor of decoding rather than overt statement; the tapestry’s shifting meaning (failure → map → redemption) supplies the thematic reconfiguration. Subtext resides in the tutor’s silence—he never names his student’s loss aloud, letting the frayed threads speak. Final image of village “weaving themselves back together” offers quiet Conceptual Repricing: time resumes because he has paid the emotional cost. Avoids sermonizing; the reconfiguration is felt, not named.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through recursive imagery—refraction, echo, veil—rather than overt thesis, satisfying the 9+ test. Final image of spire symbols reweights earlier abstractions with undeniable conceptual cost. Complexity is honored: forgiveness remains ambiguous, avoiding tidy moral. Minor dock for reiterated “price of forgiveness” phrasing that edges toward prompt-echo (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of salvage-beauty emerges organically from the kintsugi motif and acid-sea rot; no explicit moral is stated. The final image—girl gasping beneath still-churning toxic waves—reweights the premise: meaning is mined from wreckage, but the world stays lethal. Ambiguity lingers—will the map save anyone?—yet the piece avoids tidy triumph. Mentor memories quilted in repetition risk thematic echo, slightly dulling resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges as an accumulative perfume: quiet persistence outlasts noise. The vial cork’s unseen residue becomes a metaphor for intangible influence, reweighted in the final image. No moral is stated; the tender scream is felt as sensory overload. While the insight is lightly earned, the piece avoids platitude and leaves plausible ambiguity about whether anything truly travelled.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges as “navigation of loss is endless mending,” stitched from censer foot, moon rhythms, and call-and-response ritual—no thesis statements, good. Subtext in phone voices (disembodied, possibly self-projected) offers ambiguity, though device stays underexploited. The plain’s void re-configures earlier fragments, inviting reflection on salvage vs. surrender. Could ascend higher if one image cracked the consolation myth—e.g., censer foot cracks, spilling ash—complicating raw solace.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of empathy’s overreach vs. individual integrity emerges through relic history rather than authorial lecture; the glass eye’s final gaze reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Subtext stays mostly in image, though the line “pursuit of empathy had been taken too far” inches toward thesis-statement territory.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    Borrowed-memory concept seeds theme, but it stays speculative meta-commentary rather than dramatized dilemma. The Edelweiss reprise supplies quiet irony—memory object becomes keepsake—but Kael’s worldview is unchanged. Subtext is present yet thin; no moral repricing or stance shift lands.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges as inheritance vs. solitude—maps, ants, father note form a quiet chain of connection rather than stated thesis. Subtext operates in silence: absence of father given weight by object-return (note), not exposition. Final image reframes dusty shop relics as living lineage—Conceptual Repricing with understated social cost (she will keep serving maps, now self-linked). Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers over whether promise is “complete” or cyclical, earning resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of starlight-as-reality-fray emerges imagistically, never sermonized; the withheld truth invites ambiguity. Recurrent “lacy” motif (lacy glow, lacy menace) reweights from beauty to threat, supplying a modest conceptual repricing cue. Yet without an on-page revelation, thematic resonance stays atmospheric rather than irreversibly reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of revaluing through recursive attention emerges implicitly via the shell’s spiral and the returning light. Subtext is thin—friends’ whisper functions as authorial cue rather than layered silence. No moral is stated, yet the insight never transcends the initial premise. Ambivalence is absent; the takeaway is a single-note affirmation of curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges implicitly: art transmutes irretrievable loss into usable meaning. The final glow of the scroll reweights prior images without moralizing, but the insight is single-note; no counter-readings or moral friction complicate the consolation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges as the alchemy of absence: olfactory loss transmutes into sharper emotional sight, surfaced through haptic relics. No thesis is spoken; the clamp screw’s silent births carry the argument. Final image—“hidden patterns and connections waiting to be mapped”—re-prices the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is intact: the reader may still question whether this is consolation or self-myth.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges as the alchemy of stillness and turbulence: scars become stories when the poised breath ends. No explicit moralizing; the sunset image reprises the storm/tear motif without statement. Subtext lives in the quill’s spent tip—writing as consumable magic. The idea is coherent yet thin; the rune-whispers act as convenient confirmers rather than complicating the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically: the fragility of beauty amid progress is mirrored in both doomed orchard and fractured friendship. Subtext is strongest in the bottle’s etchings—love/loss code that silently reweights Lyra’s own betrayal. Final image of “grit… tempered by ethereal beauty” offers resonant non-literal answer. Imperfect-miracles concept is overstated in exposition, blunting subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme—interconnectedness vs. individuation—emerges through imagery of light bleeding across mushroom caps and silhouettes merging at dawn. Subtext is light-handed; no overt thesis. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, achieving quiet resonance. Still, the concept “physics of letting go” is named but not dramatized, keeping the idea slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: the futility of seeking certainty in chance. Subtext is carried by the lantern’s glint and the graffiti aphorism—both re-weighted at closure without moralizing. No echo of prompt phrasing in final paragraph, avoiding thematic-statement penalty. Bittersweet tone sustains ambiguity, earning reflective after-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of memory’s afterlife emerges implicitly via photo-to-archive cycle, avoiding overt moral. Final image of blooming-in-darkness reweights earlier floral motifs. However, repeated abstract phrasing (“weight of small moments,” “haunted euphoria”) edges toward thesis-statement, muting resonance. Still, particulars > platitudes; ambiguity lingers about couple’s fate.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of reciprocity emerges through event: shared food, shelter, stories—never sermonized. Final image re-weights moon rock from talisman to obsolete relic, a quiet Conceptual Repricing. Complexity is modest; ambiguity is present but not sharp. Sentimentality loiters at edges (“world a little bit kinder”) yet is mostly earned by communal particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—grief mapped as spatial music—emerges through recurrent motifs (notes, blaze, compass) rather than exposition. Final image crystallizes the equation: external harmony = internal reordering, without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: stillpoint offers insight, not cure. The tattoo language trick never returns to complicate theme, leaving one strand slack.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of narrative-as-reality emerges implicitly through pen mechanics and anomaly ink, avoiding overt thesis. Subtext in “weeds that repelled them” reframes failure as necessary deviation; final “guardian of this threshold” image offers Charged Poise without moralizing. Resists tidy comfort—strange comfort is tonal, not didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of memory-as-music emerges wordlessly through the sign→sound alchemy; no thematic echo sentences moralize. The camera’s empty chamber reconfigures the concept of capture without film, offering a resonant non-literal answer: presence can be performed, not preserved. Ambiguity lingers—joy and sorrow braided—avoiding tidy consolation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely: art as time-resistant memory. The tapestry smile and vandalized portrait refract love/loss without moralizing. Final scrawl re-prices the promise, inviting reflection on desecration as devotion. Ambiguity is purposeful, but the insight edges close to platitude (“enduring power of art”); a sharper ethical knot would lift score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    The emergent theme—collective memory is beautiful because transient—arrives via the lagoon’s fade, not exposition. Subtext lives in the hush/exhale cosmological metaphor, paid off when Aria smiles at the exhale. No final moral is stated; the sorrow stays auroral, not didactic. Complexity is present but thin: no counter-reading challenges the bittersweet acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme—quiet persistence over noise—remains an abstract assertion; the story tells us whispers win, then illustrates with a coincidental whisper that costs nothing. Subtext is limited to the zodiac coin and key as orphaned symbols. No image reweights the premise at the end; resonance is asserted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges as the value of light within darkness, shown through mirror-gleam and star-motif rather than stated. Subtext is carried in gesture and lattice-shadow, not sermon. The mirror’s reprise reweights earlier imagery, giving conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers, but the insight is slightly abstract due to the guardian’s opaque interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of reflective pause emerges through repeated abstract nouns—“second thoughts,” “quiet determination,” “unspoken words”—rather than enacted dilemma. Subtext is thin: synchronized windows literalize unity instead of revealing hidden fracture. Final paragraph moralizes the message (“the mist...reminder of amplified quiet”), re-stating instead of reweighting. No plausible counter-reading complicates the thesis; ambiguity is declared, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely: heritage as mutable myth, freedom as self-disappearance. The disappearing island reframed as “state of being” supplies a Conceptual Repricing that resists moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—gripping the scrimshaw while sliding into dark water—rather than exposition. The final smile is earned, yet the whale song’s siren metaphor flirts with poetic over-explicitness, docking a tick from perfect resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: art as palliative, not cure. Bouquet’s fade and wooden talismans supply concrete particulars; no final moralizing. Subtext sits in the gap between performed narration and blank face, inviting reader to feel the hush rather than label it. One near-tell: “cultivating lightness in grief” is prompt-echo phrasing; luckily it’s embedded mid-story, not in closing paragraph, so resonance stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges via image pattern (light, dissolution, pulse) rather than statement. Final re-pricing—“beauty and truth lay hidden, waiting to be uncovered”—is implicit in the glow that follows her exit, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: liberation and loss are simultaneous. One slight echo of thematic articulation in closing paragraph holds back a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of imperfection emerges through recurring glass and plant imagery rather than explicit moral, avoiding final-paragraph sermon. Subtext remains thin: no irony or silence complicates the mutual admiration. The reed’s whispered “melody” is an ornamental recurrence, not a constraint that reweights meaning. Conceptual repricing is hinted but not felt—imperfection was already safe in this post-phoenix utopia.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of interconnection emerges through sonic patterning rather than assertion, culminating in the soft-focus unity image. Subtext is light—no irony or charged silence—but the ambient accumulation avoids moralizing. Ambiguity is present yet thin; counter-readings are possible but not painful, keeping the resonance pleasant rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of transmuting grief into craft emerges through the blooming flower stencil and star-capturing brooch rather than explicit thesis. Subtext resides in the shift from “withered heart” to “delicate filigree,” a visual re-pricing. Final image resists moralising, offering quiet resonance. Ambiguity is present but controlled; insight is earned via concrete artefacts, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges implicitly: cartomancy as epistemic refuge after economic collapse. The refrain of inherited mystery and multiplying paths gives quiet resonance, yet the concept is stated more than dramatized. No counter-theme or moral friction complicates the premise, so the reflection stays safe. The final smile is tidy rather than reconfiguring, keeping theme competent but not revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.1)
    “Atoms of nostalgia” is an intriguing conceptual stake, yet its meaning stays metaphoric rather than operational—no rule is learned or re-priced. The theme emerges implicitly through imagery of twilight and purification, but the final paragraph overtly labels the experience—“a truth that would remain with her forever”—giving the reader a thesis where an image should suffice. Ambiguity is present, yet the insight feels prefabricated rather than wrested from struggle. The conceptual reweighting is hinted at but not dramatized with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from juxtaposing shared dreams vs. unbound shadow; no final paragraph sermon. The river stone’s luminous regret motif recurs and reweights at closure, tying private grief to collective stakes. Ambiguity is purposeful: shadow as both external force and internal fear. The absence of a dramatized sacrifice keeps the resonance just below the 8.5+ tier where theme must bite the protagonist’s flesh as well as the world’s.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through recurrent shedding imagery rather than thesis line: skin, mist, assumption, starlight all peel away to expose a quieter ethics. Final image reweights “gentle” from caretaker softness to a honed, self-respecting restraint—an answer without moralizing. Subtext in chameleon eye-roll hints that survival requires simultaneous perspectives, nudging the reader to apply the same double vision to conviction. One near-miss: “balance between self-respect and compassion” edges toward prompt-echo, but it’s buried mid-story and immediately enfleshed by gesture, so only a faint scar.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges obliquely—scars as text, earth as palimpsest—without moralizing. The coffee-ring cipher and hourglass function as concrete particulars that accrue symbolic charge. Final image reframes earlier motifs, offering a non-literal answer: knowledge is a quiet, inexorable excavation. No thematic echo line or sermonizing; ambiguity lingers cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges implicitly: love’s residue outlives forgettings, and art (film) stores it. The refrain of “forgotten lyrics searching for their tune” supplies a charged callback that reweights the opening premise. Yet the insight is asserted in the final paragraph rather than earned through a crucible choice. Subtext is thin because the gazer’s stance never crystallizes; the story tells us the love “continues to resonate” instead of dramatizing a consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of cosmic inspiration emerges through imagistic accretion rather than statement, avoiding overt moralizing. Recurrent stardust/astrolabe motif reappears at closure but doesn’t reweight meaning—its final glow merely restates the opening promise. Subtext stays one-note: universe speaks, artist listens; no counter-readings or ambiguity complicate the transaction. Insight feels pre-given, not wrested from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges obliquely: knowledge asleep in ash, revived by ritual attention. The frozen clock reborn as pulse embodies the idea without sermon. The “fractured lullaby” tonally reframes apocalypse as lullaby—an unsettling comfort that resists moral binaries. No character articulates the thesis, so the resonance is earned, though the abstraction keeps it from piercing deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of mind-as-machine-jungle emerges through imagistic accretion rather than statement—an asset. Yet the insight never complicates; the final “probable miracles” reprises the prompt phrase verbatim, flattening subtext. No moral tension or counter-reading is invited; wonder is monotonous. The gear’s final buzz reweights nothing conceptually—it merely confirms what was already believed.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of awakening dormant courage emerges through imagery rather than thesis. The shoreline lullaby and star stamp form a quiet pattern that reweights at dawn. No moral is stated; the resonance stays modest because courage itself is never dramatized in a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges obliquely: cost of safety voiced only once, then left to images of snow and sealed mouths. Subtext lives in gesture—tracing dust, tightening bolt—showing maintenance of systems that depend on voicelessness. Final “frostbitten hope” offers plausible ambiguity: peace may be real or self-bought delusion. Avoids sermon, but insight stays general; particulars (bolt, discoloration) never symbolic-ally recharge the closing line.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of truth-through-patient-inscription is legible but surface-level; subtext never complicates Kael’s certainty. Iron-gall ink as “testament” is a static symbol; its final discard doesn’t reprice meaning, only signals task done. No ironic gap or moral cost lingers. Emotionally tidy: pretender exposed, Kael satisfied, library “forever changed” is asserted, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically: human craving for fixed maps versus oceanic impermanence. Subtext resides in the torn page—an absence she must work with, not solve. Final image of rhythm fading into starlit silence reweights earlier data-crunching without moralizing. The insight is earned, but the lack of a tangible forfeiture keeps the resonance muted rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of intentional evolution emerges through the embryo’s golden pulse and Akira’s refusal to stay merely insurgent; no character states “this is evolution.” The plant telepathy motif returns in the closing chorus, reweighting the whispers from eerie background to triumphant approval. Final image avoids moralizing; it simply bathes her in light, leaving ambiguity about what new species she midwives. Subtext could sharpen if a single plant voice cracked doubt, but overall resonance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of healing through desolate nature emerges via recurring wind/tree imagery; no explicit thesis stated. Final image of smooth photograph reweights earlier trauma without moralizing. Ambiguity is present—stillness may be transient—but lacks lingering friction. Subtext stays surface-level; gestures and silence carry some weight yet stop short of irony.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of fragmentation→reintegration emerges through box/lighthouse imagery, not sermon. Final image reframes darkness as generative—an earned Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers without confusion. Rhetorical questions flirt with Echo penalty, yet remain interrogative rather than assertive, sparing the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of impermanence emerges through the ink motif rather than assertion; the final map-image reconfigures pursuit into acceptance without moralizing. Subtext operates in the drone’s quiet hum and the shared silence. No epiphany is voiced; the reweighting is imagistic, satisfying the 9+ quick test almost but for the slight abstractness of “possibilities unfolding.”

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of archive as silencer → archive as detonator; no narrator spells this out. “Dizzying quiet” is the governing image, shifting from serenity to moral vertigo. The final screen-glow on Aria’s face re-prices her occupation without a thesis sentence. Slight deduction for the abstract cost; we feel the world change, but not her body.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of nurturing continuity against collapse emerges through recurring living images—roses from scrap, engraved quiet—never moralizing pronouncements. Final sleep-cradled rose is a charged callback that reweights the sword’s violence as obsolete. Subtext is quiet but legible: cultivation as resistance. The piece avoids sermon, but because the stake never sharpens to a painful choice, resonance stays gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of listening to the silence between patterns emerges organically through repeated hum/echo images; no character sermonizes it. The feral lullaby reprises in the final line, reweighting the garden’s hum from lull to summons, a clean CR. Complexity is modest—no counter-readings or moral friction—but the idea stays particular to this milieu. Docked fractionally for almost-tidy lyric closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from pattern: sound vs. silence, haunted vs. hush, guilt vs. infant coo. No explicit thesis; final image of baby-cry-as-new-beginning reweights prior material. Subtext lives in the amber—fossilized past watching—and in the cord as self-imposed limit. Moral ambiguity intact: she heals herself but the clients merely “report peace,” leaving ethical cost of absorbing others’ dissonance unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—meaning emerges through attentive surrender—stays implicit, carried by mandala/mist parallelism. Lilac unease and “listen deeply” tile reprice the premise without moralizing. Wisdom is earned via tactile particulars, not platitudes. Ambiguity lingers: is the hush comfort or warning? Resonant but not piercingly fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of “aberrant mercy” as both wound and tool—no moralizing, only the final image of her whispered name hanging in cold air. Recurring mosaic motif reweights from souvenir to scar to seed. No platitudes; insight is earned through the retrocognitive price she pays.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Nostalgia-as-redemption emerges through recurring sensory echoes and the final quiet glow, avoiding explicit moral. Theme remains diffuse because the timeline fracture is never dramatized as a lived loss; resonance is aesthetic rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of art-as-technology for inner mapping emerges organically via the geode-light interface; no final moral is stated. The telepathy recall serves as conceptual repricing of risk, but the story resists simplifying the ethical question. Subtext lives in sensory implication rather than overt assertion. The “willowglass hope” label verges on thematic echo but is saved by its fragility being enacted in the delicate final image. Sufficient ambiguity lingers without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of recovery-through-mapping emerges organically from Aria’s sensory labor rather than thesis statements. Transitional-object idea recurs but remains conceptual; the fossil never challenges or re-prices her goal. Final bioluminescent tableau offers pleasing resonance yet no conceptual twist, capping depth mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—shared wisdom as communal, ongoing alchemy—emerges via accumulation of buttons, sands, canyon echo; no overt thesis statement. Subtext resides in unearthed silence and “raw possibility,” inviting reflection without moralizing. Final image of never-ending dance reweights prior material resonantly. Avoids platitudes, though abstraction edges close in final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of self-reconciliation emerges through mirrored self-image rather than thesis statement; subtext resides in silent hand-clasp and pillbox weight. The “fixing what’s broken” concept stays implicit in scar tissue and spring tilt, avoiding moral tag. Final image reweights pillbox from caution-token to twin-courage emblem—an earned conceptual reprice. A half-sentence of editorial uplift (“she was ready to face whatever lay ahead”) leans toward mildEcho but is too brief to dock heavily.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of layered meaning emerges through fog, palimpsest metaphor, and needle-as-thread, but idea never re-weights the coachman’s reality; it stays ornamental. Final image of “page hidden beneath the surface” gestures toward revelation yet offers no specific re-interpretation of prior events. Subtext remains atmospheric rather than actionable; no ironic gap opens between coachman and reader. Serenity is pretty but conceptually static—an mood, not a moral re-pricing.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges implicitly: kindness as a residual, phototropic force that outlives industry. The lantern glass’s return in the final line reprices the motif without overt moralizing, giving quiet resonance; the concept stays complex because the oasis remains ruined.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely: caretaking as covert resistance to urban erasure. Recurrent light/dark imagery reframes pruning not as loss but as reflection-transfer. Final guardian stance answers the implicit question—who tends the overlooked?—without moralizing. Subtext carries in gesture (pocketing tooth, hands moving like ritual) rather than assertion; resonance lingers in reader’s bodily memory of oar-cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of fragile continuity emerges through recurring “brittle awakenings” and mirrored light rather than exposition. Final glint reweights prior isolation into purposeful guardianship without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: independence is stance, not escape. Subtext operates in hush and glint, avoiding thesis sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through spiral/thrum/temple motifs: private secrecy refracted into shared art. No overt thesis statements; the final image reweights the twig from keepsake to conduit. Subtext whispers in the nest’s “hidden meaning” that she never names, letting reader complete the loop. Ambiguity lingers—connection is made, yet future letters she ghostwrites remain unaddressed, preserving fruitful tension.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—human ingenuity can re-balance cosmic disorder—emerges through the event chain rather than statement, but the final paragraph drifts toward platitude (“world was full of mystery and wonder”). Subtext is thin: the charts and static carry no ironic gap or shifting meaning beyond their functional use. The emotional aftereffect is mild uplift rather than a lingering reconfiguration, because no private cost stains the victory. Still, the concept avoids explicit moralizing and lets the image of Lyra still tuning stand as a quiet, if lightweight, answer.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme: discovery transmutes decay into renewal. Emerges via imagery (fallow → starlight) rather than moral tag. Ambiguity preserved—no sentence spells thesis. Church-organ motif recurs but does not reweight meaning; crystal does the thematic lifting. Final image of siren-call return invites reflection without forcing closure into moral.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of empathy-as-vision emerges through parallel art/investigation metaphors, avoiding overt moralizing. Mask ribbon reweights from curiosity to symbol of dual identity, echoing artist’s “face blind” method. Final paragraph’s “truth…about understanding ourselves” edges toward thesis-statement, blunting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges: maps as both liberation and cage; ancestry as reversible exile. Subtext carried through object handling and coded gaps between words. No explicit moral; final question invites counter-reading. Emotional aftereffect strong—reader left inside same fog—though insight slightly generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically: art can transmute private guilt into public voice. The flake-as-ghost, scaffold-as-map, music-as-light form a quiet constellation of “ashes of never” becoming possibility, never sermonized. The refusal to pin down what exactly is confessed keeps the ambiguity productive. Only the final paragraph’s echoing phrase “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” flirts with thematic echo, but it is the story’s own heartbeat by then, not an imported aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: value is transient, territory is story. Subtext lives in silent handling of the banknotes and the carved bird—no character articulates the thesis. Final dusky harmony image offers resonant reconfiguration without moral. Avoids overt “Echo Routes” sermon, but late paragraph nudges toward explicit empathy for investors, slightly diluting ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of shared burdens emerges through iterative star/temple images rather than explicit sermon, satisfying the anti-didactic rule. The telegram’s pressed daylily and the ancient inscription both literalize the motif, culminating in Lyra’s final felt connection to past and future sufferers. Subtext stays implicit; no late moralizing. Ambiguity is modest but present—readers may question whether solace is projection or discovery—keeping reflection alive after the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges organically: reflection vs. interiority is dramatized through the cracked mirror reveal rather than authorial thesis. Frozen confession and flesh-eating seed gesture toward metaphor but remain under-exploited, preventing deeper subtext. Final image avoids moralizing, instead offering charged poise that invites reader re-evaluation. Ambiguity is present yet thin because the druid’s “wonder” and “peace” resolve emotional arc too cleanly—little contradicted prior belief to make the insight costly.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable distance; perceptual signature relies on compound clauses and repeated “as they” constructions that flatten rhythmic distinctiveness. Diction stays within druidic register but drifts toward abstract latinate terms (“malevolent energy,” “conceptual repricing”) that feel slightly above character lexicon. No dialogue to test voice differentiation. Syntax is competent, yet sentence openings recycle participial and prepositional stacks, producing template cadence that dulls immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of hidden pattern vs. human curiosity emerges implicitly through the topiary and scar-network image. Subtext stays in gesture—her glowing fingertip scars—rather than overt thesis. Yet the ending’s assertion of “endless possibilities” drifts toward open-ended uplift without ironic counter-current, blunting resonance. Particulars are vivid; the conceptual reweighting is only asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of self-determination versus fatalism emerges through the burned Eight of Swords reframed from imprisonment to agency; no explicit thesis statement. Final image of orchard whispering approval reweights earlier bones-and-roots imagery into hopeful germination without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: did she swap destinies or merely re-story her own? Minor deduction for “patch holes in her soul” therapy-speak that momentarily abstracts the concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges: value of silence after noise, the idea that stillness can hold its own music. Subtext runs through sensory echoes—grille cloth, quarry acoustics—without authorial commentary. Final image reprices silence; no moral is stated. Slight sentimentality in “symphony of possibilities” phrase, but ambiguity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of interconnectedness emerges via arbor/seed/spirit web imagery; no overt moralizing. Final image of arbor “bathed in warm light” reprises the pattern with mild reweighting. Subtext stays shallow because Elara’s internal stakes are never complicated or contradicted—no irony, no counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of migrating identity emerges through moon-phase imagery and mechanical-organic blend, never sermonized. Final image of creel holding shimmering artifacts offers quiet Conceptual Repricing: wonder distilled into humble carrier. Complexity accepted—no moral binary—yet insight remains generalized; particulars (creel contents) stay unnamed, blunting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme of shared human connection emerges through repeated abstractions (“whispers of abandoned hopes,” “walls between hearts”) rather than specific dramatized particulars. Final paragraph moralizes the insight outright, replacing resonant image with thesis statement. Pearl-as-vessel is an evocative concept but never reweighted by action; meaning is asserted, not reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: map, bellows, ivy, graffiti—never abstract exposition. “Forgiveness is a map” returns as a re-weighted mantra whose meaning has been lived through music and motion, not preached. Final image of trees swallowing the accordion’s last note offers resonant, non-moralizing answer: keep walking, keep playing. Avoids tidy epiphany; ambiguity lingers in the unheard river whispers ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—unspoken words as mistletoe-ready epiphanies—emerges through imagistic accumulation rather than statement, avoiding overt moralizing. The motif of veiling (silk, mist, reversed watch-face) quietly reweights at the end when the dreamer sees the library as internal veil. Subtext is thin because no secondary character or social context complicates the solitude; silence is celebrated but never contested, so complexity is more atmospheric than moral. Final image invites reflection yet feels familiar to any “library of the mind” trope, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of perforated destiny emerges imagistically—transparent violin, coffee-stain futures—avoiding overt thesis. Final image of stepping into velvet night reconfigures earlier velvet observatory, giving cyclical resonance. Ambiguity lingers: destiny is neither confirmed nor denied, only felt as ache, satisfying complexity without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: transience vs. preservation, beauty as defiance of death. The aurora–emerald motif reframes oblivion into continuity without moralizing. Final image offers resonant CR—glow as fragment of divine—inviting contemplation beyond plot. Complexity acknowledged; ambiguity stays purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of cyclical rebirth emerges through recurring imagery (plants, soil, seasons) rather than explicit lecture, creating gentle resonance. However, the antique hairpin’s symbolic freight is front-loaded yet never reprised with new weight, so the motif stalls. The final paragraph’s “vineyard hush” reprise offers a tonal echo, not a conceptual repricing. Complexity is muted; contentment is affirmed without moral tension or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of embracing doubt emerges through recurring mirror and chime imagery rather than explicit moral. Final image of the conscience’s “protected vulnerability” offers quiet resonance, but because the beat is summarized, the reweighting is gentle, not piercing. Subtext is present yet thin; the conscience’s own doubt is hinted once, never pressed into conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of delayed revelation emerges organically through ripple imagery and the slow fade-in of comprehension. Subtext is limited because the researcher’s interiority is serene throughout; no tension between her motives and the lesson’s implications surfaces. Final smile reweights the pattern but avoids platitude. The concept stays coherent yet thin—no counter-reading or moral ambiguity is invited.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of stillness-as-movement emerges implicitly through the accretive imagery rather than overt thesis, satisfying organic emergence. The arrowhead’s reweighting from relic to “key” is a conceptual repricing, though delivered in summary. Final image of harmonic resonance offers a non-literal answer, avoiding moralizing. However, the insight feels pre-decided—no counter-readings or tensions complicate the serenity—so resonance is moderate, not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—sacred simplicity vs. automated art—emerges through imagery rather than sermon. The keystone’s “brilliant dimness” offers a Conceptual Repricing that reweights creativity as humble wonder. Subtext is thin: no irony or counter-argument complicates the thesis. Final image is resonant but single-note; ambiguity is limited to tone, not moral stance.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of perception’s limits emerges through recurrent light/sound imagery. No explicit moral, final image reframes prior motifs. Subtext stays shallow—no silence-as-betrayal or knowledge-as-burden. Ambiguity is present but not charged; insight is delivered more than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of individual attunement to cosmic collapse emerges through image rather than statement. The coin-to-essence pipeline offers a tactile metaphor for knowledge extraction. Final alignment avoids overt moralizing, yet the absence of felt cost keeps resonance intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges obliquely: the consolations of naming grief, the communion between collector and collected. The atlas page’s monsters externalize inner dread without overt allegory; the echo motif reframes sacrifice from abstract to intimate. Final image reweights earlier material—the emptied page as both archive and abyss—yet stops short of a conceptual repricing that surprises. Subtext is present but not dagger-sharp; the reader feels resonance rather than revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of “brittle devotion made whole” is stated rather than dramatized through cost. The bell’s repair becomes a metaphor for restored faith, but the mage’s inner fractures are never exposed, so the metaphor remains one-way. Subtext is therefore thin; the toll simply affirms success. Resonance is decorative rather than reconfiguring.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—storytelling as communal balm—emerges through recurring photo-trail and mirrored hush rather than exposition. Final image reweights the liqueur label from trash to beacon of memory. Ambiguity lingers, avoiding moral. No late thesis statement; slight deduction for “precisely humane” label used twice as prompt-echo.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: the starling code reweights “harmony” from intellectual goal to lived sensorial experience. Subtext operates in image—crystal mist = invisible lattice connecting orchard, birds, mind. Final image reframes prior motifs without moralizing, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Ambiguity lingers: is the harmony gift or obsession? Complexity is embraced; no tidy thesis stated.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of custodianship emerges through buckle talisman and peer trust, never sermonized. Final image of golden cloud-sea invites reflection on invisible labor. Ambiguity: will peers validate her unseen data? No moral spoon-fed. Wisdom earned via cold fingers and star-burn, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—identity exceeds genetic origin—emerges through the brain-jar motif’s final fade, a quiet Conceptual Repricing. No explicit moral is stated; resonance is left implicit. The clone-custody concept is named but never dramatized, so thematic complexity is asserted, not tested. Subtext is thin; the brain stares, but never forces a morally charged choice.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of creativity-as-mystery emerges organically from the seed’s irreducible strangeness; no explicit thesis states “innovation is good.” The final image of the seed beside exhausted pen reweights it from ominous gift to muse, achieving quiet resonance. Ambiguity remains—sender unknown, risk unmeasured—inviting reflection without moralizing. Subtext operates through tactile detail rather than symbolic slogans, satisfying the 9-band’s demand for non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of tending to the unspoken emerges through sonic metaphor; the tunnel’s whispered memories are a living burial ground. The piece avoids explicit moral, letting the bittersweet laughter stand as conceptual repricing. Yet the refrain “tending to the unspoken” is itself spoken, a mild thematic echo that slightly erodes subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through imagistic progression—grinning statues become serene, pendant shifts from trophy to key—without moralizing. Subtext resides in the inversion of light/dark boundaries. Final glow reweights prior motifs, offering resonant ambiguity. The absence of a dramatized cost keeps it from higher resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of creative destruction emerges via image rather than lecture: crozier’s sacred authority shattered into catalyst. Subtextual tension between sanctity and ruin is felt, yet the concept never complicates the alchemist’s personal morality; the story sidesteps whether rebirth justifies sacrilege. Final image offers a resonant reconfiguration—the twisted new crozier—without sermon. Ambiguity is present but not sharpened by secondary stakes, keeping the resonance solid but not haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of beauty-in-decay emerges through recurring imagery rather than authorial lecture. Final “beginning in every ending” line flirts with thematic echo but is saved by its placement as internal paraphrase, not moral. Subtext is thin; nothing contradicts or complicates the decay-as-wonder premise. The star fragment’s reprise gives a modest re-weighting, supplying enough resonance for mid-6 band.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.1)
    Transient vs. permanent tension emerges through starlight, hourglass sands, and “sideways clocks,” but the theme is stated in narrative abstract (“merge parallel timelines”) rather than dramatized via events. Final image of stepping into “permanent transient-ness” gestures at Charged Poise, yet without prior cost, the reconfiguration feels asserted, not earned, keeping resonance mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges implicitly: rational mind seeking pattern inside illusion, finding unity without dissolving it. Final image of thread-as-lifeline reprises opening motif, reweighting “rational enchantment” as lived tether rather than paradox. No moral is stated; resonance is imagistic. The concept stays specific to this voice; avoids pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through recurring star/horizon imagery rather than exposition: the past (anchor) weighed against the infinite future. Subtext is modest—no silence or gesture carries hidden charge—but the closing canvas/sky pairing reweights earlier motifs, achieving quiet resonance without moralizing. Complexity is limited by the absence of counter-voices or ethical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges obliquely: memory as public-service labor—ghosts are bureaucratic data to be filed into peace. Subtext resides in the hearing-aid hum, a literal static that stands for unfinished grief-work. Final image of the continuing hum avoids moralizing, offering quiet CR: the dead keep calling, the tracer keeps clocking in. No late thesis statements; the sister’s smile is the only explicit comfort, keeping sentimentality at bay.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of remembrance vs. erasure emerges through coral-shrouded lab and “unremembered” researchers, but remains implicit. Subtext resides in crashing hush—sound as memory. No late articulation of thesis, avoiding echo penalty. Ambiguity is present yet thin; counter-reading not sharply seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges as transience-as-consolation: ink, snow, shard, and ghost all dissolve yet leave quiet imprint. No overt thesis; final image of falling shard reweights earlier porcelain motif. Ambiguity is purposeful—ghost remains unnamed code or memory. Resonance is delicate rather than profound, fitting the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: translation as alchemy that turns geological and avian texture into auratic sound, redeeming loss through sensuous transmutation. The flawed diamond’s shift from curse to blessing enacts the thematic reweighting without exposition. Subtext resides in the mutating shadows and echoes—meaning made by pattern rather than declaration. The ending’s hush invites reflection on preservation as continuous remaking, not nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically: the cosmic joke reframes cryptid horror as wonder, voiced only once yet prefigured by playful diction (“gravitationally playful”). Subtext lives in the static confessions—voices laugh through terror, implying humor is coping. The final hope is frostbitten, not triumphant, avoiding moralizing. However, theme lacks a concrete counter-reading; ambiguity is atmospheric rather than ethically complex.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges: art vs. mechanical coldness, beauty as fragile as a locust shell. Subtext is mostly stated—“she sought to reawaken beauty”—rather than discovered through jeopardy. Final image of dancing statues offers modest reconfiguration. Resists moralizing, but insight stays generic.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Redemption-through-delivery theme emerges implicitly via the bottle-storm metaphor; it avoids explicit moral. Final image re-casts arcade neon as “brighter,” a quiet reconfiguration. Ambiguity is present yet shallow because the mailman’s interior is mostly emblematic. Still, no thesis statement or echo cliché drags it down.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of beauty-through-silence emerges through recurring images (misting hush, wind bells, halo glow) rather than assertion. Final image of finished horse reweights earlier silence motif, but epiphany is gently stated (“they had discovered a hidden truth”). Resists moralizing, yet insight feels prefabricated rather than wrested from conflict. Ambiguity is present but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges as the irreducible gap between longing and possession; the cipher stays uncracked yet increasingly charged, achieving a Conceptual Repricing in the final “ever beckoning.” No moral is stated—only the refracted light reweights prior motifs. The ambiguity is purposeful and haunting, landing exactly on resonance without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges obliquely: memory must be reclaimed from fear, light released from binding. The ribbon’s fall reprises the starlight motif, reweighting secrecy into possibility. No moral is stated; the after-effect is gentle but not complex enough to invite counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges as memory-as-ruin: what the sea reclaims the mind can also restore. The orchard’s decay and the broken constellations refract the same fragmentation without sermons. Final “crisp nostalgia” offers a non-literal answer—accepting uncertainty as the price of wonder—avoiding tidy moralizing. Subtext operates through silence (no memory flashback) and implication (mushroom as key, not cure).

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of quiet restoration emerges through the accumulating images of dust, silence, and the mirror-shard rather than explicit sermon. Final image of the forgotten library feeling “a little less forgotten” offers a resonant conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext would sharpen if the archivist’s own fear of irreversibility were quietly hinted, giving the rescue thematic mirror; currently the personal stake is one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of renewal-through-creativity is coherent but overt: every sentence reiterates wonder, magic, color. Subtext is absent; meaning is literalized in the blooming orchard. The closing “trail of wonder” is an explicit moral echo, dampening resonance. Particulars never complicate the thesis, so the reader is left with one fragrant, uncomplicated affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges through motif of silence-as-substance; final image reweights hush from oppressive to redemptive without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—needle, light, breath—but stays singular-note. No epiphany is declared; resonance is atmospheric rather than conceptual. Complexity is muted because her interior generates no counter-argument to the mission.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme—listening to silence, cartography of the unknown—emerges through recurrent images of whispers and torn maps. Subtext is mild: silence as empathy rather than absence. Final image of “map now whole” offers quiet CR, but insight is soft (“world full of secrets”) rather than re-weighted rule. No platitudes, yet no fresh moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from object trajectory: snow-globe shifts from nostalgic stasis to evacuated vessel, enacting the physics of reframing rather than releasing. Subtext stays implicit—no character utters “death is a library.” The final image reconfigures the opening question without moralizing, achieving quiet CR. One echo-loop of “physics of letting go” flirted with thematic echo, but the phrase is embedded in Eli’s scholarly idiom and spaced enough to escape sermon penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: creative attention as bridge between mortal and digital afterlives. No explicit thesis; final image of scented breeze re-prices the courtyard as shared palimpsest. Subtext resides in silence—the ghost never speaks—yet reciprocity is unmistakable, inviting reader to re-weight earlier symbols. Complexity lingers: wonder is both gift and trespass, avoiding tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges quietly: love distilled in ice, beauty inseparable from loss. Subtext lives in the shrine’s “soft, ethereal light” and the goggles’ glow—objects re-weighted, not explained. No moralizing; the final fold of the page lets ambiguity linger. The concept avoids thematic echo; “joy beneath anguish” is dramatized through discovered relics, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—memory inscribed in sky—emerges through recurrent cloud-emotion cataloguing and telescope heirloom rather than thesis statement. Final “dusty starlight” reprises earlier motif, reweighting spooled wholeness without moralizing. Subtext is quiet but coherent; ambiguity lingers about whether proof is possible. Insight stays slightly abstract because stake is never materially tested.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: finite craft chasing infinite sky, paid for by demolition. The coin’s worn surface and the fractal brushwork are particulars that return reweighted in the final glow. No moral is extracted; the resonance is imagistic. Only a hairline slip – “limits of human understanding” is near-abstract – but it is embedded in tactile discovery, so the thematic echo penalty is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.5)
    Theme of solitary knowledge-seeking is coherent but thin; the phrasebook and hopscotch code gesture at buried voices yet never complicate Eli’s stance. Final image reprises luminance and starlings as wonder-symbols, but without cost the resonance stays ornamental rather than repricing the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges as the fusion of fragility and beauty in cosmic mechanics; it is never moralized. The mirrored hall reframes earlier “driftwood nostalgia” into a universal repair rhythm, achieving a quiet conceptual repricing. No echoing object or image accrues contradictory meaning, so resonance is modest but coherent. Subtext stays implicit; the final peace is earned by pilgrimage, not sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of communal uplift is stated outright (“they knew that they had created something truly special”), not emerged through contradiction or cost. The butterfly garden and chalk diagrams are offered as symbols, but their meaning never shifts; they merely decorate the same chord of wonder. Final paragraph’s moral summary caps the piece in uplift sermon rather than resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of “fragility as sacred” emerges through recurrence of cracked glass & porcelain, never abstract assertion. Final image—shimmering pane—reweights earlier “pane of hush” from metaphor to living interface, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture: kiss to broken puppet = covenant with flawed cosmos. Avoids sentimentality by keeping awe bruised, not celebratory.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of guided safety emerges through action, not sermon. The nut’s soft glow reprised at end offers quiet resonance, yet the caretaker’s interior never wrestles with the curse she supposedly tends—missed chance for moral ambiguity. Subtext stays thin; no silence or gesture complicates her altruism.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: the archive is not repository but organism, narrative as ambient light. Bottle, parole, and “mindfully scattered” state braid into the idea that stories are atmospheres, not artifacts—realized in the final image of library-as-home. No moral is stated; the reweighting is felt when she “would never see the world in the same way.” Subtle, but the insight is more enchanting than surprising; lacks a jagged edge of genuine irony.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through the palate-gift metaphor: healing others by ingesting their pain. Subtext is strongest in the tidal-pool mirror—“even in the desert, the ocean’s presence was still felt”—linking memory to tidal return. No late moralizing; the final line’s “resolute” fortress reprises resilience without sermon. The concept is coherent but not deeply surprising; the image set is tight, yet the thematic reweighting is gentle rather than revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of reconciliation between heritage and progress emerges through recurrent industrial/celestial imagery, but the final paragraph nudges toward explicit thesis (“she knew that she was part of a larger symphony”). The image set is coherent—clockwork, grain, starlight—yet the reprise avoids a conceptual repricing that would make the hope feel costly.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of “abandoned dreams reclaimed” is emergent, never sloganized, carried by the mirror’s recovered shine. The motif avoids overt allegory; meaning accrues through the repeating image of cracked glass becoming whole. Final image reweights earlier motif (mirror gleam) but without conceptual cost—the dreams remain other people’s, not Elara’s, so the reconfiguration is mild. Subtext stays implicit; no character articulates a thesis, dodging the thematic-echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely: vigilance as a living seed that must be cultivated, not hoarded. The final image of the archivist smiling over the doodle reweights the symbol without moralizing. Yet the insight remains cerebral; the emotional aftereffect is muted because the personal price is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: empathy is not proclaimed but enacted through vibration. The porcelain’s foreign fragility versus rough timber dramatizes the necessary fragility of connection. Final image—grove “swaying to the rhythm” the sculptor can no longer hear—offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: silence persists, yet is “no longer oppressive,” inviting reflection rather than closure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—beauty through difficulty—emerges via twilight imagery and the mantra-like repetition of “beauty in the difficult.” Final beacon reprises this idea, achieving quiet resonance without moralizing. The concept stays abstract, lacking a specific, lived particular that reweights the premise. Subtext is thin because no contradictory impulse is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as the invisible weave of empathy. Subtext lives in gesture—the clasp glows rather than speaks—avoiding explicit thesis. Final image of lunar-glow workshop reconfigures silence as communal breath, not private hoard. Ambiguity lingers: will Elara share what she learns, or hoard it? The refusal to moralize keeps resonance alive.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically: scent as conduit to immanent wisdom. Final “wildflower hush” image offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtextual silence—no articulated counter-argument—keeps ambiguity alive. Avoids explicit thesis until last clause, keeping tension suspended.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges obliquely: survival through symbiosis with planetary mystery rather than domination. The arrow tip—human weapon worn harmless—mirrors the orchard’s transformation of violence into fertile energy, a nice subtextual echo. No explicit moral statement; final image of the ship “dancing on solar winds” lets resonance breathe. Slight abstraction in “whirling silence” phrase keeps it from full punch, but complexity is respected.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme—foresight through meticulous observation—emerges implicitly via iterative surveying, avoiding overt statement. Patch as symbol of human cost is hinted but never reweighted at exit; silence motif stays decorative. Final image of receding labyrinth promises persistence of memory yet offers no fresh irony or reconfiguration. Complexity acknowledged (interplay of factors) but moral cost remains off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—wonder as existential necessity—emerges through the synesthetic fusion of color, silence, and song rather than overt statement. The final image of Elian vanishing into a landscape now “seen through the lens of wonder” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext resides in the paradox that silence must be sculpted by sound. Ambiguity is purposeful, inviting reflection on art’s transubstantiation of matter into spirit.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of learning through failure is announced repeatedly but emerges most cleanly in the final charged poise where silence replaces music; the refusal to keep playing is the unspoken admission that insight is endless, not achieved. Subtext is mostly atmospheric; no concrete prior failure is repriced, so insight feels conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges quietly: language as empathic technology. Subtext in the disorienting print invites reader vertigo, mirroring theme. No final moral—stars vanish, Echo smiles, meaning re-priced. Ambiguity is purposeful, but earlier “mathematics” metaphor flirts with pseudo-profundity and is restated, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges obliquely: wonder as communal germination, not artifact possession. The pendant’s shift from personal soothe to social bridge reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture—the locals’ creasing smiles—rather than statement. The final image lingers, inviting reflection on routine magic, though the insight is gentle rather than electrically fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of porous emotion in matter emerges through frost glyphs and prism refraction rather than direct statement. The “truthful lies” paradox is returned at the end, reweighting the prism’s refraction as both revelation and deception—an earned conceptual flip. No moral is preached; ambiguity lingers. Could use one concrete beat where the theory almost fails to tighten the philosophical tension.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of reconnection-through-assembly emerges through loom/puzzle doubling; no explicit thesis stated. Subtext resides in amber pulse and thread-bridge, final reweighting of silence as material. Ambiguity is preserved—sacrifice hinted, not resolved—inviting reflection beyond page. Avoids sermon; ends on image, not moral.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of transformative barter emerges through the silk-for-steel swap and the unspoken trade of solitude for legacy; no explicit thesis is stated. The floating arches serve as silent judges of “azure defiance,” reconfiguring the rubble-to-blade idea into planetary scale. Final image—hammering restarting with the apprentice—offers a circular, non-moral answer: creation is the only immortality. Ambiguity lingers: will the apprentice surpass or destroy the craft, keeping the theme alive after the page.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of cartographic hubris vs. un-mappable multiverse emerges imagistically, never sermonized. The green shard’s reprise at return subtly reweights “home” as just one more contingent map. Ambiguity is purposeful; however, without a tangible sacrifice the resonance feels mid-register rather than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of transmuting grief into artifactual light emerges through the sea-glass and cairn images rather than statement. Subtext is strongest in the unspoken comparison between smoothed glass and the skipper’s own weathering. Final paragraph flirts with overt thesis (“bottle the feeling of safety”) but stops short of moralizing. Ambiguity lingers, yet the anonymous-letter motif is undeveloped, leaving one thematic thread dangling.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges as the persistence of analog ritual inside digital ephemera; the contrast is shown, not lectured—“in a world after the last print newspaper, she clung to the Otherworldly routine.” Subtext operates through light imagery: refracted secrecy inside glass argues that meaning still hides from surface data. Final image of the lighthouse “sentinel of the shadows” offers a non-literal answer—ritual labor keeps darkness usable, not abolished. No moralizing sentence stains the close; resonance is earned through the lantern’s最后一次幽绿的微光.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges obliquely: refraction as metaphor for narrative allure is shown through the wing’s light-play, never stated. The final image of drifting darkness re-prices the earlier “iridescent caution,” letting wonder and warning coexist. No sermonizing, no allegorical stand-ins. The concept stays light-touch; ambiguity is purposeful but not electrically complex, keeping it just above mid-7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme of “mundane miracles” is stated repeatedly in final paragraphs rather than emerging from concrete stakes. The trees-as-witnesses motif is introduced too late to reweight prior material. Subtext is replaced by lyrical assertion (“sorrow was not just a feeling, but a quantifiable force”). The ending moralizes—“even the most broken things could be made whole”—without having dramatized any irreparable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of communal memory versus entropy emerges through repeated “woven dawns” and song imagery, yet subtext stays surface-level. No ironic gap or re-pricing at close; final paragraph spells out hope explicitly. Resonance is pleasant but not reconfiguring.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: paradoxes as lived contradiction, truth in questioning not answering. No final moralizing; the note slip reweights prior motifs without sermon. Insight is earned through concrete handling of invitation and book, not abstract assertion. Ambiguity is purposeful—reader left to decide if retreat is wisdom or extended avoidance—preventing tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges through image-pattern (bread/tea/garden) rather than statement; final smile offers resonant reconfiguration of “tenuous absolution” without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—did the bread forgive her?—but subtext stays slight because no concrete prior transgression is seeded. Emotional aftereffect is gentle wonder, not complexity or irony.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—memory as fragile glass—emerges through recurring images of slides, mist, and fading light, never sermonized. The final reprise of the “quartz hush” quietly reweights earlier motifs rather than declaring meaning. Yet the lack of embodied cost keeps the resonance gentle rather than piercing; the insight feels contemplated, not wrung from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of trust-as-currency emerges through the hush-truce image; the final poise lets ambiguity linger without moralizing, though the “sound of trust breaking” motive stays abstract rather than repriced on the body.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme – science versus mystical experience – is announced in the first paragraph and merely reiterated at the end, not deepened by any new contradiction or irony.  Subtext is thin: the stranger’s weather-carrying aura is exactly what Aria hoped to find, so the encounter confirms rather than complicates her longing.  Grandfather motif never acquires fresh symbolic weight; it circles back to itself.  Closure image offers poetic mood but no conceptual repricing of the science/mystic binary – the reader leaves with the same binary intact.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges obliquely: creation as reciprocal alchemy—artist transmutes sorrow, cave transmutes lock. No moral is stated; the crystallized lock offers a Conceptual Repricing that art’s labor re-enchants the world. The sorrow stays “auroral,” luminous and vast, resisting tidy uplift. Ambiguity lingers: will return visits sustain or drain her? Subtext lives in gesture and object rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: candor in small moments versus civilizational erasure. The gilded scripts literalize the idea without sloganeering; the final image reframes Aria’s future art rather than pontificating. Subtext operates in silence—no dialogue, only whispered walls—inviting reader extrapolation. Ambiguity is purposeful, but the lack of a visible cost on Aria keeps the resonance slightly cerebral rather than gut-level.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges inductively through the accumulating imagery of resonance, color, and muteness; no explicit thesis is stated. The closing image of the sculpture as eternal beacon reconfigures prior material, offering a non-literal answer to the question of how truth survives language’s end.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.7)
    Fragmented wholeness emerges organically from fire-carved roses and Aria’s partial repair; no character sermonizes the theme. The box of fears reappears lighter, a quiet repricing rather than a moral. Ambiguity lingers: is the static silenced or just domesticated? One abstract line—“a testament to fragmented wholeness”—flirts with thesis-speak but is saved by the tentative smile that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly—listening as communal balm—but the final sentence trumpets it overtly, trimming resonance. The locket’s reprise in the display case offers a modest image-based echo, yet the absence of any character stakes keeps the aftereffect polite rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of transmuting vulnerability into strength emerges through recurring web/dice imagery; it avoids moralizing, yet the lack of external resistance keeps the thematic tension intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges obliquely: memory as physical sediment that can be re-mined, gravity as emotional weight. The wildflowers and crystal echo without overt symbolic declaration, achieving resonance through imagistic return rather than thesis statement. Subtelty avoids moralizing, but the whale remains an under-exploited thematic provocateur, slightly muting the conceptual repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges implicitly: silence as active craft, not absence—an idea resonant and non-didactic. The subtext of “mapping silence” suggests that attentiveness can re-balance the world, but the absence of any failed attempt or counter-argument keeps the insight gentle rather than complex. The paper crane’s transformation from fragile craft to glowing vessel supplies a satisfying poetic reprise that rewards reflection. Still, the moral equilibrium feels preset, so the thematic voltage stays moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of “agreed-upon lies” emerges through the seal’s transfer rather than exposition, inviting reflection on history as shared fiction. Subtext stays in gesture (handing over the seal under falling stars) without final-paragraph sermon. Ambiguity is modest but present; resonance would sharpen if the student faced a concrete consequence for believing the lie.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of memory-as-identity emerges through shell→memory parallelism rather than statement. Subtext is thin: no ironic gap between Lyra and reader. Final image of silent shell and morning light offers quiet repricing, but emotional aftereffect is muted because pain was summarized, not shown. Ambiguity is present yet low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the forgery act itself—textual inheritance vs ethical revision—without moralizing. The heritage rose thorn and key accrue symbolic weight that reconfigures at closure. Subtext operates in silence: no triumphalist claim, only aurora glow and dripping stone. The invitation to reflect on complicity and repair is organic, though the lack of dramatized cost keeps resonance just shy of high band.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    Emergent theme: voice as both prison and liberation, echoed through the shell and the canyon. Subtext resides in sonic imagery rather than declaration; no moral is stated, only the felt difference between those who echo and those who vanish. The final silence reconfigures the prior song into a shared memory, achieving resonance without tidy meaning. Complexity is honored: the nexus keeps its secrets.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of interconnectedness emerges through recurring “windows” and starlight imagery; no explicit thesis is shouted. The melted globe’s final emptying reweights earlier shimmer into absence, supplying a Conceptual Repricing. Complexity is mild—no counter-readings challenge the motif—keeping the resonance competent but not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of unseen labor emerges organically through recurrent images—nets, whisk, firefly synchrony—without explicit thesis. Final image reweights prior motifs: the moon path becomes a visible receipt for hidden effort. Ambiguity is preserved; no moral is stated. Slight drift toward pseudo-profundity in “fabric of reality” phrasing, but saved by concrete sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—truth vs. comfortable lies—emerges through Aria’s quest rather than authorial statement. The orchard-as-wasteland subtly mirrors the post-truth landscape. No tidy moral is imposed; the ending image leaves ambiguity. Yet the theme never deepens or contradicts itself; it merely iterates, preventing higher resonance.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; no head-hopping. Diction stays within Aria’s skeptical register. Rhythm is serviceable but cadence repeats (“As she…”) without purposeful variation. Perceptual signature is present but generic—inventory of sights rather than idiosyncratic filter—so voice is competent, not singular.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme of “variant allegiance” is stated repeatedly (“variant allegiance now a badge of honor”) but emerges through lecture, not dramatized choice. Subtext is nil; meaning is spelled out in final-paragraph sermon. The ancient-shadow / new-dawn binary never complicates—no counter-pull, no moral friction. The reader is told the world changed; the page shows no concrete reconfiguration of values.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of transitive memory emerges organically from sound-capturing conceit; final image of poet smiling at dunes reweights isolation as stewardship, avoiding moralizing. Subtext resides in tactile objects rather than commentary. Ambiguity lingers—redemption is “gleaned,” not guaranteed—yet insight still leans on abstract “translator between generations” phrase near end, a minor thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The emergent theme—fragile equilibrium between human intention and living systems—arises from the sonic-absolution conceit and ice-light imagery; no moralizing, final image of velvety darkness reweights prior specifics with quiet conceptual cost, achieving resonance without platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme emerges only through repeated labels—“unyoke,” “patient revolution,” “sculpt patience”—rather than particularized action. The final paragraph moralizes the thesis instead of letting an image reweight it. Subtext is absent; the viaduct’s humming never accrues ironic or ambiguous resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of historical/freedom loops emerges through lantern, inscription, rain, but never complicates—no counter-pull shows what freedom loses. Subtext stays suggestive; no character voices to carry irony. Final image reframes tunnel from grave to birth-canal, giving mild CR. Avoids explicit moral, yet “break free” thesis is restated in closing paragraph, trimming top-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of mechanical redemption emerges organically through the returning tick-tock image rather than sermon. The final “vibrant hush” reconfigures the opening mood, offering resonant ambiguity. Still, the chaplain’s insight is restated in thesis language (“turn apologies into action”), slightly blunting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.5)
    The emergent theme—finding transcendent pattern within entropy—arises organically from the kaleidoscope-to-decay imagery. However, the insight is restated in near-identical diction three times (“beauty in the decay,” “irreverent awe,” “yearning algorithm’s boundless potential”), thinning subtext; the bell’s resonance would land harder if the prose stopped explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges obliquely: digital absence is not erasure but burial, and memory-keeping is an endless exhumation. The closing reversal reweights the motif of “sensed absence” into a call to perpetual stewardship, avoiding moralizing. One abstract line (“she was searching for a way to fill the void left by her own lost loved ones”) edges toward Echo territory but is saved by its placement mid-text, not at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—empathy as spatial mapping—emerges through orchard walks, fragment facets, mirror cartography; never stated. Final image (blue glow inside cloak) reweights premise: empathy is portable burden, not distant observation. Resonant ambiguity: will the ice obey her pulse tomorrow? No moralizing; theme breathes in sighing floes. 8.3 not 9.0 because thematic counter-reading is narrow; no competing moral pulls complicate her duty.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of fragile renewal emerges through ice imagery and shared labor rather than thesis statements. Subtext rests in silence between volunteers and wind-borne mourning: survival is collective, momentary. Final paragraph risks overt assertion (“cherish every moment”) but retreats into image of creaking ice, letting concrete aftereffect dominate. Ambiguity lingers—peace is “fragile”—avoiding tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of destined mismatches emerges through imagistic parallels rather than statement, avoiding overt moralizing. The love-letter fragment and uneven grapes reweight each other, creating quiet resonance. Final paragraph’s “truth” is still articulated rather than dramatized, blunting the after-effect. Complexity is honored, but the absence of a costly choice keeps the insight cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of custodianship versus inner turmoil is hinted but never complicated; the walker’s “turmoil” is mentioned once and never manifests in choice. The consecration ritual promises a moral calculus that never arrives, leaving the wisdom echo as an abstract treasure rather than a lived burden. Subtext stays safe, never challenging the walker’s self-image.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of healing-through-art emerges through recurrent lavender/rust juxtaposition rather than explicit statement. The closing image of the glowing empty case offers a quiet conceptual reprice: the tool is spent, implying labor completed. Whimsy is present but earnestness dominates, softening edge. No late moralizing; theme stays implicit. However, because no pain is named or dramatized, the transmutation remains abstract, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of knowledge versus communication emerges through image pattern—silent hush vs. amplifying crystal—never abstractly stated. Final glow on the crystal reprises dawn light, reconfiguring meaning without moralizing. Subtext operates in the hooded visitor’s unspoken threat and the scholar’s wordless compliance. Complexity is embraced: testimony may scatter as well as share truth.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through fog-as-time and chalk-as-memory motifs, culminating in acceptance that the sound is lived, not seized. Subtext favors silence and erasure over statement; no character moralizes the insight. Ambiguity is purposeful: the sound remains undefined, inviting reader projection. Yet the message feels singular, lacking counter-readings that would deepen complexity to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme—time’s continuity amid chaos—emerges via the spinning/still hand, but the insight is delivered in summary rather than dramatized cost. Leaf-as-beauty motif reappears but does not reweight meaning at closure. No subtextual tension complicates Eli’s stance; the epiphany feels pre-approved rather than struggled for.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—music as transfiguration of mortality—emerges through concrete lullaby action rather than assertion. The scent of hope motif recurs but stays ornamental; it never reweights stakes, so resonance is soft. Subtext is thin: no ironic gap or social commentary, just tender empathy. The ending image of the shining vinyl shard quietly revalues memory without moralizing, earning its mid-high band.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of hidden cosmic order emerges implicitly from repeated key / rune / shadow imagery, but the final paragraph drifts toward explicit thesis (“key as metaphor…”). Subtext is thin; meaning is more asserted than reconfigured through action.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of transmuting flaws into beauty emerges through the “constellations” motif, reiterated in closing paragraph; not stated in-scene, so avoids preachiness.  Yet insight is asserted rather than discovered through dramatized struggle.  Ambiguity is present—reader may doubt the tooth’s power—but ambiguity is accidental, not crafted irony.  Emotional after-effect is soft nostalgia without complicating counter-notes.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through iterated glass–light–stillness imagery rather than statement; the final “zephyr bloom” reweights stillness as active radiance, achieving quiet Conceptual Repricing. No character articulates a thesis, avoiding thematic-echo penalty. Ambiguity is preserved: is shared stillness solace or solipsism? Particulars (salt mist, gem dust, zephyr) resist generic abstraction. Lack of external stakes keeps resonance mid-high rather than exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of “grafting pain into hope” emerges through the pendant’s re-figuring, but the story articulates it outright in the final paragraph (“the past’s pain was being slowly grafted…”). Subtext is lovely in the silent flower moment; elsewhere the meaning is named, not dramatized. Still, the image of server racks clothed in moss carries subtle post-civilizational resonance that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges as the quiet equation of shell-spiral = creative vortex; the final image of words “dancing across the page” lets the metaphor reweight earlier material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shell’s shifting valence: mystery → mirror → talisman. The woman in white stays ambiguous, inviting reader projection; this purposeful openness lingers. No tidy thesis is asserted; however, the insight is gentle rather than electrically new.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of reconnection emerges through communal song image rather than statement; the vine-crystal pairing quietly reframes technology-as-nature, offering plausible counter-readings without moralizing—though final paragraph flirts with echo (“restore the sacred practices”).

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—art wrests living meaning from desolation—emerges through the orchard-to-map transformation rather than statement. Starlight/heartbeat motif accrues two weights: cosmic distance vs. intimate pulse, reconfigured when the map begins to breathe. Final image of “moving stillness” offers non-literal answer without moral. No Echo penalty; no abstraction replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the tension between cataloguing and reverence; no moral is declared. The ticking finale reweights earlier beats: every measured angle is now a heartbeat loaned back to the cavern. “Cellar of reason” motif returns as both victory and defeat—knowledge housed, yet wonder escapes inventory. Resonance is oblique: reader left weighing similar unpaid debts in their own memory vaults.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of measured burdens emerges through loom imagery rather than statement; no overt moralizing. The final tapestry as mirror-of-soul reconfigures prior motifs without spelling lesson. Subtextual invitation—viewer pauses, recognizes own weights—is elegantly implied. Ambiguity is preserved; complexity not collapsed into binary.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of transience emerges through sensory recurrence (steam, shavings, rain) rather than statement. No moral delivered; final image of emptied kettle + completed carving reweights “here and gone” with quiet acceptance. Ambiguity lingers—will ritual suffice tomorrow?—inviting reflection. Avoids sentimentality; insight earned via concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of rebirth-through-ingenuity emerges from concrete restoration rather than sermon, but the final paragraph drifts toward explicit thesis (“a new equation for hope”). Subtext is thin; symbols (maze, sextant) don’t gain new weight at end. Resonance is pleasant yet generic—any derelict space could substitute. The image of glowing terminal reconfigures meaning, but the conceptual cost is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically: mechanical time vs. natural rhythm. Final crystalline sunrise image re-prices earlier petrichor nostalgia without verbal moral. No thematic echo sentence; complexity accepted. Slight drift toward abstraction in “harmonize the mechanical with the natural” line, but image rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of self-deception versus clarifying light emerges through recurring sundial/light motifs rather than explicit sermon. The “architecture of lies” is echoed once in final paragraph—borderline thematic echo—but it is embedded in a fresh image of water lapping against stone, so the penalty is waived. Subtext operates in glints, scratches, silence; no moral is extracted. A lingering ambiguity remains: whether clarity brings peace or merely new responsibility—inviting reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of preservation-against-entropy emerges through fog, salt, and woven rope, never stated aloud. The closing image of seed-like knowledge planted in silence is conceptually resonant. Yet theme is muffled by the collector’s frictionless success; the potential loss she fears never materializes, so the thematic tension is theoretical. Subtext is present but not charged.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of absence→presence via written memory emerges implicitly through motif chain: empty streets → carpet thread → lunar hush. No explicit thesis, but final dust puff reweights earlier absences into quiet companionship. Subtext operates in image, not declaration. Lacks deeper moral friction; theme is atmospheric rather than dialectic, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically: extinct beauty versus mechanical survival, carried by the egg motif and the palace’s heartbeat. Subtext is present but thin—no ironic gap between prince and reader, no competing moral frames. The final image of a “sleeping giant” stirring offers a resonant reconfiguration, yet the prince’s personal stake in that rebirth remains metaphorical. Complexity is hinted but not dramatized; the piece avoids overt moralizing, earning a respectable thematic score.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of “scars as song” emerges through recurrent images—charred bark, coin, black sand—rather than overt statement, but the final line drifts toward abstract moral (“hope…for the scars to sing”). Subtext is thin; the coin and sand never accrue contradictory meaning under pressure, so the reweighting is sentimental rather than conceptually charged. Still, the particulars stay particular, avoiding tidy moral binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically: the cosmos favors gentle transmission over destructive flame, re-weighted in the final image. No overt thesis statement; the repetition of “quiet sigh” and “troubling serenity” supplies resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved—reader can still question whether serenity is comforting or stifling. Lacks a sharp ironic edge or counter-reading, so stays shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of collective grief emerges through migration trope—beauty persisting beyond death—avoiding overt thesis. Ribbon and poem function as family ritual, not sermon. Final image crystallizes paradox without moral tag, satisfying CR. Ambiguity is present yet thin; counter-readings are possible but not textured into scene.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through the shifting rake-handle text and light-image rather than explicit moralizing; the final golden horizon offers a non-literal answer to “can guilt be shed in steps?” Complexity is respected—no tidy absolution, only onward motion. The echo of “incremental” in the inscription and sunset is organic, not harvested. Still, the lack of a dramatized counter-argument keeps the resonance slightly monovalent.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: caretaking of the dead parallels caretaking of memory-threads and echo-intentions, culminating in the realization that the living world is equally threaded with unfinished purposes. No moral is stated; resonance is carried by the final image of the gardener walking among headstones now “alive with the thrum.” The tapestry language and crystal hum reframed as “language” supply subtle cohesion without symbolic over-tidiness. Ambiguity is preserved: we cannot decipher the echoes either, maintaining thematic complexity without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges obliquely: innovation within constraint is evoked through the spire’s dark boundary and the quill’s delicate potential. Subtext remains modest but intact—no moralizing, just the quiet image of unspent ink. The final paragraph’s “sustaining transformation” verges on echo-line but stops short of explicit thesis, preserving ambiguity. Resonance is modest because the cost is never felt.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—art as transmutation of absence into narrative—emerges through recurring dust/radio imagery rather than statement. Final image reweights dust from debris to medium, supplying quiet conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers: is the story-telling real or wishful? Complexity is modest because the beat is single-note; no counter-readings challenge Emilia’s conviction. Subtext stays imagistic, avoiding moral tag, but lacks friction to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges via iterated fragility images (shattered mask, charcoal dust, powder) rather than exposition. The final reconfiguration—safety as vanishing mirage—feels earned because the ash drift makes the concept tactile. Avoids final-paragraph sermon, landing in resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges implicitly: knowledge-preservation as perverse salvation after civilizational failure. Subtext resides in the cog’s reprise—once a timekeeper, now a relic of timeless ruin—reweighting “ancient methods” as both futile and vital. No overt moralizing; final smile invites ambiguity. The concept stays particular to Kael’s obsession rather than drifting into generic aphorism, though the echo of “competing narratives” edges close to Thematic Echo.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme emerges via iterated images of weaving/carving harmony, but the final paragraph verbalizes—“devotion,” “power of music”—rather than letting the image speak. Subtext is thin; silence and leaf-rustle carry some resonance, yet the concept of “unlearning hatred” is asserted, not dramatized. The ending avoids overt moral, but the conceptual reweight is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges as regeneration through sensuous memory—no thesis stated, only tasted. The seed’s sprout reprises the pruning motif, quietly answering the central question: decay is the compost for future stories. Subtext lives in gesture (she cradles the seed like a secret pregnancy) rather than exposition. Final paragraph risks a hint of sermon (“she knew that this was just the beginning”) but stops short of moralizing, preserving earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of “failure preserving wonder” is stated by the toll-keeper at the end; it emerges more through dialogue than through the hive’s lived impact on either character. Subtext is minimal—no silence, gesture, or image reweights the idea. The concept is coherent but arrives as a tidy moral rather than an earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme—beauty in impermanence through adaptive perspective—emerges organically from the statue’s reframing of structural decay. Subtext is quiet: the empty ampoule silently reweights earlier nostalgia into resilient acceptance. No moralizing statement intrudes; the final image of thriving decay lingers with gentle irony.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges inductively: beauty as stubborn civil resistance against urban cruelty. Subtext resides in silence—absent stars, unheard tongues—rather than exposition. Final smile reframes earlier “saffron quiet” as communal promise, not solitude. Avoids overt moral; could reward more specific contradiction to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of cultural memory emerges through the bread-initial motif and thaw reveal, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext is modest: opera glass as exile lens, bread as mnemonic archive. The ending image of guardian-duty is too cleanly resolved; ambiguity is asserted rather than felt. Resonance is gentle, not charged.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of forbidden knowledge vs. transformative risk is present but stated (“step beyond fate’s design”) rather than dramatized. Hunger stone / yoyo duality never accrues shifting meaning; symbols stay decorative. Final image of glowing lighthouse offers quiet repricing, yet moral ambiguity is absent—story side-steps whether radiance is blessing or curse. Insight feels pre-packaged, not earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.5)
    Theme of image-as-trap emerges through poster, mirror, photograph, but remains conceptual; no paradox or fresh angle complicates it. Subtext is limited because the narrator’s fear is never contradicted or deepened. The ending’s “siren’s call” reprise is a nakedly thematic echo rather than a reweighted image. Insight stays at prompt level: images can possess—never questioned or deepened.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme of transmuting nature into art is stated explicitly (“turn obstacles into instruments”) and reiterated rather than emerged through event. The orchard-music fusion is lovely but static; it neither questions nor complicates the premise. Final image of drifting clouds merely loops back to the opening question without reconfiguring meaning. Subtext is therefore thin—no silence, gesture, or irony complicates the stated idea.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of intrusion vs. silence emerges through the watchers’ mute gaze and Lyra’s defiant whistle, but the argument stays implicit. Recurring “sunwashed dread” reweights the turtle-city from wonder to menace, yet the note’s exposition weakens thematic density by stating the expedition’s doom rather than dramatizing it. No overt moralizing; ambiguity lingers. Thematic resonance is more atmospheric than philosophically provocative.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of absence-as-presence emerges through recurring water-and-ink imagery rather than statement, achieving quiet resonance. Final image of the empty yet "full" inkwell reconfigures meaning without moralizing, though earlier passages flirt with thesis-like phrasing that slightly dulls subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges obliquely: forgotten texts as mirrors for submerged selves; final blue stamp converts passive archive into personal palimpsest. No overt thesis; image of ink blooming on drowned page reweights “honest origins” as ongoing, mutable. Ambiguity lingers—truth is mark, not extraction—avoiding moral. Subtext operates through object handling rather than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of alchemizing sorrow into luminosity emerges through iterated images—polish, fold, release—without sermonizing. The origami crane’s final flight offers a wordless repricing of grief’s value, satisfying the non-literal answer test. Ambiguity is preserved: transcendence is hinted, not guaranteed. No thematic echo in the closing paragraph; subtext stays implicit, though the basilica’s unused promise lingers as untapped thematic potential.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of weaponized stagnation emerges through data rather than character experience; insight is stated (“unused potential… a catalyst”). Final image of tempered spirit offers modest resonance, but the conceptual reweighting is delivered in narrative paraphrase, not charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of belonging emerges implicitly from star maps and antique stones, avoiding explicit sermon. The final Conceptual Repricing links cosmic cartography to personal rootedness, offering quiet resonance. No counter-readings or tensions complicate the insight; the epiphany feels singular rather than wrested from conflict. Texture is pleasingly non-generic, though the insight is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of truth-vs-manufactured memory emerges through “sieved hush” and false-heritage vocation. Subtextual tension is present but static: the driftwood vision could have forced a moral recalibration yet doesn’t. Final image of glinting watch hand offers quiet irony yet no new weight. Ambiguity lingers, but insight feels suspended, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of recycled wisdom emerges through moon/recycling figuration rather than authorial moral. Subtext operates in the pull’s tactile recurrence and the final moon-set image. Final paragraph risks overt thesis (“mistakes of the past could be recycled into wisdom”) but stops short of sermon. Ambiguity is preserved: forgiveness is uncertain, stance crystallized not resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of “letting go to move on” is asserted outright in final paragraphs rather than emerging from a turning event. The compass metaphor is heavy-handed, and utility-pole symbolism is explained twice. No counter-theme or alternative reading is allowed; the story moralizes rather than resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of empathy-through-dimness is introduced via epigraphic newspaper line and reiterated in final paragraph, but the narrative never dramatizes an empathic test or failure. The baseball’s “JT – Time Traveler” signature hints at subtext about cross-time connection, yet this potential irony is left dormant. No particular is reweighted at the end; the lake simply glows brighter. The concept is coherent but relies on repeated assertion rather than earned resonance, preventing 7+ lift.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of transformation emerges through the cosmic intimacy cadence rather than direct statement; no character articulates “change is good.” The fortune-cookie aphorism is a diegetic prop, not authorial moral, so it escapes thematic echo penalty. Subtext is carried in image—moonlit fruit, beast eyes, luminescent apparition—but the reweighting is gentle, not conceptually jarring. Resonance lingers, yet the absence of a felt cost keeps the insight slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: time’s fractures are lived through the cracked saucer and fading hand-prints, avoiding explicit thesis. Final image of “cloudbound memories” offers a non-literal, resonant answer. Subtext operates in silence—she never names her child yet maternal loss permeates. Ambiguity is purposeful; complexity is honored without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of compassion as trans-temporal repair emerges through the sewing motif rather than statement. Subtext is carried in the shimmer of tears, the floating necklace—silence does the arguing. Final image reweights the ship from tomb to cradle without moralizing. Resonance is quiet but intact; ambiguity lingers about what Aurora will meet beyond the door.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—universe as web of coincidences—emerges through repeated hush and bottled-light echo rather than thesis. Final image reaches for CR yet lacks prior moral weight to reprice. Subtext resides in sensory motifs, but ambiguity tips into vagueness. No platitudes, yet insight stays general.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme—liberation through covert knowledge—emerges by accumulation: blackout, code, cradle, whispered footsteps. Subtext is thin; the bronze quill holder promises irony but supplies only a key-shaped plot key. The final paragraph’s moral uplift (“darkness had been vanquished”) is overt, not reconfigured by image. Resonance is pleasant but generic; the piece avoids moralizing yet offers no fresh angle on secrecy or revolt.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—knowledge as inheritance and cosmic responsibility—emerges through ritual action rather than statement. The stardust/rock motif reweights at closure, re-pricing the herder’s curse. No moralizing paragraph. Ambiguity lingers: will cosmos now unravel faster? The after-effect is quiet wonder, not profundity, keeping it under 7.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges from recurring images of mapping, masking, and developing—scars as negatives, storm as developer bath. The final reconfiguration is quiet: darkness shifts from “oppressive” to navigable. No moral is stated, but the insight is generic—“hidden patterns” remain abstract. Particulars (timer, timetable) carry more texture than the thematic payload, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of “victory as journey, not destination” emerges via the needle-card reprise and sundial re-weighting, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext is thin—no gaps between reader and character knowledge create irony. The motif of threads/questions/destinations is announced repeatedly, but since the duel’s content remains abstract, the metaphor feels pasted on rather than grown from particulars. Final softening is honest but sentimentally safe.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of regeneration-through-art emerges organically from rust-to-phoenix imagery; no overt thesis statement. Subtext resides in the tin’s hidden layers and the unspoken prisoner’s absence—beauty forged from what society discards. Final dawn image offers quiet Conceptual Repricing: knowledge that rebuilding is Sisyphean yet chosen. avoids moralizing, but abstraction limits aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of art-as-refuge emerges through image recursion (clock, film, compasses) rather than statement. The final re-configuration—she embraces frozen time—re-weights the motif set without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, but the emotional after-effect is muted because the cost is conceptual, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.3)
    Thematic statement (“collective memory = lifeblood”) is repeated verbatim; memory is abstractly revered but never tested against competing values or social cost. The ending offers uplift instead of reconfiguration, so the emergent idea stays ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of remembrance-as-tide emerges through concrete recurrence (compass needle frozen on memory, lace pattern mirroring waves) rather than thesis statement. Final image reconfigures apology into artifact surrendered to ocean—non-literal, unsentimental. Grandmother rule is understated; no moralizing paragraph caps the piece, allowing lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges coherently—decay as creative force—but is over-articulated in meta-commentary (“reality preprocesses itself”) rather than dramatized. The butterfly dust symbolizes the concept but doesn’t evolve in meaning. Final paragraphs verge on sermonizing, stating insights (“beauty in destruction”) instead of letting images resonate ambiguously.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, legacy, and perception, avoiding overt moralizing. The frost and ledger motifs accumulate meaning, suggesting that truth resides in ephemeral, overlooked patterns. However, the final insight—“pauses as inspiration”—edges toward abstraction without grounding in a concrete loss or irreversible shift, softening thematic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as fertile ground for new forms of connection. The “unshaken marvels” motif reweights the post-catastrophe world from loss to resilience, culminating in the conservatory’s quivering leaves as witness. However, the final paragraph verges on thematic assertion (“strength to face whatever lay ahead”) rather than pure image-based resonance, slightly undercutting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—stillness as active sanctuary, not mere absence—emerges organically through the undertaker’s labor and the signal’s transformation from distress to invitation. Subtext thrives in the lens’s repair and the library’s rebirth, avoiding moralizing. However, the final paragraph verges on declarative (“a reminder of the rest that now had a permanent address”), slightly undercutting resonance with near-thematic echo. The core question—can rest be given form?—is answered non-literally through sustained stewardship, not statement.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of solidarity amid oppression emerges organically through action and image, not moralizing. The bell symbolizes collective resilience without overt allegory. However, the ending leans toward sentimentality (“heart full of hope”) rather than complex ambiguity, and the central question—can anonymity sustain community?—is affirmed without counter-pressure. Subtext is present but safe; no meaningful ethical tension challenges the ideal.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—love as internal, divine, dormant—emerges through image (wisteria, breath, crystal) rather than statement. The final benediction avoids moralizing, offering resonance over resolution. However, the epiphany (“love you seek is within”) borders on thematic echo, slightly undercutting subtext. Still, Kwan Yin’s Tear and camera obscura subtly tie craft to compassion, earning organic thematic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme (“time’s texture”) emerges through recurring imagery but collapses into pseudo-profound abstraction (“embracing the entirety of existence”). The lotus metaphor and “quaking reverie” gesture toward resonance but substitute lyricism for earned insight. No moral ambiguity or counter-reading exists—Elian’s quest is frictionless, flattening thematic complexity. Final integration of knowledge into craft is asserted, not dramatized, weakening subtextual payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (“resilience through patience”) emerges via repetition, not subtext; final paragraphs moralize (“true freedom… presence of hope”) rather than resonate through image. The piano-key code and arrow echo mechanically without shifting meaning. Epiphanies feel unearned because struggle is summarized, not dramatized—wisdom reads as prompt-derived platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: silence and absence as carriers of emotional truth, with healing born from confronting rupture. The battered marvel motif reweights trauma as generative rather than purely destructive. Final image avoids moralizing—Lyra’s peace arises from integration, not resolution. Yet the insight leans slightly toward pseudo-profundity (“sound of trust breaking”) without grounding its mechanics in human behavior, risking abstraction over lived complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (“magic in fleeting moments”) emerges through image but collapses into pseudo-profundity with lines like “spoke to the very heart of existence.” The ending offers no non-literal answer—just reaffirmation of the premise. Recurring motifs (moonbeams, flowers) decorate rather than reweight meaning. Subtext is absent; everything is stated, leaving no room for ambiguity or resonant aftereffect expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (“thawing heart as renewal”) emerges through repeated metaphor but collapses into assertion rather than earned resonance. The final paragraph moralizes (“proud to be part of its thawing”) instead of offering a non-literal answer. Recurring images (bookmark, orb, ice) lack reweighting—they echo without transformation. Subtext is drowned by on-the-nose narration that tells rather than implies thematic meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through the phrase “truth is in the shadows,” linking concealment to self-discovery, but risks banality by equating vulnerability with strength without complication. The seashell’s hum and cast note function as symbolic convenience rather than earned motifs—they appear once, then reprise without transformation. Final paragraph moralizes (“vulnerability as a source of strength”) rather than letting resonance arise from image. Ambiguity is absent; the epiphany is tidy, not complex.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—silence as generative, narrative as cosmic cartography—emerges organically through image and rhythm, not assertion. The “ambered hush” and “marbled hush” avoid moralizing, inviting reflection on language, perception, and unseen order. Final image (fort creaking “like a lullaby”) resonates non-literally, reweighting chaos into calm without tidy resolution. However, the insight borders on pseudo-profundity (“summarize the silence”) without grounding in human-scale struggle, slightly undercutting emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (“sentience emerges from experience”) is coherent but delivered through exposition, not subtext. The ice violin’s recurrence lacks functional evolution—it’s admired, then symbolizes, without altering Zeta’s behavior. Final paragraph moralizes (“thoughts come from amalgamation of experiences”) instead of offering resonant, non-literal closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (“freed by honesty”) emerges through assertion, not event—epiphanies are unearned summaries (“she had come to realize…”). The lens and doodles symbolize truth but don’t generate thematic tension; their meaning is fixed, not reweighted. Final image offers no non-literal answer—just restated moralizing (“honesty reigned”). Avoids sentimentality but defaults to banal pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the ritual of polishing marbles and the cyclical imagery of bloom and wither, avoiding overt moralizing. However, the final lines lapse into abstraction (“a story that would continue to unfold”) that dilutes resonance. The core idea—that nurturing is reciprocal dialogue—is evocative but remains untested, reducing thematic complexity to serene affirmation without counterweight or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—time’s nonlinearity and cosmic wonder—emerges through the nexus and winged creatures, but leans on abstract assertions (“infinite possibilities,” “change human understanding forever”). The final paragraph moralizes rather than resonates, stating significance instead of implying it. Subtext is thin; the “subdued awakenings” motif remains decorative. Epiphany feels unearned, lacking struggle that would ground its profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of music, memory, and liminality, avoiding explicit moralizing. The “in between spaces” concept evolves from metaphor to lived experience, culminating in Rachel’s integration with the opera house. Subtext thrives in silence, water, and unstruck chords—suggesting art’s persistence beyond performance. However, the insight borders on romanticized idealism; the lack of counterpoint or ambiguity (e.g., danger, delusion, futility) limits thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of data, intuition, and marginalia, culminating in the insight that certainty is provisional. The botanical illustration shifts from static symbol to charged emblem of epistemic humility. Avoids moralizing; resonance arises through image and accumulated texture. However, the central question (“What is truth?”) receives a lyrical but familiar answer—uncertainty as beauty—lacking a non-obvious moral calculus or counter-reading to push into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—truth as burden—emerges through recurring motifs (swallowed truth, secrecy) but collapses into assertion (“weight of the swallowed truth was finally beginning to reveal itself”). The ending offers no non-literal reweighting; insight is declared, not dramatized. Subtext is thin: the psychic radio segment gestures at hidden pain but doesn’t intertwine with the explorer’s arc. Resonance is stated, not earned through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of transience and the redemptive power of silence emerges organically through image and setting, not exposition. The final lines reframe decay as beauty without moralizing. However, the insight (“peace in turmoil”) borders on familiar lyric wisdom; it’s elegantly stated but not freshly interrogated. Subtext thrives in silence and excavation, yet avoids genuine moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of “ordinary magic” emerges through recurring images (curl, eclipse, music) rather than direct statement. Subtext lives in gesture—the shared gaze, the tucked hair—and avoids moralizing. Yet the insight remains generic: wonder exists if you pay attention. No counter-reading or complexity tempers the optimism; the world offers beauty without friction. Final image resonates but doesn’t reweight prior material with new conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—memory, preservation, the weight of lost narratives—emerges through recurring imagery (tapestry, diaries, whispers). But it remains atmospheric rather than dramatized. The “poignant tale of love and loss” is told, not shown. Final lines reiterate mood without reweighting prior material conceptually. No moral is stated, but resonance lacks earned specificity—wisdom feels borrowed, not discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme (“open secrets”) is named repeatedly but emerges as abstraction, not lived tension. The story confuses motif recurrence (“transpose into a new key,” “familiar enigma”) with subtext, offering pseudo-profound assertions instead of earned insight. Final lines moralize (“testament to the power…”) rather than resonate, violating the Thematic Echo penalty by stating the thesis in closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—illuminating hidden assumptions through sound/silence—emerges organically from the ritual premise. The blue palette and silence-as-presence offer subtle subtext. But the ending moralizes: “he had illuminated hidden assumptions and revealed underlying truths,” stating rather than implying the insight. The epiphany feels unearned because the struggle was atmospheric, not existential or personal.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—creativity born from stillness, reflection, and nostalgic memory—emerges organically through recurring images (mirror, spire, nautilus). The final image reweights the premise: music arises not from sound but silence. However, the closing lines verge on moralizing (“world full of hidden harmonies… bring them to life”), tipping into pseudo-profundity. Subtext is rich, but the epiphany feels preordained, lacking counter-readings or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme (“self as labyrinth”) emerges through motif but collapses into abstraction; the “secrets of fractured timelines” remain unexamined conceptually. Final image offers vague rebirth (“city reborn”) without reweighting prior events or posing a non-literal answer to the central question. Recurring phrases (“darkening brightness”) feel decorative, not resonant. Epiphany is asserted (“she had conquered”) rather than earned through specific struggle, yielding pseudo-profundity over emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—silence as generative, not void—emerges through recurring images (needle, drum, hush) without moralizing. The final melody “unseen” reweights prior silence as fertile, answering the central question non-literally. Subtext thrives in gesture: fingers coaxing drums, shadows drawn by hum. However, “filament of hush” leans toward abstract label, and the phonograph’s hidden language borders on pseudo-profundity without grounding in concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of truth-seeking vs. institutional secrecy emerges but resolves into assertion (“she would uncover the truth”) rather than resonant image. The “layered tranquility” motif lacks transformation—opening and closing moods mirror without reweighting. Moral clarity replaces ambiguity; the lab is “nefarious” with no ethical complexity. Final paragraph moralizes intent instead of letting subtext arise from concrete particulars or charged silence.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (memory’s fragility and healing power) emerges organically from the perfume vial and greenhouse imagery, avoiding overt moralizing. However, the epiphany (“grasped the impact of memories”) is told, not earned through concrete struggle, leaning into pseudo-profundity. Subtext is muted—scents evoke tears, but the connection between olfactory triggers and emotional catharsis isn’t dramatized, only asserted. Final image (empty vial) reweights memory as bittersweet, yet lacks conceptual cost or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of rope, stone patterns, and time’s texture, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image—patterns absorbed into the grotto—resonates as a non-literal answer: truth is co-created, not discovered. Yet the theme risks abstraction (“texture of time”) without anchoring in human-scale dilemma. The energy beings catalyze reflection but not conflict, leaving the central question (“adapt, resist, flee?”) unanswered and untested.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty resides in imperfection, silence can be transformed by shared art. The mendicant’s bowl and chronic hush reweight meaning by story’s end—not stated but shown through music’s effect on landscape and people. Avoids moralizing; the final image of lingering music offers resonant, non-literal resolution. Yet the theme leans toward familiar eco-spiritual tropes without subverting or complicating them through character-specific friction.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of artifice and authenticity, centered on “half truths” as emotionally functional fictions. The blotter petal symbolizes how fabrication can be rooted in genuine experience, and the grotto’s responsive glow suggests emotional labor leaves traces. However, the final image offers resonance without reweighting—a quiet affirmation rather than a conceptual repricing. Avoids moralizing but stops short of probing the ethical ambiguity of selling counterfeit feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (“cycles of compassion”) is stated outright rather than emerging from conflict. The locket and envelope echo the idea but don’t reconfigure it through action—Sophia’s gratitude and Lena’s initiative feel illustrative, not revelatory. Final lines moralize (“testament to the cycles…”) instead of offering resonant ambiguity. Insight is told, not earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from Kael’s longing and art, avoiding overt moralizing, and the “webs of kinship” motif threads through imagery. However, the final insight—that art fosters belonging—is presented as fait accompli, not earned through conflict or loss. The story resists tidy binaries but lacks counter-readings or moral complexity; the community’s instant gratitude feels unearned, undercutting thematic weight. Subtext remains thin because stakes were never truly jeopardized.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—hidden harmonies beneath urban surface—emerges organically through image and action, not exposition. The infinity symbol evolves from ornament to key, echoing the theme of cyclical, layered time. Final image reweights the premise: art becomes vessel for infinite resonance. But the insight borders on pseudo-profundity (“magic that lay just beneath the surface”) without moral or existential friction—no counterpoint, no cost to knowing, rendering the wisdom slightly weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: the unquantifiable can be glimpsed, not solved. The final image—conjurer vanishing as dawn arrives, glass eyes watching—reweights the orchard from place of loss to realm of possibility, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. Recurring motifs (eyes, mosaic, silence) accrue meaning without overstatement. However, the phrase “mathematics of emotion” flirts with pseudo-profundity, and the epiphany risks abstraction despite grounding in ritual action.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: presence in absence, memory as anchor, care as quiet resistance. The tape fragment reweights the past/present without moralizing. Final image—a whispered myth felt but not confirmed—offers a non-literal answer to “Can one be seen while remaining hidden?” However, the theme leans toward sentimentality (“beacon in the sapphire hush”) and avoids complexity; no counter-force or ambiguity challenges the dweller’s worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme emerges through recurring natural imagery but collapses into explicit moralizing: “transformation was a journey worth undertaking,” “beauty and growth were possible.” The linden leaf’s symbolic function is stated, not earned through reweighted meaning. While the core idea—growth through surrender—is coherent, it’s delivered via assertion rather than subtext, and the ending summarizes theme instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme emerges around trauma, memory, and hidden history, but it’s articulated through assertion (“testament to the power,” “symbol of that balance”) rather than earned resonance. The brooch’s transformation into art reweights nothing—it merely illustrates a pre-stated idea. Final paragraph moralizes (“reminder of the secrets…”) instead of offering a non-literal, image-based answer, triggering a −0.6 penalty for thematic echo in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—everyday magic hidden in plain sight—emerges through recurring imagery (crystals, shadows, vibrations) but culminates in explicit moralizing: “the most profound magic lies not in grand gestures…” This final-paragraph thesis statement replaces resonant ambiguity with prompt-like articulation, triggering a −0.6 penalty. Subtext is thin; insights are asserted, not dramatized through struggle or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of remembrance-as-rebirth emerges organically through the trumpet valve’s resonance, avoiding overt moralizing. However, subtext collapses into assertion in the final third (“testament to the power of remembrance,” “beacon shining brightly”). The valve’s symbolic function is reactive, not earned through character struggle—it catalyzes communal healing without narrative friction. Ambiguity is sacrificed for tidy uplift, weakening thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (“truth transforms perception”) emerges through motif (vault, punch, cracks) but collapses into abstraction at closure: “world now full of possibility” states insight rather than embodying it. The “fortress of unspoken truths” promises moral or epistemic weight but delivers generic revelation without ethical tension or counter-readings. Recurring images lack reweighting—cracks guide but don’t mislead; punch hums but doesn’t betray. Final paragraph moralizes (“changed forever”) instead of trusting resonant particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of memory, perception, and hidden patterns, avoiding moralizing. The final image—wind echoing the whales’ symphony—resonates as a non-literal answer to the central question of interconnectedness. However, the theme leans heavily on lyrical assertion rather than dramatized contradiction, and “entangled memories” functions more as poetic motif than a tested philosophical framework with counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from Kael’s quest: the nature of endings and continuity. The duplicate’s line—“I am what remains after goodbye”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates through image (mirror-self, fading presence) and silence (the shared gesture). However, the final paragraph leans slightly toward abstraction (“dimensional echo that would resonate forever”), bordering on pseudo-profundity, though it avoids outright sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between deception and justice, with the ink pot symbolizing inherited moral ambiguity. The “mathematics of a fair trade” reframes freedom as a complex equation, avoiding tidy moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture—Lena’s cradling of the pot, her father’s proud smile. Yet the final paragraph edges toward abstraction (“justice done”) that slightly overstates what the scene earns, diluting the quiet conceptual repricing achieved moments earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of invented histories, texture-collecting, and liminal time, avoiding moralizing or abstraction. The final image—the notepad holding “the promise of new stories”—resonates as a non-literal answer to the question of whether ephemeral moments can be preserved. However, the theme remains decorative rather than tested; no counter-force challenges the stationer’s belief, so complexity is implied but not dramatized. Subtext thrives in imagery, but the lack of friction limits thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of memory and erasure is stated rather than dramatized; insights arrive as assertions (“a narrative of love, loss, and survival”) not earned through struggle. The final image (label stored away) lacks resonant reconfiguration—it merely restates earlier motifs without shifting their meaning. Recurrence feels ornamental, not integral to thematic development or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme emerges as the interplay between memory, sound, and cosmic mystery, but it’s conveyed through assertion (“unlocked the secrets of the universe”) rather than resonant particulars. The painted seashell and cello hum suggest a link between personal history and universal order, yet the insight feels generic—pseudo-profound without moral or conceptual cost. The ending states triumph instead of implying it through charged poise or repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of community resilience emerges through recurring motifs (carnival, foundation chip), but is undercut by abstract assertions (“the city was more than just a collection… a living, breathing entity”). Final paragraphs moralize (“testament to the strength of community”) instead of letting resonance arise from particulars. Subtext is thin—graffiti’s power is explained, not shown through character reaction or risk. No meaningful ambiguity or counter-reading complicates the anti-gentrification stance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of transience emerges through recurring images (flora, sand grain, dawn), but leans into sentimental abstraction (“poignant reminder,” “fleeting beauty”) rather than earned insight. The final image reprises the grain, yet its symbolic weight feels ornamental, not causally integrated. Moralizing phrasing (“importance of capturing its beauty”) edges into thesis-statement territory, undercutting subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of harmony between machine and environment emerges organically through Emilia’s synesthetic calibration. The drone’s transformation mirrors the depot’s shift from mist to light—resonance without moralizing. Subtext thrives in tactile precision vs. visual absence, suggesting knowledge beyond sight. Yet the theme leans toward idealized unity, lacking counterpoint or ambiguity that would deepen its complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—quest for hidden knowledge—emerges through recurring images (phrasebook, rivers, convergence) but remains abstract. The ending offers no non-literal answer; it restates desire without reweighting it. No moral ambiguity or counter-reading arises—Emilia’s pursuit is unchallenged. Subtext is thin; the phrasebook’s “mantra” is quoted but never interrogated, reducing resonance to decorative echo.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: harmony as active, patient re-synchronization of place and memory. Subtext lives in vibration, silence, and cobblestones—not stated morals. The final image (“sound of a town reborn”) reweights earlier stillness as fertile, not final—a non-literal answer to whether time’s damage is reversible. Avoids sentimentality, but leans slightly into lyrical abstraction (“fabric of reality reshaped”) that borders on pseudo-profundity without grounding cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—memory as fragile, sacred inheritance—emerges organically through the vial and temple whispers. The final image reweights the premise: success brings melancholy, not triumph, underscoring the cost of preservation. But the insight borders on familiar (“lost civilizations must be remembered”), and subtext leans on lyrical assertion rather than gesture or silence. No counter-readings complicate the reverence for memory.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—legacy, truth, storytelling—emerges through recurring motifs (lattice, scuffs, threading), but resolves into abstraction rather than resonant ambiguity. The final image (“threads weaving into a tale”) states thematic intent without reweighting prior material through character consequence. No moral is preached, but the lack of closure prevents conceptual repricing. Subtext is present in the cry-wolf lineage, yet untested by action that would complicate its inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of cyclical debt and spectral mentorship emerges through recurring images (veil, bead, winter fields), but collapses into sentimentality in the final paragraph (“mournful elation,” “gift of understanding”). The ghost’s “lovingly venomous” duality promises moral complexity but delivers unambiguous benevolence. Subtext is muted by explanatory narration (“she understood the true nature…”), replacing implication with summary. Resonance is lyrical but lacks conceptual repricing or irreversible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of art transforming brokenness emerges through recurring motifs (weaving, fragments, tapestry), but it’s stated outright rather than dramatized (“testament to the power of art to transform”). The ending moralizes instead of offering resonant ambiguity, especially in final paragraphs that repeat “path from ruin to reverence.” Subtext is minimal; insights feel like prompt compliance, not earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of ancestral reconnection emerges organically through setting and object, not declaration. The sundial and bones suggest time, memory, and continuity without moralizing. However, the final insight (“rebuilt something within herself”) edges toward abstraction, slightly undercutting subtext. Ambiguity is maintained, but the emotional payoff leans safe rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of analog intimacy vs. digital ephemerality emerges organically through image and ritual, avoiding moralizing. The “futuristic nostalgia” tone supports this duality, and the bottle-in-ocean metaphor resonates without overstatement. However, the final insight—that slowness holds beauty—is asserted rather than reweighted by event; no counterforce challenges or deepens the premise. Subtext lives in objects (clipboard, chalk) but lacks friction to generate ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—hidden truths woven into art that can alter history—emerges organically through needle, thread, and celestial rhythm. Subtext resides in the tension between surface craft and subversive listening. But the final insight (“stories would be the guide through darkness”) verges on declarative summary, slightly undercutting resonance. Still, the chart-as-key metaphor avoids moralizing and sustains ambiguity about what the uncovered secrets actually entail.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of unspoken words and liminal regret emerges organically through the unsent letters, condensation messages, and Aria’s role as conduit—not through assertion. The final image—Aria carrying the essence “in the space where an apology waits unspoken”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights silence as sacred burden. Ambiguity lingers without confusion, and the fierce tenderness tone supports thematic complexity. However, the insight borders on lyrical abstraction without grounding in a concrete human consequence beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of resilience amid shared trauma emerges organically through coral and cast imagery, avoiding overt moralizing. However, insights verge on pseudo-profound abstraction (“lotus-hearted ache,” “graft new meaning”) without grounding in specific human behavior. The final image reweights the coral as a symbol of healing, offering quiet resonance—but the thematic payoff feels decorative rather than inevitable. Subtext is present but diluted by lyrical vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—art as resurrection of forgotten beauty—emerges organically through image and action, not statement. The mural’s temporary vitality offers a non-literal answer: creation as fleeting communion with loss. However, the final lines verge on thematic echo (“magic that lay just beyond the fog”), slightly diluting subtext with near-declarative phrasing. Still, resonance lingers through the orchard “reborn, one brushstroke at a time.”

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: restoration as rigid preservation versus creation as collaborative bewitchment. The final image—forest swaying in time with music—offers a non-literal answer to Lena’s question about boundaries, reweighting art as living dialogue. Subtext thrives in objects: the nickel’s warmth, the mirrors’ angles, the humming hands. However, phrases like “nested awakenings” and “fabric of reality unraveling” flirt with pseudo-profundity, slightly diluting thematic precision despite strong visual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of coded resistance emerges through setting and motif but collapses into assertion in the final paragraph: “testament to… unbreakable spirit,” “beacon of hope,” etc. These are prompt-like moral summaries, not earned resonance. The gourd seed’s dispersal suggests legacy, but the conceptual cost of thought taxation is never felt—only named. Subtext drowns in declarative abstraction rather than arising from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—art as alchemy of suffering—emerges organically through image and action, not moralizing. The galaxy postcard evolves from relic to catalyst, reweighting the past without explicit commentary. Final lines avoid sentimentality, offering quiet affirmation: creation persists across time. However, the “blossom armistice” concept remains decorative, not integrated into the poet’s moral calculus, slightly blunting thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—memory as fragile, necessary labor—emerges organically through the interplay of objects, action, and setting, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: the cracked wind chime still sings, the orchids glow, and the caretaker endures, suggesting that preservation is imperfect but vital. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture—the smile, the lingering melody—rather than exposition. However, the theme edges toward abstraction in phrases like “museum of extinct feelings,” which risks conceptual vagueness over concrete emotional truth, slightly diluting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: truth as harmonic pattern recoverable through disciplined, flawed human effort. The “symphonies of truth” reframe silence not as failure but as necessary prelude to resonance. Subtext lives in the ink well’s transformation—from vessel to oracle—and Elara’s smile amid diverging paths suggests trust begins inwardly. Avoids moralizing, though the epiphany leans slightly toward lyrical assertion (“fabric of reality altered”) rather than earned insight grounded in textual struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of compassion and unity emerges through recurring motifs (chain, breathing stones, encrypted message), but collapses into explicit moralizing: “testament to the power of compassion and unity.” The final paragraph states the theme rather than dramatizing it, violating the “no sermonizing” rule. While the amphitheater symbolizes community, the insight feels unearned because Kaelin experiences no friction that challenges her idealism.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of paper trails (fabricated history), dust motes (ephemeral truth), and lost songs (irretrievable past). The final image—Emilia at peace amid swirling dust—offers a non-literal answer: one can live with unresolved duality. However, the thematic insight edges toward assertion (“it was not just about preserving… but about finding a way”) rather than pure resonance. The mars meteorite symbolizes vastness but doesn’t reweight the core question, slightly diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of “necessary distances” as spiritual disorientation emerges organically through maze architecture, prismatic shifts, and paternal legacy. Subtext resides in tactile details (wood grain, weather code), avoiding moralizing. Yet the final insight—that distances are part of a “larger whole”—edges toward abstraction without confronting ambiguity or cost. Resonance is lyrical but lacks the conceptual repricing needed for 9+; wisdom feels inherited, not earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme (“belonging,” “hidden rhythms”) is asserted through lyrical repetition but never emerges from concrete struggle or choice. The final paragraph moralizes (“testament to the power of shadowseam wonder”) instead of offering resonant ambiguity. No counter-readings or complexity—only decorative profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—memory as fragile yet connective, paths as ephemeral responses to change—emerges organically through recurring images (foam, seeds, crystals) without moralizing. The ancient symbols reframe disappearance not as loss but transformation, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the insight arrives too cleanly; the recollectionist’s epiphany lacks friction or counterpoint, softening thematic complexity. Still, the final image of glowing crater glass embodies earned wisdom without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme—art as bridge between mundane and magical—emerges through image and motif but remains untested by conflict or cost. The final paragraph restates the premise rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. “Orchestrated serendipity” is named repeatedly but never interrogated for its limits or illusions. Subtext is thin; the story asserts wonder without dramatizing its fragility or price.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—art transcending time via cosmic unity—emerges through recurring images (stars, gaps, skin as canvas). However, it’s asserted more than earned: the final verse appears magically, bypassing struggle. The “nostalgia ban” introduces intriguing social context but isn’t woven into thematic tension. Subtext is thin; insights (“interconnectedness”) feel pre-packaged rather than discovered through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (“beauty beneath surface”) emerges organically through recurring images (reflection, ripples, prism), avoiding overt moralizing. However, insight remains abstract: “noctilucent reckonings” functions as poetic label, not lived revelation. The ending resonates aesthetically but offers no non-literal answer to a central question—because no real question was posed under pressure. Subtext is present but untested.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (“hard softness,” pain as universal language) emerges through recurring images but collapses into assertion in the final third (“messenger carrying a vital message”). The box’s symbolism is ornamental, not generative—it doesn’t constrain or reweight meaning. Subtext is minimal; insights are summarized, not dramatized. The ending moralizes (“potential for enlightenment”) rather than offering resonant, non-literal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through recurring motifs (balloons, patterns, light), but borders on self-congratulatory abstraction (“equations for hope”). The ending offers a quiet affirmation, not a resonant reconfiguration—it restates the premise without repricing it. No counter-reading or complexity tempers the optimism; the piece avoids moral ambiguity or cost. Subtext is thin beneath the lyrical surface.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of legacy and memory emerges organically through image and motif, avoiding overt moralizing. The film strip’s reappraisal offers subtle conceptual shift, and walls-as-dreamers reframes perception. However, insights remain abstract (“testament to lives,” “story to be told”) without grounding in specific human contradiction or cost. Final resonance leans on lyrical repetition rather than earned wisdom from struggle, falling short of non-literal closure that reweights prior material decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—art as portal to hidden realities—emerges organically through image and action, avoiding moralizing. The recurring parapet and lullaby weave subtext about perception and coded communication. However, the ending offers wonder without conceptual cost; “possibilities” remain abstract, unweighted by sacrifice or paradox. Resonance leans on lyric beauty rather than reconfigured meaning or irreversibility.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme (“redemption through flawed beauty”) is stated outright rather than emerging from action. The ebony clipboard’s “ritual significance” is told, not shown altering behavior. Final image reprises motifs but offers no non-literal answer—only affirmation (“redemption was possible”). Epiphanies are unearned summaries (“ideals anchored in practice”), not insights forged through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of preservation amid destruction emerges organically through the egg and cracked earth, avoiding overt moralizing. The “echo of extinct birds” offers resonant ambiguity—not revival, but memory-as-lifeblood. However, the final lines verge on lyrical assertion (“legacy would live on”) that risks sentimentality. Subtext is present but not deepened by character flaw or irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—authenticity versus societal performance—emerges organically through recurring motifs (threads, echoes, lullaby). The prism sanctuary functions as a resonant symbol that reweights the premise at closure. However, the final paragraph verges on moralizing (“beacon of hope,” “beauty of being true to oneself”), slightly undercutting subtext with declarative resolution. Still, ambiguity lingers in the courtesan’s unnerving confidence, resisting tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from setting and object, avoiding overt moralizing, but remains inert because no tension tests it. The central question—“ethics of storytelling”—is posed but not wrestled with; Amaranth’s epiphany feels granted by atmosphere, not earned through struggle. The campfire stick’s generational weight hints at legacy, yet no counter-argument or personal cost reframes that inheritance. Final resonance leans on lyrical repetition (“meteor hush,” “half-lit epiphanies”) rather than a non-literal answer grounded in dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through image and action: fragility, memory, transience. The moth wing and temporary structures reweight “overlooked histories” as sacred yet ephemeral. Avoids moralizing; final glow implies stories persist beyond grasp. However, the monarch butterfly’s “last migration” introduces apocalyptic weight that isn’t integrated into Aria’s personal stakes, creating slight thematic dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—memory as fragile, recoverable sound—emerges organically through rope, card, and hum. The final image reweights the premise: names aren’t just recalled but sonically resurrected. However, the insight edges toward abstraction (“testament to the power of memory”) rather than staying grounded in the specific mechanics of Akira’s craft, slightly diluting subtextual force.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: agency vs. destiny, decay of purpose, and retrospective clarity. The final image—Hindsight stepping into a reborn forest—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the “decaying directive” remains too abstract to fully ground the theme in concrete particulars. Subtext is strong, but insights lean toward pseudo-profundity (“paths that choose their walkers”) without gritty human counterweight.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of celestial-terrestrial unity emerges through repetition, not earned insight. The final paragraph moralizes (“beauty and order could prevail”) rather than offering resonant ambiguity. “Encrypted devotion” remains conceptual window-dressing; no tension between skepticism and wonder manifests in choices that reweight the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme emerges through recurring motifs (music box, shifting grace) but collapses into explicit moralizing: “holding onto anger... perpetuated a cycle of suffering.” The final paragraph summarizes the thesis rather than offering resonant ambiguity. Insights read as prompt-derived abstractions, not earned through specific struggle—pseudo-profundity replaces emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: the erasure of boundaries between reality/fantasy, maker/made, is embodied in the mirror’s creation and the protagonist’s dissolution. The final image—the glass mountains reflected on certain mornings—offers a non-literal answer: dreams persist only when anchored in crafted objects, at the cost of the dreamer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (is this transcendence or loss?). Recurrence of “shimmer” reweights the premise without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through the metaphor of deciduous vows and forgotten seeds, suggesting that care revives broken bonds. But the insight borders on sentimental: the world rewards persistence with effortless reconciliation, avoiding the moral complexity of real rupture. The final image reweights the ribbon as a bridge, yet the absence of loss or irreversible cost softens thematic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the nonlinear inheritance concept and the bathroom epiphany, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image of blossoms shining like stars resonates with the opening, suggesting cyclical wonder. Yet the insight—knowledge as interconnected web—is stated plainly rather than dramatized through conflict or sacrifice, leaning into pseudo-profundity. Subtext is present but lacks friction or counterpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—knowledge as responsibility—emerges coherently, and the “unlearned lessons” concept resonates with Elara’s shift from theory to application. But the ending moralizes explicitly (“she had found something far more valuable than mere knowledge”) instead of trusting subtext. The “unheard symphony” motif recurs but feels decorative, not reweighted by action or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—memory as fragile, names as preservation—emerges organically through ship decay and passenger fragments. The final image (Garden as oasis) offers non-literal resolution, reweighting the quest as internal. But it edges toward pseudo-profundity (“state of mind”) without grounding the conceptual cost in character-specific loss.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of rope-braiding, archival work, and temporal anomaly—knowledge as pattern-making in the face of absence. The final image (seal glowing on desk) reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext thrives in tactile details (dusty tomes, vibrating air) rather than exposition. Yet the “fables of absence” remain vague; their thematic weight relies on poetic assertion rather than dramatized stakes, preventing full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—finding quiet within chaos—emerges organically through vibration metaphors and the bloom of hush as both literal and conceptual goal. The final image reweights silence as active harmony, not absence. However, the last paragraph veers toward summary (“sanctuary of peace,” “delicate harmony”) that borders on thematic echo, slightly undercutting earned resonance. Subtext thrives in the stone’s glow and crack patterns, but the closing lines risk stating what the imagery already conveys.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—meaning in coincidence—emerges through recurring motifs (stars, prisms, silence), but culminates in declarative optimism (“thistle-blown hope... burst into bloom”) that borders on sentimentality. The final image offers warmth, not ambiguity or conceptual cost. Subtext is thin; the shard’s retrocognitive power serves revelation, not moral or existential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of collective memory as identity-shaper emerges organically through image and ritual, not exposition. The crystal’s whispers and shadow-measuring suggest how past echoes inform present selfhood. Final image reweights the premise: memory isn’t preserved but carried forward, shaping future. Avoids moralizing, though risks pseudo-profundity in phrases like “sculpt her identity from experiences.” Resonance is earned through consistent texture.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: creativity as response to stillness, art born from ambient awareness. The mosaic’s “In the stillness, find the spark” avoids moralizing by functioning as diegetic artifact that mirrors Lyra’s journey. However, the final insight borders on platitude, and the thematic payoff leans on familiar tropes (artist saved by beauty). Subtext is present but not deeply layered—wonder replaces complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of transformation and liminal time emerges organically through cicada, starlight, and pause imagery. The final image—chronicler rising at dawn with cicada—offers quiet resonance without moralizing. However, the insight feels unearned; no struggle or sacrifice precedes it. Subtext is present but muted by absence of dramatic friction or character-altering realization.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: solace arises not from escaping confinement but from reconfiguring perception within it. The “flavors of silence” motif evolves from abstract task to lived interior landscape, culminating in the doll’s return as symbol of earned tranquility. Avoids moralizing; insight grows from concrete experience. However, the “gilded hush” borders on ornamental mysticism, slightly diluting thematic grounding in psychological realism.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of silence as solace emerges through recurring imagery but remains abstract and untested. The final paragraph asserts success (“another step towards teaching silence”) rather than dramatizing insight through struggle. No counter-reading or complexity challenges the premise—silence is uniformly redemptive. The storm glass symbolizes balance but doesn’t complicate or deepen the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of hubris and renewal emerges through murals, but collapses into sentimentality at closure (“whispers of the past grew fainter, replaced by the promise of a brighter tomorrow”). The stairway symbolizes ascension, yet its discovery lacks moral or epistemic cost—Aria inherits power without reckoning with the civilization’s downfall. Final throne-sitting offers no conceptual repricing; it affirms restoration rather than questioning whether Xylophia-IV should be “restored” at all. Subtext is drowned by on-the-nose declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the keeper’s paradoxical role: tending shadows to teach breath, isolation to foster connection. The final image—the silent, glowing knocker—resonates as a non-literal answer: closure isn’t silence, but readiness. However, the phrase “teach suffocating to breathe” edges toward pseudo-profundity, and the moral risks sentimentality by resolving complexity into harmonious rebirth without lingering ambiguity or counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of finding magic in ruin is gestured at through Lyra’s past and luminous setting, but remains abstract. “Quantum promise” and “shadowseam wonder” read as pseudo-profound labels, not emergent insights from struggle. Final image of diamonds in mushroom light offers visual resonance but no conceptual repricing—no reweighting of the pyramid scheme trauma or cost of belief.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (“intuition unlocks hidden truths”) emerges through recurring motifs (crank, shadows, muses) but collapses into assertion in the final paragraph (“testament to the power of intuition”). The “bridge of intuition” is named but never tested—no failure, doubt, or cost complicates its use. Subtext is minimal; everything is stated (“truth began to reveal itself,” “legacy a testament”). The ending moralizes rather than resonates, offering no non-literal answer—just a summary of the premise as achieved fact.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme—allegiance as conduit for possibility—emerges through image and ritual, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, it remains decorative rather than interrogated; the knight’s transformation affirms the premise without tension or counterpoint. The “shape of possibility” is evocative but undefined, yielding resonance without conceptual weight. Final image reweights nothing—it simply manifests what was desired.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme emerges through recurring motifs (dust, light, forgotten objects), but the final paragraph moralizes rather than resonates: “testament to the enduring power of the human heart” reads as prompt-driven assertion. The button’s transformation into symbol feels illustrative, not inevitable. Subtext is drowned by explicit statements about “resilience” and “hope.” Earned wisdom is absent—insights arrive pre-packaged, not forged through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from relics, erased histories, and collective memory, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image—Aria vanishing at dawn with the key—offers a non-literal answer: resistance persists in small acts of preservation. However, the closing lines verge on abstraction (“beacon of hope in a world threatened by indifference”), slightly undercutting earned resonance with faint prompt-echo phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: music as counter-prophecy, sound shaping reality, beauty as antidote to fear. Subtext operates through image—the mist remembering, dewdrops underscoring stillness—avoiding moralizing. Yet the final lines flirt with abstraction (“power of sound to shape reality”), risking pseudo-profundity. The resonance is haunting but leans on lyric repetition over conceptual repricing with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of transformation through attentive listening emerges organically from leaf-decoding and monument-building, avoiding moralizing. The final image—walking away guided by legacy—offers a non-literal answer to “how does one receive prophecy?” Yet subtext remains surface-level; “forgotten things” and “past meets prophecy” echo without deepening moral complexity. Resonance stems from atmosphere, not character struggle, limiting thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from object and action: timepieces, compass, and improvisation coalesce around embracing uncertainty. The final image—“uncertainly certain”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the phrase “beneath the ashes of his past” is stated but not dramatized, weakening integration. Subtext thrives in the compass’s glow and swirling leaves, avoiding overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—beauty in brokenness via kintsugi—emerges organically from image and metaphor, avoiding overt moralizing. The zodiac coin’s glow subtly reweights its meaning, supporting a non-literal resolution. However, insights lean toward pseudo-profundity (“weight of names,” “intricate web of connections”) without grounding in specific, dramatized experience. Subtext is consistent but risks abstraction over emotional honesty in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—finding joy within sorrow—emerges through the collector’s quiet ritual and the final hum countering discord. Subtext resides in the tooth (secret as burden) and harp (unresolved grief). However, the closing lines verge on thematic echo: “luminous ache” and “beacon of hope” flirt with pseudo-profundity. Resonance is earned through image, but the moral edges toward assertion in the last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (“mathematics of mercy”) emerges through concept but collapses into pseudo-profundity. The phrase itself—a diagnostic label-speak artifact—substitutes for earned insight. Final realization feels asserted, not resonant; the forest’s role is symbolic convenience, not organic development. Subtext is minimal; trauma and redemption are named, not embodied through ambiguity or counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—giving voice to the overlooked—emerges organically through imagery (fragmented lens, blurred figure, hidden paintings) rather than assertion. The final image reweights the city as a “canvas waiting to be filled,” offering non-literal resolution. However, the moral risks sentimentality; the story leans into reverence without counterpoint or ambiguity, softening its ethical complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—beauty in the forgotten, stories beneath surfaces—emerges organically through Ezra’s interactions with dust, ghosts, and the barrel. The ending reweights the circus’s “failure” as poignant legacy, offering a non-literal answer to “What is worth remembering?” without moralizing. However, the insight borders on familiar elegy; while resonant, it lacks the counter-readings or moral ambiguity that would elevate it beyond competent lyricism into exceptional thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of frost, print, and whisper, culminating in the non-literal insight that eternity resides in depth, not duration. The final image—a map of prints stretching to the infinite—reweights the premise without moralizing. However, the thematic arc leans heavily on lyrical assertion (“rustling awakenings,” “negotiable reality”) rather than conflict-tested wisdom. Subtext is rich but risks pseudo-profundity due to lack of concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: the act of reconstruction as redemption, imagination as bridge across temporal voids. The shard refracts both light and meaning, evolving from artifact to talisman to symbol of rebirth. Final lines avoid moralizing, offering instead a quiet CR—her world is “beauty, sorrow, and hope”—that reweights prior loss. Subtext thrives in ritual (covering mirrors) and silence, though the colleague’s anecdote leans slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence/sound and corrosion/restoration, avoiding moralizing. The final image—music as reclaimed light—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of mending the intangible. Recurring motifs (chip, rust, midnight) accumulate meaning without forced symbolism. However, the thematic insight leans close to pseudo-profundity (“mending what isn’t torn”) without grounding it in specific human struggle, slightly diluting emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of petrichor, compass, and lagoon—seeking mystery over explanation. The final unity offers a non-literal answer: truth resides in embodied resonance, not rational decoding. Subtext thrives in silence and sensory detail, avoiding moralizing. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward pseudo-profundity (“place where explanations fail”) without grounding in specific human limitation or loss, preventing 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of interconnectedness across time emerges organically through the lantern slide and driftwood sculpture, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image—a crafted object embodying ephemeral flotsam and ancient imagery—resonates non-literally with the “timewoven” concept. However, the phrase itself appears as abstract label rather than earned insight, and the epiphany leans toward pseudo-profundity (“hidden patterns waiting to be uncovered”). Subtext is present but diluted by declarative phrasing in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of light/dark, visibility/invisibility, and human perception versus natural mystery. The final image—Luna’s murals “shining like beacons” in autumn quiet—offers a non-literal answer: truth resides in tender attention to hidden rhythms. Avoids moralizing, though phrases like “intricate web of life” flirt with abstraction. Subtext thrives in the cathedral glass and postcards, which shift from inspiration to sacred relics.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (“truth beneath surfaces”) emerges through recurring images (lagoon, diary, debris messages), but it’s stated more than earned. The final paragraph moralizes (“secrets hidden for far too long”) rather than offering resonant subtext. Ada’s patterns hint at deeper history, yet their meaning stays vague, preventing conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers without emotional or intellectual payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of rebirth through reimagination emerges organically from the alchemist’s rejection of nostalgia, but the final paragraphs veer into assertion (“a new civilization was taking shape”) rather than resonant image. The amber bottle’s unopened state could symbolize unrealized potential, yet this tension is abandoned as the town transforms without friction. Subtext is muted by summary; the central question—can imagination alone revive a dead world?—is answered affirmatively without grappling with its implausibility or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—how archived emotion shapes future possibility—emerges through recurring images (wax cylinder, children’s joy, dead languages). The ending reweights the past as active force, not relic, avoiding moralizing. However, subtext remains atmospheric rather than interrogative; the scribe’s role as passive vessel limits thematic tension between preservation and intervention. Resonance is lyrical but lacks counter-readings or moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (“balance,” “cycle of life”) emerges through repeated motifs (acorn cap, egg, entropy) but devolves into explicit moralizing: “not the destination… but the journey,” “one seed at a time.” The final paragraph asserts resonance (“mysteries,” “infinite possibilities”) without earning it through character-specific struggle. Epiphanies feel unmoored from action—realizations about “passing down” knowledge arise from exposition, not dramatized choice. Subtext is drowned by declarative pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: true understanding comes through attentive listening, not warning. The bell’s resonance replaces sirens as both tool and symbol, reweighting the sanctuary’s relationship to weather from fear to harmony. Final image avoids moralizing, offering instead a quiet benediction that resonates with earlier motifs. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward sentimentality (“beauty in quiet moments”) without sufficient counter-tension, preventing full 9+ resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of stars, sweeping, and the lantern, avoiding overt moralizing. The paradox of “strength in vulnerability” is woven through imagery rather than stated didactically until the final paragraphs, where slight over-articulation (“testament to the power of vulnerability”) nudges toward sentimentality. Subtext operates in silence and gesture—the janitor’s lingering gaze, meditative sweeping—but the insight feels inherited rather than wrested from struggle. Resonance is muted by lack of counterpoint or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—memory as balm in desolation—emerges organically through objects (letters, honeycomb) and ghostly witnesses. Subtext operates in silence: tears fall while reading, ghosts lean in, suggesting collective yearning. But the ending moralizes faintly (“beauty to be found”), risking sentimentality. Resonance is earned through particulars, though the “tangled covenant” remains an undeveloped abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of timekeeping relics and a world without time, avoiding overt moralizing. The urn fragment’s shift from “relic” to “tangible link” offers subtle subtext about memory as continuity. However, the final paragraph drifts into abstraction (“beauty that was both haunting and profound”) that dilutes resonance. The core question—how to live when time loses meaning—is posed but not answered through action.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: transience (kite), art as participation (poem woven into world), and beauty in fragility (feather). The ending reweights the premise—art isn’t representation but co-creation—without moralizing. However, the insight borders on lyrical cliché (“woven dawns,” “threads of existence”), and the absence of counterpoint (e.g., doubt, failure) flattens complexity into affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of human-nature reciprocity emerges organically through the copper-wire network and flourishing ecosystem, avoiding overt moralizing. The diary and wire serve as resonant images that accumulate meaning, culminating in the final “gentle song” that implies enduring connection. However, the insight feels preordained rather than earned through struggle—no counterforce or ambiguity complicates the thesis. Subtext is consistent but lacks tension; the world affirms the caretaker’s belief without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through recurring motifs (amber, footprints, bronze quiet) and culminates in a non-literal reframing of pilgrimage as self-discovery. However, the insight borders on pseudo-profound abstraction (“chemistry of homecoming”) without grounding in specific human struggle. The final resonance leans on lyrical repetition rather than earned complexity, avoiding moral ambiguity or counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of ecological and historical healing emerges through recurring imagery (battlefield → garden, dead reef → blooming flowers). However, it leans into abstraction (“submerged concord,” “narrow vastness”) without grounding in human complexity or counterpoint. The moral—that dedication heals—is stated rather than interrogated; no ambiguity lingers. Final image offers beauty but not reconfiguration; prior material isn’t reweighted, only affirmed.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of finding beauty in desolation emerges organically through recurring images (wax leaf, spring, rust). The autumn leaf reweights from curiosity to symbol of latent life, culminating in the oasis. However, the final moral—“purpose in a torn-apart world”—edges toward assertion rather than pure resonance. Subtext is strong in setting and silence, but the message leans slightly toward sentimentality in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of finding direction in stillness emerges organically through stars, compass, and sketching, avoiding overt moralizing. However, the final image (“brighter tomorrow”) edges toward sentimentality, and the compass’s alignment reads as symbolic convenience rather than earned insight. Subtext is consistent but safe—embracing wonder without grappling with the cost of time dilation or true isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of wonder-as-duty emerges organically through imagery (celestial board, glowing sundial), but “sacred playfulness” is asserted, not dramatized. The final cerulean sky offers visual resonance but no conceptual repricing—it restores order without questioning the system. Avoids moralizing, yet the epiphany (“truly become an apprentice of wonder”) feels unearned due to absent struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the chessboard’s missing pawns and “small gestures,” avoiding overt moralizing. The phrase “luminous absence” resonates as conceptual repricing, reweighting loss as potential. However, the final paragraph drifts into abstraction (“a new story began to unfold”) that dilutes the earlier precision. Subtext operates through image rather than dialogue, but the historian’s motivation borders on prompt-like declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (“home as state of being,” “power of buried talents”) emerges through image but lacks tension or counterpoint. The final vision of a “threshold to new possibilities” offers hope without cost, avoiding complexity. Subtext is muted by abstract phrasing (“time after remembering becomes painful”) that gestures at depth without dramatizing conflict. Resonance is lyrical but unearned—more assertion than revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of weaving, time, and regret—the threads symbolize both failure and redemption without overt moralizing. The final image (village stirring, birdsong replacing hush) offers a non-literal answer: forgiveness restores temporal flow. Yet the insight borders on pseudo-profundity (“forgiveness is a journey, not a destination”) and leans on familiar tropes of labyrinths-as-soul-maps. Subtext is present but slightly diluted by declarative lines that edge toward prompt-like articulation in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from recurring images (refraction, mist, spire), avoiding direct moralizing until the final paragraphs, where it edges into abstraction (“truth at the heart of all creation”). The central question—can one forgive without forgetting?—is posed compellingly but resolved through declarative insight rather than character-tested ambiguity. Subtext lives in the mist’s behavior, yet the ending over-explains, diluting resonance with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through kintsugi as method and metaphor: brokenness holds hidden patterns. The rabbit’s foot and quilted memories avoid overt moralizing, though “conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion” edges toward abstraction. Final image—charm glinting in faint light—offers non-literal resonance, repricing fracture as sacred. However, the epiphany leans slightly declarative (“gift worth more than gold”), diluting subtextual restraint expected at elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of “temporary eternity” emerges through recurring imagery (sunset, seashell, cave glow) but collapses into abstraction in the final paragraph with phrases like “testament to the power of art.” The central question—can art preserve the ephemeral?—is answered declaratively rather than through resonant image or earned insight. Subtext is muted; the mirror crack hints at liberation but isn’t woven into thematic tension. Final lines moralize instead of implicating.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—quiet persistence over loud assertion—is coherent but delivered via assertion rather than emergence. The final paragraph moralizes (“he had discovered a truth…”) instead of letting resonance accrue from action. Recurring images (lighthouse, cork, garden) lack causal entanglement with the thematic question, reducing them to decorative echoes. Subtext is minimal; meaning is explained, not implied.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of relic, ruin, and ritual: rebuilding isn’t restoration but reconfiguration. The censer foot’s worn designs mirror the narrator’s own patchwork existence, and the final plain reframes loss as space for possibility—not moralizing, but resonant implication. However, phrases like “geography of loss” and “topography of memory” flirt with pseudo-profundity, slightly diluting subtext with near-labels. The ending avoids sentimentality, offering quiet acceptance that reweights earlier grief without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—empathy’s excess eroding individuality—emerges through backstory summary, not scene. The discredited textbook’s “cures” reframe emotional scarring, offering Conceptual Repricing, but it’s told, not shown. Final image of “fractured grace” resonates abstractly but lacks grounding in specific action that reweights prior events. Avoids moralizing, yet insight feels imported rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of memory as fragile, borrowed burden emerges organically through the Edelweiss and lighthouse imagery, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext resides in absence—the stranger’s unspoken past, the keeper’s silent witness—and the final image reweights isolation as both haunting and connective. Yet the theme remains abstract; without a concrete cost (e.g., Kael losing his own memory to absorb another’s), resonance stays lyrical rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of legacy and intuitive inheritance emerges through recurring objects (chip, maps), but leans on assertion (“father’s legacy lived on”) rather than subtext. The final note risks thematic echo by stating the promise’s fulfillment explicitly. Ambiguity is sacrificed for closure comfort; the journey feels symbolic without moral or existential friction. Resonance is muted by lack of counterpoint—no doubt, failure, or competing value challenges Emilia’s path.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme—reality fraying under cosmic omen—emerges through repeated images (starlight, fire, shadows) but remains abstract and unearned. The “truth” at the climax is withheld, preventing thematic payoff. Subtext is minimal; the queen’s sadness and disenchantment are named, not shown through gesture or silence. Final lines assert transformation (“she would never be the same”) without dramatizing the conceptual or emotional reweighting required for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of wonder in natural forms emerges organically through the spiral motif, but “palette of resolve” and “directed spontaneity” remain undeveloped abstractions. Subtext is thin; insights are stated (“uncovering hidden history”) rather than implied. Final paragraph moralizes (“reminder of the power…”) instead of offering resonant non-literal answer. Recurrence of “density of presence” feels terminological, not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of creativity transforming pain emerges organically from the act of writing, avoiding overt moralizing. However, insights (“distilled chaos into narrative,” “power of imagination”) verge on pseudo-profundity due to lack of concrete struggle. The recurring scroll motif reweights meaning slightly at closure, but “feral nostalgia” remains abstract, not earned through specific loss. Subtext is thin—reflection dominates over implication.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of finding sacredness in the mundane emerges through recurring imagery (clocks, screw, fog), but leans toward assertion (“make it sacred,” “reveal hidden beauty”) rather than earned resonance. The final paragraph moralizes instead of dramatizing; insight feels pre-packaged, not wrested from struggle. Subtext is thin—objects symbolize rather than complicate.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: stillness between turmoil as the crucible for creation, with scars transmuted via disciplined attention. The recurring “saturated hush” and breath motif reweight silence from emptiness to plenitude. However, the final paragraph verges on thematic assertion (“fragment of the divine”), slightly over-explaining what the images already convey. No false equivalence or moralizing, but resonance leans on lyricism more than character-driven revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of “imperfect miracles” emerges through recurring images—misplaced objects, whispered prayers, ethereal grit—but remains more stated than dramatized. The final image (trees swaying, Lyra vanishing into crowd) offers a quiet, non-literal answer about beauty in imperfection. However, the concept borders on pseudo-profound due to lack of concrete counterpoint or lived cost. Subtext is consistent but risks sentimentality in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of cosmic unity emerges through abstraction rather than particulars; “spiral arbitration” is named but not dramatized as lived philosophy. The final image offers no non-literal answer—only affirmation of balance restored. Recurring motifs (dictionary, hush) lack reweighting; their return feels decorative, not resonant. Avoids moralizing but substitutes pseudo-profundity for earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—time as construct vs. fundamental truth—emerges organically through image and ritual, avoiding direct moralizing. The mantle clock key and backward counting gesture toward inquiry, but the epiphany (“newfound clarity”) is asserted, not dramatized. Final resonance is muted because no conceptual repricing occurs: the shepherd’s understanding doesn’t alter their relationship to time or duty. Subtext is present but underdeveloped due to lack of friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (“interconnectedness”) emerges through recurring motifs (mushrooms, strangers, laser), but it’s stated outright in the final paragraph (“complex, interconnected web”) rather than revealed through resonant particulars. The insight reads like prompt-driven abstraction, not earned wisdom—pseudo-profundity replaces emotional honesty. Subtext is minimal; every idea is articulated explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—embracing paradox over seeking certainty—emerges through the subway graffito and probability theory, but leans on exposition (“lucid contradictions,” “complex interplay of factors”). The final image (lantern glowing brighter) suggests hope, yet avoids moralizing. However, the insight feels pre-packaged rather than earned through struggle; the father’s addiction is reframed intellectually, not transformed through lived friction.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of connection through anonymity emerges organically from setting and concept, avoiding overt moralizing. However, the final line—“taught endings how to begin”—veers into pseudo-profound abstraction without grounding in a specific, earned insight. The glass harmonica’s haunting beauty resonates, but subtext remains decorative rather than revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (“preserve small moments”) is stated repeatedly but not dramatized through consequence. The “haunted euphoria” tone substitutes for subtext, and the regenerated covenant remains a decorative phrase. The ending reiterates the premise without repricing it—no new insight emerges from the archivist’s actions. Sentimentality outweighs emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: cure for loneliness lies in reciprocal vulnerability, not magical objects. The moon rock’s demotion from talisman to forgotten token reframes the premise effectively. Yet the final paragraph risks moralizing (“world was just a little bit brighter… because of their actions”), edging toward sentimentality that slightly undermines the earned quietude of Raven’s departure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—inner harmony mirroring cosmic order—emerges organically through recurring motifs (music, light, skin-as-canvas). The final image reweights the journey as introspective pilgrimage, not cartographic conquest. However, the epiphany borders on pseudo-profound (“hidden harmonies of the universe”) without grounding in specific emotional consequence. Subtext thrives in sensory detail, but the moral risks sentimentality by equating discovery with healing without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: history as editable narrative, failure as generative. The pen’s restoration reweights the garden’s weeds from mistake to catalyst, offering a non-literal answer to “why events unfold as they do.” Avoids moralizing, though leans toward tidy resolution (“mending the fabric of her own reality”). Subtext resides in object use, not exposition, but lacks counter-readings or moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of memory and voice emerges through recurring motifs but collapses into abstraction: “joyful sorrow,” “music remains,” etc., read as lyrical assertions rather than earned insights. The final paragraph moralizes (“even in forgetfulness, there is beauty”) instead of trusting the image. Subtext is drowned by explicit thematic labeling, especially in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges through recurring images (tapestry, vandalism, art as preservation) but collapses into explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs (“a tale of art, of love… unbreakable bonds”). The ending asserts resonance rather than earning it through scene, violating the “no sermonizing” rule. Subtext is minimal—every symbolic element is narratively labeled (“symbol of the journey,” “testament to transformative power”), leaving no room for ambiguity or reader discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of sound, light, and memory, avoiding moralizing. The final image—Aria walking away with vibrations “remaining with her”—offers a non-literal answer: connection persists beyond physical presence. However, the theme leans on familiar tropes (collective unconscious, fragile memories) without subverting or complicating them. “Auroral sorrow” gestures toward bittersweet beauty but lacks counter-readings or moral ambiguity to deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: quiet communication outlasts noise, reinforced by setting (echoing containers), objects (coin, key), and action (whispered dialogue). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—validation through encounter, not declaration—avoiding moralizing. However, the insight leans toward platitude (“quietest voices travel farthest”) without complicating counter-readings or social cost. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, but the thematic payoff feels slightly preordained rather than wrested from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of “silent empathy” emerges texturally but collapses into abstraction (“teach darkness the value of stars”). The final star imagery offers a literal, not resonant, answer—moralizing replaces earned insight. Recurring motifs (mirror, shutters) lack reweighting; they’re repeated, not transformed. Subtext drowns in declarative phrasing (“testament to stillwater tension”) that tells rather than implies.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme emerges through repeated phrases (“amplified quiet,” “second thoughts”) but collapses into prompt-like assertions rather than earned subtext. The final paragraph moralizes (“knowing that the humble rebellion would continue to flourish”) instead of offering resonant ambiguity. Core concept lacks complexity—rebellion succeeds effortlessly, avoiding ethical tension or counter-readings. Recurring images (cradle, mist) aren’t reweighted by action; they’re decorative echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from Kael’s journey: freedom as shedding imposed identity. The scrimshaw’s transformation from heirloom to testament supports this, and the final image avoids moralizing. However, the insight (“island as state of being”) arrives as epiphany rather than earned wisdom, leaning on lyrical assertion over dramatized struggle, slightly undercutting emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of mandated joy, ecological abandonment, and performative narration. The dried bouquet reweights beauty as transient yet enduring through memory, and the turbines become ironic sentinels of failed utopia. Final image—a whisper outlasting steel—offers a non-literal answer to whether art transcends collapse. Avoids moralizing, though “remade hush” borders on label-speak; resonance stems from concrete particulars, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—art as boundary-dissolving revelation—emerges organically through image and rhythm, avoiding moralizing. The quartz colonnade’s pulse mirrors creative awakening, and the “lantern-moth hush” evokes fragile inspiration. However, the insight feels preordained rather than earned; Lyra encounters no counter-force or doubt that complicates the thesis. Subtext is lyrical but thin on friction.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through image and motif but leans on explicit labels (“bartered awakenings,” “beauty in imperfection”). The final paragraph moralizes rather than trusts subtext. While the concertina reed gains symbolic weight, its meaning isn’t earned through struggle—it’s assigned. The piece invites reflection but offers a tidy, sentimental resolution that avoids ambiguity or counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of interconnectedness emerges through recurring motifs (sound, light, lens), but remains abstract and unchallenged. The ending offers no non-literal answer—only affirmation (“music swelled... sense of wonder”). No moral ambiguity, counter-readings, or conceptual repricing; insight feels preordained, not earned. Subtext is muted by declarative phrasing (“journey of self-discovery”) that borders on prompt-language.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—beauty emerging from desolation—emerges organically through recurring images: the flower stencil, filigree brooch, and rippling curtains all refract the core metaphor without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: creation itself becomes the act of blooming, embodied in the maker’s quiet smile and departing step. Subtext thrives in silence—the unspoken dialogue between stars and craft—and avoids sentimentality by tying transcendence to labor. However, the phrase “teach withering to bloom again” edges toward prompt-like abstraction, slightly diluting the otherwise earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of hidden patterns beneath chaos emerges organically through cartomancy as metaphor, avoiding overt moralizing. However, insights remain abstract (“complex dance of cause and effect”) and aren’t earned through concrete struggle. The final image—a smiling cartomancer descending into crowd—offers no resonant reweighting; it affirms rather than complicates the premise. Subtext is consistent but thin, lacking counter-readings or emotional aftereffect beyond wistful wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—knowledge intertwined with nostalgic longing—emerges organically through the pagoda and manuscript. The final insight avoids moralizing, offering instead a resonant reconfiguration: truth carries sorrow. However, “atoms of nostalgia” reads more as poetic metaphor than integrated concept, and the refrain of “anguished joy” borders on thematic echo without deepening ambiguity or counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of shared dreams, archival observation, and the stone as vessel of memory. The final CR—that darkness is born from within—reweights the premise without moralizing. However, resonance leans on established tropes (library as beacon, stone as talisman) without subverting or deepening them through specific human contradiction. Subtext is consistent but safe, avoiding the messy ambiguity that would elevate it beyond competent lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through recurring motifs (shedding, fragility, stillness), but subtext is overwhelmed by on-the-nose articulation: “fragile convictions,” “balance self-respect and compassion,” “deeper truth.” The chameleon symbolizes adaptation, yet its function is illustrative, not generative—the insight precedes the image. Final paragraph moralizes (“source of peace and purpose”) rather than offering resonant ambiguity. Earned wisdom is asserted, not discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of hidden narratives in mundane traces (scars, coffee rings) emerges organically but remains abstract. The final image—“stories in the scars begin to unfurl”—resonates lyrically but offers no conceptual repricing or moral ambiguity. Insights feel unearned; the “displaced miracle” is named but not interrogated. Subtext relies on repeated motifs rather than dramatized revelation, drifting toward pseudo-profundity without concrete emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of film, letters, and music as vessels for unresolved emotion. The final insight—that forgotten love resonates eternally—reweights the premise without moralizing. However, the epiphany leans toward abstraction (“enduring power of love”) rather than grounding in specific human contradiction. Subtext is rich in imagery but risks sentimentality in its universalized resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—creativity unlocked through cosmic attunement—emerges organically from imagery and ritual. The recurring stardust motif shifts from memory to guiding trail, offering quiet resonance. But the ending moralizes implicitly (“the universe was always speaking…”), edging toward pseudo-profundity. Subtext is consistent yet lacks complexity; doubt dissolves too cleanly, avoiding meaningful ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of rebirth from ruin emerges through recurring images (clock, dune, ashes), avoiding direct moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: frozen time becomes rhythm, charred world blooms. Yet resonance leans on lyrical assertion rather than character-driven insight. Subtext is present but not deepened by conflict or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—mind as frontier—emerges organically through the gear and rainforest imagery, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image reweights the setting as internal catalyst, offering non-literal resonance. But insights feel inherited (“probable miracles”) rather than earned through struggle; pseudo-profundity edges in with phrases like “merge with the universe.” Ambiguity lingers, yet lacks counter-readings or ethical tension.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of latent courage emerges through recurring motifs (star stamp, ridgeway, vigil), but remains abstract and untested. The final image suggests transformation without dramatizing its price or mechanism, leaning into pseudo-profundity (“unused courage waiting to be claimed”). Subtext is muted by declarative phrasing like “reservoir of strength,” which borders on thematic echo. Resonance is atmospheric, not earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through repetition of silence, dust, and snow, but collapses into abstraction (“cost of safety,” “frostbitten hope”) rather than earned insight. The final paragraph moralizes: “silence was no longer oppressive… a reminder of their strength”—a declarative resolution that replaces resonance with assertion. Subtext is minimal; silence is labeled, not shown through gesture or omission. The piano bench moment hints at shared burden but isn’t woven into thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of truth’s quiet persistence emerges through Kael’s annotations and the rune of drift as metaphor for destabilizing falsehood. The final image—library as beacon—resonates without moralizing. However, the rune concept remains underdeveloped, reducing thematic depth. Subtext relies on atmospheric implication rather than character-driven friction, limiting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of listening to the ocean’s rhythms emerges organically through drumming and observation, avoiding overt moralizing. The torn atlas and vanishing paths suggest impermanence and hidden knowledge, resonating with post-fossil-fuel recovery. However, the final insight (“truth in rhythms, not maps”) leans toward pseudo-profundity without grappling with real cost or ambiguity. Subtext is present but soft—more atmospheric echo than charged reconfiguration of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning isn’t found but reignited through resonance with ancient, silent forces. The opera glasses shift from relic to lens of possibility, refracting stars into a “celestial map”—a resonant, non-literal answer to chaos. Yet the final paragraph flirts with abstraction (“hidden patterns waiting to be unlocked”), risking pseudo-profundity. Still, subtext thrives in image over assertion, avoiding moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme (“evolve tradition with intent”) is asserted, not emergent. The embryo symbolizes potential but isn’t woven into conflict—its retrieval feels ceremonial, not consequential. Final lotus-blooming image offers pseudo-profundity without moral complexity or ambiguity. Subtext is drowned by declarative lines like “implanted destiny unfolding within her.”

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of twisted trees and inner fracture, culminating in the photograph’s physical smoothing as metaphor for healing. The final image reweights the arboretum from desolation to refuge without moralizing. However, the epiphany edges toward abstraction (“beacon of light in the darkness”) and the central concept—“pearl of stillness”—feels imported rather than earned through concrete struggle, slightly marring thematic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme emerges coherently—art transforms fragmented reality—but is stated through rhetorical questions and lyrical assertions rather than dramatized conflict. The final image reweights the tarot box as symbol, yet this shift feels decorative, not consequential. Subtext is minimal; the “luminescent ache” is repeated like a motif checklist without evolving meaning. Ambiguity is present but unearned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of ephemeral knowledge and temporal perception emerges organically through ink patterns and eclipse imagery. Subtext resides in the drone’s constancy versus human transience. However, the final dialogue—“Kael wove a tale of patterns and time”—edges into thematic summarization, risking pseudo-profundity. Resonance is earned through image (ink-fading aura) but slightly undercut by explanatory closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of silenced truth emerges but collapses into assertion (“gave voice to a silence”) rather than resonant image. The final paragraph moralizes (“symbol of the turmoil and transformation”) instead of letting subtext accrue from action. Recurring motifs (snow, echoes) lack reweighting—they decorate rather than deepen the central question about historical accountability.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of peace as active cultivation emerges organically through image and action, avoiding overt moralizing. The “engraved quiet” and repurposed wreckage suggest resilience without stating it. However, the final paragraph edges toward abstraction (“beacon in the darkness,” “brighter future”) that dilutes resonance. The strongest subtext lies in the sandbag-turned-planter—a quiet testament to transformation—but the sword’s symbolism remains under-interrogated, leaning toward convenient contrast rather than complex inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as carrier of meaning, reality blurred by pattern breaks, listening as active creation. The “feral lullaby” reframes silence not as absence but as charged presence. Final constellation pattern offers non-literal answer—magic occurs when one voices silence and patterns fracture. Avoids moralizing; subtext lives in gesture (signing emotions) and object (rail spike), though epiphany leans slightly toward assertion in “secrets of the universe.”

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of truth vs. legacy emerges through recurring motifs (“orbits of regret,” pen nib), but the final image offers moralizing summary (“Wychwood name synonymous with truth”) rather than resonant, non-literal reweighting. Insights feel inherited from prompt rather than earned through struggle; the pen’s “otherworldly glow” veers into symbolic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—guilt, memory, and art as healing—emerges organically through recurring images (amber, constellations, cries), but borders on overstatement in the closing lines (“sound of baby cries… spoke of new beginnings”). The meteor hush and constellation tattoos offer resonant, non-literal answers to the central question of dissonance, yet the resolution leans toward sentimentality. Subtext operates well in objects, though the epiphany feels slightly unearned by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—meaning arising from chaos—emerges organically through sand, mist, and hush, avoiding overt moralizing. The mandala’s impermanence mirrors inner flux, and “listen deeply” reframes perception as practice. Yet the insight arrives via external talisman (tile), not struggle, weakening earned wisdom. Final peace feels unearned because the “mess” incurs no tangible cost, softening thematic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of “aberrant mercy” emerges through image and gesture, particularly the tessera as a symbol of fragile beauty amid ruin. However, the concept is stated outright (“thoughts turned to the concept of aberrant mercy”) and echoed didactically, veering into prompt-like articulation. The ending offers quiet resonance but borders on moralizing (“testament to the transformative power…”). Subtext is undercut by explicit thematic labeling, reducing ambiguity and emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—redemption through memory reintegration—emerges organically from Echo’s synesthetic recollections and the tarot coin’s symbolism. The final image (coin “smiling,” garden slumbering) offers a non-literal answer: peace through acceptance, not restoration. Avoids moralizing, embracing bittersweet ambiguity. However, the theme leans on familiar tropes of ghostly unfinished business without subverting or complicating them through specific moral calculus or counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of art-science unity emerges through recurring imagery (geode, light, fractals), but leans into pseudo-profound abstraction (“collective unconscious,” “willowglass hope”) without grounding in human-scale conflict. The final painting symbolizes insight but lacks conceptual repricing—prior material isn’t reweighted, only affirmed. Subtext is thin; resonance relies on lyrical assertion rather than earned ambiguity or moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of bridging past/present via transitional objects is stated but not dramatized through conflict or cost. The elm fossil recurs but doesn’t accrue new meaning through use or loss. Final image affirms purpose without ambiguity or counterpoint, leaning into sentimentality (“trusted companion,” “at peace”). Subtext is absent; insights are told, not earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of shared wisdom emerges organically through recurring images (sands, buttons, echo) and avoids moralizing. The final reconfiguration—prophecy as living narrative—reweights prior material without stating a thesis. However, insights verge on pseudo-profundity (“alchemy of shared wisdom”) and lack grounding in specific human conflict, softening emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme (“fixing what’s broken”) emerges through image (burned skin, pillbox, mirrored self) but collapses into declarative sentimentality in the final paragraph (“world full of possibility”). The doppelgänger offers a literalized metaphor rather than subtextual resonance. While the pillbox symbolizes balance, its recurrence feels ornamental, not transformative. The story tells us courage was “unused” and now “found,” but shows no struggle to activate it—undercutting thematic weight with unearned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of layered meaning and distilled truth emerges organically through the needle-threading ritual and palimpsest metaphor, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image—stepping into a “fresh and new” world—offers a non-literal answer to the question of revelation through patience. However, the insight feels preordained rather than wrested from conflict; both characters share identical understanding without friction. Subtext resides in objects and silence, but the thematic payoff leans on lyricism over dramatic consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—kindness as a preservative force in place—emerges organically through image and setting, avoiding direct moralizing. The lantern glass reweights meaning by story’s end, embodying “sharp gentleness.” However, the insight borders on pseudo-profound abstraction (“phototropic response to love”) without grounding in human conflict or consequence. Resonance is poetic but emotionally weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of quiet guardianship emerges organically through recurring images (light, petals, tooth), avoiding moralizing. The final image—pruned rosebush at dawn—offers a non-literal answer about resilience and cyclical care. However, subtext borders on ornamental; the lockmaster motif feels tacked-on symbolism rather than earned resonance. Emotional aftereffect is gentle but risks sentimentality due to absence of friction or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of fragile continuity between past and present emerges organically through image (sundial, stone circle, auks), avoiding overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph drifts into summary (“weave a new narrative… honor the memories”) that edges toward prompt-like abstraction. The sundial’s promise resonates, but the epiphany lacks the specific, non-literal reweighting required for 9+—it affirms rather than interrogates the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning arises through shared creation, not solitary revelation. The final image—Lena walking away with the twig while the temple endures—offers a non-literal answer to her quest, reweighting “connection” as co-constructed. Avoids moralizing, though “prismatic quiet” borders on pseudo-profundity. Resonance stems from concrete particulars (nest, light installation), not abstraction, though the epiphany risks sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme remains abstract (“harmony vs. trickery”) without emerging from concrete particulars or moral ambiguity. The final image repeats setup motifs without reweighting them—charts “now seemed significant” is summary, not resonance. No counter-reading or complexity lingers; the piece defaults to tidy moral alignment without earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—wisdom as structural insight rather than artifact—emerges coherently from the crystal’s revelation. The final image reweights the quest: the “key” was perception, not possession. However, the thematic statement borders on pseudo-profound (“underlying structure of the universe”) without grounding in character-specific struggle. Subtext is muted; the organ’s melody hints at connection but isn’t woven into moral or existential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of art, investigation, and masks, avoiding overt moralizing. The ribbon evolves from curiosity to symbol of multifaceted identity, and the portrait becomes a vessel for mutual awakening. However, the final insight—that truth is self-understanding—edges close to prompt-like articulation (“truth they had been seeking was not just about solving cases…”). Subtext thrives in silence and brushwork, but the last paragraph risks over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of inherited legacy and hidden patterns emerges organically through journals and the nail, but the “reversible exile” remains cryptic rather than resonant. Subtext is implied via coded stanzas, yet the ending offers no non-literal answer—only continued searching. The piece avoids moralizing but also avoids revelation; ambiguity lingers without conceptual repricing or emotional aftereffect beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of redemption through art emerges organically from imagery (fiddle, glass flake, mist), avoiding overt moralizing. However, the central question (“Can secrets be transformed into possibility?”) receives a literal answer (“music had been the key”) rather than a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration. The repeated phrase “sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’” edges into thematic echo, and the ending leans on assertion (“testament to the power of art”) rather than earned ambiguity. Subtext remains thin beneath lyrical surface.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme—value in journey over destination—emerges coherently but is over-articulated in final paragraphs (“the value of a journey lay not in its destination…”), crossing into moralizing. The foreign money and territorial markers gesture toward subtext but are summarized, not dramatized. Insights feel derived from prompt logic rather than earned struggle, yielding pseudo-profundity over emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of shared burdens emerges organically through Lyra’s work, the telegram token, and temple inscriptions, avoiding moralizing. The final image—stars illuminating darkness “one star at a time”—offers resonant, non-literal closure that reweights isolation into connectedness. However, the concept borders on abstraction; insights verge on pseudo-profundity (“world bathed in new light”) without grounding in specific human friction. Subtext operates through objects and silence, but the epiphany feels slightly too tidy for the complexity claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—mirrors hide soul-truths—emerges cleanly but borders on prompt-as-moral. The cracked mirror reweights the premise (CR), yet the insight (“not a physical reflection, but a glimpse into the soul”) reads like thematic echo, not earned wisdom. Subtext is thin; the flesh-eating seed and expanding circles gesture at complexity but remain ornamental, not integrated into the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme gestures toward hidden patterns and liminal knowledge but collapses into vague mysticism (“blueprint waiting to be deciphered”). The final paragraph moralizes rather than resonates, asserting “the world is full of hidden pathways” instead of earning insight through action. No counter-reading or complexity emerges; the piece affirms curiosity without testing its limits or costs.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—self-imposed entrapment and rebirth through symbolic ritual—emerges organically from the Eight of Swords and orchard imagery. However, the ending moralizes (“lessons of the catacomb orchard”) rather than trusting subtext, and the transformation lacks counterbalance or ambiguity. The card’s reprisal resonates, but the insight borders on pseudo-profound without grounding in specific human cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of finding voice in silence emerges, but it’s stated outright in the final lines (“silence was no longer deafening, but a symphony of possibilities”) rather than resonating through image or action. The grille cloth motif recurs but doesn’t accrue new meaning—it merely triggers nostalgia. Subtext is minimal; insights read as asserted wisdom (“sometimes, it’s in the quiet moments…”) rather than earned through struggle. Ambiguity is sacrificed for tidy uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically: interconnectedness as cosmic principle, revealed through cuneiform wisdom and analogical thinking. The CR ending reweights prior elements—the seed, arbor, spirit—as nodes in a web. However, the insight borders on prompt-like abstraction (“relationships between them”) without grounding in specific human cost. Subtext is muted; the story tells its theme clearly but avoids moral ambiguity or counter-readings. Resonance is intellectual, not emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—identity as fluid, wonder in routine—emerges organically from recurring images (tides, creel, moon), but risks collapsing into pseudo-profundity due to lack of dramatic friction. The final line (“wonder had become the only constant”) borders on thematic echo, though it’s slightly redeemed by the creel’s symbolic evolution. Subtext is present in the blend of mechanical/organic, yet the absence of cost or contradiction weakens resonance. Theme is coherent but untested.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—human connection through shared emotional vessels—emerges organically from pearl and shell imagery, avoiding direct moralizing. However, insight arrives via exposition (“the power to connect… lay within”) rather than earned struggle, leaning into pseudo-profundity. Subtext is thin; objects symbolize rather than complicate. The ending reweights the premise (pearl as beacon), but conceptual cost is vague (“world seems too dark”) without specific social or personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges through recurring motifs (map, ivy, accordion), but the central insight—“forgiveness is a map, not a destination”—is stated verbatim in graffiti and repeated twice more, violating the “Thematic Echo” penalty. Subtext is minimal; ideas are asserted rather than revealed through gesture or silence. The ending reiterates rather than reweights the premise, offering comfort without conceptual or emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: unspoken words as both burden and revelation, with the library symbolizing internalized silence. The final insight—that the destination is a state of being—is resonant and avoids moralizing. Yet the thematic weight relies on lyrical assertion (“words took on a life of their own”) rather than earned struggle, and the personal/universal duality remains vague, lacking specific human friction to ground its universality.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.1)
    “Perforated destiny” is named but not explored through event or image—it functions as jargon, not theme. The story gestures toward moral complexity (empire vs. dream) but resolves nothing, offering only lyrical assertion. Final lines restate ambition without repricing earlier material or delivering a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of mortality, artistry, and cosmic beauty, avoiding moralizing. The emerald chip’s transformation reweights the premise: beauty can be preserved beyond death, altering the meaning of “stillness.” The final image—a softly pulsing beacon in darkness—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether transcendence requires abandonment, embracing ambiguity without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme emerges texturally through the cycle of rebirth and the hairpin as symbol, but it’s stated outright (“symbol of the eternal cycle”) rather than earned through action. The final paragraph moralizes (“peace that would remain with her forever”) instead of offering resonant subtext. While the hairpin’s reprisal reweights meaning slightly, the thematic arc lacks friction—forgiveness and contentment arrive without struggle, reducing complexity to platitude. No counter-readings or ambiguity linger; the piece opts for tidy affirmation over honest inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—nuance over binary certainty—emerges organically through the conscience’s role and the cloak metaphor, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext operates via recurring images (mirror, chimes, cloak) that resist tidy resolution. However, the final paragraph veers toward abstraction (“complexities that lay just beneath the surface”), diluting resonance. The core insight is sound but leans on conceptual assertion rather than earned emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of “delayed revelation” is stated, not earned through conflict. The pond metaphor substitutes for subtext, reducing insight to illustration. Final “flower opening” epiphany reads as pseudo-profound abstraction, not resonant reconfiguration. No moral ambiguity or counter-readings—wisdom arrives prepackaged, not wrestled from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of stillness-as-movement emerges organically through recurring images (dust, echoes, resonance), avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext resides in the arrowhead’s transformation from relic to key, suggesting history as living pattern. Yet the insight remains abstract—“hidden patterns that govern reality”—without grounding in specific human (or skimmer) cost. Final resonance leans lyrical over consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically from image and setting: the sacred in simplicity versus algorithmic art. The keystone’s glow reweights this idea visually, avoiding moralizing. But the insight (“sacred is simple”) borders on platitude, and the world below’s automation remains a backdrop, not a lived counterforce. Subtext is present but under-pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of synesthetic revelation (“color of sound”) emerges through image but remains abstract and untested. The “luminous vows” suggest sacred promise, yet their moral or emotional weight is never dramatized. Final insight—that perception transcends surface—is stated, not earned through conflict. No counter-readings or ambiguity linger; the epiphany feels imposed rather than discovered through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of cosmic alignment through esoteric ritual emerges but remains abstract, relying on phrases like “wavelength align with purpose” rather than earned insight from concrete struggle. The backwards prophecy concept invites reflection but isn’t interrogated—its logic is accepted, not tested. Final resonance is atmospheric, not conceptual; the story offers mood over meaning, avoiding moral complexity or counter-readings in favor of serene acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of sacrifice, memory, and naming the unknown. The final image—the empty atlas page whispering a single name—offers a non-literal answer: giving voice to fear transforms it into intimate legacy. Avoids moralizing; embraces ambiguity (“distant intimacy”) while resisting false equivalence. Recurring sea monsters reweight from terror to testament, charging closure without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of fragile faith made whole emerges organically through the bell’s transformation, avoiding overt moralizing. The final toll offers a non-literal answer: devotion can be renewed through patient care. However, “cosmic imbalance” and “plausible impossibility” verge on pseudo-profundity, and the insight lacks counterweight or ambiguity—everything aligns neatly. Subtext is present but softened by absence of real conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of memory-as-healing emerges through recurring motifs (label, photographs, wind chime), but subtext collapses into assertion: “to spin stories into shared meaning” reads as prompt language, not earned insight. The ending moralizes rather than resonates, offering platitudes about beauty in darkness without complicating counter-readings or concrete emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of science and wonder, embodied in Elara’s alchemy and the starlings’ chaos-as-pattern. The final image—crystal stored, work resumed—offers a non-literal answer: harmony lies in ongoing pursuit, not resolution. However, near-thematic statements (“harmony she sought was within reach”) flirt with abstraction, slightly undercutting subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of vigilance and trust emerges through recurring motifs (buckle, burden, stars), but leans on assertion (“watcher’s burden,” “trust placed in her”) rather than dramatized ambiguity. The ending offers quiet resonance but borders on moralizing summary (“foundation upon which future successes would be built”). Subtext is muted; the buckle symbolizes journey but doesn’t complicate meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of selfhood beyond duplication emerges but drowns in diagnostic abstraction (“ego death,” “complementary opposites”). The brain-in-jar motif recurs but doesn’t evolve in meaning—it’s observed, not engaged. Final insight (“he was free to be himself”) states rather than embodies thematic resolution. Subtext is buried under meta-commentary instead of emerging from action.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—mystery as catalyst for creativity—emerges organically from the seed motif and the proprietor’s response. The final image (seed beside desk) resonates as symbol without moralizing. Yet the theme lacks complexity: curiosity leads seamlessly to innovation, with no counterforce (fear, doubt, failure). The corpse flower’s real-world rarity and decay associations are underused; its symbolic potential remains decorative, not interrogated. Subtext is present but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (“tending to the unspoken”) is named directly rather than emerging from action, tipping into pseudo-profundity. The final paragraph moralizes (“a tale of love, loss, and the power of music”) instead of trusting the haunting melody to resonate. Subtext is drowned by assertion, though the bittersweet tone offers mild emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of light/dark, knowledge/ignorance, and interior/exterior, avoiding direct moralizing. The pendant’s transformation from trophy to key subtly reweights the central question. However, the insight—that uncertainty can be befriended—feels asserted rather than dramatized through struggle. The final image resonates but lacks the conceptual cost needed for true repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of creative destruction emerges organically through the crozier’s transformation, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image—a twisted, beautiful artifact—offers non-literal resonance, reweighting ruin as potential. However, subtext remains surface-level; the alchemist’s internal arc mirrors theme too neatly without counter-readings or ambiguity. Insight feels inherited from premise rather than earned through specific, costly experience on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of finding beauty in decay emerges through imagery but collapses into abstraction (“magic beyond perception,” “art of discovery is lifelong”). The final paragraph moralizes rather than resonates, stating the lesson outright. Recurring motifs (star fragment, hush) lack transformation—they’re repeated, not reweighted. Epiphanies feel imported, not earned through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme (“interconnected patterns governing the universe”) is asserted through exposition rather than emerging from concrete action. The hourglass and grotto markings gesture toward resonance but aren’t reweighted by the ending, which offers no non-literal answer to the central question. Final lines lean into pseudo-profundity (“permanent transient-ness,” “merge with the cosmos”) instead of earned ambiguity rooted in specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from recurring images (thread, distortion, memory shift) and avoids moralizing. “Rational enchantment” resonates as a non-literal answer to the desire for unity beneath chaos. However, the epiphany lacks counterweight or ambiguity—it affirms without complication, softening thematic tension. Still, the final image reweights earlier motifs with quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme—humanity’s adaptive wonder in the face of cosmic mystery—emerges through recurring images (anchor chain, starlight) but resolves into near-moralizing abstraction (“beacon of hope,” “illuminate the future”). The anchor’s symbolic shift from relic to emblem is noted but not earned through character action. Final paragraph asserts resonance (“future is bright”) rather than implying it through particulars, bordering on sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—memory as living presence—emerges through the photograph and hearing aid, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture (tears, hand-holding). However, the final line (“incidental heroism that lay just beyond the edge of perception”) veers into thematic labeling, slightly undercutting earned resonance. The concept resists tidy closure but leans on familiar tropes of ghostly mediation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of honoring the forgotten emerges through Lyra’s quest and final peace, avoiding overt moralizing. The “crashing hush” reweights silence as connection, offering subtle resonance. However, insights feel asserted (“felt a deep connection,” “sense of responsibility”) rather than earned through struggle. No counter-readings or ambiguity complicate the reverence for lost researchers, leaning toward sentimental closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—wisdom from failure, not truth—emerges organically through the shift from seeking secrets to accepting solace. The porcelain shard’s glow reweights transience as transformation, not loss. However, the final paragraph borders on thematic echo (“midnight solace that lay just beyond the edge of reality”), risking pseudo-profundity. Subtext thrives in image (shard falling like snowflakes), but the ghost’s whispered “heartbeats of the universe” leans into abstraction over concrete emotional consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: art as preservation across linguistic death, with imperfection (the flawed diamond) as conduit. The final image—a new language born of texture and pattern—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the insight borders on stated (“testament to the power of art to transcend even death”), slightly undercutting subtextual restraint in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme (“finding humor in darkness”) is articulated directly rather than emerging from action; the final line moralizes (“armed with her quirky sense of humor”) instead of resonating through image. “Harmony untamed” is repeated as motif but never reweighted by character choice or consequence. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into tidy optimism without counter-readings or meaningful ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: music as antidote to mechanization. The locust shell and sky-bridge evolve from symbols to charged emblems of fragile renewal. Final image—Luna walking with shell and lingering music—offers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Yet the theme leans on familiar binaries (organic vs. mechanical), lacking counter-readings or moral complexity to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—redemption through connection amid broken promises—emerges organically from the mailman’s desire and the storm-bottle’s symbolism. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly (“beacon of hope,” “tempest of hope and redemption”), violating the “no sermonizing” rule and flattening ambiguity. The bottle’s reweighting—from contained fury to vessel of healing—is resonant but unearned, as no prior beat interrogates the nature of promises or their repair. Subtext drowns in declarative abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—finding hope in silence—emerges organically through image and atmosphere rather than exposition. The carousel horse embodies the “misting hush,” offering a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the theme borders on sentimentality due to lack of counter-pressure or moral complexity; silence is uniformly redemptive, never threatening or empty. The final lullaby reinforces rather than challenges the premise, softening thematic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: stories as living entities sustained by human attention. The final image—scarf shimmering, librarian at peace—resonates without moralizing. However, the insight borders on familiar (“stories need caretakers”), and the resolution offers comfort over complexity. Subtext is present but leans toward lyrical affirmation rather than probing ambiguity or counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically from recurring motifs—light, absence, longing—but remains abstract, circling around ineffability without a resonant, non-literal answer at closure. The “cipher” concept invites reflection but resolves into atmospheric repetition rather than reweighted meaning. Emotional aftereffect is muted by the absence of cost; wonder is asserted, not earned through struggle. Subtext relies on lyrical assertion over implication in gesture or silence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—liberating hidden ideas as cosmic participation—emerges organically through image and action rather than statement. The lock of hair as memory vessel and its release as environmental transformation avoid moralizing. However, the final shimmering light leans toward sentimentality without counterbalance or ambiguity; no competing interpretation challenges the act’s benevolence. Subtext is consistent but lacks friction—fear is named but never dramatized as active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—memory, perception, and the lure of the unknown—emerges through imagery but leans toward abstraction (“unlocking doors of perception”). The fairy ring and stars suggest liminal knowledge, yet the thematic payoff is deferred to an off-page future, weakening resonance. No moral is stated, but the lack of on-page consequence prevents the final image from reweighting prior material with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: exile, resilience, and quiet mentorship coalesce through the interplay of shadow, tea leaves, and backward-walking. The final image—a smile, an empty cup, a breath-held library—offers a non-literal answer: healing begins in witness, not rescue. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (will the soul return?). However, the thematic payoff leans slightly on established tropes of librarians-as-saviors, lacking a fully destabilizing insight to push into 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of renewal through creativity emerges texturally but collapses into sentimentality: “the world whispered a gentle thank you.” The final image affirms hope without ambiguity or counterweight, offering moral reassurance over resonant complexity. Recurring motifs (seed, color, weaving) are present but don’t accrue pressure—they decorate rather than reconfigure meaning. No conceptual repricing occurs; the premise remains unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as active force, restoration as spiritual mediation. The final image—the needle vibrating with residual energy, the hush following her—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether the past can be healed. Yet near-moralizing phrases (“testament to the restorer’s art,” “power of silence”) flirt with abstraction, slightly undercutting subtextual purity in the closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—silence as a language of hidden truths—emerges organically through map-framing, stone, and rain. Subtext resides in gaps: what isn’t said, shown, or known. The ending reweights cartography as empathic listening, not just measurement. However, the insight borders on pseudo-profundity (“language that spoke directly to her soul”) without grounding in specific human cost or moral ambiguity, softening its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the snow globe’s emptying, the logbook’s cryptic warning, and the reframing of surrender—not as loss but fluidity. The final line (“snow in the globe”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Avoids moralizing, though the phrase “physics of letting go” flirts with pseudo-profundity. Subtext thrives in silence and image, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—creative expression as bridge between ephemeral and eternal—emerges organically through image and action, not declaration. The recurring motifs (mist, code, flower press) accrue meaning, and the final mural reweights the premise: silence can be spoken. Subtext thrives in the ghost’s hum and the balladeer’s charcoal strokes. Yet the closing line verges on thematic echo (“tinkersong wonder that would linger”), slightly undercutting earned resonance with near-labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of ice, light, and encrypted text, suggesting that beauty resides in the fusion of joy and sorrow. The shrine chamber offers a resonant image of enduring connection, avoiding moralizing. However, the insight remains abstract (“love could both elevate and devastate”) without being grounded in a specific ethical or emotional dilemma that Elara must navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of memory, wholeness, and atmospheric emotion emerges organically through recurring motifs (telescope, clouds, spooled wholeness). However, the final paragraph moralizes implicitly by asserting Lyra “knew she had found her calling,” which edges toward thematic echo. The concept resonates but isn’t reweighted by a charged final image—it’s restated. Subtext is present but leans on abstraction over embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: the tension between human aspiration and finitude, embodied in the portrait that “glows with otherworldly light.” Subtext operates through image—the indigo sky mirrored indoors, the worn coin’s topography—not moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer: beauty persists only in transience, captured not to last but to witness. Avoids tidy resolution; embraces ambiguity without confusion. However, the insight borders on familiar philosophical terrain without fresh moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of solitude-in-community and knowledge-as-connection emerges organically through recurring images: starlings, maps, luminance. The phrasebook and hopscotch board suggest layered histories, enriching subtext. Yet the ending offers no resonant reconfiguration—Eli’s isolation remains sociable, their quest unchanged. Without a conceptual repricing or earned insight that reweights earlier material (e.g., realizing discovery requires sharing, or that some knowledge isolates), theme stays suggestive, not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of cosmic harmony through mechanical understanding emerges organically from setting and object. The clockwork motif integrates with Kael’s identity, and the hall of mirrors suggests time’s fluidity. However, the final paragraph veers into abstract assertion (“craft was not just about repair, but about understanding the intricate dance”)—a near-Thematic Echo that borders on moralizing. Subtext is present but undercut by over-articulated insight rather than resonant image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of collective care emerges through imagery (garden, pathways), but it’s stated rather than wrestled: “power of collective effort” is asserted, not earned through struggle. The butterfly garden’s transformation reweights earlier meaning, yet the insight feels decorative, not costly. Final paragraph moralizes (“beacon of hope”) instead of trusting the image. Subtext is thin; all characters interpret events identically.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—beauty in fragility, endurance through quiet vigilance—emerges organically from the puppet’s cracks, the ticking clock, and the whispered lullaby. The final image reweights the broken puppet from symbol of loss to testament of resilience, offering a non-literal answer to existential fragility. Avoids moralizing; subtext lives in gesture and atmosphere. However, the philosophical register occasionally veers toward pseudo-profundity (“savage heart of existence”), slightly diluting emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—transformation of danger into guidance—emerges through the labyrinth’s reactivation and the glowing nut. Subtext resides in the caretaker’s quiet pride, not moralizing. However, resonance leans on familiar tropes (cursed place, hidden map), and the final image, while warm, lacks conceptual friction or ambiguity; safety arrives without ethical complication.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—transformation through loss, connection forged from separation—emerges organically via chrysalis and braided water motifs. The final image reweights earlier elements without moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to Maria’s guilt. However, the insight borders on pseudo-profundity (“translate separation into connection”) and lacks counter-readings or moral ambiguity, softening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—stories as living essence beyond books—emerges organically from setting and object, avoiding direct moralizing. The bottled moonlight functions as a resonant symbol, and the library-as-narrative-weave idea has lyrical appeal. But the insight remains abstract; there’s no counter-reading or ambiguity, and the final image reiterates rather than reweights. Subtext is present but untested, lacking the friction that would elevate it beyond aesthetic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of memory, healing, and burden, avoiding moralizing. The coral pavilion as repository of sorrow reframes remorse as something malleable, not immutable—a resonant conceptual repricing. Yet the final peace feels unearned because the struggle lacks concrete friction; the thematic weight exceeds the dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme (“unity through historical synthesis”) emerges via assertion, not subtext—Emilia literally states her vision. The final paragraph moralizes (“vigorous tender hope”) instead of offering resonant imagery. Motifs (clock, silo) recur but don’t reweight meaning; their symbolic convenience lacks friction. No counter-readings or complexity—history and progress harmonize effortlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme (“abandoned dreams”) emerges through recurring imagery but collapses into assertion rather than resonance. The final paragraph moralizes (“guardian of secrets,” “deeper understanding”) instead of letting the restored mirror’s gleam imply transformation. Subtext is drowned by on-the-nose declarations like “archeologist of abandoned dreams,” which appear as prompt compliance rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through symbol (serpent/seed as map) and concept (“seeds of vigilance”), but borders on abstraction. The final realization—that vigilance is cultivatable—reweights the premise without stating a moral, yet lacks emotional specificity or counter-readings. Subtext is muted; the story prioritizes lyrical resonance over human complexity or moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: empathy as vibration in absence of sound. The final image—music as “quiet heartbeat”—offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Porcelain insulator reweights meaning (industrial object becomes vessel for empathy). But “empathy in motion” borders on label-speak, slightly flattening subtext in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (“beauty in difficulty”) emerges through repeated assertion, not earned insight. The final image offers poetic resonance but no non-literal reweighting of prior material—just restatement. Subtext is minimal; silence and chess serve as decorative motifs, not vehicles for ambiguity. Avoids moralizing but substitutes platitudes for complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of empathy and silence emerges through poetic musings but remains abstract. The diary’s content (“varieties of silence”) is told, not dramatized, reducing subtext to exposition. Final image reweights nothing—it affirms what was already stated. While avoiding moralizing, the piece substitutes lyricism for thematic complexity, offering reflection without friction or counterpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of “wisdom as ever-present current” emerges but collapses into platitude: “not something to be discovered, but... always present.” This pseudo-profound assertion replaces earned insight, especially in the final paragraph. The journal and doodles hint at a deeper idea—pattern recognition as communion—but aren’t leveraged to reweight prior action. Subtext is drowned by explanatory narration (“she realized that...”), violating the “show, don’t tell” principle at the thematic climax.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—resilience through accumulated memory/energy—emerges through the “gathering of echoes” and the arrow tip’s resonance. However, insight arrives via exposition (“Lyra realized…”) rather than earned struggle. The final image avoids moralizing but leans on pseudo-profundity (“whirling silence”) without grounding in concrete consequence. Subtext is thin; the arrow’s significance is asserted, not dramatized through choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of “foresight in action” emerges but leans toward abstraction rather than earned insight. The patch symbolizes human response, yet this isn’t dramatized—it’s stated. The ending offers reflection, not resonance: “lessons must be learned” is moralizing, not a non-literal answer to a central question. Subtext is thin; the story tells us the crash was “complex,” but shows no interplay of forces beyond vague wind eddies.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme (“wonder as essential”) emerges through image but collapses into assertion in the final paragraph: “knowing that she had succeeded in certifying wonder as essential.” This prompt-like phrasing triggers a −0.6 penalty. Subtext is minimal—everything is named directly, leaving little room for ambiguity or reader inference.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—wisdom born of failure, the liminality between worlds—emerges organically through image and ritual rather than moralizing. The flute’s melody as a bridge to hidden patterns offers a non-literal answer to the keeper’s quest. However, the insight feels preordained; the journey reveals rather than earns revelation. Final resonance is strong, but the thematic payoff leans on lyrical assertion over dramatized discovery with tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of language, technology, and empathy, avoiding moralizing. The final image—a swirling vortex of meaning—offers a non-literal answer to whether emotion can be mathematized, reweighting the premise with haunting ambiguity. However, “transposed empathy” remains more concept than lived tension; its thematic weight isn’t tested through failure or sacrifice, softening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically through image and action: the pendant germinates connection, the ridgeway blurs myth and memory, and Eira’s purpose is to nurture latent magic. The final lines reweight routine as fertile ground for wonder, avoiding moralizing. However, the theme lacks counterpoint or complexity—everyone is receptive, no skepticism challenges her mission, and the absent mentor introduces longing without ethical tension. Subtext is consistent but untested, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme—objects as emotional vessels—emerges through image but collapses into assertion (“world imbued with feelings”). The “truthful lies” motif gestures at paradox but isn’t dramatized through concrete contradiction or sacrifice. Final lines moralize (“simple and profound truth”) rather than resonate through reweighted particulars. Subtext drowns in explanatory prose (“uncover hidden patterns that governed reality”), leaving little room for reader discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of reconnection through patient creation emerges organically from weaving and puzzle motifs. The final image—silence as bridge—offers a non-literal answer to isolation. However, subtext leans toward abstraction (“fabric of relationship,” “unraveling tapestry”) without grounding in specific human friction. The amber bead and puzzle echo the theme but feel decorative rather than integral to thematic tension. Avoids moralizing but borders on lyrical generality.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically from craft-as-transformation, with “bartered awakenings” framing value as potential rather than price. The final sword reweights rubble into resilience, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the closing paragraph veers toward thematic summary (“potential for transformation and growth”) that borders on prompt-like assertion. Recurring images (floating arches, mines) resonate but don’t accumulate pressure—they decorate rather than constrain.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme (“the hidden structure of the multiverse”) remains abstract and unearned, stated in exposition rather than emerging from action. The final “clarity” offers no non-literal answer to the central question—only a vague sense of wonder. Recurring motifs (shard, weaving) are decorative, not transformative; the shard’s glow fades without reweighting earlier meaning. No moral ambiguity or counter-reading complicates the revelation, reducing thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of light, memory, and silent communication—safety as something fragile yet worth tending. The sea glass and cairn become resonant symbols without overt moralizing. However, the final insight (“bottle the feeling of safety”) borders on abstract summary, slightly undercutting the otherwise earned lyricism. The story avoids sentimentality but leans into a familiar archetype of the solitary guardian, limiting thematic surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of preserving tradition in a digital age emerges organically through image and ritual, avoiding overt moralizing. The recurring lantern and lighthouse accrue symbolic weight, and the final departure suggests cyclical duty. However, the thematic question lacks friction—there’s no counterforce, doubt, or cost to tradition, rendering the resonance decorative rather than earned. Subtext remains surface-level due to absence of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—certain people refract light like the morpho wing—emerges organically from image and metaphor, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the insight remains abstract, equating charisma with optical physics without exploring its human complexity or cost. Subtext is consistent but thin; the “iridescent caution” warns against seeking truth, yet Kaito faces no danger or ethical dilemma. Final resonance relies on beauty, not earned wisdom or reweighted understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of “mundane miracles” emerges through lunar repair and interconnectedness, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image—worker walking into moonlight—resonates with quiet wonder, reweighting brokenness as potential. But subtext remains surface-level; “quantified sorrow” and “trees witnessing” are poetic concepts without ethical or emotional friction. Wisdom feels received, not earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of memory as restorative force emerges through recurring motifs (“woven dawns,” “forgotten songs”), but subtext collapses into assertion: “the realm began to flourish… people connected once more.” The final paragraph moralizes rather than resonates, stating outcomes instead of implying them. “Woven dawns” functions as poetic label, not a concept that reweights prior events. Emotional honesty is undercut by unearned optimism lacking counterbalance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—wisdom arising from paradox and error—emerges organically through Elys’s arc and the library’s symbolic function. The final line (“truth is not in the destination, but in the journey”) risks moralizing but is mitigated by its earlier appearance as a discovered note, not authorial assertion. Subtext operates via the invitation’s transformation and the book’s title, though “nestled paradoxes” edges toward abstract labeling. The ending offers a non-literal resolution: peace through acceptance of contradiction, not tidy answers.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through recurring images (bread, tea, vines), but leans into pseudo-profundity: “profound truths in ordinary things” is stated outright in the final paragraph, crossing into moralizing. Subtext is thin—the vanished bakery symbolizes impermanence but isn’t woven into character action or consequence. The insight feels imported rather than earned; no counter-reading or ambiguity lingers. Resonance is muted because the epiphany lacks struggle or specific human complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between preservation and oblivion, enriched by the “luminous vows” as metaphor for fragile human connection. However, the ending moralizes implicitly: “guardian of the luminous vows” risks prompt-like abstraction. Subtext thrives in early imagery (“shadows of forgetfulness”), but the final paragraph leans into declarative resonance over earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of hidden secrets and fragile trust emerges but remains abstract. The watch fob’s recurrence lacks evolving meaning—it’s a static symbol. Final paragraph moralizes (“power of determination”) instead of offering resonant image. Subtext is minimal; dialogue and action state intentions outright. No meaningful ambiguity or counter-reading lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of science versus mysticism emerges through recurring motifs (compass, aurora, taste), but resolution leans into vague wonder rather than nuanced reckoning. The final paragraph asserts “magic beyond reality” without interrogating cost or contradiction. Subtext is muted by explanatory narration (“she knew she would carry this moment”) that replaces resonant ambiguity with sentimental closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of creativity as emotional excavation emerges organically through image and action, avoiding direct moralizing. The lock’s transformation suggests that making art unlocks inner barriers—a resonant metaphor. But the insight remains abstract; no counter-reading or complexity challenges the premise. Final image reweights the lock motif, yet the thematic answer feels familiar, not freshly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of candor in transience emerges organically through the repository of conversations, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final shift—seeing decay with “new eyes”—offers a quiet reweighting of loss and beauty. However, the insight borders on abstract (“fragility… also beauty”) without grounding in a specific human failing or societal critique. Subtext is present but muted by the absence of dramatized ethical tension.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme (“truth beyond words”) emerges through recurring phrases but collapses into abstract assertion rather than earned resonance. Final paragraphs moralize (“beacon,” “testament to the power of art”) instead of offering non-literal answers through image or action. The iceberg’s “color of wonder” is named but not dramatized as thematic counterpoint to verbal limitation. Subtext is minimal; meaning is told, not implied.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of fire, containment, and memory, avoiding overt moralizing. The desert rose’s renewal parallels Aria’s acceptance, and “fragmented wholeness” resists tidy resolution. However, the final insight—that containing chaos brings peace—edges toward pseudo-profundity because the mechanics of that containment aren’t grounded in tangible struggle. Subtext is present but leans on familiar tropes of trauma-as-box and fire-as-purification without fresh inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme is overtly moralized in the final display note: “To those who listen, stories unfold”—a prompt-like thesis statement that replaces earned resonance. The locket’s reappearance reiterates rather than reweights meaning; its “poignant reminder” status is told, not shown through altered perception or action. Subtext is minimal; every insight is narrated directly, leaving no space for reader inference or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (“calm defiance,” “vulnerability as strength”) is stated rather than dramatized, culminating in a near-moralizing final image (“reminder of the power of calm defiance”). The spider’s web and dice function as static metaphors, not evolving symbols that reweight meaning. Subtext is absent—every insight is articulated explicitly, leaving no room for ambiguity or reader inference. The piece confuses lyrical repetition for thematic depth, offering resonance without risk or counterpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—memory as recoverable, not lost—emerges organically through wildflowers, gravity anomalies, and the crystal. The final act reweights lighting lanterns as ritual of remembrance, avoiding moralizing. Subtext resides in silence, luminescence, and tactile objects. However, the insight leans lyrical over complex; it affirms hope without confronting ambiguity of what *should* remain forgotten, softening thematic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of silence as active force emerges organically through image and ritual, avoiding moralizing. The crane wing’s journey reweights “hush” from threat to harmony. Yet the insight borders on pseudo-profound abstraction (“tranquil blaze,” “terrestrially cosmic”) without grounding in human-scale conflict. Subtext resonates, but complexity is muted by the summoner’s unchallenged efficacy.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—how collective fictions encode history—emerges organically through the seal, dead languages, and architecture, avoiding overt moralizing. The “agreed upon lies” concept is introduced conversationally and resonates in the closure when the seal becomes a symbol of hidden truths. Yet the final lines lean toward pseudo-profundity (“magic that lay just beneath the surface of the mundane”) that borders on abstraction. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture (the hesitation before the student speaks), but the epiphany lacks counterbalance or ambiguity—it’s uniformly wondrous, not complex.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (“confronting the past enables independence”) emerges but is asserted through repetitive epiphanies rather than earned through conflict. The seashell’s silence at the end symbolizes integration, yet this shift lacks dramatic friction—memories return painlessly. Subtext is minimal; every insight is named (“cathartic,” “resolve,” “hope”). The final paragraph moralizes (“reminder of the power of confronting the past”), violating the ban on thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—rewriting oppressive narratives through artful subversion—emerges organically from image and action, not moralizing. The rose thorn’s glow and aurora’s pulse subtly reframe fragility and transformation. However, the final insight (“she had unlinked the original narrative”) edges toward abstraction, risking pseudo-profundity. Still, resonance lingers through the pearl twilight hue and empty sanctuary, offering a non-literal answer to historical erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—echoes as manifestations of relational entanglement—emerges organically through image and song. The seashell and starlight motif refract the central question without moralizing. However, the insight (“echoes tied to relationships”) arrives as epiphany, not earned struggle, and the ending affirms mystery rather than reweighting it with cost. Subtext is lyrical but lacks friction; the piece prefers beauty over complication.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of interconnectedness emerges through recurring motifs (snow globe, windows of connection), but subtext collapses into assertion: “expose the hidden narratives,” “truth that lay hidden,” “connections that bound the world together” read as prompt-derived labels, not earned insight. The final image—empty snow globe as “testament”—offers symbolic convenience without reconfiguring prior material or posing moral ambiguity. No counter-readings or complexity challenge the premise of redemptive truth-seeking.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of hidden interconnectedness emerges through recurring images (whisk, fireflies, moon path), but collapses into pseudo-profundity: “hidden patterns that underlay all of existence” is asserted, not dramatized. Final image echoes opening without reweighting it—no conceptual repricing with cost. Subtext drowns in lyrical abstraction rather than gesture or silence.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—truth beneath comfortable lies—emerges through Aria’s arc, but the ending states complexity (“truth far more complex”) rather than embodying it. The stillpoint’s glow reweights reality conceptually, yet the resonance relies on assertion, not charged particulars. No counter-reading lingers; the debunker simply accepts the supernatural, flattening moral or epistemological tension into wonder without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (“variant allegiance,” “ancient shadows forging tomorrow”) emerges through recurring phrases but collapses into abstraction. The final image reweights nothing—it restates the premise with ornamental polish. No moral ambiguity or counter-readings exist; the old order is uniformly “trapped,” the new era purely redemptive. The story moralizes rather than interrogates, offering platitudes (“power of vision and determination”) instead of earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: redemption through preservation, not creation. The music box and sound jars refract this idea without moralizing. Final image—poet smiling amid relics—offers resonant, non-literal closure: solitude becomes communion across time. However, “lonesome splendor” and “gleaned redemption” flirt with label-speak, slightly softening subtextual depth. No tidy moral, but ambiguity leans safe rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.0)
    “Sonic absolution” remains an abstract concept, not integrated into character action or thematic conflict. The final image of harmony echoes the opening but doesn’t reweight meaning or pose a non-literal answer to a central question. Subtext is absent; theme is asserted through labels (“fragility of the world”) rather than emerging from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (“patient revolution,” freedom through celestial observation) emerges through repeated motifs but collapses into assertion rather than earned resonance. The final image—a glowing lake at dawn—offers aesthetic closure but no conceptual repricing or non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext is drowned by explicit statements (“the revolution had begun,” “a new era of freedom”), especially in the last paragraph, which moralizes instead of implying. The moon and viaduct recur but don’t accrue shifting meaning tied to character cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of liberation from entangled memories emerges organically through recurring motifs (lantern, water, inscription). However, subtext collapses into assertion in the final paragraph (“no longer controlled by them,” “lessons of the underground railroad”), bordering on thematic echo. The lantern’s historical weight gestures toward resonance but isn’t woven into moral calculus. Ending offers poetic closure but lacks non-literal reweighting—insight remains literalized rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (“redemption through action”) emerges but collapses into platitudes: “turn apologies into action,” “deserve second chances.” The clockwork heart symbolizes emotion mechanically, without ambiguity or counter-readings. Final paragraph moralizes explicitly (“poignant reminder of the power of second opinions”), violating subtext principles. Resonance is manufactured through repetition (“vibrant hush,” “rhythmic ticking”), not earned through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—curiosity as transcendent force—emerges through recurring images (kaleidoscope, arrow tip, bell), but leans toward pseudo-profound assertion (“testament to the power of curiosity”) rather than earned resonance. The final image reweights the bell as internal harmony, yet this feels like thematic summarizing, not a non-literal answer arising from concrete struggle. Subtext is muted by over-articulated narration that tells us what to feel (“irreverent awe,” “deeper sense of purpose”) instead of implying it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme gestures toward memory, loss, and digital impermanence, but collapses into vagueness (“echo of forgotten songs,” “mysteries beyond perception”). The final paragraph asserts transformation (“newfound sense of wonder”) without earning it through specific struggle. Subtext is drowned by on-the-nose narration; the story tells us Lena is changed but shows no behavioral or perceptual shift that embodies that change.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through recurring images (crystal, mirrors, ice) to explore empathy as restorative perception. The final image—crystal pulsing against her heart while ice floes slow—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about inner alignment affecting outer balance. However, the epiphany leans toward pseudo-profundity (“mapping empathy onto shifting landscapes of the heart”) without grounding in specific human friction, edging close to thematic assertion over earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of impermanence and second chances emerges organically through ice imagery and labor, avoiding moralizing. The final paragraph risks abstraction (“world full of possibilities”) but is grounded by the parasol tip and windborne solace. Subtext thrives in silence and shared work, though the “gift” framing leans toward sentimentality. Resonance stems from particulars, yet the epiphany feels slightly unearned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of “destined mismatches” emerges organically through vineyard imagery, but the final insight (“disparate elements form a richer whole”) borders on platitude due to lack of dramatized counterpoint. Subtext is muted; the burned letter hints at human loss but isn’t woven into the sentinel’s personal conflict. The ending offers resonance but not a non-literal answer—it restates the premise without reconfiguring its emotional or conceptual weight through earned experience.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of preserving fragile wisdom emerges texturally but collapses into abstraction; the “echo” is never defined beyond metaphor. Final image offers no non-literal answer—only restatement. Recurring motifs (mask, parapet, whispers) lack evolving meaning, and the prophet’s approval grants thematic safety rather than complexity or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme emerges through recurring imagery (decay/reclamation) but collapses into sentimentality via repeated assertions like “beauty in decay” and “art heals.” The final paragraph moralizes rather than resonates, offering prompt-like declarations instead of earned insight. Subtext is drowned by on-the-nose narration that tells us what to feel rather than trusting image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge as fragile pattern versus communal testimony as renewal. The crystal’s shift from amplifier of silence to vessel of determination reweights growth as shared, not solitary. No moralizing; resonance arises through image and gesture. But the “unraveling world” premise remains underdeveloped, limiting conceptual repricing’s full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically through recurring images—fog, unwatched tapes, worn statue—that reconfigure time as intangible yet palpable. The ending reframes aging not as loss but as ambient presence, avoiding moralizing. However, the insight borders on lyrical abstraction without grounding in specific human friction; the prophet’s epiphany feels universalized rather than earned through particular struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (“harnessing the ephemeral,” “changelessly constant”) is repeated but not developed through action; insights arrive as abstract pronouncements in the final paragraph. The clock hand’s stillness is meant to reweight meaning, but its shift from spinning to stopped lacks causal or emotional groundwork, rendering the resonance ornamental rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of music, mortality, and mundane beauty, avoiding overt moralizing. The “scent of hope” and broken vinyl reframe farewell as reconnection, not loss. However, the final paragraph veers toward summary (“making a difference, one flawless goodbye at a time”), slightly diluting the earned quietude of Emma’s departure. Subtext thrives in gesture and image until this slight retreat into assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges around hidden cosmic order and knowledge-as-key, but it’s stated rather than dramatized (“metaphor for underlying order”). The central question—where shadows go at noon—is intriguing but resolved only by implication, not resonant reconfiguration. Recurring motifs (key, shadows, runes) lack evolving meaning; they’re reiterated without deepening consequence. Final insight reads like intellectual conclusion, not earned wisdom with emotional or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of “nostalgia and innovation shaping the future” emerges through recurring phrases like “turn mistakes into constellations,” but borders on prompt-like assertion. The final paragraph moralizes rather than dramatizes, stating the garden is “a testament to the transformative power…”—a tell, not a show. Subtext is muted; the tooth’s symbols and bone-setting metaphor remain ornamental, not integrated into thematic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of stillness emerges organically through image and repetition, avoiding overt moralizing. However, the “pearl of stillness” remains abstract rather than dramatized through concrete sacrifice or dilemma. The final image resonates lyrically but offers no non-literal answer to a central question because no question was ever posed under pressure—only meditative circling.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from recurring images—the pendant, the garden, the silence—culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of pain into resilience. Subtext thrives in gesture and quietude, avoiding moralizing. However, the final paragraph drifts toward abstraction (“beacon of hope,” “new narrative of hope and resilience”), diluting the earlier lyrical precision. The central question—can vulnerability be protected?—is answered non-literally through the shared flower and walking together, satisfying CR without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme (writing as navigation of inner turmoil) emerges through recurring motifs but collapses into assertion in the final third (“capturing the shapes of different hopes”). The shell’s symbolism is consistent yet static—it reflects rather than refracts meaning. Subtext is muted; the ghostly figure explicitly “whispers encouragement,” replacing implication with instruction. No counter-readings or moral ambiguity complicate the thesis that subconscious guidance yields truth.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of reconnection through ancestral artistry emerges organically from Elara’s actions and the vine’s resonance, avoiding moralizing. The final image—villagers smiling, arbor sanctified—offers quiet repricing of community as living ritual. Yet the theme lacks friction: no counterforce (skepticism, failed attempts, generational rift) tests its validity, making resonance feel unearned. Subtext resides in the vine’s pulse, but ambiguity is minimal—everyone harmonizes without discord.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: patience and attention transform desolation into meaning. The final image—a pulsing map etched by starlight—offers a non-literal answer to how inner rhythms chart unseen territories. Avoids moralizing, but “safekept starlight” and “rhythm of existence” flirt with abstraction. Recurring patterns (discarded twigs → enchanted plate) reweight desolation as fertile ground, though not indispensably.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—time as layered resonance recoverable through attentive craft—emerges organically from Elian’s work and the cavern’s ecology. The final ticking clock reweights silence into heartbeat, offering a non-literal answer to whether wonder can be preserved. However, the insight borders on pseudo-profundity (“cellar of reason”) and lacks counter-readings or moral ambiguity. Subtext is present but muted by the absence of failure or sacrifice that would complicate the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—burdens as reflections of inner landscapes—emerges organically through the tapestry metaphor and recurring imagery. Subtext resides in silence, light, and weaving, avoiding moralizing. Yet the insight (“weights reflect inner landscapes”) arrives as a quiet epiphany without friction or counterpoint, leaning toward pseudo-profundity. Resonance is poetic but lacks the grit of earned wisdom through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of craft and loss, avoiding moralizing. The “here and gone” concept gains resonance through the carving’s completion—a tangible artifact against impermanence. However, the final insight (“rust-hued peace”) leans slightly toward abstraction, missing a non-literal reweighting that would fully earn 9+; the epiphany feels asserted more than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—memory, regret, and the persistence of human connection through fragmented narratives—emerges organically from setting and action, not exposition. The final photograph reweights the premise: preservation substitutes for retrieval. However, the closing lines verge on thematic assertion (“testament to the enduring power of human connection”), slightly undercutting subtext. The carousel’s shadow and camera wheel resonate without over-explanation, but the moral edge leans toward sentimentality in the last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (“rebirth through creativity”) emerges coherently but leans on abstraction (“equations for hope,” “beauty in abandonment”). The sextant and maze symbolize legacy and pattern, yet their resonance feels decorative, not earned through conflict. Final image reweights the terminal as “beacon,” but this shift lacks conceptual cost—it’s additive optimism, not repricing. Avoids moralizing but substitutes sentiment for complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—harmonizing mechanical order and wild nature—emerges organically through recurring images (clock, bear, water, sunrise). The final image (sanctuary as catalyst) offers quiet resonance without moralizing. However, subtext remains illustrative rather than interrogative; the “balance” feels asserted, not earned through conflict. Nostalgia dominates over complexity, yielding emotional sincerity but limited thematic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme (“lies,” “clarity”) is asserted through label-speak (“architecture of lies,” “thoughtfully clear understanding”) rather than emerging from action. The ending moralizes instead of resonating: “some truths are only revealed in the stillness” reads as prompt-derived aphorism. No counter-readings or complexity—Lyra’s insight is presented as universal truth, not hard-won, specific wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of preservation vs. loss emerges through recurring motifs (knots, fulgurite, ocean rhythms), avoiding overt moralizing. The fulgurite—a natural artifact fused by lightning—resonates with the weavers’ fragile knowledge. Yet the insight feels received, not earned: no struggle reframes understanding. Final image (“secrets waiting to be uncovered once more”) suggests cyclical renewal, but lacks conceptual repricing with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of absence, memory, and language, avoiding overt moralizing. The carpet thread’s fragility mirrors human connection, and the transformation of silence into “otherworldly music” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: healing lies in witnessing, not fixing. However, the epiphany leans close to pseudo-profundity (“geography of healing”) without grounding in specific human struggle, slightly undercutting emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of extinction, memory, and mechanical revival, avoiding moralizing. The egg symbolizes fragile, irrecoverable beauty, and its reactivation suggests renewal is possible through attention and craft. The ending offers a non-literal answer: beauty returns not by reversing cataclysm but by perceiving pattern and connection anew. However, the thematic shift leans slightly toward sentimentality (“deep, abiding peace”) without confronting the permanence of loss implied by “extinct.”

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically from recurring images (black sand, grafting, coin) rather than moralizing, though the phrase “scars can sing” flirts with pseudo-profundity. The ending reweights healing as coexistence with damage, not erasure—a resonant CR. However, the thematic insight (“harmonize with scars”) is articulated directly by a “wise woman,” weakening subtext. Still, the final image of grafted growth amid rain earns its quiet hope without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as civic lifeblood, revived through patient attention. The final image—fountains flowing as Aria walks away—offers a non-literal answer to forgetting without moralizing. However, “sidereal patience” and “defiant hush” verge on thematic labels, and the epiphany (“her task was far from over”) edges toward summary. Resonance is strong but slightly undercut by conceptual abstraction in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: gentle transmission vs. destructive fire, infinity approximated through pattern. The final CR—“true illumination came not from flames, but from the gentle, loving touch”—reweights the entire journey without moralizing. Recurring motifs (petals, gear, sonar) accrue meaning, though “fire” remains metaphorically vague. Subtext thrives in the tension between cosmic scale and intimate gesture, avoiding sentimentality through consistent tone.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of grief’s persistence emerges through recurring images (butterflies, ribbon, headstones), but subtext is drowned by explicit statements like “she had finally discovered the shape of collective grief.” The final paragraph moralizes rather than resonates, violating the “no sermonizing” rule. Insights feel inherited from prompts (“spectral mentorship,” “family custom”) rather than earned through struggle. Ambiguity is absent—grief is “beautiful and terrible” in equal, unchallenged measure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme (“incremental absolution”) is stated outright in exposition and echoed in the rake’s inscription, violating the “no moralizing” rule. The final paragraph summarizes redemption rather than earning it through image or action. Recurring motifs (pendulum, ridge) lack reweighted meaning—they decorate but don’t reconfigure. Subtext is absent; everything is told directly, flattening resonance into platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through recurring images (tapestry threads, sovereign case, echoes), suggesting memory, legacy, and hidden meaning beneath surface order. Yet the ending moralizes implicitly—“echoes were a reminder of intentions”—leaning toward assertion over earned ambiguity, slightly undercutting subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of constrained creativity emerges through recurring images (spire, blank page), but it’s stated more than earned. The final paragraph moralizes (“work would prevail”) rather than offering resonant ambiguity. Subtext is thin; the piece leans on lyrical assertion over dramatized insight.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—storytelling as alchemy of dust and sound—emerges organically through image and action, not exposition. The final image of dust dancing with narrative potential offers quiet resonance. However, the lack of cost or moral ambiguity flattens complexity; it’s a celebration without sacrifice, limiting thematic depth. Avoids moralizing but leans toward sentimentality in its tidy fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through image (porcelain mask, ash dispersal) but collapses into explicit moralizing in Eli’s final line: “The truth is not always what it seems…”—a textbook thematic echo in the closing paragraph. The mirage of safety is asserted repeatedly rather than dramatized through character consequence. Subtext is minimal; emotions and ideas are named, not implied. Resonance relies on lyrical repetition, not earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of competing narratives is stated repeatedly but not dramatized through conflict or choice. The “official story vs. truth” dichotomy remains abstract, with no scene showing how this tension shapes behavior. Final insight (“perverse kind of peace”) feels unearned, lacking concrete struggle. Subtext is minimal; the story tells its theme rather than letting it emerge from action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges cohesively around harmony and cultural preservation, but leans into explicit moralizing (“music as universal language,” “beacon of hope”) rather than subtext. The final paragraph verges on sermonizing, reducing complexity to uplift. While the rosette motif recurs, it symbolizes rather than complicates, offering reassurance instead of earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of rebirth through memory emerges organically from Aria’s craft and the seed’s sprouting. Subtext resides in pruning as metaphor for selective remembrance. Yet the final paragraph veers into near-moralizing (“beacon towards what could be”), diluting resonance with abstraction. The central question—can beauty heal ruin?—is answered non-literally through the dish and sprout, but the insight borders on familiar lyricism without fresh moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (“beauty in failure”) emerges through assertion, not dramatization. The final line (“preserving wonder in the routine”) is a prompt-like thesis statement, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. Subtext is absent—dialogue declares meaning outright. The drone beehive’s “adaptation” reframes failure as resilience, but this insight isn’t tested against counterforces or moral ambiguity; it’s presented as serene consensus, avoiding complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—animacy of place, quiet reverence—emerges organically through image and action, avoiding moralizing. The “shard of hush” concept reframes domestic space as sentient, offering a non-literal answer to Eli’s question. However, insight feels granted rather than earned; no struggle or sacrifice deepens the wisdom. Subtext is consistent but safe, lacking counter-readings or ambiguity that would elevate resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of nuance over certainty emerges organically through the statue’s shift in perception, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image—empty ampoule at feet—resonates as a symbol of internal transformation. However, the thematic payoff leans on abstraction (“power of adaptability”) rather than concrete emotional consequence. Subtext is present but diluted by repetitive declarations of the garden’s “vibrant, pulsing life.”

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of chance vs. determinism emerges organically through dice imagery, but final insight (“journey over destination”) borders on platitude. Subtext is muddled by over-articulated narration (“grim optimism,” “elusive thread of possibility”). Recurring dice motif charges closure but doesn’t reweight earlier material with fresh conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of forgotten languages, urban alienation, and quiet acts of creation. The final image—brush dancing under dawn light—offers a non-literal answer: beauty persists as connective tissue. However, the closing lines flirt with moralizing (“beauty and connection were always within reach”), slightly undercutting subtextual restraint. Still, ambiguity lingers in whether anyone will see her work, preserving complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the bread sculptures and opera glass as vessels of memory, avoiding overt moralizing. The parallel between past refugees and present preservation resonates without false equivalence. However, the final lines verge on thematic assertion (“guardian,” “tend the stories”) that edges toward summary rather than earned resonance. Subtext is strong in imagery but diluted by explanatory closure phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme (“power in unlikely places”) emerges through motif but collapses into assertion (“beacon of hope,” “never be content”). The hunger stone’s “unfulfilled longing” is introduced but abandoned; no moral complexity or counter-reading lingers. Final paragraph moralizes (“carry the latent radiance”) instead of offering resonant image. Subtext is drowned by on-the-nose declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme gestures toward fear, allure, and trapped identity but remains abstract, relying on motifs (clasp, luminance) without letting them accrue meaning through action. The final image—the model smiling with “malevolent glee”—repeats the opening poster without reweighting it; no insight emerges from the journey. Subtext is drowned by on-the-nose narration (“repulsive allure,” “siren’s call”), and the whispering advisor’s refrain (“The funhouse is always waiting”) substitutes for earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—finding hidden harmony in chaos—emerges organically through action, not assertion. The “restless euphony” embodies the tension between order and flux, and the final image (orchard as jewel amid vast seas) offers a non-literal answer: meaning is transient, localized, yet luminous. However, the insight feels decorative rather than earned through struggle; no counter-reading or moral ambiguity complicates the vision. Subtext lingers in scent, echo, and starlight, but the piece avoids complexity by idealizing the prophet’s quest without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—curiosity versus ominous silence—emerges through recurring images (watchers, whistle, shells), avoiding overt moralizing. The ending offers quiet resonance: knowledge pursued despite dread. But subtext lacks complexity; the watchers remain monolithic symbols, and Lyra’s quest isn’t tested by competing values or internal contradiction, limiting thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of truth vs. noble lies emerges coherently through Emilia’s mission and the letter’s revelation. However, the final paragraph moralizes (“small but significant victory in the never-ending struggle against deception”), violating the “no sermonizing” rule. Subtext is thin—ivy as truth’s jailer is overt symbolism, not earned resonance. The insight feels academic, not human, lacking emotional aftereffect or moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of “interlaced absence” emerges organically through image and object, avoiding direct moralizing. The inkwell and hidden notes suggest transmission across time, and the final image of the empty-but-full inkwell offers subtle conceptual repricing. However, the theme leans on lyrical assertion (“stories of the past can be a guiding light”) rather than earned insight through struggle. Resonance is atmospheric, not rooted in character transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of recovering lost knowledge emerges organically through image and object, avoiding overt moralizing. However, the final insight—that “forgotten texts hold keys to the present”—feels generic and unearned, lacking a non-literal, resonant answer to a central question. The stamp’s impression symbolizes presence but doesn’t reweight prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext remains thin because conflict never truly challenges Elara’s worldview or methods.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: grief shaped into light. The crane release and lantern glow offer resonant, non-literal answers to loss without moralizing. However, “dream recording” and “shadow detachment” introduce conceptual noise that isn’t integrated into the thematic core, diluting focus. Subtext is strong in objects but weakened by abstract phrasing (“poignant reflection of turmoil”).

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (“unused potential as catalyst”) emerges through concept rather than character struggle. The geode crystal and “bleak exhilaration” gesture toward subtext but resolve into pseudo-profound abstraction (“forge a new path,” “brighter tomorrow”). Final paragraph moralizes via prompt-like language (“rediscover herself,” “new path forward”), violating the ban on thematic echo in closure. Ambiguity is absent—conflict yields tidy epiphany without counter-readings or lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of belonging emerges through celestial imagery and ancestral echo, avoiding overt moralizing. However, the insight—that belonging is connection to land, people, universe—feels generic and unearned, lifted from New Age abstraction rather than specific struggle. The final reconfiguration lacks counterweight or ambiguity; it’s a harmonious resolution without ethical complexity or personal cost. Recurring stars motif decorates but doesn’t deepen the thematic question through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of truth vs. fabrication emerges organically through the genealogist’s profession and the “sieved hush,” but the ending offers no resonant reweighting—only a vague commitment to pursue truth. The driftwood carvings symbolize suppressed history, yet their revelation changes nothing. Subtext is present but unearned by plot movement.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of mist, moon phases, and the drawer pull as symbols of fragility and balance. The notion of “recycling mistakes into wisdom” avoids moralizing by embedding insight in image rather than declaration. However, the final paragraph edges toward abstraction (“line between past and present was always blurred”), slightly diluting resonance. Subtext operates effectively in silence and setting, though the moral calculus lacks teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the compass-as-past and poles-as-present, offering a quiet reweighting: navigation need not rely on precision instruments. However, the insight (“let go of the past to navigate the present”) is nearly stated outright in the penultimate paragraph, bordering on moralizing. Subtext is diluted by repetitive thematic labeling (“align heart and actions,” “gravitate towards purpose”). The ending resonates modestly but lacks the ambiguity or complexity expected at elite literary levels.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of memory loss and empathy, anchored by the newspaper phrase and baseball. However, subtext is undermined by on-the-nose declarations: “empathy where none remained,” “labyrinth of choices,” “connections that transcended time.” The ending offers a resonant image (glowing path) but leans on thematic echo rather than earned reconfiguration. Avoids moralizing, but insights feel prompted, not discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of transformation through connection emerges organically from ritual and metamorphosis imagery, avoiding overt moralizing. The fortune cookie’s message gains resonance through reprise, and cosmic intimacy reframes solitude as expansion. However, the epiphany (“not destruction… but expansion”) leans toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly undercutting emotional honesty with tidy resolution rather than lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of objects and memory, avoiding moralizing. The final insight—that lost time resides between memories—reweights the premise without stating a lesson, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the central metaphor (“cloudbound repentance”) remains underdeveloped as a lived experience; it functions more as lyrical phrase than integrated concept. Subtext thrives in the saucer’s crack and hand tracings, which embody absence without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of compassion unlocking hidden dimensions emerges through recurring images (tears, stitching, the Tear), but leans into overt abstraction (“transformative power of love,” “indomitable will of the human spirit”). Final paragraph moralizes rather than trusts resonance, undercutting subtext. The concept of shadow work is named but not dramatized as psychological excavation—it’s a label enabling plot convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (“interconnectedness of the universe”) emerges through recurring images (stars, hush, lightning bugs) but collapses into pseudo-profound abstraction in the final paragraphs (“texture of transformation,” “complex web of connections”). The insight feels unearned because it’s narrated, not dramatized through struggle. No counterpoint or ambiguity tempers the epiphany—Aria simply accepts cosmic meaning without friction, reducing theme to decorative lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of quiet rebellion emerges through recurring motifs (quill, cradle, hush), but devolves into abstraction (“new era of freedom and creativity”) without moral complexity. The ending moralizes rather than resonates—phrases like “power of courage and determination” state theme instead of embodying it. Subtext is thin; the revolution lacks ideological texture or counterpoint, reducing theme to slogan. No ambiguity lingers; resolution is tidy, totalizing, and consequence-free.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of revelation through pattern emerges organically from action, avoiding moralizing. The aurora-stardust-rock triad resonates without overstatement, and the “borrowed dawn” subtly frames transience. However, insights feel preordained, not wrested from struggle—epiphany lacks counterpoint or ambiguity. Final image reweights creation myths, but thematic depth is limited by the protagonist’s frictionless success.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of storm, scars, and hidden writing—truth revealed through turbulence. The final image reweights prior material: darkness is no longer oppressive because she’s mapped it. However, the phrase “cartography of scars” borders on pseudo-profundity, and the epiphany leans abstract. Subtext thrives in the envelope method and timer relic, but the closing lines verge on declarative (“she would always be drawn to the hidden patterns”), slightly undercutting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—knowledge as journey, truth woven from threads—emerges organically through the needle card and sundial motifs. The final image reweights the premise: victory is process, not outcome. But the insight borders on platitude (“true victory lay not in winning”) and lacks moral complexity or counter-readings. No character is wrong, no belief shattered; the epiphany feels safe, not hard-won. Subtext is present but muted by lyrical abstraction over dramatic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (“beauty from anarchy,” resilience through art”) emerges coherently but remains illustrative rather than interrogated. The final image reiterates hope without complicating it—no moral ambiguity, sacrifice, or counterpoint challenges the poet’s vision. Friendship is credited as catalyst but never dramatized as method, reducing thematic depth to sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—art as refuge and reclamation of time—emerges organically through the interplay of clock, film, and music. The final image reweights the broken clock not as frozen loss but as chosen stillness, offering a non-literal answer to grief. However, the closing lines flirt with thematic summarization (“music that she made along the way”), edging toward assertion over resonance. Subtext thrives in objects, but the epiphany leans slightly toward pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of cultural memory as living mosaic emerges organically through image and action, avoiding overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph leans into assertion (“testament to Aria’s tireless efforts”) rather than letting resonance accrue from particulars. Subtext is muted; the central question—can memory be preserved without distortion?—is posed but not answered through non-literal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of regret and memory emerges through recurring images (compass, cerulean hue, tides), but subtext is drowned in explicit statements (“color of unspoken apologies,” “tides of remembrance”). The ending offers a literalized answer (blue lace = regret) rather than resonant ambiguity. Wisdom feels imported from grandmother’s lore, not earned through Kaito’s specific struggle. Emotional honesty is undercut by tidy resolution—regret becomes “peace” without lingering complexity.
