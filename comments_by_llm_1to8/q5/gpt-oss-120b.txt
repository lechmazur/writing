  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (humility, gradual change, the power of small disturbances) emerges organically from the greenhouse's transformation and Mara's shift from supernova scale to dust scale. The final whisper—"We are all dust, rearranged, learning, decaying, and still growing"—borders on explicit moralizing but is grounded in the weeks of observation. The dust and greenhouse decay serve as concrete particulars that support the theme without becoming purely symbolic tokens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (purpose found in pauses, survival as testament) emerges through frost/glass/ledger motifs and the canyon's resonance. The final image attempts non-literal answer via glass singing under starlight, but the execution tilts toward direct assertion ("she found the purpose she had been seeking") rather than letting particulars speak. Thematic statements in the final paragraph ("purpose lived not in grand gestures but in the quiet pauses") flatten what could have remained resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—survival as preserving "unshaken marvels" and giving voice to silence—emerges from the heat-mapping device, the fork's tone, and Mara's scars. The final image (conservatory exhaling, silence turned to song) offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, phrases like "a living bridge between loss and wonder" and "the heart can still compose unshaken marvels" edge toward abstract thesis statements in the closing paragraphs, and the prompt label "unshaken marvels" is repeated rather than transformed into fresh idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of rest as sanctuary emerges from concrete actions—lens placement, light pulses, spirit sighs—without overt moralizing. The recurring motif of "occupying impossible spaces" and "permanent address" returns at closure, reweighting the premise. Yet the final paragraph's line "a lighthouse for the lost" edges toward thematic summary, and the ending offers a resonant image without a non-literal answer that challenges prior assumptions or introduces undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of intergenerational solidarity and community resilience emerges clearly through repeated images (bell, arbor, children learning knots, elders nodding). However, the final image—"the bell's song faded into memory, ready to be rung again"—restates the premise rather than reweighting it with a non-literal answer or felt cost. Subtext is minimal; dialogue is absent, so all meaning arrives via narration that often tells theme directly ("the purpose of all this was to build intergenerational support"). The piece gestures toward complexity (sanctions as "test of solidarity") but resolves into a tidy affirmation without ambiguity or counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme—healing through presence and compassion—emerges from recurring breath, light, and lattice imagery, avoiding overt sermon until the penultimate line ("healing was not a single act but a continual revealing through breathing changes") borders on theme summary. The camera obscura and Kwan Yin's tear constrain method and lend particularity, but the reservoir lattice resolves without ambiguity or counter-reading. The final image (blossoms glowing with compassion's memory) offers resonance, though the lack of on-page cost or moral friction flattens the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("texture of time," dissolution of static walls) is overtly stated multiple times ("She believed that only by disintegrate the static walls…," "Mara understood that the maze's purpose…") rather than emerging from scene particulars. The fading photographs and hyperbolic geometry are potential motifs, but their recurrence does not constrain choice or accumulate pressure—they illustrate the declared theme without reweighting it at closure. The final image asserts thematic completion ("the maze stood complete—a reverie that quaked with the promise of endless discovery") as a thesis statement, not a resonant non-literal answer grounded in cost or action.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: chains, keys, seeds, walls as metaphors for oppression and renewal. The final image—green shoot through cracked earth—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the inscription "When the wall comes down, the seed shall rise" borders on direct thematic statement, and Mara's whispered promise to the seeds risks sentimentality. The piece invites reflection on resilience and knowledge-sharing, yet the thematic question never faces genuine counter-pressure or ambiguity that would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of "trust breaking and mending" is stated explicitly in the final paragraphs ("trust, even when broken, leaves a trace worth hearing") rather than emerging from concrete events. No character choice or image reweights the premise with ambiguity or cost. The device becomes a thematic token—"colors of broken trust and new hope"—without irony, contradiction, or earned insight. The orchard's "legend whispered among divers" in the penultimate paragraph tips into overt thematic summary rather than letting the final image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated in the final paragraph—"not to steal images, but to preserve the fleeting brilliance of existence"—rather than emerging from concrete particulars. "Illuminated moments," "destiny's door," and "luminous disbelief" recur as ornamental labels without reweighting prior material through action or image. The ending replaces scene pressure with overt moralizing. No thematic question is posed early and answered non-literally by the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of thawing/warming and fragile equilibrium emerges from repeated imagery (ice melt, glass cooling, cracked bookmark as new beginning). The bookmark and glass sphere carry symbolic freight and reappear at closure. However, the final whisper—"the thawing heart of the world would beat within every safe zone she forged"—is an explicit thematic statement that replaces scene pressure with declaration. The piece invites reflection on patience and craft, but the ending leans toward stated moral rather than resonant non-literal answer, capping score in mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme (vulnerability as power, betrayal as weapon) is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars. The seashell's "true heart" and amber vial arrive as symbolic convenience late in the narrative, resolving the stated fear without dramatized struggle. The final image—"forever changed"—asserts transformation without showing what was reweighted or lost. No counter-reading is invited; the moral is spelled out.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—mapping the unknowable, listening to silence—emerges from imagery and the oracle's task without overt moralizing. The final dissolution gesture ("map dissolve into the very air, becoming part of the marbled hush itself") offers a non-literal answer, but the thematic question lacks prior friction or cost to reweigh. "Ambered hush" and "marbled hush" recur but remain ornamental; no particular constrains the insight. The piece resists simplistic resolution yet also lacks the earned complexity that friction and trade-off provide.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme (boundaries between cleaning and creating, mundane work as transcendence) emerges organically from the robot's actions and the ice violin motif. However, the final paragraphs state the theme overtly: "a bridge between the ordinary and the transcendent," "even the simplest motions could echo through the looped timelines of existence." These meta-summaries replace scene pressure and reduce resonance. The "second chance program" motif recurs at the end and reweights the robot's ongoing loop, which supports thematic integration, but the explicit framing undercuts the subtlety needed to reach high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of honesty/transparency is repeated in abstract declarations: "freed by honesty," "transparency," "thaw mistrust," "pact of openness." The final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "true clarity need not be shouted, for it shines ambiguously clear even in the deepest night." No earned wisdom arises from specific struggle; the registrar observes rather than wrestles with a question. The lens and light function as symbolic conveniences introduced late to harvest thematic resonance without prior particulars that constrain or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "blooming withering" duality is named repeatedly but never dramatized as a choice between competing goods or unavoidable harms. The phrase "commemorating small victories elaborately" and "mended deception" appear as prompt labels without specific grounding in the vine dresser's actions or worldview. The ending ("we will tend you as you tend us") states rather than implies reciprocity, foreclosing reflection. Theme remains an imposed thesis rather than an emergent property of conflict, and the final image offers satisfaction without lingering ambiguity or conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of time's sideways movement and the interplay of "icy warmth" emerge through image and motif rather than statement. The piece resists moralizing and maintains atmospheric coherence. Yet the final paragraph summarizes theme ("time could indeed be nudged sideways") rather than embodying it in a non-literal image, and no concrete cost or ambiguity anchors the thematic question. The holographic lattice and unfurling buds function as symbolic confirmation rather than a resonant answer that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of silences, "spaces in between," and reverence for the unseen emerges through image and pattern (water damage code, unstruck chords, wordless conversation). The final realization—"the code was not a cipher of letters but a pattern of silences"—borders on overt statement but is anchored in the water-ripple discovery. The ending offers a quiet, non-literal answer via the dried program and steady lanterns. However, "wordless conversation" and "in between spaces" recur as phrases more than lived pressure, and the ghost's satisfaction feels abstractly tidy rather than ambiguous or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—truth, certainty, and the cost of carrying hidden knowledge—emerges through images (botanical illustration, smudged ink, stone, aurora) rather than direct statement. The illustration returns at closure with reweighted meaning (now "stained with the story of the mountain's breath"), and the auroral sorrow evolves into "quiet resolve." The ending offers a non-literal answer (truth as both heavy and light, sorrow as beautiful guide) without moralizing. However, phrases like "swaying certainties," "peripherally aware," and "occupying margins" read as thematic echo of the prompt rather than dramatized insight, and the final shift (inward to outward) is asserted rather than earned through a scene-tested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme—hidden truths as measurable weight—is stated rather than earned from particulars. The beaded valve, "swallowed truth," and "emotional tonnage" recur as symbols but do not constrain a choice or evolve through conflict. The final image ("quiet prayer he never intended to utter") moralizes instead of landing a resonant, non-literal answer. Religious skepticism is mentioned twice without shaping perception or costing anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme ("silence births renewal") emerges from the descent and refuge immersion. The final line avoids overt moralizing yet still borders on thematic summary. Recurring images (vines, origami, obsidian, river) create atmospheric texture, but the keeper's role as passive witness prevents the ending from posing a non-obvious moral calculus. The regenerative silence motif constrains the atmosphere but does not force a choice that reweights prior material with ambiguity or conceptual friction.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of "ordinary magic" emerges through particulars (baby curl, adaptive melody, eclipse), and the piece resists overt moralizing in the main beats. However, the final two paragraphs tilt into direct thematic statement: "magic does not need grand gestures, only attentive hearts" and "ordinary magic is always within reach" summarize rather than let the image speak. The locket's return at closure reweights meaning only weakly, since it carried no prior conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme (memory, axis, realignment) emerges through repeated images—tapestry, diaries, humming—but remains abstract. The "displaced axis is not a fracture but a realignment" reads as on-the-nose philosophical summary rather than insight earned through struggle. The final image ("stories walls have heard are finally being gathered") recapitulates the opening premise without reweighting it; no new cost or irony charges the closure. The bronze-quiet atmosphere is coherent but does not modulate with pressure, flattening thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.7)
    The "open secrets" motif recurs but functions as decorative labeling rather than emerging from concrete action or image that reweights prior material. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "stood as a beacon of open mysteries, forever guiding those who dared to listen to the quiet music of hidden truths"—a thematic summary replacing earned resonance. The protagonist's mission to "transpose life into a new key" and "encode the pulse of a human heart" remains abstract philosophizing disconnected from scene work. The gull with cookie scrap attempts symbolic closure but arrives without prior grounding, reading as imposed rather than inevitable. No complexity or counter-reading is invited; the piece affirms its own profundity without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme (illuminating hidden assumptions, the power of focused perception) is stated explicitly ("his ritual aimed to illuminate hidden assumptions") rather than emerging from concrete events. The indigo hue functions as a symbolic marker but does not constrain choice or accumulate pressure that reweights prior material at closure. The ending's "one color to illuminate the unseen" and "stillness can be unraveled and rebuilt" read as abstract thematic summaries rather than resonant, non-literal answers earned through particulars. Subtext is thin; rhetorical devices are named but not demonstrated in speech or silence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of memory, longing, and transformation; the nautilus as compass, mirrored horizon as threshold, and the final fortune ("Your heart is the baton; the world is your score") resonate without overt moralizing. The piece invites reflection on chronological homesickness as creative fuel, and the upended hush reweights as orchestra by the end. However, the thematic payoff leans on stated imagery ("when the ice sings, you will hear yourself become") rather than a non-literal, earned answer that reweights prior particulars through concrete action. The final fortune risks summarizing rather than dramatizing the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme is stated repeatedly in prompt-like language ("to own every timeline… is to master oneself") rather than emerging from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. The clay tablet and fractured timelines function as symbolic props without dramatic cost or complexity. No plausible counter-reading exists; the piece preaches a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—silence as mirror, feeling through negation—emerges from image and action rather than assertion. The filament-of-hush metaphor recurs and shifts meaning (threat → glow → ribbon of light), and the final observation that "the heart can still compose a symphony of feeling" grows from the cavern work. However, the ending leans close to thematic summary: "emotional numbness can always be rewound and healed" states the premise rather than letting the image speak. The mirrored-hush concept charges the closure but never acquires non-literal ambiguity; it remains a one-to-one symbol. Subtext is thin in gesture and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme emerges around integrity, solitude, and truth under siege, but the final paragraph ("truth would always find a way") delivers a stated moral rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The recurring "layered tranquility" and "progressing laterally" remain abstract motifs without sharp shifts in meaning. No earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle; Elara's epiphany about her "meticulous nature… not a cage but a compass" reads as therapy-speak assertion rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is asserted rather than earned: "texture of time," "passionate weave," and "collective longing of all wanderers" are stated in the final paragraph as summary rather than resonating from prior particulars. The rope's shift from prison escape to cosmic binding is declared symbolically but lacks on-page friction that would charge the transformation. The piece tells its thematic conclusion ("dare to untangle the delicate pattern of existence") instead of dramatizing insight through concrete choice and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme (beauty in the unfinished, silence as canvas) emerges through images—bowl collecting notes, charcoal roots, vines swaying—but the final paragraph states the thesis overtly: "the unfinished was a canvas of endless light" and "infinite grace." This thematic echo in closure deflates resonance (−0.6). The piece gestures toward ambiguity ("not erased but transformed") yet the villagers "understood" in unison, flattening complexity. No counter-reading persists; the story resolves into a tidy epiphany without cost or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of commodified emotion and the boundary between insight/empathy emerges from Mara's trade and the "half truths" she captures. The petal as recurring object shifts meaning slightly from promise to product, and "affectionate detachment" colors the frame. However, the final lines ("promised to return with a new perfume that will gently subsume that sorrow into a comforting illusion") veer toward thematic summary rather than resonant image. The ending articulates the premise rather than reweighting it through a non-literal answer or ambiguity with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of "cycles of compassion" is stated repeatedly in the text ("cycles of compassion that linked traders, readers, and sailors"; "cycles of compassion are the most reliable cargo") rather than emerging from concrete events. The Compassion Register and the full-moon ceremony are told gestures, not dramatized with friction or cost. The final image (locket glimmering, listeners feeling hope) offers a declared answer rather than a resonant one. Multiple passages slip into thematic echo and sermonizing, especially the penultimate paragraph ("proving that cycles of compassion are the most reliable cargo"), triggering the baseline −0.5 penalty in Q5.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of kinship and belonging emerges through repeated imagery (webs, threads, lattice) but remains abstract rather than grounded in a specific choice with cost. The glyph's discovery by Lira reframes the tag as "a living symbol that grows as the community heals," but this realization is stated rather than dramatized. The final line attempts resonance—"rewrite the language of belonging"—but substitutes assertion for earned particularity. No moral complexity or counter-reading is offered; the vision is univocal and sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of time-as-malleable emerges through recurring imagery (infinity loops, sculpted time, interrupted cadence) but relies on direct statement: "she must become the echo," "sculpts time itself." The final image (silver water, restored rhythm) asserts thematic closure without reweighting prior material through concrete action or visible cost. No earned wisdom arises from struggle—Mira receives insight ("realized," "understood") as exposition. The echo-as-living-note conceit is poeticized rather than dramatized, and the ending's "promise" resolves ambiguity into tidy satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is overtly stated: "the mathematics of emotion," "ambiguous loss was not an absence but a transformation—a subtraction that made room for a new addition," and "grief plus hope equals a new kind of growth" are spelled out in exposition rather than emerging from image or dramatic irony. The glass eyes and mosaic stone recur but function as symbolic props without constraining choice or accumulating pressure toward a non-literal insight. The final image—luminous petals shedding—offers visual resonance, yet it arrives as convenient miracle rather than a reweighting earned by prior particulars. The orchard's "buried optimism" is asserted in the opening and closing without intermediate complication or earned shift in meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme (visibility as acknowledgment of loss, methodical kindness as archive work) emerges through image and motif—rain-smell sense memory, phantom patrons, cache as conduit. Yet the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "methodical kindness would continue to echo, guiding future seekers," which edges into Thematic Echo territory. The sense-memory map and blue glow offer concrete particulars, preventing full collapse into abstraction, but the ending does not pose a resonant question or ambiguity; it delivers a fulfilled promise without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme—sustainable change via release of control—is articulated directly in exposition ("the most sustainable change was always sustained by releasing control," "reconstruct by releasing control") rather than arising from dramatized conflict. The linden leaf functions as a recurring image that shifts from amber to green, and the mycelium bridge offers a concrete particular. However, the ending paragraph tells the lesson ("a reminder that sustainable growth thrives on letting nature reconstruct") instead of allowing the final image to reweight prior material without a stated moral. The paradox of control/release is asserted more than embodied in choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the water wars, mist-collection, and the protagonist's art as a processing tool. The amber brooch as "compass" and the rain trails as "conduits of memory" offer a non-literal answer to how meaning persists in ruin. However, the final paragraph tilts toward summary: "she had given it art to remember the water wars by" states the thesis rather than letting the image resonate. The exchange framework is conceptually clear but the lack of on-page cost softens the thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("everyday magic," "unseen forces," "bright darkness") is declared repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete events. The final paragraph moralizes: "unseen forces, when embraced, can magnify the magic hidden in everyday breath." No earned epiphany or non-literal answer; the piece tells its thesis rather than dramatizing it. Recurrent images (shadows, cave pearl, bright darkness) are decorative rather than constraining or reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—stitching scattered memory into communal story, letting gaps breathe—emerges from particulars (the valve, the harbor, the gathered fragments). The archivist's shift from "lonely exile into communal chorus" offers a thematic claim, but the ending does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer; instead it restates the mission ("to connect the scattered songs of the sea") without fresh inflection. The final image (setting out with the valve) reads as continuation rather than conceptual repricing. Subtext operates in the valve's shift from triumph-herald to repository, but the piece leans toward direct thematic statement ("his reactively visionary approach," "letting the sea's own silence tell part of the tale") rather than trusting image.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges implicitly—hidden narratives, the archive as living conduit—and the final ledger image reweights the "fortress" from stone to archive without overt moralizing. Yet the insight ("she had become the conduit") is asserted rather than earned by a specific on-page struggle, and the closing "promise to return each hour" reads as thematic echo rather than dramatized choice with cost. The phantom punch and constellations recur purposefully, but their symbolic weight is overstated ("humanity's hidden narratives") without grounding in a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy or ambiguity. The piece resists banality yet leans toward abstraction in its final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of memory-as-journey and doubt-entwining-with-wonder emerges through the tile, verses, and whale arcs. The final image attempts to land thematic resonance ("unheard symphony…not a sound to hear but a feeling to inhabit"), but this is stated rather than earned through scene particulars. The tower-as-sanctuary idea recurs but remains concept-level; no concrete choice tests it. No stated moral appears, which is a strength, but the ending asserts its answer rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of goodbye as transition rather than ending emerges through image and event. The amulet dissolving into dust and the immortal's farewell to emptiness attempt resonance, but the twin's on-page articulation—"When we say goodbye, the world does not end; it folds into another plane"—approaches Thematic Echo by stating the thesis directly. The final image gestures toward transformation but relies on summary ("newfound purpose") rather than non-literal reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—alchemy of fairness, liquefying rigid ideologies, reciprocity beyond borders—emerges from the ink pot's ritual use and is woven through imagery of fluidity versus rigidity. The piece resists overt moralizing in dialogue, letting the contract's glow serve as the thematic answer. However, the final paragraph shifts into abstraction ("death and vitality are twin vessels for change") and the key insight about law versus shared willingness is told rather than discovered through dramatized friction. The ink pot's recurrence charges the ending, but the thematic question is resolved by assertion rather than particulars that force reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme—"invented histories as bridges across time's chasm"—is articulated directly in the penultimate paragraph rather than emerging from concrete events and choices. The piece offers ambient meditation on refracting time and silence but no conceptual repricing with undeniable cost; the final image of walking "deeper into the bonsai corridors" simply restates the initial posture. The thematic statement in "he understood that invented histories were not lies but bridges" is explicit moralizing that replaces earned resonance, triggering the −0.5 to −0.8 penalty for thematic echo in the closing stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (memory, erasure, identity) emerges from concrete particulars—death certificate error, poison label, overheard fragments—and avoids overt moralizing until the final beat. The ending offers a thesis statement ("a purpose that no death certificate could erase") that verbalizes rather than images the thematic question. One positive: the layering metaphor recurs with shifting texture (paper, filament, palimpsest), though it does not constrain choice or charge the closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme—myths endure through art and curiosity—is stated outright in the penultimate third: "myths survive when retold through art, sound, and the stubborn optimism." The cello and seashell recur, but their shifting meanings are explained rather than embodied. The final image (sunrise, light step) gestures toward resonance but lacks the cost or ambiguity that would invite reflection. Thematic echo in late paragraphs replaces scene pressure (−0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—community resilience against commodification—emerges through the graffiti network and the foundation chip as symbols of collective memory, which is purposeful. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly ("even the smallest piece can anchor an entire community") and the phoenix mural functions as an on-the-nose rebirth icon rather than a non-literal answer. Mira's role as "culture shock absorber" who "learned to balance chaos with order" restates the premise without dramatizing a cost or contradiction that reweights it. Subtext operates in the encoded graffiti conceit but flattens when the ending explains rather than enacts the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (memory, witness, endings) emerges through recurring images (hourglass grain, dawning hush, nightwatch) but the final whisper to the summit ("May the grain's story travel") is an overt thematic statement rather than a non-literal answer earned by scene pressure. The archivists' future "dawning hush" is told, not dramatized. The grain as "captured breath of time" risks symbolic convenience; its resonance is asserted more than built from prior micro-costs.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of mending/bridging and blind sight crafting futures emerges from particulars (water-refraction as measuring tool, vapor as partner). The final paragraph's "bridge between broken things and new horizons" and "luminous futures" edge toward stated moral rather than resonant image. Subtext operates in the whispered address to the drone and the mist's "quiet partnership," but the ending summarizes theme rather than letting the repaired wing's behavior answer the question non-literally.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the ice/water/silence triad and the recurring convergence motif; "Kaltwasser" and the final vein of water offer a resonant answer to the question of origins without sermonizing. The falcon, phrasebook, and glass condensation reprise with shifted meaning at closure. However, "worrying tranquility" and the dread/hope pairing feel asserted more than embodied in contradictory action. The ending reweights prior material but stops short of full conceptual or emotional cost—Mara smiles, ready and hopeful, with terror mentioned but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme (community restoration, balance between stone and spirit) is declared overtly in multiple lines ("restore shared balance," "spirit renewed") rather than emerging from concrete events. The ebony fork and cobblestone rhythm are mentioned frequently but do not accumulate fresh meaning or constrain a final choice; they remain static symbols. No non-literal resonance or reweighting occurs at the ending; instead, exposition summarizes the moral ("unseen foundation upon which the revived community would forever thrive"). The piece tells its theme rather than dramatizing it through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of ephemeral beauty and shared wonder emerges through the vial and hush imagery, avoiding overt moralizing. The recurring "gathered hush" and "lonesome splendor" phrases attempt resonance, but the final act—uncorking the vial to share eternity—states the theme rather than reweighting it through a non-literal image. The piece gestures toward complexity (solitude vs. sharing, instinct vs. purpose) but resolves tidily: Mara gets everything, the world inhales eternity, no ambiguity remains. Mid-band for thematic presence without challenging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.8)
    The redemption-from-false-alarms premise is stated repeatedly ("every warning is a thread, not a wall") rather than dramatized through particulars. The lattice and hush function as floating symbols without grounding in concrete choice or trade-off. The final paragraph moralizes ("became a beacon of truth") instead of offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. No counter-reading or ambiguity; the story telegraphs its moral.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of debt and redemption is stated rather than earned through specific struggle. The final image—blossoms and a pulsing bead—does not reweight prior material or answer a central question the narrative dramatized. "Lovingly venomous" and "mournful elation" remain oxymoronic labels without embodied tension or conceptual cost. Travelers' gratitude is told, not shown, and adds a sermonizing frame. No non-literal resonance; the ending explains its own meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of renewal and hope emerging from ruin is stated rather than earned. "Orchid solace," "broken precedents," and "ruin to reverence" recur as labels without evolving meaning or concrete grounding in choices. The ending's final image ("sew the world's wounds with gentle, orchid-soft hands") restates the premise in abstract terms rather than reweighting it through a non-literal answer. The piece gestures toward complexity ("courage to break the old laws") but dramatizes no conflict between law and vision, making the thematic claim ornamental. Subtext is minimal; all meanings are surfaced in narration.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of faith restored through patient wandering emerges from particulars: sundial base, root-veins, bone hymns, dawn light. The final image (altar catching golden rays, travelers guided by stories) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the roots' reverent hands and the quiet voice's gratitude. However, "interrupted journeys," "purposeful wandering," and "cautious enchantment" recur as near-synonyms without fresh inflection or complication; the thematic resolution feels predetermined rather than tested by counter-pressure or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Margins" and "meaning" are stated repeatedly ("the margins held the most luminous stories") rather than emerging from concrete action. The final image—letter vibrating, city unfolding like a storybook—offers visual metaphor but no earned insight or non-literal answer to a dramatized question. The piece reads as allegory announcing its thesis ("futuristic nostalgia," "carefully inventive experiment") instead of trusting scene work to generate resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme—truth in suppressed voices, wisdom disguised as foolishness—is stated rather than earned through concrete action. The final sentence ("truth could be sewn") summarizes the premise instead of letting the image resonate. Motifs (the flame, the tapestry, autumn leaves) recur but do not constrain choice or charge the closure; they are decorative rather than load-bearing. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into an unambiguous triumph without plausible counter-reading or moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of apology and release emerges through recurring images (unsent letters, condensation script, fireflies) and the final claim that "the apology had never needed words, only the act of evoking truth." Yet this insight is stated rather than dramatized—no on-page friction tests whether silence or speech carries greater cost. The metaphor of letters-as-fireflies offers lyric resonance, but the piece never interrogates the paradox of "fierce tenderness" or the ethical weight of withholding versus revealing. Thematic ambiguity dissolves into tidy affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of healing/grafting emerges from coral metaphor and translator's stated goal, but remains abstract. The final image (droplet on plaster) attempts resonance but is unearned by prior conflict. "Shared anxieties" as a concept is named repeatedly without dramatized particulars that test or complicate it. The phrase "lotus-hearted ache" recurs as a mood label rather than an insight earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme emerges implicitly (art as catalyst for joy, light versus shadow) but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "May we always find joy where shadows once held sway" and "how a mural artist who paints with light can revive a world." Subtext operates in some images (the fresco fragment as "beating heart," chandeliers of trees), yet the ending resolves into platitudes rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The piece gestures toward complexity but settles for tidy affirmation without ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of curiosity versus certainty is legible and recurs through imagery (murals dissolving, reflected sound, nested awakenings). However, the piece leans heavily on prompt-language abstractions—"exchange certainty for curiosity," "nested awakenings"—without grounding them in concrete, irreversible action. The final image of Lena laughing and walking away gestures at transformation but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. The hobo nickel and sound waves remain symbolic conveniences rather than particulars that force a non-obvious thematic reckoning. The resonance is asserted rather than earned through specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of rebellion against thought taxation is stated rather than emerged from concrete choices with visible consequence. The "living cipher" and "secret language club" function as prompt-echo labels without irony or counter-reading. The final image ("the next warp would come with the next dawn") offers cyclical promise but not a non-literal reweighting of prior material. Lysander articulates the thematic premise in line six ("after thoughts become taxable…"), triggering a thematic echo deduction of −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of transmuting pain into beauty is stated explicitly multiple times ("photosynthesize pain into beauty," "blossom armistice") rather than emerging from concrete action. The galaxy postcard and lullabies serve as symbolic conveniences introduced to enact the thesis without friction. The final image—"reef-shadow joy, blooming eternally"—declaims rather than reconfigures, and the child-finds-shell frame dissolves the poet's arc into a generic cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through metaphor—extinct feelings, forgotten names, resurrected echoes—but remains abstract rather than grounded in concrete choice-cost friction. The final image (refilling the candle, whispering a name) restates the premise without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to the central question. "Foxglove regret" dissolves into "gratitude" via summary assertion rather than earned transformation, and the traveler's moment offers surface beauty without thematic tension or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.5)
    The covenant/broken-trust motif recurs and the final pledge ("no silence would ever again eclipse these pages") attempts thematic closure, yet the promise arrives as assertion rather than earned insight. The symphonies-of-truth concept remains metaphorical decoration; no particular reveals a non-literal answer to the central question. Thematic resonance is diluted by direct statement in the final beats rather than emergent from scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of reconciling preservation and progress emerges through "encrypted compassion" and the water-as-empathy metaphor. However, the concept remains abstract and untested—no council debate, no cost of choosing one value over another. The ending states rather than enacts thematic resolution: "each drop a word in the ongoing encrypted compassion" is sermonic. The amphitheater's breath and the chain's cipher offer evocative images but do not complicate or deepen the thematic question through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—renewal layered over loss—emerges through recurring images (dust, pigeons, meteorite glow) and one apt particular: "moss blooming over stone." However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "reinvention does not erase, but layers the old with the new" and "balance and memory can coexist." The ending asserts thematic resonance rather than earning it through a non-literal image that reweights prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is overtly stated in the final lines ("the true distance one must travel is the space between wonder and understanding") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. Motifs—thresholds, distances, grain, fractured hush—recur as ornament without constraining choice or accumulating pressure. The child's "featherly determined" lineage and the mother's voice are asserted but never dramatized. No ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the ending moralizes instead of resonating. Thematic echo penalty applies for the explain-everything final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of belonging emerges through repeated abstractions ("the rhythm of belonging," "the cosmos of belonging") rather than specific, dramatized particulars. The burnt feather and fireflies recur but their meanings are asserted ("the ash remembered the star it fell from") rather than earned through prior friction. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the luminous respite...was the soft engine that powered the cosmos of belonging" is a thematic statement rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. No non-literal answer to a central question; instead, platitudes about shared breath and universal patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.3)
    The piece attempts a theme of memory fragility and the restoration of forgotten paths through emotional resonance, emerging from the seed-collection and color-translation motif. However, thematic articulation is front-loaded and static: "recollection is a fragile tide that recedes before memory fades" is stated twice in near-identical phrasing without complication. The final realization—"the disappearing paths were not lost, but merely awaiting the right emotional resonance"—declares the theme rather than earning it through scene pressure. The closing image ("her heart a mosaic of hopeful sorrow") leans on prompt labels instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—order from chaos, serenading monotony—emerges through recurring images (bishops, ink, tide, violin) rather than on-page pressure. The bishops and X-mark recur but never constrain a choice or deepen contradiction; they illustrate the concept rather than test it. The ending attempts resonance ("echo of his violin and the faint imprint") but replaces earned insight with atmospheric reprise. No character friction or ambiguity complicates the thesis; the piece philosophizes about creativity without dramatizing its cost or limits.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece gestures toward themes of exile-as-bridge and mortal-versus-celestial art, and the moonstone dust returns in the final image ("settled on the petals"). However, thematic resonance is stated rather than earned: "exile within her dissolve[d]," "universe expand[ed] within her," "gaps...filled with possibilities" are abstract claims unsupported by on-page friction or discovery. The ending summarizes a moral ("inviting them to choose their own gaps") instead of dramatizing a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (finding worth in the ordinary) emerges through recurring images: stone, ripples, glass, light. However, it is stated rather than earned—"value lives in every ripple," "hidden ledger balance itself"—and the final paragraph moralizes directly. No epiphany arises from struggle or specific cost. The prism and noctilucent imagery accumulate without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of translating pain into shared understanding is stated repeatedly ("universal language," "each wound...into a story," "pain found its voice") rather than emerging from concrete particulars or choices. The cracked porcelain box is deployed as an overt symbol, and the ending's "cascade of light" literalizes the metaphor without earned resonance or ambiguity. Abstract philosophizing ("the true bargain had never been about buying innocence, but about gifting it back") replaces scene pressure, and the final paragraph moralizes directly. The piece gestures toward complexity (scars as lenses, hard softness) but resolves into a tidy epiphany that feels imposed rather than discovered through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (hope as collective measurement, equations woven into community) emerges through image and motif—balloons, decorative patterns, the gauge-as-mirror metaphor—rather than overt statement, which elevates the score. However, the final declarations ("the gauge was not a broken relic but a mirror," "the mathematics of hope were etched into the world itself") lean toward thesis summary. Recurrence (balloons, spirals, decorations) is purposeful but does not constrain choice; the ending offers conceptual resonance without the non-literal inflection or ambiguity that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—memory as living, shared architecture—emerges from the film-negative method and the wall-dream conceit. The ending's "collective imagination that lives in every stone whisper" shifts from solitary archive to communal ritual, a valid thematic deepening. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit statement ("the true map was not of corridors, but...") where a charged image would have resonated more. Subtext operates in the film-as-lantern motif but doesn't fully escape the prompt's allegorical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme is announced rather than earned through specific events: "possibilities are merely reflections waiting for a borrowed heartbeat to awaken them" is direct moralizing. Motifs ("borrowed heartbeat," "dusky harmony," "coded lullabies") recur as labels without constraining choices or accruing new meaning. The ending declares resonance ("mirrors will always reveal a new horizon") instead of offering a non-literal image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme emerges from images (ebony clipboard, celestial dance, swords on altar) rather than statement, which is sound. However, the final paragraph lapses into summary and near-moralizing: "the price of redemption had been taken," "the first true step toward anchoring ideals in practice." The terrace-as-testament and the hymn's "flawed beauty" gesture toward resonance but lack the concrete particular that would reweight prior material without stating a lesson. Thematic echo penalties apply for the explain-everything closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of cruelty entwined with preservation emerges through the manufactured drought and sentimental motive, but the final image states rather than dramatizes the paradox: "amoral yet tender" is declared, not shown through a choice that costs him something. The phrase "a song from silence" in the penultimate paragraph borders on thematic echo. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into a tidy moral frame where "even in a world of engineered scarcity, a single act of release could carve a song from silence."

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of conformity versus individual voice emerges through image (lullaby, echoes, sanctuary) rather than statement. The final image—"rebellion, once a hush, now a hymn"—attempts to reweigh prior material but slides into abstract moralizing rather than a non-literal, resonant answer grounded in particulars. The courtesan's internal arc (chaste paradox → defiant singer) is asserted more than dramatized through specific struggle. Subtext operates in the prism's mechanics and the "alarming serenity" tone, yet the ending's promise ("world forever changed") feels like summary rather than earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—ethical storytelling that reverses exploitation—is stated repeatedly but emerges from authorial assertion rather than dramatized particulars. The puppet shows, strings as "lifelines," and reversal metaphor are told concepts, not shown through concrete action or earned insight. The final image ("strings of conscience unspooling...like ribbons of starlight") is abstract and decorative, offering no non-literal answer or resonant reconfiguration. The piece leans heavily on prompt labels ("half-lit epiphany," "meteor hush," "subversive puppet shows") as thematic shorthand without grounding them in specific events or moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.3)
    "Blushing stillness" and "interrupted cadence" recur as thematic phrases, and the piece attempts to honor forgotten travelers through image and gesture. However, the theme is stated rather than earned—Lira's final smile and "guardian" pose articulate the moral directly. No fresh insight emerges from specific struggle; the "quiet anthem" and "ripple forward" tell rather than show consequence. The lyric mode coheres but lacks cost-driven specificity to charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (memory as living conduit against silence) emerges from image and action rather than statement, and the rope's transformation offers a concrete thematic anchor. The ending's resonance—each name a thread in a luminous tapestry—avoids overt moralizing. However, the phrase "testimony that memory, once transcribed, could never truly freeze" edges into thematic echo, and the ease of Mara's success undercuts moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of paths choosing walkers emerges through image and the directive's rewriting, avoiding overt moralizing until late. The phrase "paths do not merely lead; they listen, they decide, and they reward the precise playfulness of seekers" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward Thematic Echo, summarizing the premise in prompt-like language rather than letting the final image do the work. The wafer seal's return and the bunker's hum offer resonance, but the vortex's convenient resolution flattens the conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of measurement/calculation bridging mortal and cosmic appears in recurring vocabulary ("ledger," "measure," "accounting," "empirically ironic") but is stated more than enacted. The final paragraph moralizes: "even the most empirically ironic calculations can uncloak devotion when rendered through careful schematics." The magic square tile recurs but shifts meaning only in summary; no specific on-page image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. The piece abstracts its central question—how frugality and cosmic ambition intersect—into prompt-like phrasing rather than letting particulars answer it.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Cellular memory" and "shifting grace" are prompt labels repeated without scene embodiment or thematic friction. The final image ("carried its memory in every cell, a quiet anthem of peace") states the theme rather than earning it through particulars. The wanderer's lullaby is a stock epiphany—told not discovered. The piece lacks a resonant, non-literal answer; instead it delivers a moral summary in the final paragraph ("Thus the sanctuary remained a beacon..."). Subtext is absent; all meaning is directly stated.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of "erasing boundaries" is stated directly ("boundaries are merely shadows of fear"; "not the removal of lines, but the weaving together of separate songs") rather than emerging from concrete action and cost. The final image—Arlen resting, the dream's heartbeat matching the orchard's pulse—gestures toward unity but lacks an earned non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The piece leans on abstractions ("renewal," "expand," "erasing the space between") instead of letting particulars generate thematic resonance. The closing tone is serene and summative, typical of a prompt-driven moral rather than a lived discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges implicitly through the orchard's cycle and the mending metaphor, avoiding overt moralizing until the final lines ("every fracture holds a seed of renewal"), which verge on platitude. The "accidental wisdom" motif recurs but remains abstract; no concrete image reweights prior material at closure. The ending declares triumph and pact rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, preventing entry to the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (knowledge as nonlinear inheritance, loops rather than lines) emerges through imagery—orchard blossoms, bathroom mosaics, constellation maps—rather than overt statement until the final paragraph's "knowledge is a garden that grows in loops" borders on moralizing. The pistachio shell recurs with accumulating meaning (seed → void → key → map), charging the closure image. However, the ending offers a resonant answer without narrative friction; the "simply complicated truth" resolves into comfort rather than maintaining the disquiet promised by tone.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "unheard symphony" and "library of unlearned lessons" are poetic conceits repeated without concrete stakes or reweighting at closure. The final image—Selene stepping through a portal—resets rather than transforms prior material. Theme remains abstract and untested by character friction; no genuine trade-off emerges between curiosity and cost, making the resonance ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.7)
    "Trapped freedom" and "unkindled solace" are invoked repeatedly but remain abstract labels rather than embodied tensions. The final line ("promised to catalog the silence of forgotten seas") gestures at theme without a non-literal answer rooted in prior particulars. The "true recapture was not of objects, but of stories" reads as thematic echo rather than earned wisdom from dramatized struggle. No counter-reading is invited; the piece resolves into tidy epiphany. The motifs (mirrors, ink, carousel) recur but do not constrain choice or charge closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.7)
    The "fables of absence" theme emerges through recurring images (missing door, unfinished epic, negotiations never concluded, stories never present) and the final insight that "absence can be harnessed" reconfigures prior material without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the seal's twin-spiral and the rope's intertwined verses. However, the theme leans toward abstraction—"what is missing shapes the world as surely as what is there"—rather than arising solely from concrete particulars. The final chronicle entry and Mara's contented listening avoid platitude yet feel didactic, offering a thesis ("clarity thrives when the unknown is acknowledged") that edges toward thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—balance between echo and silence, not absence of sound—emerges through the mapkeeper's realization and the echo chamber stone's action rather than explicit moralizing. The ice patterns and "bloom of hush" recur with shifting weight, and the final image of the mapkeeper continuing his vigil offers a resonant answer to "finding quiet in the storm." However, the closing lines drift toward abstract thesis ("purpose was clear") and the promise whispered to silence edges into declaration. The piece avoids heavy-handed morals but does not fully resist thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (pattern vs. chance, renewal from brokenness) is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from dramatized conflict. The final paragraph moralizes with "proving that even the smallest coincidence can kindle a future," violating the no-sermonizing rule. "Thistle-blown hope" recurs as a motif but lacks the constraint or reweighting required for earned resonance. The retrocognitive shard's memory of the towers' fall is told, not shown altering present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of collective memory as geometry and echo is stated directly and repeatedly rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The archivist articulates the thesis ("the act of examining shadow lengths at monuments was a ritual to trace the invisible lines of shared remembrance") in prompt-like language, replacing scene pressure with abstract philosophizing. The crystal and shadow motifs recur but do not constrain choice or charge the closure; they serve as decorative symbols. The final image ("his identity, like the shadows he traced, would forever be a collage of shared memory") is a tidy moral rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme ("art filters despair") emerges through repeated imagery—sparks, mosaic tiles, chants—but is explicitly stated in the penultimate paragraph: "to filter despair through art, to let hope sparkle in darkness." This thematic echo replaces resonance; the final image does not reweight prior material through irony or tension, only restates the premise. The mosaic and rag knot recur without shifting meaning. No counter-reading or ambiguity survives the sermon-like closure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of transition periods and time's texture is stated repeatedly in lyric language ("time is not a line but a sea," "invisible lines that bind transition periods"). However, it remains abstract—no particular event or choice embodies the discovery. The final image offers mood but no conceptual repricing or non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The proverb about tides is generic; the jade cicada's silence is ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme (cramped space holding sky-vastness; fear dissolving through collected silences) emerges from imagery and Lio's arc. The final doll-on-table moment and mother's smile attempt resonance, but "understand that a cramped space could hold the vastness of a sky, provided one learned to stretch the contracted heart" reads as overt thesis-statement rather than scene-earned insight. The stretched-contracted motif recurs purposefully, yet the ending tells the reader what to feel instead of charging the image to do that work.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.5)
    Theme (silence as comfort, transit as meditation) emerges from images but is over-stated in lines like "to teach silence how to comfort" and "let quiet become your guide." The final paragraph's "mission fulfilled" and "Dreams lingered" drift into soft moralizing rather than a resonant non-literal answer. Motifs (storm glass, silence, train whistle echo) recur but do not shift meaning; they accumulate texture without conceptual repricing. Subtext is thin; dialogue is absent and gesture minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.3)
    The futuristic-nostalgia fusion of "analog and digital," "memory and possibility" threads through imagery consistently. Yet theme remains asserted rather than earned—"balance between past and onward dreams" is stated, not dramatized through a choice with visible cost. The final image (greeting the sunrise, vowing to record) summarizes meaning rather than offering a non-literal answer. No complexity or counter-reading emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme ("isolation as paradoxical renewal") emerges through pattern and image rather than statement, which is a strength. However, the final paragraph supplies a tidy moral summary ("no longer as a barrier but as a bridge forged from his own scars") that replaces scene pressure with assertion (−0.6). The doorknocker ring recurs but is left as a "relic" without reweighting prior material through the keeper's on-page cost. Subtext operates in image ("luminescent veins," "loaded emptiness") yet the ending's conceptual repricing is told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme of honoring honesty over greed and the "quantum promise" covenant emerges through image and recurring motif (bolt, mushrooms, glitchy texts), avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph. The final sentence ("the world would reward those who volunteered honesty over greed, and the pressure of truth would always spawn brilliance") crosses into thesis statement, abstracting what the prior images had begun to embody. The manager's return and the "literal sparkle" line in the final third feel like thematic echo rather than earned subtext. Recurrence of the mushroom glow and shadowseam does charge the ending image, but the conceptual repricing is weakened by the explain-everything tone in the closing moves.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of intuition bridging gaps in history emerges organically from the gramophone's use and the scroll's confession. The notion that "ending a line" is about transformation rather than destruction appears in the final paragraph as an explicit statement rather than arising through image or action. The scroll's content—betrayal by ignorance—hints at complexity but is not embodied in a choice or friction that tests the theme. The ending offers a coherent thematic image but moralizes it rather than letting resonance accumulate.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme of loyalty as song versus chain emerges in the final third ("loyalty was not a chain but a song"), but this insight is stated rather than earned through prior particulars. The marionette theater program and moss recur, yet their meaning does not shift through the knight's choices; they accumulate as symbols without dramatic friction. The ending attempts resonance through poetic assertion ("murmured allegiance... sealing the pact with a kiss of frost") but offers no non-literal answer grounded in scene work. Subtext is thin; the text tells its theme explicitly in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme (forgotten histories deserve care) is stated directly rather than emergent: "her work of magnifying small kindnesses could turn a single button into a beacon for the unknown." The final image (dust rising again) does not reweigh prior material; it confirms the premise without complication. No moral ambiguity or counter-reading is offered—the button simply enables endless kindnesses. The "Thematic Echo" penalty applies: the final lines articulate the thesis in prompt-like language without scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme ("revised histories," resistance against indifference) emerges consistently but remains stated rather than dramatized. The lagoon, puddle map, and transmitter function as ornamental symbols rather than particulars that constrain choice or complicate moral calculus. The final lines ("quiet persistence of coded freedom") deliver a thesis statement instead of a resonant image that reweights prior material. No counter-reading or ambiguity is present; the regime is flatly indifferent, Mara purely noble, and the outcome unambiguously hopeful without visible friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges through imagery—silence as preservation, music as erasure, fog as mediation—without overt statement. The final image (saxophonist disappearing into legend) offers a resonant but somewhat stock resolution: the solitary artist fading after his work is done. The piece resists platitudes and invites reflection on language, prophecy, and quiet power. However, the thematic question (can silence prevent catastrophe?) is answered tidily rather than reweighted with ambiguity, and the ending leans toward sermonizing ("his whispered lullaby keeping the prophecy forever quiet") in its final assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.7)
    A theme of memory, care, and reciprocity between human and forest emerges from the monument-building and leaf-reading actions. However, the final image dissolves into abstract assertion—"sealing the pact between human care and forest memory"—rather than a concrete, non-literal answer. The moonstone speck recurs but functions as a plot device without reweighting meaning. No earned epiphany arises from struggle; the regional folklore motif is told rather than dramatized through conflicting interpretations or hidden costs. The ending's "mossy delight" and gratitude feel thematically tidy without complexity or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty versus seeking perfect order emerges from Mara's craft and the compass metaphor, and the brazier inscription makes it explicit. However, the final beat articulates the theme in near-prompt language ("uncertainly certain that the future will always be a swirl of hidden currents beneath the ashes") rather than letting image and action alone do the work. The compass-as-metaphor is stated outright ("she understood that the compass was a metaphor"), violating show-through-particulars. The ending offers a conceptual answer but with declarative framing instead of resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the kintsugi metaphor and the weight-of-names motif, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraphs. The gold seam resonates as both repair and self-knowledge, and the coin's "balance restored" offers a non-literal answer. However, the ending edges toward thematic echo: "the names that shaped her world" articulates the thesis rather than letting the image speak. Subtext operates in gesture (the coin trembling, gold snaking), but the piece risks tidy resolution—"quiet gratitude" softens regret without friction or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of grief-to-laughter emerges from events rather than assertion, and the crocodile's tooth as healing artifact carries modest symbolic weight. However, the final image ("glowing tooth...beacon") states the theme overtly rather than trusting particulars. The joke about a goat conducting a choir feels whimsical but disconnected from prior material, reducing thematic resonance. "Luminous ache" recurs but remains abstract, not anchored in specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of mercy as calculated through remembered pain is stated outright in the equation and the final paragraph's moral summary ("the willingness to brace oneself against one's own shadows"). Abstractions like "geometry of compassion" and "displaced yet rooted" are repeated without grounding in specific action. The pewter strap's transformation from shackle to beacon is symbolic but not earned by prior particulars. The ending explains the theme rather than letting it emerge from scene pressure, and the final line delivers a thesis statement instead of a resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of honoring overlooked histories is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete action. The lighthouse fragment recurs but shifts meaning only through assertion ("its essence now a shared memory") without dramatic cost. The final paragraph delivers direct thematic summary ("your stories will never dim") that replaces scene pressure with platitude. No resonant non-literal answer to a central question is earned; the piece substitutes lyric decoration for thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of acknowledging forgotten souls emerges organically from the investigation and the ledger discovery. The motif "cracks in the façade" recurs but operates mostly as metaphor rather than constraint. The ending offers a quiet answer—restoration of memory lifts burden—but the resolution is tidy and sentimental ("ghosts' gratitude settle like a feather") without the ambiguity or cost that would deepen thematic resonance. No counter-reading or moral complexity complicates the protagonist's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of "negotiating reality" and "rustling awakenings rewrite immutable codes" is stated rather than enacted through concrete stakes. The bottled whisper and frost-spiral method are symbolic furniture; their recurrence does not constrain choice or shift meaning—they illustrate the theme rather than dramatize it. The final image ("compress the infinite," "testimony") declares wonder without showing the cost or contradiction that would make it resonate. Lacks the non-literal answer; instead, the story sermonizes its own thesis in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme emerges (loss/creation, revolution as cultural synthesis) but remains stated rather than earned through particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the true revolution was no longer a battle of arms but a symphony of mirrors, storms, and verses"—a thesis announcement rather than resonant image. "Burnished sorrow" recurs as label without shifting meaning. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into tidy affirmation without ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.4)
    The covenant-of-rust motif and the light/midnight binary gesture toward theme (truthful metal, reclaimed light), but the story does not earn a non-literal answer through specific struggle. The final image—music box playing, Alder promising to guard the chamber—states the moral rather than enacting it. "Tinkersong wonder" and "hopeful tune" tell rather than resonate. Subtext is minimal; all thematic weight is declared in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges through recurring images (petrichor, hinges, silence, thresholds) and the conceptual claim that "the place where explanations fail was not a location but a state of quiet surrender." The water staircase and fossils pulse with faint thematic resonance. However, the ending states the thesis rather than earning it through a non-literal answer rooted in particulars. The phrase "hinged awakenings" is invoked but never defined through action or consequence, and the final image (walking toward rain clouds, ready to "delve deeper") repeats the opening posture without reweighting prior material. The piece tilts toward allegory without dramatic life.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of art bridging time emerges through images (lantern slide, carved compass, timewoven alliances) but defaults to abstract declaration rather than specific on-page tension. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "reimagined not just a structure but an entire way of seeing," "learning rise anew." No counter-reading or ambiguity remains; the "child holding a tiny carved boat" epiphany resolves into tidy self-discovery without friction. Motifs recur but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of nocturnal bloom as a "promise whispered in the dawning hush" emerges repeatedly but is stated rather than dramatized through specific, non-literal action. The postcards, glass, and flowers recur but function as ornamental motifs rather than particulars that constrain choice or charge the closure with earned cost. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "the dawning hush was not silence but a promise that even the coldest winter yields to a softer, brighter bloom"—a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure with assertion, triggering the explicit-moralizing penalty. The story gestures toward a question about darkness and light but resolves it through convenient epiphany rather than ambiguous, resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of recovered memory versus erasure is stated overtly ("reclaimed memory," "suppressed voices") rather than emerging from particulars. The obsidian lagoon and violet-glowing brass panels gesture toward symbolic resonance but feel ornamental—neither object constrains a choice or reweights prior material at closure. The final image ("parley of sand and sky had forged a new covenant") is abstract moralizing, not a concrete scene moment. "Searing reverie" is repeated as a label without embodied cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated rather than earned: "comfort lies in truth," "imagination can still forge new beginnings," "memory as catalyst" appear as abstract claims disconnected from scene pressure. The amber bottle, paper lanterns, and memory motifs recur without shifting meaning or constraining choice. The ending moralizes ("civilizations are not built on stone alone, but on the fragile glass of remembered desire") instead of offering a resonant image. No coherent question is posed or reweighted by the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—memory, prophecy as preservation, dead languages bridging past and future—is coherent and surfaces through image and motif (wax cylinders, dead tongues, children's questions). However, the final vellum-sealing does not reweight the question non-literally; it restates the premise as a loop ("preservation became a promise") without tension or surprise. The piece offers atmospheric resonance but no earned insight that challenges or deepens the initial premise. Subtext operates in image but closure is stated rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of time as texture and cyclical inheritance is announced ("borrowed time," "cycle of wild serenity") rather than emerging from concrete conflict. The story abstracts its central concept into metaphysical claims without dramatizing cost or complexity. The final image offers a tidy moral ("borrowed time could be felt, cultivated, and returned") that resolves ambiguity mechanically. Motifs (acorn cap, vortex, mist) are mentioned repeatedly but do not constrain choice or charge the closure with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—listening over noise, calm in chaos—emerges clearly from action and image, not from thesis statements. The recurring "hush" and the bell's transformation from "harsh clang" to "low, steady tone" support the concept through particulars. However, the ending's thematic echo ("favor listening over noise, a quiet rebellion") verges on summarizing rather than reweighting, and the sanctuary's transformation feels too tidy to leave lingering ambiguity or cost. The solstice ceremony offers a resonant backdrop but no counter-reading complicates the affirmed moral.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of "flourishing stillness" and strength-in-vulnerability pervades every paragraph but is stated rather than enacted: "to find strength in vulnerability" appears as motivation label, and the final paragraph declares "vulnerability turn to a quiet fire" without prior scene work to earn the shift. The yellow lantern and the star-path motif recur, yet their meaning does not evolve—each mention restates reverence without complication. The station's "language of stars" and "melody of creation and decay" veer into abstract philosophizing rather than emerging from concrete, character-particular experience. No counter-reading or moral ambiguity is offered; the piece resolves into tidy affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of silence, memory, and covenant emerges through recurring images (bees, ghosts, stained glass, honey) and the piece resists overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("the astonished recluse who had become a guardian of silence") rather than letting the image speak. The covenant motif is introduced and reiterated but never concretely tested, so the thematic weight remains abstract rather than earned through specific on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme—time's texture and memory as carrier—emerges from motifs (urn fragment, hourglass, garage-sale messages) but is stated rather than earned through specific, conflicted action. The final image ("tapestry she could walk through, line by line") offers a declarative answer without ambiguity or felt cost. Recurrence of the silo and fragment is present but does not reweight meaning at closure; the villagers' notes function as thematic echo rather than a non-literal resonance that complicates prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.6)
    The piece announces its theme repeatedly—"beauty thrives in the incomplete," "tending the incomplete was not mending but honoring the spaces between"—in place of dramatizing it through conflict. The phrase "woven dawns" recurs as a motif but without shifting meaning; it remains a decorative constant. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "a gentle rebellion against the demand for flawless endings," "dawns are forever woven from fragments." No concrete particular at the ending reweights prior material; instead, we receive a direct thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (interspecies connection, reverence for nature) emerges through repeated images (copper veins, stone pillars, botanical diary) and avoids overt moralizing until the final beat ("willingness of all beings to bind together"). The council's decision and Mara's vigor restoration edge toward tidy resolution, but the core concept of architectural secrets revealed by compassion is traceable. No epiphany is earned through struggle; the insight is declared rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of homecoming as pattern rather than place emerges from the amber's chemical signature and the tower's echo, grounded in concrete imagery. However, the final paragraph delivers an on-the-nose thematic statement ("home could be rebuilt wherever curiosity chose to settle") that replaces scene pressure with assertion. The "Convergence of Amber" archive note and "bronze quiet symphony of discovery" drift into meta-commentary. The amber's shift from luminous to "dim ember" offers a purposeful reprise, but the conceptual cost remains implicit rather than felt in Arin's choices or renunciations.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of renewal reclaiming scarred ground emerges from particulars (reef death, battlefield jetty, garden blooming) and the ending image reweights the premise without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the juxtaposition of war drum becoming heartbeat and dead languages approving the garden. However, the final paragraphs drift toward thematic summary ("even a battlefield could become a field of flowers," "narrow vastness") rather than letting the image speak. The piece resists tidy morals yet the recurrence of "narrow vastness" feels token rather than earned through constrained choice.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of memory, connection, and loss emerges through the waxed leaf and phonograph grooves. The phrase "translate distance into closeness" recurs but functions as a label rather than dramatized through particulars. The ending whispers a promise to the wind, approaching Resonant Reconfiguration, yet the thematic answer remains stated rather than shown through a non-literal final image. Subtext in "wild hush" and "violet-tinted sky" adds texture, but the closure reverts to direct declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is stated rather than dramatized: "turn confusion into exploration," "honored both loss and hope," and "every stretched moment held a compass awaiting its own revelation" are direct thesis sentences. The gilded compass rose and sketching ritual recur but function as symbols checked off rather than images that reweight prior material with cost. The final paragraph moralizes: "charting the unknown not because I sought to escape the past, but because I had learned…" The piece tells its theme without letting concrete action charge it.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges around wonder, playful courage, and bridging past and future, but it is articulated rather than enacted. The final paragraph explicitly states "his role was not merely theft or chivalry, but a bridge between the playful spirits of the past and the daring hearts of tomorrow" and "wonder never sleeps," foreclosing interpretive work. The sundial lid and chess pieces function as symbolic tokens rather than particulars that constrain choice and charge the closure. No counter-reading is invited; the protagonist's insight arrives as a tidy epiphany without ambiguity or cost. The piece gestures at complexity but resolves into a straightforward moral: embrace the unknown with open arms.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of preserving "small gestures" emerges concretely through the missing pawns and scroll detailing acts of bravery during the flood. The "luminous absence" motif recurs and charges the final image with some resonance. However, the ending ("she had become the historian of small gestures") states the theme rather than dramatizing it through a non-literal image, and Mira's smile arrives as declaration instead of earned complexity. The conceptual cost of this role—what she renounced or risked—remains unshown.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme—home as resonance rather than place—is asserted in the penultimate paragraph: "home was not a fixed point but a resonance." This is direct statement rather than emergent from scene particulars. The stone and feather recur but do not shift meaning; they perform the same function (reveal, translate) in each beat. The final image ("the shape of home became a melody") restates the thesis rather than offering a non-literal answer with cost. Thematic echo in the closing lines (−0.5 in Q5).

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (forgiveness as iterative opening moves) emerges from chess and thread motifs. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "forgiveness was not a single move but a series of openings" and "fierce repose… seemed to sing his redemption." Subtext is thin; the labyrinth's symbolic function is stated rather than discovered. The woven-hush motif recurs but does not shift meaning—it remains a static emblem of calm throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of forgiveness-through-refracted-truth emerges from images (spire, echoes, mural) and recurs across beats, avoiding direct statement. However, the townsfolk's collective "weight lift" and Mara's final calm resolution feel abstract; the story does not interrogate competing costs or invite ambiguity. The ending line "We are the echo" gestures toward resonance, but it arrives as assertion rather than a non-literal answer earned from prior particulars. Subtext operates in imagery but not in conflicted choices or ironic gaps between knowledge states.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.8)
    Kintsugi as theme—brokenness made beautiful through acceptance—is woven through imagery (golden seams, quilting memories, pockmarks closing) and gains resonance. However, the final declaration ("each crack holds the promise of a golden line") states the moral rather than letting the statue's shimmer and the alchemist's smile imply it. The piece resists true moral ambiguity; the alchemist's doubt melts cleanly and the world mends without friction or cost, reducing thematic complexity. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; most meaning is directly narrated.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of temporary eternity emerges through the recurring seashell motif and the painter's vow. The final canvas image attempts resonance, but the journey lacks contradiction—every discovery affirms the painter's intent without complication. "Intimate aloofness" and "promise solidify, not as a burden but as a quiet oath" verge on label-driven abstraction rather than dramatized insight. The oasis-as-test claim ("a way for the sea to gauge whether I would remain detached enough") tells rather than enacts thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—the paradoxical power of softness over force—emerges through recurring images (whisper/shout, vibration, scent, tenderness) and the lighthouse as metaphor. The final paragraph states the theme overtly: "proof that whispers truly travel farther than shouts" and "tenderness shouted louder when it was felt in the softest of breaths," which undercuts resonance by moralizing. The thematic echo penalty (−0.6) applies for articulating the thesis in prompt-like language in the final lines. No counter-reading complicates the claim; the piece presents the premise as validated truth rather than as a question dramatized with ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—loss, return, and the necessity of mapping grief—emerges through particulars (censer foot, moon phases, copper coils). The final image of ships turning westward with lanterns flickering like patina offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, lines like "she understood that reverse migration was not a folly of longing but a necessity" and "the navigator smiled... with the steady acceptance of someone who has built a bridge from loss to hope" veer into thematic echo, stating the theme rather than letting the image do the work. The censer foot's hollow storing coordinates is a purposeful concrete detail that lifts the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—psychological safety through shared reflection—emerges from the glass eye motif and is developed across the narrative arc. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "psychological safety grows not from the absence of pain, but from the courage to reflect it together" states the thesis rather than trusting the image to resonate. The smugglers' instant conversion undercuts the complexity the premise promised. The eye as recurring object reweights meaning but the moral is spelled out, lowering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—loneliness as canvas, memory as witness—emerges through recurring images (the flower, the gaps, the lamp) rather than direct statement. The Edelweiss and tide-gaps shift meaning across beats, from "borrowed memory" to "beacon for any future soul." However, the ending offers an asserted promise ("no one… will ever be lost to oblivion") rather than a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration earned by prior particulars. The final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("quiet comfort of being truly seen") without irony or complication, preventing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.6)
    The piece gestures toward a theme of choice and legacy ("the true map was not on paper but in the act of choosing itself"), but delivers it as direct statement rather than emergent particular. The matrix chip and ant trails recur but function as symbolic ornament—ants do not constrain a choice at closure, and the chip's mechanics (responding to water and insects) do not charge the final image with cost. The ending's claim that "decisions are made not in isolation but in the echo of promises kept" articulates a thesis instead of dramatizing friction between competing goods. No non-obvious moral calculus or counter-reading pressure appears.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges around the burden of leadership and recurring nightmares, but it arrives through assertion rather than earned particulars. The final image—"tempered by starlight"—offers a vague thematic claim without a non-literal answer to the central question. The orb's "bleeding starlight" and "recurring dream" motifs recur but do not reweight prior material; they simply confirm the premise. No counter-reading is possible; the queen's arc resolves into tidy restoration ("the kingdom woke to a sky clearer than ever") without ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated directly in the final beat: "the true alchemy lies in the willingness to see light where others see only ash." This moralizing replaces earned resonance. The "palette of resolve," "scientifically romantic," and "revalue" recur as prompt labels without accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material. No concrete particular shifts meaning at closure; the ending asserts thematic victory ("revalue the world with every breath") without ambiguity or cost. Thematic Echo penalty applies: −0.6 for direct thesis articulation in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.6)
    Thematic resonance around memory, nostalgia, and the artist's struggle to capture fleeting vision is present and coherent. However, the piece relies heavily on abstract labels ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," "chaos into narrative") rather than earning insight through specific dramatized experience. The final image of stepping outside gestures at renewal but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal, cost-laden answer. No single particular (object, gesture, constraint) carries the theme's weight at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of ordinary miracles emerges through image and action (the screw as "conduit for love's first sigh," the water level mirroring hope), and the piece resists overt moralizing until the final paragraph's "ordinary miracles finally revealed," which edges toward summary. Subtext operates in the fog as veil and the pendulum as heartbeat, though the symbolic layering—water, fog, gears, breath—becomes dense without sharpening the central question. The ending reweights prior material by linking the repaired screw to the mother with newborn outside, but the thematic answer ("every repaired piece was a story of resilience") is stated rather than dramatized, and the line "You are more than metal; you are a conduit for love's first sigh" performs the theme rather than enacting it.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (healing through story, release of past failure) emerges from the scars-as-runes conceit and the grandmother's chant. Subtext operates in the ritual gestures and the quill's crystallization. However, the ending states the theme overtly ("not as wounds but as luminous verses ready to be read") rather than letting the final image answer non-literally. The phrase "smiled softly brightly" is a syntactic stumble that undermines the quiet closure. Epiphany is asserted, not earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of imperfect miracles and forgiveness emerges through the perfume ritual and the metaphor "a broken mirror still reflects sunlight, if only the shards are arranged in a circle." The apology's text—"I carry the weight of that ash"—articulates regret concretely. However, the final line's "promise that apologies, like music, can linger beyond the silence" tilts toward overt statement. The story resists false tidiness (Mara's response is absent, the miracle is "imperfect"), but the thematic throughline is more narrated than dramatized through conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme (unity, spiral recursion, illusion versus truth) is present but abstract, advanced through direct statement and prompt labels ("spiral arbitration," "cosmic illusions") rather than concrete particulars. The final image (converging horizon, seamless understanding) offers visual spectacle but no non-literal answer to a question dramatized in scene. The ending moralizes gently ("not a finality but a doorway") rather than allowing resonance to emerge from earned cost. Subtext is minimal; most meaning is on the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme emerges clearly (clocks measure intervals between breaths, not seconds) but through direct statement rather than embodied particulars: "he realized that clocks measured not time but…" in the penultimate paragraph is overt thematic summary. The mantle clock key and razor-edge gears are mentioned but do not accumulate pressure or shift meaning at closure. The final image—walking toward cliffs—offers no resonant reconfiguration; it restates the theme without dramatizing cost or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.7)
    "Lucid contradictions" and the interplay of certainty and chance are stated thematically in the opening and closing paragraphs, but the narrative never enacts a paradox or forces Mara into a choice where both options are equally clear and confounding. The clover melancholy tone and recurring symbols (candle, mica, ledger) are mentioned but do not shift meaning or reweight the premise. The final image—lighting the lantern "one last time" to guide the next wanderer—offers a tidy moral rather than earned ambiguity, and the theorem is a stated answer rather than a resonant question.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme—endings as beginnings, isolation dissolving into communion—emerges through the disc's loop and the accumulation of voices, avoiding direct statement. The glass harmonica as recursive pattern supports the theme through concrete action. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "the core concept of cultivated estrangement dissolved, replaced by a quiet communion" and "a promise etched into the very walls" are thematic summaries rather than resonant images. The story invites reflection but the closure articulates the thesis rather than letting the loop and Mara's step speak for themselves, triggering −0.5 for terminal theme statement.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("preservation of small moments") is stated outright in multiple lines rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The locket-child-lighthouse-fisherman chain is told, not enacted, so the conceptual weight rests on assertion. The final image repeats prior gestures (lifting quill, feeling metal pulse) without a non-literal answer or reweighting; no earned insight or resonant ambiguity lands.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (cure for loneliness = catalyzing connections through reciprocity) emerges from the moon fragment's rumored empathy-echo and the final dispatch of the lantern. The ending offers a non-literal answer: "the cure…was not a potion but the act of catalyzing connections." However, the insight is stated rather than earned through specific struggle—Lira never doubts, reconsiders, or confronts friction between her method and a cost. "Polite anarchy" recurs but remains decorative; subtext is thin. The final image (station humming with laughter) asserts rather than dramatizes the thematic payoff, and the reciprocity chain is told via rumor mechanism, not shown through on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme—interior mapping via empathy and feeling—emerges from the premise and recurs in imagery (skin absorbing languages, platinum compass, musical trail). Yet the final paragraph collapses into overt thesis: "navigating uncharted emotional depths required more than sight; it demanded a map drawn in feeling…" is direct statement rather than dramatized insight. The stillpoint's "pulse of emotion…love, loss, and hope" reads as abstract claim without specific event to earn it. The quiet ending would qualify if the image were particular, but "map of her soul finally complete" is generic resolution without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of editing/redemption is stated overtly ("editing history was less about control and more about listening") rather than earned through concrete particulars. The "exotic nib," "gravitational anomaly," and "confidently uncertain" recur as labeled motifs but do not accumulate pressure or reweight meaning at closure—they decorate rather than constrain. The final paragraph moralizes ("the universe rewards those who can unbend") in place of a resonant image. No thematic contradiction or ambiguity; the resolution is tidy satisfaction without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.4)
    The core concept (silence as music, creation from absence) is coherent and the harbor-as-canvas metaphor threads through both shards. However, thematic weight rests on direct statements rather than earned particulars: "even forgotten souls can craft beauty from void" is a tidy moral delivered in exposition. The camera and sign language recur but do not accrue new meaning; the final image of Lira vowing to "map silence wherever she roamed" repeats the premise without reweighting it. The piece avoids overt moralizing in dialogue but summarizes its theme in the penultimate paragraph, flattening resonance. No plausible counter-reading or ambiguity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.7)
    The phoenix motif and redemption arc are stated directly rather than emerging from particulars: "his redemption," "the promise now lived in the walls." The piece announces its theme ("protect the stories") in the scroll rather than dramatizing the collision between preservation and destruction. "Volcanic tenderness" is repeated as a label without concrete correlative in action or image. The final paragraph's "soft heat that invites strangers to linger" offers atmospheric reassurance rather than a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme—rebellion as conduit for collective healing—is stated rather than dramatized through choice and cost. The auric lagoon's "entangled memories" and the repeated inhale/exhale cosmic rhythm gesture toward a thematic architecture, but the final image ("quietly rebellious heart … who dared to drum") restates the opening label without reweighting prior material. The ending paragraph moralizes ("sorrow can birth light," "became more than a story") instead of trusting scene pressure to earn resonance. Symbolic recurrence (aurora, drumming, lagoon glow) accumulates texture but does not create a non-literal answer to a dramatized question.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme—"whispers are the true currents of this city"—is stated on the retrieved parchment and restated in the final paragraph, replacing scene pressure with authorial thesis. The zodiac coin and map recur but do not shift meaning at closure; they remain functional props. No non-literal answer emerges from particulars; the ending spells out the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (silent empathy, teaching through patience, darkness learning starlight) is legible but arrives through direct statement rather than earned particulars: "Its core concept was silent empathy," "teaching darkness required patience," "darkness had finally tasted starlight." The final image (dock shimmering, night's quiet triumph) offers a lyric answer but lacks the dramatic cost or conflicted choice that would ground abstraction in scene. Epiphanies are declared ("It understood...") rather than discovered through struggle. The fisherman's whispered gratitude feels like thematic echo rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme—quiet rebellion, unspoken words, second thoughts—is stated repeatedly in nearly identical phrasing ("quiet revolution," "humble rebellion," "chorus of second thoughts") rather than emerging from image or event. The final line, "The quiet has spoken," is explicit moralizing. The grotto's magnetism and chess metaphors remain ornamental; no particular action reweights them. No thematic tension or counter-reading exists.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of freedom through self-embrace emerges but is stated rather than dramatized. "Combative tenderness" and "guarded hearts" recur as labels without evolving through scene work. The scrimshaw's "unlocking" is a symbolic gesture, not a particular action tied to Mara's internal contradiction. The final paragraph ("she had finally found freedom in embracing her true nature") is a thematic summary rather than a resonant image. No counter-reading or ambiguity lingers; the piece resolves into a straightforward moral.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme—grief coexisting with enforced joy—emerges from the premise but is articulated through direct statement ("cultivate lightness in sorrow," "quiet redemption") rather than image or action. The baton and flowers are symbolic conveniences introduced to illustrate theme without prior causal weight. No counter-reading or moral friction appears; the text offers a tidy thesis. One strength: the turbines as indifferent witnesses supply a non-literal frame that partially anchors the thematic question without moralizing, lifting the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of boundary-dissolution is stated overtly ("boundaries are meant to be explored," "dissolve the walls between thought and feeling") rather than earned through particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "aesthetically driven testament to freedom" and "rewrote the boundaries of sky" replace scene pressure with thematic summary, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6 for final-paragraph articulation). No resonant, non-literal answer; the ending asserts its own significance without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of beauty-in-imperfection is stated overtly ("imperfection was the truest melody," "celebrates the story each fissure tells") rather than emerging from enacted particulars. The concertina reed and phoenix function as symbolic tokens recurred mechanically without reweighting meaning. The glassblower's closing wisdom is a thematic echo—moralizing in place of scene pressure. One small credit: the colorblind protagonist's sensory substitution (perceiving "through cadence of shadows and whisper of metal") offers a specific inflection, though underexploited.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (connection across perceived divides) is articulated through repeated abstractions—"texture of connection," "golden shadows of mutual awareness"—rather than earned through specific conflict. The piece treats the premise as conclusion, asserting discoveries that are never dramatized with friction or cost. The final paragraph's moralizing ("propelled humanity toward deeper empathy") and explicit thematic summary lower the score further. No particular experience on the page generates insight; the bell ringer's "powerfully gentle resolve" to continue is declared, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of intention lifting veils to transform grief emerges clearly, but the final image states rather than reweights it: "every ending was merely a fold waiting to be opened" and the smile summarizing her mission read as thesis delivery. The "genuinely artificial" paradox and "curtains of intention" recur as motifs without evolving meaning or friction. The piece avoids moralizing in dialogue but the ending paragraph articulates the thematic claim directly, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme is repeatedly announced ("inherited mystery," "blueprint of hope," "guide a world reborn from digital ash") rather than emerging from concrete action. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "In the inherited mystery, she had found her purpose…a legend whispered by those who learned to read the lines of history." Prompt language ("reverse engineering," "map cultural patterns," "inherited mystery") recurs as unearned epiphany. No subtext; every thematic claim is stated directly.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme—transformation via unpredictability, reclaiming fragmented heritage—emerges through images and motifs, but the final paragraph explicitly states the thesis ("true purification comes not from erasing the past, but from embracing its fragmented atoms"), replacing scene pressure with overt moralizing. The ending does not offer a resonant, non-literal answer; it summarizes the lesson. "Atoms of nostalgia" recurs but remains abstract, never anchored in a concrete particular that charges the closure. Subtext is thin; meanings are declared rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—preservation of fleeting moments, hope as legacy—emerges through recurring images (the stone, the shadow, the child's kite) but resolves into tidy affirmation without ambiguity or earned insight. "Luminous regret melt[s] into gratitude" is an explicit emotional summary that replaces scene pressure with label-speak. The final paragraph moralizes ("every shadow eventually seeks light") and delivers thematic echo in prompt-like language ("after dreams become shareable for generations"). No non-literal answer reweights prior material; the ending states rather than dramatizes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of trust reconstruction through shedding deception emerges clearly, and the final journal entry attempts a resonant image. However, the climax delivers overt thematic statement—"balance is not a static point but a river"—rather than letting particulars speak. The chameleon, shells, and mist recur but function as symbolic tokens rather than constraining Mara's moral calculus or accumulating narrative pressure. The piece invites reflection yet leans toward platitude at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.8)
    The scar-as-narrative motif and displaced miracle concept create thematic coherence around wounds holding hope, but the final understanding is stated rather than earned through concrete particulars that reweight prior beats. The coffee-ring-to-scar mapping offers a specific image, yet the link to the child's regenerated arm feels imported rather than arising from the protagonist's own tension. The closing line "time itself was a wound we could read" tips into overt philosophizing that replaces dramatized resonance. Subtext operates in the moss and root exchanges but the ending sacrifices ambiguity for a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—unused love and unsent farewells—is stated repeatedly in abstract terms ("unused love," "vault of unused love," "sorrow transformed into something bright") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final image ("carrying the stored unused love like a lantern") offers metaphor without non-literal reweighting or earned resonance. No contradiction or complexity textures the emotional arc; the piece moves in a single emotional register toward aesthetic satisfaction. The psychometry and film strip function as ornamental motifs without constraining choice or charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated rather than earned: "dreams linger like dust on the wind," "rest was not an end but a cycle," and the final "where creativity could once again flow unbound" are direct thematic summaries without emergence from particulars. The astronomical instrument and stardust remain ornamental motifs that do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward the ending. The final paragraph moralizes ("Sometimes, in the hush before dawn…") instead of trusting image, triggering the explicit-moralizing penalty of −0.6 in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of renewal from ash emerges through particulars—frozen clock, fractured lullaby, blooming dune, sparks into seeds—without explicit statement. The chess clock's reversal and the dune's color shifts reweight the opening images at closure. However, the final lines veer toward thematic echo: "even the most barren souls can be kindled" and "the world would always sing its fractured lullaby" risk restating the premise rather than letting the image resonate. The piece invites reflection but borders on moralizing in the penultimate paragraph, slightly flattening the earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.9)
    A coherent theme emerges (inner exploration, mind as wilderness) through the mechanical-forest conceit and recurring hum/gear imagery. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "probable miracles were not rare gifts but the natural rhythm of a world that never ceased to reinvent itself" and "the wild frontier of his mind would forever expand"—thematic echo that states rather than dramatizes. The gear and forest imagery recur but do not reweight prior material with cost; they accumulate texture without friction. The ending offers assertion ("aware that," "knew that") instead of a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.3)
    The core question—what happens when courage lies dormant—emerges through recurring imagery (seed beneath sand, star stamp, lullaby) but never moves beyond decorative recurrence to constrain choice or charge the closure. The ending "star-stamped ticket punch clutched like a talisman" and "traversing hidden melodies" are abstract assertions rather than a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in particulars. "Vigil in twilight" and "gently persistent" function as thematic labels rather than dramatized costs, and the final paragraph moralizes the journey without scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of safety's price and unpardonable silence emerges through image (bolt, discoloration, snow) and the final carry-forward memory, avoiding overt thesis. The bolt's dual nature—mundane iron charged with piano echoes—is purposeful and non-literal. However, the guests' realization ("safety's price was not measured in steel or stone, but in the willingness to bear silence") edges toward summary moralizing in the penultimate paragraph, narrowly avoiding a heavier penalty by anchoring in the prior bolt and hue particulars. The seraphic-mundane paradox of the bellhop is declared more than shown, and "frostbitten hope" recurs as label rather than evolving metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges through recurring images—drift, collapse, borrowed sovereignty—but the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "power taken by deceit would always crumble under the weight of truth." The rune of drift shifts meaning (mystery → truth-telling stain → calm pattern), offering a purposeful progression. The "graceful collapse" motif recurs with tonal coherence, charging the ending image of stones singing "a lament for the lost but also a promise of renewal." However, the explicit thesis statement and the tidy restoration (kingdom's rightful line) resolve complexity into a binary moral rather than inviting ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.3)
    The piece gestures toward themes of memory, loss, and ecological navigation, but the final paragraph moralizes—"some changes are only visible when we listen long enough"—rather than letting image carry weight. "Periodically eternal" and "delayed revelation" are repeated as labels without concrete particulars that reweight the opening material. The atlas-as-clue insight is told, not earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme—cycles, rebirth, patient decoding—emerges through image ("dust into spirals," "hum of an ancient stone circle") but the final paragraph moralizes directly: "meaning was not a fixed destination but a rhythm she could trace." The opera glasses and stone hum recur but carry thematic weight through repetition rather than charging a choice. Subtext is thin; the stargazer's internal arc (solitude to leadership) is told rather than earned through struggle. The ending offers resonance but leans on prompt-language abstractions ("thunderous serenity," "relentless hum") that soften specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—blending tradition and insurgent change—emerges from premise and imagery (steam, ferns, reconstruction). The final image attempts resonance: the embryo's destiny as invitation, not command. However, thematic elements are stated rather than embodied in conflicted choices; Anara never confronts a cost or counter-pressure that tests the merger of old and new. The ending's "collective heartbeat" and "altered destiny" rhetoric flirts with moralizing; the image wants to invite reflection but the lack of prior friction leaves it abstract. No motif (kite, amber, moss) shifts meaning through accumulation or reprise with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars—survival, memory, stillness—and the final image (walking toward the cliff with the photograph as a "beacon") offers a non-literal answer to grief and hope. Yet the protagonist's kneeling promise verges on thematic summary ("I will remember... I will honor..."), and the metaphor of the pearl, while recurring, is explained rather than dramatized. The piece resists overt moralizing but does not fully transcend its therapeutic idiom, preventing higher resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of fragmentation-as-canvas emerges organically from the broken tarot box, torn cards, and Elian's realization that his fractured self is not curse but medium. The phoenix card seeds the consumption/renewal idea without overt moralizing. Rhetorical questions risk stating rather than showing theme ("Was it not the purpose…"), and the final line ("answer… hung in the air like a thread of light") edges toward abstraction. The ending image (redesigned portrait as "luminous ache") offers a resonant non-literal answer without sermonizing, though "necessary darkness" in the penultimate beat borders on thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme (time's pause as the world's breath during crisis) emerges through imagery, but the closing paragraph states it overtly: "the slowdown was not a flaw but a deliberate deferral," "those who ignored such pauses paid the price of oblivion." The ink functions as symbolic convenience—introduced and resolved within the same beat without constraining prior choices. The story never dramatizes the central question; instead, it asserts an answer through sermonizing interiority and a thesis-like declaration in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—the power of brave dissent to crack frozen silence—emerges through recurring images (ice, frost, echoing quiet, green shoots). The final paragraph synthesizes these motifs into a testament without stating a moral. However, the resolution feels too tidy: dissent succeeds without on-page cost, the council convenes without counteraction, and hope arrives as green shoots in a symbolic flourish. The piece resists overt sermonizing but delivers a thematic echo in the final line ("scandalize the silent world into speaking") that borders on thesis statement. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; most meaning is directly narrated.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (quiet strength, hope amid ruin) emerges through repeated images—sandbag, engraved quiet, tranquil blaze, roses as guardians—but is also explicitly stated multiple times ("silence can hold strength," "burden can become a bridge"). The final image offers a sunrise and communal vow but does not reweight prior material with fresh tension; it restates the premise. The boy's compass and Lira's whispers are on the page but remain symbolic gestures rather than particulars that earn insight through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of longing and connection emerges through sustained imagery (sound waves, constellations, feral lullaby). The final image—casting a net for notes rather than fish—offers a non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the resolution is stated rather than enacted with cost: "to catch the echo…was not to trap it, but to set it free" reads as summary wisdom rather than earned insight from specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.4)
    "Orbits of regret" and "proof by contradiction" are repeated as labels and thematic echoes but never dramatized as conflicting values or costs. The final image (descending stair, orbits "unwind, one proof at a time") offers conceptual closure but no non-literal answer earned by particulars—it restates the premise rather than reweighting it. The ledger revelation is declared to "lift the orbits" without showing what was sacrificed or what competing good was lost. No Q4 escalation caps thematic resonance at mid-5s per the cross-cap.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—memory, guilt, and technological haunting—emerges through the amber-insect device and the grieving mother's lullabies, avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph: "to tether a cry was to honor a memory, and that haunted firmware could be healed when compassion rewrote the code in letters inked by love." This explicit thematic statement flattens what had been implicit resonance. The final image of the city singing a lullaby and the laboratory breathing offers a lyric echo, but the closing lines drift into abstract assertion ("forever anchored," "never repeats the pain") rather than a concrete, non-literal answer rooted in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme—unlearning as shedding assumptions, silence as language—is stated directly rather than earned through specific struggle. The piece declares "meaning can arise from mess" in exposition, not through dramatized consequence. The tile, mandala, and mist recur but do not shift meaning at closure; the violinist's arrival restates rather than reprices the premise. No earned wisdom arises from concrete cost or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme is stated rather than emergent: "compassion could be engineered," "mercy, once aberrant, had become the world's new foundation." The final image offers no non-literal answer; instead it explicitly moralizes ("knowing at last that mercy..."). The "warm coldness" motif recurs but does not shift meaning or charge the closure—it remains a label applied to multiple images without accumulating pressure. No counter-reading is invited; the piece toggles between "warm" and "cold" without genuine complexity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—possibility rescued from despair, hope summoned through art—emerges through recurring imagery (apples, echoes, nostalgia) but is undermined by the explain-everything final paragraphs that state the moral explicitly: "every closed business could bloom anew," "hope can always be summoned." The tarot coin's shift from Tower to sunrise delivers the theme literally rather than through resonant particulars. The orchard's sensory density and the ghost's performance invite reflection, but the ending summarizes rather than reweights, dropping the score to mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of skepticism yielding to wonder is explicitly stated rather than earned through particulars: "even a skeptic can become a conduit for wonder when affection for truth guides the heart." The "willowglass hope" metaphor is explained rather than dramatized, and the closing lines moralize directly ("the most fractally precise secrets could be shared, not hidden, when curiosity meets compassion"). No resonant image reweights prior material; the ending instead summarizes the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—silence, voice, translation of the unknown—is declared rather than dramatized through specific conflict. The final insight ("to amplify the silence that already lived within them") arrives as assertion, not earned through on-page friction. Recurrence of the leaf and glow reads as motif-by-checklist without constraining choice or reweighting prior material with undeniable cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges around "shared wisdom" and the reversibility of time, but it arrives through direct statement ("She realized that the shared wisdom was not a static lesson but a living conversation") and prompt-label echoes rather than enacted particulars. The final paragraph moralizes openly: "the world could change when its keepers turned time with care." Recurring motifs (buttons, echo, hourglass) are mentioned frequently but do not constrain choice or shift meaning at closure; they function as ornamental markers. The ending asserts resonance ("every button, every grain, every echo brushed color onto it") without a non-literal image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme of redemption through courage emerges but relies on direct statement rather than particulars: "unused courage was not a place but a state," "fixing what's broken required both the courage he had sought and the humility to accept aid." The engraved pillbox and snow codes recur but function as puzzle pieces rather than accumulating pressure or shifting meaning. The final paragraph moralizes: "The valley echoed with a silver hush, a promise that the world could heal when its people acted prudently daring." Symbolic objects (phoenix light, crystal spring) are convenient rather than earned from prior constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.9)
    The palimpsest motif (layering, erasure, stitch) recurs and charges the prose texture. Theme emerges from image rather than statement: memory as rewriting, promise as layered commitment. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt moralizing—"to distill complexity into essence was not to erase, but to honor each layer"—stating rather than trusting the image. The river-as-promise metaphor is thoughtful but not tested by choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—resilience through fractured memory, kindness as catalyst—emerges from the lantern's phototropism and the oasis's lattice of timelines. The final image (lantern as beacon, kindness that bends timelines) resonates without overt moralizing. However, the resolution is too tidy: the oasis "remembers how to breathe," the lantern "no longer fading," and Mara's smile confirms success without ambiguity or conceptual cost. The story gestures toward complexity (fractured pieces protect each other) but does not dramatize tension between preservation and change that would charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges from the image pattern (light versus darkness, nurturing forgotten spaces, "protected vulnerability") rather than overt statement, and the vines' glow at dawn offers a non-literal answer to the question of care. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic gloss—"to reflect light into dark corners was the truest form of care"—borders on moralizing and undercuts resonance. The lockmaster's tooth and rosebush recur but function as atmospheric tokens rather than motifs that constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme of "isolation → independence" and "coexistence" is stated repeatedly in abstract terms ("translate her isolation into independence," "brittle awakenings were not failures but delicate beginnings") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The brass sundial and sky-whale recur but do not shift meaning at the end—they remain symbolic placeholders. The final vow ("whispered a vow to translate her isolation into independence") is sermonic rather than a resonant answer earned by prior events. No conceptual cost is legible; the ending grants symmetric satisfaction without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.3)
    The "thread that connects all things" and "keeper of secrets" operate as abstract labels rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The final paragraph overtly explains the cycle ("each secret weaving into the next") instead of charging the image. Recurrent motifs (thread, spiral, prismatic quiet) appear frequently but do not constrain choice or reweight meaning at closure—they are ornamental rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme—unity through subtle resistance—is stated overtly in nearly every paragraph ("power plays could be outmaneuvered," "hope, when handled with care, can rewrite even the stars") rather than emerging from concrete images. The final passage moralizes directly instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. Recurrent motifs (charts, subsonic pulse, ethereal grit) are invoked as talismans without constraining choice or reweighting meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme ("rebellion... against the forgetting of stories") is stated in the penultimate paragraph rather than earned through image and action. The compass-as-symbol and key-as-symbol are labeled ("not a weapon but a symbol") instead of letting objects accumulate pressure. Thematic Echo penalty applies: "the rebellion he had sparked was not against stone, but against the forgetting of stories that bind humanity" is prompt-like thesis in the final third (−0.6). The ending disperses into multiple declarative summaries rather than offering one resonant, non-literal image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is overtly stated throughout: "unifying opposites," "lance the void," "awaken dormant empathy." These abstractions are repeated as labels rather than emerging from specific events. The final image—"tear rolled down the stone"—is figurative convenience, not earned resonance. The portrait's "voids" for eyes and Mara's promise to the stone read as symbolic gestures detached from concrete stakes. No ambiguity or counter-reading is available; the piece asserts its thesis without inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of bravery and memory is declared repeatedly ("overlooked bravery," "moral compass," "courage across time") rather than emerging from scene particulars. The copper nail recurs but functions as a label for the theme rather than an image that reweights meaning through action. The final stanza-writing beat and the red line on maps gesture toward resonance, yet these are told resolutions that summarize rather than dramatize insight. No non-literal answer to the central question is offered; the ending states the theme outright.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.9)
    A theme of redemption and possibility-from-loss emerges through the pixelated amnesty conceit and the bridge-song ritual, but it resolves into a tidy moral rather than embracing ambiguity: the impossible becomes possible, the vanished returns, hope is captured. The final image ("a pixel of grace") offers a resonant visual but the conceptual answer is stated rather than enacted with conflicted particulars. Subtext operates in image and motif (fluttering scaffold map, wet-plate developing) but the piece tilts toward overt thematic statements ("to sculpt possibility," "a doorway to re-write what never was") that replace scene pressure with assertion. The refrain "luminous disbelief" recurs as a label rather than earning its emotional charge through specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—loops as testing rather than failure—emerges from the circus train, the algorithm's territorial markers, and Arlen's inherited restlessness, all specific to his biography. The final image of the last bill and the walk toward the co-working space *attempts* to reweight the circuit motif, but the insight is stated ("circles are not failures…") rather than dramatized through a concrete choice with cost. The piece resists overt moralizing until that penultimate paragraph, which edges toward thematic echo. Still, the currency collection and the train's boundary markers provide enough particularity to lift the score above generic territory.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.8)
    "Shared burdens" and "words heal" are asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through concrete trade-offs or earned insight. The ending delivers a thematic summary—"burdens would always be shared"—rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. Epiphanies ("understanding dawns," "the universe was offering her a method") arrive as declarations instead of emerging from specific struggle. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly, penalized −0.6 per guidelines.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is stated rather than emergent: "what mirrors don't show," "warlike serenity," "truth beneath," and "lost things" are declared via prompt-echo language but never dramatized through specific conflict or micro-choices. The druid's "guarded heart finally open to the world" is a thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph (−0.5 for explicit moralizing that replaces scene pressure). The seed, amulet, and confession recur but without reweighting prior material—they are moved like chess pieces to satisfy thematic labels. No resonant, non-literal answer emerges; the ending asserts meaning rather than enacting it.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is asserted ("purpose thrives on curiosity's fire," "dreams dictate destiny") rather than earned through scene pressure. The "eclipsed covenant" is explained in the text ("not a contract of power, but a promise to bind dream to duty") instead of discovered through action. The final image recycles prompt language ("intersection of dreams," "root-bound visionary would become the bridge") without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer. No thematic complexity emerges; the resolution is tidy and declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—sacrifice and renewal through bartered destinies—emerges through the burned tarot card and the amber thread weaving through marrow, avoiding overt statement. The final image of the amber thread as lantern offers a non-literal answer to the central question of soul-repair. However, "bartered destinies" remains more conceptual claim than dramatized friction; the story skirts banality ("shared renewal," "healed hopes") and the thematic payoff feels asserted by the imagery rather than earned through character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme ("purpose after loss") is stated overtly in multiple passages rather than emerging from concrete particulars and earned turns. The final ledger entry moralizes the lesson explicitly: "the true stage is not lit by spotlights but by the quiet conviction..." This is thematic summary, not resonance through image. Motifs (applause echo, valley longing, cloth scrap) recur but do not accumulate pressure or reweight meaning at closure—they are decorative rather than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of transition and reestablishment emerges through image (seed, magnetic field, departed spirit) but is over-articulated in the final paragraphs: "every translation was a seed, and every seed a promise to reestablish harmony" states the thesis rather than earning it through dramatized cost. The "haunted ambitions" motif is told as past context, never dramatized as present pressure. The arbor's metaphorical resonance (language evolution, magnetic currents) is asserted through Lira's comparative thinking but not tested under friction, leaving the conceptual bridge feeling ornamental rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—identity as migration, contradiction as beauty—emerges organically from recurring images (moon phases, tidal rhythms, fisherman-to-scholar) rather than direct statement. The librarian's insight that "his purpose required him to let his own identity migrate" verges on thematic echo but remains rooted in prior particulars (gears slowing with thin moonlight, creel holding shifting stories). The final image (creel glowing, blank volumes awaiting moon-phase ink) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the piece favors accumulation of motifs over tension between competing goods; the acceptance of contradiction arrives without dramatized resistance or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of reclaimed hope and shared grief is stated rather than enacted. The pearl's "latent radiance" and the ritual of binding sorrows are presented as symbolic machinery without concrete stakes or ambiguity. The final entry in Mara's log ("heartbeats aligned in a chorus of quiet reverence") moralizes rather than resonating through image. No counter-reading is available; the piece telegraphs its thesis ("the world inside the caves had found a new crown of compassion") in the closing paragraph, replacing scene pressure with thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (self-forgiveness as ongoing pilgrimage) emerges from imagery: river as truth-bearer, graffiti as compass, accordion as breath-instrument, map-drawing as self-cartography. The graffiti line "Forgiveness is not a destination but a river" borders on thematic statement but is anchored in the setting and reflected in the final action. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the patched accordion humming and ivy parting, reweighting the journey motif with "raw solace I cradled like a fragile stone." However, phrases like "cartography of the soul" and "erosion" edge toward abstraction, and the piece sometimes tips into direct thematic articulation rather than allowing full emergence from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme is stated rather than earned: "the library itself was a cipher, its passages encoded in time's own language" and the dreamer's closing line ("Each petal holds a promise…") function as prompt echoes rather than emergent insight. The "unspoken words" motif recurs but does not reweight prior material—petals, glyphs, and syllables are ornamental rather than charged by cost. The ending offers no non-literal answer; it summarizes the quest in declarative terms. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6) applies to the final-paragraph moralizing ("a story that once spoken, will never fade").

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme ("a dream could outweigh an empire") is stated in the penultimate sentence rather than earned through particulars. The ice violin, coffee stains, and vines recur but function as ornamental motifs rather than accretive meaning-makers. The final image ("even a single note could propagate change") offers a resonant close, but the moral is explicit rather than implied. Subtext is absent; all stakes and insights are declared. The piece attempts lyric accumulation but defaults to thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (light preserved against oblivion, honoring fleeting beauty) emerges clearly from the ritual and closure image. The covenant with the universe and the chip as beacon carry thematic weight. However, the final two paragraphs over-articulate theme: "a covenant with the universe," "countless stories," "even as oblivion loomed, a single spark could still illuminate the endless dark" state rather than dramatize. The emerald chip's placement as a guide for wanderers adds a thematic grace note, but the piece tips toward assertion in its final third.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of rebirth-through-care emerges from recurring images (vines, hairpin spiral, seasonal cycles) and is woven through action rather than stated outright until the reflection paragraph ("contentment was not a hidden treasure…"). That late articulation feels imposed rather than earned by prior particulars. The hairpin's spiral and the grotto's umbral veil offer resonance, but the ending circles back to the premise without reweighting it through a non-literal image or earned cost. The "quiet perfume of contentment" reads as aesthetic closure rather than thematic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—certainty versus nuance, the necessity of doubt—emerges from the wind chimes, hollow shard, and cloak metaphors, and the final image (shard as "portal for future doubts") offers a non-literal answer. However, the piece leans heavily on direct thematic statements: "truth is never a single reflection," "protecting vulnerability meant embracing the uncertain," "honesty could be a weapon and a shield." The magistrate's arc is told rather than dramatized, and the ending paragraph ("She turned back...ready to offer her services") summarizes the theme instead of charging it through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of delayed revelation and teaching vanishing is coherent and woven through imagery (ripples, rings, withholding perception). However, the final lesson—"the art of appearing just as one chose to vanish"—is stated rather than enacted through specific consequence or micro-choice. The sycamore motif recurs but functions as atmospheric echo rather than charged reprise that reweights prior material. The piece gestures toward paradox (aging backward, withholding to reveal) without landing a non-literal answer grounded in on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of stillness versus motion and reverence for the past is signaled through concrete images (pulse, arrowhead, birds), but the ending restates rather than reweights: "navigate the world inside her mind" is a direct thematic summary, not a resonant image that answers the question obliquely. The final paragraph tells us she has succeeded without showing cost or tension, drifting into moralizing closure. No counter-reading or ambiguity lingers; the piece resolves into a tidy affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—finding the sacred in the simple, the value of quiet brilliance versus mechanized spectacle—is coherent and emerges from the spire journey and keystone encounter. The "lingering luminance" and "brilliant dimness" recur with pattern, reweighting the opening reputation of underachievement. However, the final insight is stated directly ("the sacred was not a distant relic but the simple act of letting go") rather than dramatized through a non-literal image or action. The automated cities below function as thematic counterpoint but remain distant abstraction. Epiphany is asserted, not earned through specific struggle; the piece leans toward thesis statement at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.1)
    The concept of translating sound into color carries thematic potential, but the story asserts rather than dramatizes it. The final paragraph moralizes ("every vow, once luminous, can light the deepest ocean of forgotten libraries") instead of letting the image resonate. Eli's quest is framed as profound, yet no particular detail or contradiction earns the weight; the "luminous vow" remains abstract and untested. The ending offers a stated moral rather than a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.6)
    The backwards prophecy and wavelength-alignment motif are present, but the final image ("purpose pulse like a star newly born") is a generic abstraction rather than a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The story offers a thesis statement ("purpose he sought was not a destination but a frequency") in the penultimate paragraph, which reads as moralizing rather than emergent subtext. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5) applies for prompt-like phrasing at closure. The deck's cracking glass and "distilling hope from fading signal" provide some particularity, lifting the score modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of naming as a way to release grief emerges through the crystal sequence and converges with the echo-of-sacrifice motif. The final constellation offers a non-literal answer—love made visible—but the journey lacks complexity; every fear softens on command without counter-pressure. The ending avoids overt moralizing yet borders on sentimentality ("grief to gratitude") without earned ambiguity. Subtext in the melting droplets and aurora is present but not charged by contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (fragile devotion can mend the cosmos through patient humility) emerges from the premise but is articulated in near-thesis language: "even lukewarm magic can mend the universe," "brittle devotion...could echo through the cosmos." The final paragraphs moralize rather than imaging a resonant answer. The recurring bell and dripping mist function as motifs, but their recurrence does not constrain choice or reweight prior material with cost—they simply accumulate to affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (truth vs. myth, collective memory) emerges from images (reservoir, label, chime, photographs) but relies on abstract summary: "quiet construction of truth through stories," "shared narrative," "myth into a shared sunrise." The final paragraph states the theme ("true power of expunging falsehoods") rather than letting the image resonate. No earned insight from concrete struggle—Caitlyn's conclusion is told, not dramatized. The sapphire label recurs but does not reweight prior material with cost. Thematic Echo penalty: −0.5 for prompt-like thesis language in closing lines ("her quiet vigilance had turned a myth into a shared sunrise").

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of logic/intuition harmony is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete friction. The maiden-balancing-scale fresco, starling patterns, and fire/water symbols are deployed as illustrative ornament without constraining Selene's decisions or charging the ending. The final beat offers a tidy synthesis—"true alchemy begins where logic yields to awe"—that reads as thesis rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior struggle. Sentimentality toward fireflies is mentioned but does not complicate her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—duty, memory, cyclical vigilance—emerges through the buckle, the fallen skyfarer's promise, and the seeker's return to the clouds. The final image (vanishing into the arbor at dawn, "ready to watch, ready to bear") reweights the watcher's burden without moralizing. The parachute buckle and harness revision carry symbolic weight tied to trust and repair. However, the piece occasionally edges toward prompt-echo phrasing: "watcher's burden," "attentively inventive," "soundless echo" recur as thematic labels rather than earning resonance through specific action. The closing line's "soundless echo of purpose" gestures at meta-commentary, though it stops short of explicit thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of "complementary opposites" and post-ego-death rebuilding is stated repeatedly ("calm and fury," "compassion and resolve") but remains abstract; the piece tells the theme rather than showing it through concrete choices with friction. The final image (dojo as sanctuary, shared heartbeat) gestures at resonance but lacks specificity—"rebuilding through complementary opposites" could apply to any recovery story. The Duplicate's awakening and Kael's emotional restoration land without ambiguity or cost, producing a tidy moral rather than earned complexity. Mara's brief appearance adds a teaching-coda frame but no thematic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of grief-as-melody and tending-the-unspoken emerges through images, yet the ending states rather than earns its answer. "Sorrow and mirth can coexist" is declared on the page rather than demonstrated through a non-literal final image. The conductor's "gratitude" and "satisfaction" resolve complexity into tidy sentiment. Recurrence of lullaby and wind carries lyric texture but does not reweight prior material with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of "making friends with uncertainty" emerges through recurring images (mist, veil, boundaries of light) and the guardian's stated longing. However, the final tableau—opening the wing, greeting travelers—offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; it resolves into a tidy moral ("learned to wait," "foggy lucidity") without friction or cost. The pendant's cult origin and the breach threat are dropped rather than integrated thematically. Subtext is minimal; the prose states rather than implies.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.4)
    "Creative destruction" is declared repeatedly but never enacted with visible friction; the alchemist does not tear or lose anything meaningful before rebirth. The final paragraph moralizes the theme overtly: "forged a new future through patient, creative destruction" and "even broken things can bloom anew" replace scene pressure with summary. Subtext is absent—every thematic claim is stated directly rather than embodied in a choice or image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "beginning in every ending" theme is stated multiple times and echoed in the shard's function, the chord matching the city's founding vibration, and Selin's final cataloguing. However, the theme remains a repeated assertion rather than emerging from specific, contradictory action; Selin never confronts a choice where an ending must be embraced at genuine cost to find a beginning. The final image of filing data as "Genesis in Echo" restates the premise rather than reweighting prior material through non-literal resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.7)
    The "permanent transient" paradox and the hourglass imagery recur, but theme emerges through assertion ("time could be bent, not broken") rather than from dramatized events. The ending ("both an ending and a beginning") is a tidy summary that tells rather than shows resonance. The hourglass floats and the ferry returns with no moral calculus, no ambiguity, and no specific cost that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=3.1)
    Theme is declared rather than earned: "connections are both material and imagined" and "imagination can be measured" are stated outright in exposition. No specific event dramatizes these claims; the protagonist's "realization" arrives without struggle or cost. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("rational enchantment had indeed bridged the gap"), violating the no-sermon rule. Recurrence of "sinew thread" and "rational enchantment" reads as keyword cycling rather than motif that constrains or reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.6)
    Thematic material about depth/sky tension, tradition/progress, and curiosity is stated directly rather than emerging from scene particulars. The chain link is positioned as a symbol through explicit narratorial assertion ("more than a relic; it represented…") rather than charged use. The ending whispers a "somber promise" and offers an on-the-nose thematic explanation to students in place of earned resonance. No ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the piece lectures rather than dramatizes its concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme is stated rather than emergent: "incidental heroism," "protect vulnerable voices," and "curious heart can answer" are announced in prompt-like language rather than distilled from particulars. The final paragraph summarizes the thematic claim ("even when the dead call, a curious heart can answer and protect") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image. The photograph's color restoration and the statues bowing their heads are gestural symbolism that shouts rather than resonates. No concrete irony or counter-reading is available; the piece resolves into a simplistic binary of rescue versus oblivion without ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—honoring the forgotten, charting the invisible—is present and reinforced by the codex and cable imagery, but it surfaces through repeated assertion ("stand by the unremembered," "invisible threads… never be forgotten") rather than emergent from concrete choice. The final image (burying the codex, heart at ease) attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration, yet the question it answers is never dramatized in scene: no on-page conflict between memory and erasure, no trade-off that tests Mara's commitment. Gold flecks recur but function as ornament rather than accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—failure as teacher, broken pieces holding meaning—is stated overtly in the final paragraphs ("fetch wisdom from failure," "even a porcelain shard could rewrite destiny") rather than emerging from concrete action. The ghost-as-mirror insight arrives as tell, not dramatized irony. Motifs (shard, ink, heartbeat) recur but do not accumulate pressure or reweight prior material; they are invoked to harvest thematic points. The closing image ("universe's quiet song") leans toward generic solace without earned resonance or non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—language preservation, translation of texture into sound—emerges from the premise and imagery. The flawed diamond's "curse" recurs with shifted valence ("a promise of power rather than doom"), and the final image of the canyon sealing the language inside offers a resonant close. However, the storyteller articulates the theme overtly ("to translate texture into sound before the death of a language took its final breath," "the death of a language he had given texture a voice"), replacing dramatized insight with stated thesis. No counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme is declared rather than emergent: "turn bitterness into a cosmic joke," "frostbitten hope," and "the joke was that the universe itself had been waiting for someone to laugh at its own darkness" read as thesis statements rather than insights earned through concrete experience. The arrowhead, moss, phone, and frost recur but remain symbolic tokens without accumulating pressure or constraining choice. The final-paragraph moralizing ("a story of redemption, a frostbitten hope that turned the dark into a joke shared across dimensions") replaces scene pressure with abstract summary (−0.6). Subtext is absent; every thematic beat is articulated by the narrator, and the creature's "fragment of forgotten song" is explained rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (beauty vs. mechanical order) is stated rather than dramatized through specific choices with cost. The final image—glowing orchard, vow to travel—asserts resolution without reweighting prior material; the locust shell "beacon" is symbolic decoration, not a reconfiguration. Phrases like "the gap between knowing and understanding" and "even the most tarnished wonder could one day bloom" read as thematic summary rather than emergent resonance from particulars. No counter-reading or moral complexity appears; the piece endorses its premise without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of "linking absences" and "broken promises heal[ing]" recurs in dialogue-free narration and the envelope's vow, but emerges through prompt-label repetition ("We honor the voids, we mend the cracks") rather than dramatized particulars that reweight prior material. The storm-in-a-bottle shifts from "roiling clouds" to "calm sky," a purposeful image arc, but its thematic charge—hope, fragile peace—is asserted in the final paragraph ("even a storm confined can still rain hope") rather than earned by a non-literal callback that makes the reader feel the cost. The piece gestures toward complexity (voids acknowledged, grudges washed away) but resolves into tidy mutual recognition without friction or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Silence as possibility" is stated and restated but never emerges from particulars—every thematic claim is directly asserted ("the art of listening to the void," "endless possibility"). The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "her mission to interpret silence as possibility had birthed a new symphony." No image or action reweights prior material; the text tells rather than shows theme. The halo fragment and carousel appear decorative rather than thematically earned, and no counter-reading is invited.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—stories as hidden geometry bridging analog memory and lived perception—emerges from imagery (Möbius strip, hyperbolic curvature, firefly narratives) rather than direct statement, which is a strength. The ledger as "bridge between measurable and mythic" offers resonant particularity. However, the ending's promise that "analog memories would find a way to reawaken" and "countless tales" is abstract reassurance, not a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with cost. The thematic question lacks the friction of a genuine difficulty overcome on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (longing as shared light, the cipher as bridge) emerges from recurring images—jasmine, luminous absence, the pearl—but the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "longing, when shared, becomes a light that never truly fades." This moralizing replaces scene pressure and violates the "non-literal answer" test. The watercolor palette and sunrise photography recur but do not reweight meaning through dramatized cost; they remain decorative motifs. Subtext is thin; most meaning is asserted rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—fear versus courage, the unlocking of secrets—is stated explicitly in multiple lines ("an idea trapped behind fear," "bridge between fear and courage," "wherever fear tried to bind") rather than emerging from concrete action. The lock of hair returns at the end but functions as a symbol declared by narration, not reweighted by events. The final image ("filament lingered, a quiet promise") offers a thesis statement rather than a resonant non-literal answer. Thematic echo penalty: the locksmith's realization that "even in the deepest shadows, longing can illuminate" articulates the story's thesis in prompt-like language, triggering −0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of memory-as-archive and ritual-recovery emerges through recurring constellation/fungus imagery, but the final image summarizes rather than reweights: "stolen memories were no longer hidden, but now rooted" is a direct thematic claim. The mushroom glow pulsing with verses offers a symbolic beat, yet the ending explains rather than allowing the particulars to resonate. No counter-reading or ambiguity remains—satisfaction is symmetric and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of resilience and reversible exile is stated rather than enacted: "mentor resilience quietly," "Endure, then return," and the final whisper "You will not be exiled again" are direct thematic declarations that replace scene pressure. The tea-leaf geometry and afternoon shadow could serve as charged images, but they function as magical plot keys rather than motifs that reweight prior material. The ending offers no non-literal answer—walls literally heal, exile literally ends—so the conceptual cost is absent. "Combative tenderness" is named twice but never shown as a simultaneous contradiction in a choice, reducing it to a decorative oxymoron.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (wonder, hope, intertwined worlds) is stated rather than earned: "the color of wonder," "hope blossomed anew," "radiant hush forever echoing." The heirloom seed could function as a motif that constrains choice or charges closure, but it appears, cracks, scatters spores, and blooms in a frictionless sequence. The final gift to the traveler ("where the sky meets sea, the world's color would weave anew") articulates the thesis rather than letting concrete action answer the thematic question. No non-literal image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme of silence as sanctuary emerges through recurring "hush" imagery and the contrast between noise and stillness, but the final paragraph states the theme directly ("silence, when tended, can become a sanctuary itself") rather than earning it through image or reweighted action. The "interlaced hush" and "lucid unrest" are invoked repeatedly as labels without dramatized tension or cost. No genuine ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the piece declares that Elara's work "holds for generations" and "the purest peace" without complication. The thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph ("reminder that even the loudest grief can be tamed") feels sermonizing rather than emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—empathy bridging myth and geography—emerges through recurring images (map tear, rain, silent footage) rather than overt statement. The final image (generations of map framers continuing the dialogue) gestures toward Conceptual Repricing but lacks the particularity to make the cost undeniable. "Shielded openness" and "methodically curious" function as thematic labels rather than lived contradictions. The ending offers resonance without a non-literal answer rooted in scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme ("physics of letting go") is declared repeatedly rather than earned through action: "letting go was not surrender but a transformation of energy," "tension minus attachment equals the luminous path of release." These are stated morals, not resonant answers arising from particulars. The snow globe and transmission recur but do not reweight prior material; they illustrate the thesis without friction. Final paragraph moralizing ("sophisticated melancholy … can illuminate") replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme emerges through image and action: connection, touch, belonging arise from the courtyard-as-conduit and the binary-blossoms chorus. The sunrise tulip's "bright as hope" and the plea "to be felt, not just parsed" ground abstraction in sensory particulars. The final image of travelers adding verses offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the need for belonging. However, the balladeer's encoding of "his own longing" and the line "even silent code craves song" tilt toward thematic statement rather than pure implication.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme ("joy beneath anguish," affectionate detachment) emerges clearly from the spire's history and the servant's role. However, the final image offers little more than the premise restated: he carries contentment upward, whispers a promise, leaves the goggles for the next traveler. No non-literal answer, no reweighting of prior material. The diary's emotional map and crystal jars function as overt symbols without subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges through repeated images (telescope, clouds, broken strings) but remains stated rather than enacted. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "a quiet testament that even emptiness remembers when one dares to label its feelings." The core concept of spooled wholeness appears as metaphoric assertion without specificity—no concrete particular grounds what "spooled wholeness" costs or changes. Subtext is thin; grief and reverence are named rather than shown through implication.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of "limits as thresholds" is stated multiple times rather than earned through specific struggle. The final paragraph moralizes: "the true craft was not the painting but the moment she chose to defy the silence" and "where limits end and imagination begins." The mural's survival after demolition undercuts the promised stakes rather than reweighting them. No resonant, non-literal answer emerges from the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of discovery through pattern-seeking emerges but is stated rather than embodied: "to chart the next great discovery, she must first understand" reads as thesis. The hopscotch board and polyglot phrasebook function as symbolic set-dressing without constraining choice or accumulating fresh meaning at closure. The final image—starling murmurations "acknowledging the ship's newfound glow"—gestures at resonance but remains ornamental, offering no reweighting of prior material or non-literal answer to a lived question.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of repair and time emerges through recurring images (gears, clocks, mirrors, prophecy) and the final image of the ticking clock. However, thematic depth is announced rather than dramatized: "every repair sang its own story" and "rhythm of repair pulse within his chest" edge toward moralizing. The ending offers resonance through the departure and steady clock, but the locksmith's journey lacks the friction that would elevate theme beyond pleasant abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.8)
    Theme of collective effort and shared resources emerges from particulars (water, bell, chalk messages), but the final image states harmony rather than reweighting prior material with cost or ambiguity. The ending urges resource-sharing via a whispered message—thematic echo in lieu of scene pressure. "Brambled hope" appears as metaphor without complication. No earned tension between competing goods; the nebula's glow functions as symbolic convenience rather than a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of beauty-in-brokenness is stated overtly ("understanding that beauty lay in being beautifully flawed") rather than emerging from Elara's choices or the puppet's function. The lullaby as "pattern of ticking and silence" and "nested patterns" gesture at complexity, but the piece relies on thematic echo and label rather than dramatized friction. The final image of the lighthouse as "keeper of peace" offers resonance, yet it arrives without prior particulars that would reweight the premise with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of graceless beauty and cyclical redemption emerges through concrete images (wound, ash, reluctant approval) without overt moralizing. The final image—travelers' safety glowing "brighter than any curse," yet the orchard unmoved and demanding a new caretaker—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the cost of iterative care. Subtext operates in the mechanical birds' "indifferent precision" and the orchard's sigh, avoiding label-speak. However, the thematic recurrence of "graceless" and "wound" risks becoming a motif checklist rather than accumulating pressure, and the caretaker's internal arc is thin, limiting thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.6)
    The separation/connection theme is asserted repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars. The empty chrysalis recurs but remains a static symbol—its final return in the child's hand does not reweight prior material with new cost. The ending's "cycle of separation and reconnection" is a thesis statement, not a resonant image. Some subtlety in the foam-as-lattice metaphor rescues the score from the mid-4s.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme (the origin of stories, silence quantified into light) is declared overtly ("He understood now that the place where stories begin is not a location but a moment when absence is quantified and turned into light") rather than emerging from concrete action. The bottled moonlight and "glimmering parole" recur as motifs but do not accumulate new meaning through the vendor's choices—they illustrate the premise without reweighting it. The final chord and new story announcement are assertions, not earned resonance, and the ending summarizes the thesis instead of offering a non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through recurring imagery—memory as flavor, contagion, tidal cycles, the balance of bitterness and citrus—without overt statement. The piece resists easy moralizing and sustains ambiguity about collective guilt and healing. However, the ending whispers gratitude "to the coral pavilion, to the tide, to the dream" in a way that borders on thematic summarizing rather than letting the final image reweight prior material with undeniable cost. The concept of "emotionally contagious remorse" is intriguing but underutilized as a thematic pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—empathy, bridges, communal healing—emerges through assertion and prompt-label language ("empathetically decisive," "bridges from silos," "beats of compassion") rather than specific events. The final paragraph states the theme directly: "a day built on empathy, decisive action, and the tender vigor of a choral librarian's song." Motifs (starlight, weight, languages) recur decoratively but do not constrain choice or charge the closure; they are mentioned rather than reweighted. The piece tells its meaning instead of trusting concrete particulars to generate resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges from the concrete particulars of abandoned dreams (ship, poem, song) reflected in the mirror, and the central question—can one revive lost ambitions—shapes the arc. Yet the final image offers a promise ("stories…would endure") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer with conceptual cost; Aria's realization that she "must not only record them, but revive them" is stated rather than earned through a choice that forecloses another path. The recurring motif of the helix and synaptic plasticity risks ornamental abstraction when not tied to visible on-page friction. The ending leans toward thematic summary ("ready to catalog the next abandoned dream") instead of an image that reweights prior material without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme of vigilance-as-seeds emerges from recurring imagery, but it remains ornamental rather than tested by Liora's choices. The final promise to "guard the balance of knowledge as fiercely as gravity itself" is a stated moral rather than an earned insight from specific struggle. The "prism mind" metaphor is repeated without deepening or complicating the central question. The seedlings as "living lamps" offer a pleasant image but no felt cost or ambiguity; the ending resolves into symbolic tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of empathy in motion emerges through repeated imagery (stress cracks, vibrations, shared feeling) and the final declaration that "silence held a melody." However, the ending articulates the theme rather than allowing it to resonate through a non-literal image or action. "Auris smiled, realizing that empathy in motion was not a hollow ideal" is explicit philosophizing, and the penultimate paragraph ("the tree-song sculptor taught that even the deepest silence can be a canvas") moralizes rather than letting the particulars speak.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of covenant-repair through chess-as-cosmos emerges from recurring images (stone, board, twilight, eclipse) but is repeatedly stated rather than dramatized: "eclipsed covenant was not a broken oath but a paused conversation," "sorrow can be a compass," "beauty he sought would finally rise from the difficulty." The final image—stone pulsing, walking toward dimming light—offers a lyric reprise but no non-literal answer or reweighting; it restates the opening posture. Epiphanies ("What is hidden shines when darkness yields") arrive through assertion rather than earned struggle. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5): the tutor articulates the story's thesis multiple times in prompt-like phrasing ("hopeful melancholy," "discover beauty in the difficult," "eclipsed covenant").

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme—empathy via tuning frequencies and naming silence—is stated overtly throughout ("the path to empathy was not a road paved with grand gestures but a lattice of quiet recognitions") rather than emerging from events. The diary, clasp, and silences function as allegorical counters without concrete grounding; the "hush of sunrise over a battlefield, the quiet gasp of a child's first breath" are generic examples rather than story-specific particulars. The final paragraph delivers explicit moral instruction ("every silence would someday find its voice") that replaces scene pressure. No counter-reading or ambiguity is offered; the piece sermonizes its thesis without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme ("serenity within motion," "undercurrent of wisdom") is stated overtly in nearly every paragraph, crowding out dramatization. The ending moralizes ("a testament to the power of quiet ambition") rather than offering a non-literal image. Motifs (doodles, wrapping paper, wildflower hush) recur without accumulating pressure or constraining choice. No earned insight emerges from specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—resilience as listening to echoes, a cultural memory—emerges from the motif of gathering echoes and the planet's cyclical inversions. The final image (tip dissolving into soil, promising endless cycles) offers resonance without overt moral. However, paragraph 17's summary ("the source of resilience was not merely the tip but the ancient practice...") borders on thematic echo, stating rather than embodying the insight. The whirling silence recurs effectively, shifting from threat to purposeful rhythm, and the closing line reweights Mira's role without didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges around foresight, precision, and guidance through invisible forces. The flight engineer's patch recurs as a talisman linking airflow and machine guidance, and the final image (patch in pocket, "balanced scale") attempts resonance. However, the ending tilts toward summary ("she had ensured") rather than a non-literal answer, and phrases like "cultivate foresight in action" announce theme rather than dramatizing it. The conceptual repricing is present but diluted by explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme is declared rather than emergent: "certify wonder as essential" appears verbatim, and the final paragraph moralizes ("beauty could be both still and moving, like a chisel's first strike frozen in time"). No earned wisdom from struggle; the bell ringer's ritual proceeds frictionlessly. The aurora and amber sheet recur but do not shift meaning or constrain choice. The ending explains rather than resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—learning from failure rather than clinging to one path—emerges organically from Mara's journey and the closure insight about "quiet failures." The gilded flute and driftwood markers recur with shifting meaning, and the final image (flute at fire's edge, song into stars) resonates without overt moralizing. However, the thesis is articulated in near-prompt language ("harvest insights from failure," "guardianship is woven from quiet failures"), reducing subtext and pulling the theme toward statement rather than embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of transposed empathy and emotion-as-mathematics emerges through recurring images (borrowed personalities, ink as encoded feeling, numerical patterns). Yet the final paragraph veers into direct thesis statement: "emotion is not a static variable but a transposed function"—a thematic echo that replaces earned resonance. The halo fragment's crack offers a visual climax but does not reweight prior material with non-literal implication; instead, it confirms Mara's quest without ambiguity or cost. The piece avoids sentimentality but also avoids the specificity that would ground abstraction in lived particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme—brief encounters stretched into lasting wonder—emerges clearly from recurring images (vibration, germination, fade from memory to myth) rather than direct statement. The mentor's lesson about hidden music and shared memory is articulated multiple times, reducing subtext. The final image attempts resonance (caravan merchants, pilgrimage site) but delivers it as summary rather than a non-literal, particular answer. Recurrence of "germinate," "vibration," "echo" functions as motif checklist without constraining choice or charging closure with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme (objects absorb and hold emotion) emerges from concrete events and the prism's shifting glow. "Truthful lie" recurs as motif and the closing image of "shadows lengthened and brightened in equal measure" gestures toward complexity. However, the final paragraph includes explicit theme statement—"the truth that objects do absorb emotions"—that borders on moralizing, and Liora's insight crystallizes through assertion rather than specific experience with visible cost. The "shifted hush" concept floats as atmospheric label rather than constraining choice or charging closure with non-literal resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.7)
    The loom-and-weaving metaphor threads through the piece (raveling silence, warp, heddle, threads), and the final image ("sacrifice…would always be the loom of tomorrow") attempts thematic resonance. However, the theme is stated rather than earned: "she understood that her own quiet sacrifice had become the very warp" tells the reader the meaning instead of letting the amber's dimming, the orchard's transformation, or a specific bodily cost dramatize it. The piece gestures toward complexity (silence as "a loom of absence") but resolves into an abstraction—"hope and loss"—without a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme of bartered awakenings and resilience-from-rubble is stated repeatedly ("each edge a promise to coax resilience from rubble," "every rubble could awaken, if only bartered with resolve") rather than emerging from particulars. The azure motif recurs (glyphs, blade note, defiance) but functions as decoration; it does not constrain choice or reweight prior material at closure. The final image (cracks blossoming into crystal vines) offers visual resonance but no conceptual cost or non-literal answer to a dramatized question. The piece tells its thesis rather than enacting it.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of hidden truth and cyclical breath emerges from the bay's atmosphere and the parallel-universe mechanics, but the ending's "promise, cyclically spontaneous yet eternally purposeful" borders on abstract philosophizing rather than earned image. The green shard's fracture into "specks…like stars" offers a non-literal answer, yet the crew's awakening resolves all threads symmetrically without ambiguity or cost, undercutting resonance. The piece resists overt moralizing but also resists dramatized consequence, landing mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme of shared safety and memory networks is announced repeatedly ("lighthouse for hearts," "bottled feeling of safety") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The sea glass and stone spiral are positioned as symbols but their thematic work is told, not shown through choice or cost. The final glow—"not from oil but from the collective memory"—states the theme overtly, replacing scene pressure with assertion. No complexity or counter-reading is invited.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated rather than earned: "the world would not end, but would be reborn in shadowed brilliance" is meta-commentary, not a resonant answer emerging from concrete action. The "Shadowed elation" tone and "ancient shadows" motif are repeated as labels without accruing new meaning. The final image—"strange, joyous melancholy"—is asserted rather than felt, and the philosophical claim about prophecy and renewal floats above the events instead of growing from Mira's specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—the magnetism of story, the interplay of beauty and caution—is stated explicitly ("stories cling to people who carry iridescent caution") rather than embodied in specific events. The blue morpho wing and sun trails recur but do not shift meaning; they remain static symbols. The ending releases "a cascade of light" and "the promise of stories forever magnetized," a grandiose abstraction that asserts resonance without earning it through prior particulars. No earned insight emerges from Lira's experience; the scroll simply tells her the answer, bypassing dramatic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=3.4)
    "Quantified sorrow," "mundane miracles," and "what trees witness" are repeated as theme-labels without concrete particulars that reweight them. The ending doubles down: "a quiet testament to the power of mundane miracles" and "their sorrow quantified, their future bright" are thesis statements, not resonant images. The oak's "distant sighs" and the moon's "gentle smile" veer into greeting-card abstraction. No non-literal answer emerges from prior events.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of communal renewal through memory and song is stated directly ("knit communities together," "weaving together the hearts of all who listened") rather than emerging from dramatized events. The mica window and woven dawns recur, but as ornamental motifs rather than images that shift meaning or constrain choice. The ending offers a complete, tidy resolution—"never again surrender to silence"—without ambiguity or cost, flattening thematic resonance. The phrase "true alchemy was not in transmuting metal, but in weaving together the hearts" is explicit moralizing that replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of nested paradoxes and mistakes-as-teachers is stated explicitly multiple times ("he must first accept the mistake as a teacher," "every mistake held a lesson") rather than emerging through image and choice. The mirror-book moment offers a symbolic answer but lacks the specificity of lived consequence—what does he now do differently about the abandoned friend? The final paragraph moralizes: "the city exhaled a breath of calm, its paradoxes nestled safely within his heart." One strength: the invitation as gently smoothed token offers a concrete image, though it arrives late.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.7)
    "Tenuous absolution," "the sacred in the ordinary," and "uncloak" are repeated as prompt labels rather than earned through concrete particulars that shift meaning across the arc. The final paragraph ("whenever a passerby stumbles") moralizes the theme explicitly instead of letting the image resonate. The bread-as-altar and empty-chair offering are symbolic gestures whose meaning is told rather than discovered through friction or cost. No central question is posed or reweighted by the ending; instead, the story asserts its thesis in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—memory measured gently can outlast oblivion—emerges from images (frequencies, luminous vows, quartz hush) and the chief's ritual of recording. The final whispered vow makes the theme explicit rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer, lowering thematic subtlety. Recurring motifs (quartz hush, luminous vows) are purposeful but do not constrain choice or deepen ambiguity; they ornament rather than complicate. The piece avoids sermonizing elsewhere and grounds abstraction in concrete acts (placing the slide, tracing patterns), lifting it above mere assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.9)
    A theme of fragile trust and cyclical conflict emerges through "truce of hush," "false starts," and "comforting unease," but the final whisper—"May this hush stay firm, and may the sound of trust never shatter again"—edges toward overt statement rather than resonant image. The watch fob's return in the final paragraph reweights time and inheritance lightly, yet the ending pivots to Lila's steady heart and "fresh chances to thwart the darkness," a generic forward gesture that does not reframe prior particulars. The core concept integrates thematically but remains under-dramatized in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.7)
    A coherent theme—emergent systems bridging ancient rites and neon circuitry—arises from the imagery (forest elections, compass circuits, aurora pulse). However, the ending asserts thematic insight ("taste of the planet's secret heart," "emergent compass of wonder") without a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars; instead, exposition explains the concept. The final lines moralize ("daring enough to taste the world would forever find direction") rather than letting the image resonate, lowering thematic subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—creativity as locked potential, sorrow as generative—emerges through the auroral imagery and the lock metaphor, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image (painting as portal, promise to return) offers a non-literal answer. However, the guardian's instant recognition and the vial's flood of "muted creativity" lean toward convenient symbolic payoff rather than earned from prior particulars. "Auroral sorrow" recurs but remains ornamental; it doesn't constrain choice or deepen the thematic question through action.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme—candor restores worlds—emerges through recurring images (zinc plate glow, bottled speech, vent surge) rather than earned struggle. The piece commits to its premise but resolves into a thesis statement: "candor in small moments could restore whole worlds." The final scroll-opening meta-documents the triumph, severing reader distance. The map and plate function as thematic tokens rather than particulars that complicate the premise. A strong mid-band score for coherence and atmospheric resonance, but the ending's declarative summary ("a testament that even in a toxic world, candor can bloom") flattens subtext into moral.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme—silence as language, wonder preserved through art—emerges from images and motifs rather than direct statement, a strength. However, the piece leans on prompt labels ("symphonies of truth," "color of wonder") without transforming them through specific, grounded events. The ending asserts "quiet triumph" and "hope glistens" rather than letting the iceberg's motion or the tuner's micro-choice offer a non-literal answer to the central question. Thematic resonance is diluted by the absence of cost or complexity; no counter-reading or ambiguity lingers, and the resolution feels declarative rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—harmony between machine and organic, chaos contained and transformed—emerges from recurring images (the breathing box, desert roses as compasses, intertwining bark). The final image of the box "intertwining with the plant" offers a non-literal answer. However, the piece leans on prompt labels: "fragmented wholeness," "miniaturized chaos," "organic heart beating in rhythm." The ending paragraph moralizes: "even the strangest organic chaos can be contained, miniaturized, and transformed into hope"—a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("listening heals") is stated outright multiple times ("to prove that listening heals," "listening truly healed") rather than emerging through specific choice and cost. The locket, letters, and storytelling motifs recur but without shifting meaning—they illustrate the thesis rather than test it. The ending offers lyric resonance ("a sound only the heart can hear") but no non-literal answer to a dramatized question. Subtext is absent; all meaning is surface-declared.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of encoding vulnerability as strength is stated repeatedly—"a pact with herself," "teach future seekers to encode their own frailties"—rather than arising from dramatized particulars. The hangman's dice and crystal function as symbolic placeholders without constraining Selene's choices or deepening the thematic question. The final image (the lab rising, the legend whispered) gestures toward resonance but offers no non-literal answer; it restates the premise as triumph without complication or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme (deleted memories can be reclaimed) is stated directly in the penultimate paragraphs rather than emerging from particulars. The recurring motifs—wildflowers, lantern, gravity pockets—are mentioned frequently but never shift meaning or accumulate pressure. The final assertion ("even what is deleted can be found again") reads as a prompt-label moral rather than an earned, non-literal answer. No conceptual repricing or resonant image reweights prior material; the story explains its own thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme of silence as power and cosmic connection is repeatedly stated ("mapping silence," "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") but never earned through conflict or particular choice. The final image—brook resuming song, stars honoring—delivers a moral summary rather than a resonant reconfiguration. The crane's wing is treated as symbolic shorthand without dramatized cost or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of translation and communication with inanimate structures is declared overtly rather than emerging from particulars: "to learn the language of old buildings...to hear the heartbeats of forgotten walls." The antique seal and meteor shower recur but function as decorative motifs rather than reweighting prior material. The final paragraph delivers explicit thematic summary ("each agreed upon lie a bridge") instead of trusting image and action to carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of solitude-as-strength is announced repeatedly ("isolation into independence," "crucible for self-reliance") rather than emerging from scene particulars. The seashell and archive function as symbols attached to explicit moralizing—"every ending is merely a new archive waiting to be filled"—instead of allowing inference. The final image ("bright lighthouse") restates the thesis without non-literal reweighting or ambiguity. The piece reads as illustrated theme rather than dramatized inquiry, with every motif labeled and its meaning pre-interpreted for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—forgiveness of imperfection, art as balm—is stated directly multiple times ("to forgive the unfinished," "I will forever unlink the shackles of expectation") rather than emerging from concrete action. The heritage rose thorn and key recur but without accumulating new meaning that reweights prior material; their glow and hum read as decorative confirmation. The final image (thorn glowing, footsteps echoing "like verses on stone") gestures toward resonance but remains abstracted from the dramatic question, offering a mood rather than a non-literal answer with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges clearly—echoes as untold stories, voices yearning to be remembered—but arrives via direct statement in the climax ("people echo when their stories remain untold") rather than through dramatized particulars. The whispering seashell and canyon echoes recur, yet their reweighting at closure is mechanical rather than resonant, as the protagonist simply receives the answer without internal friction or conceptual cost. The final image (whole shell humming, promise that every voice will be heard) offers tidy comfort rather than the ambiguity or complexity the rubric rewards.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme—purity within wreckage, collective dreams as bridge—emerges from repeated images (melted globe, borrowed starlight, dream shards) but arrives pre-packaged rather than earned through character friction. The final line, "the pure thing she salvaged would illuminate countless other shattered dreams," is a thematic assertion that replaces scene pressure with prompt echo. No competing moral calculus or ambiguity; the whisperer's conviction is unopposed, so the theme lacks tension. The piece invites reflection through atmosphere, lifting it above pure ornament, but the closure restates rather than reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is overtly stated throughout: "hidden patterns," "quiet labor of countless unseen hands," "hidden effort he so reverently admired." The final paragraph ("reminder that hidden patterns are the true scaffolding of existence") moralizes rather than letting the image resonate. The bamboo whisk and moon paths recur but do not accumulate pressure or reweight meaning; they remain decorative motifs. No earned answer emerges from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme—truth versus comfortable lies—is explicitly stated in the diamond's inscription ("Only in stillness does the truth shine brighter than any lie") and in repeated authorial declarations ("excavate truth from comfortable lies," "smokescreen"). The ending moralizes rather than allowing the final image to resonate: "the orchard…now stood as a testament that even in a wasteland, truth could bloom." This didactic closure replaces earned insight with a tidy thesis statement, violating the "no thematic echo" rule. While the flawed diamond and stillpoint motifs recur, they function as symbolic tokens rather than constraints that pressure choices, preventing thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("ancient shadows forge hope," "variant allegiance to night not sun") is stated repeatedly in prompt-like language rather than emerging from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "they swore a variant allegiance not to any ruler but to the promise that ancient shadows could forge hope," violating the no-sermon rule and triggering −0.5 to −0.8. Recurrent images (mirrors, coils, cobalt glass) are present but used decoratively; no motif constrains choice or reweights prior material at closure. The piece asserts resonance instead of earning it through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme—the transmission of ancestral memory—emerges clearly from the glass jars and music box, and the final image (child hearing grandmother's lullaby) offers a concrete, non-literal answer. However, the poet articulates the theme directly ("translator between generations," "redemption gleaned") in near-prompt language, which dilutes emergence (−0.4). The ending avoids moralizing but also sidesteps complexity: no counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the redemption, so resonance remains tidy rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of sonic absolution and redemption emerges through repeated imagery (crystal hum, absolution, redemption lullaby) but remains abstract and asserted rather than earned through specific conflict. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the world seemed a little less fractured," "a perfect symphony of protection, adaptation, and soulful science." No concrete choice or loss dramatizes the thematic question; the ending tells the reader the meaning instead of letting particulars resonate. The crystal's promise of absolution is delivered without cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of patient revolution emerges through recurring images (ice, viaduct, moon paths, "unyoke") rather than direct statement, and the final mantra ("unyoke the rush, honor the still") attempts a resonant answer. However, the conceptual payoff is asserted rather than earned through specific struggle; Elara's transformation occurs off-stage, summarized in abstract reflection. The piece avoids overt moralizing but drifts into pseudo-profundity ("a gentle untying of the knots that impatience had tied around the soul") without anchoring insight in concrete particulars. The 9+ test fails: the ending restates the premise rather than reweighting it with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges around breaking free from systemic neglect and honoring lost lives through action. The lantern's historical symbolism (underground railroad → resistance) is heavily stated rather than allowed to resonate through image alone. The ending offers a resolution—exposing the conduit and redirecting water—but the final lines ("no preventable death would be ignored," "break free from the shadow") moralize rather than trust the image to carry weight. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves cleanly without ambiguity or lingering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—redemption, second chances, mechanical versus human hearts—emerges through the clockwork-heart conceit and the chaplain's ministry framing. The final image of the beating heart as echo of his "prayerful heartbeat" gestures toward resonance but leans on overt symbolic equations ("turn apology into action," "second opinions breathe life") rather than particular dramatic cost. The phrase "by the way light breaks through storm clouds" recurs twice as a stated metaphor for hope without accumulating new pressure or reweighting prior material. Subtext is thin; most thematic content is explicitly narrated.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges through recurring images—kaleidoscope, yearning algorithm, irreverent awe—and the piece resists overt moralizing. The bell "no one hears yet" and the algorithm's satisfaction carry conceptual charge around desire and futility transformed into play. However, the final paragraph edges toward statement: "Let's see how far we can push the absurd" and "recorded the moment as a footnote in the endless ledger of irreverent awe" function as theme summaries rather than scene pressure. The prism pivot dilutes closure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—memory as a living presence in the digital archive, absence transformed into echo—emerges from the crew's embedded coordinates and the network's algorithmic afterlife. The final message ("We are still here, stored in the silence you felt as absence") attempts a resonant answer to the central question, but it arrives as a thesis statement rather than a non-literal image earned by prior particulars. The piece gestures toward complexity (deleted data as digital ghosts, social fabric as memory carrier) but the ending moralizes the concept instead of letting the specifics resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme ("map empathy onto action," "willingness to listen") is stated multiple times in the final third rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The reconstituted crystal and blossoming orchard deliver symmetric satisfaction without ambiguity or cost. Subtext is absent; the peacekeeper's understanding is articulated directly ("true power lay not in the stone but in the willingness to listen") in place of a resonant image that invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (endings as solace, not absence) emerges organically through recurring wind, ice-breath, and lace-tip imagery. The piece avoids overt moralizing until the penultimate line ("solace is not the absence of endings, but the gentle acceptance of their approach"), which edges toward summary but remains grounded in prior particulars. The parasol tip's fragility and the volunteers' chorus provide concrete anchors. However, the thematic resolution is asserted more than earned—no on-page choice dramatizes the shift from seeking death to cherishing endings, leaving the theme's final answer partly rhetorical.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme of "mismatched destinies" and "intersubjective understanding" is stated repeatedly in abstract labels ("drawing parallels," "nurture intersubjective understanding") rather than emerging from concrete action. The final paragraph delivers a thesis statement ("mismatched destinies could converge in quiet harmony") instead of a resonant non-literal answer. Thematic echo in the closure paragraph triggers −0.6. No epiphany is earned through on-page struggle; the sentinel's realization that his watch is "not a punishment but a gently persuasive invitation" arrives as assertion rather than discovery rooted in specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—that wisdom lives in listening rather than structure—emerges clearly through the Keeper's explanation to the villagers and the recurring image of the dunes shifting into footsteps. However, the insight is stated rather than earned through struggle; the villagers' question invites a sermon, and the Keeper delivers one. The final constellation image offers lyric resonance but no non-literal answer with cost; it restates the theme rather than reweighting it. "Echo of wisdom" and "peripheral awareness" function as prompt-label motifs rather than images that constrain choice or accumulate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of transmuting pain into beauty is stated explicitly multiple times ("We will transmute pain into a masterpiece," "collective healing," "to reshape sorrow into beauty") rather than emerging from dramatized events. The feather's glow and the arcs' luminosity are symbolic conveniences introduced late without prior causal grounding. The final image repeats the setup's claim without reweighting it through on-page cost or irony. No complexity or ambiguity complicates the mission; the townspeople's pain is asserted, not shown, and their healing is summarized rather than earned through specific, conflicted choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (language as living pulse, continuity vs. decay) emerges from the crystal and dictionary milestone but remains abstract. The "pattern of growth" and "fractured sequences" gesture at meaning without specific contradiction or ambiguity. The final image (crystal humming over folded page) offers lyric resonance but no non-literal answer or conceptual cost—Mara accepts both "weight of history and lightness of possibility" in tidy summary rather than earned friction.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of memory, aging, and clinging to echoes emerges through imagery (cracked vinyl, tide, old videotapes) rather than direct statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer—echoes can be found and cherished, longing pulls at hearts—but the resolution feels declarative ("he smiled, knowing his tidal longing would forever pull") rather than resonant from prior particulars. The chalk-on-slab inscription and the ghost-ship horn attempt thematic closure, yet the cost or trade-off that would reweight the material remains asserted, not dramatized. Subtext operates in image and metaphor, though some phrases ("the act itself was a promise to remember") lean toward overt thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of harnessing the ephemeral and "changelessly constant" effort emerges through recurring motifs (leaf, luminous ache, escape velocity), but the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "constant change is possible when the heart remains changelessly constant" and "to harness the ephemeral, one must listen." These direct articulations replace earned resonance with summary. The "luminous ache" recurs frequently yet shifts meaning only through synonymous rephrasing rather than concrete events that reweight it at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme of wholeness-from-brokenness is stated explicitly ("the broken song could be reunited," "wholeness can emerge from brokenness," "hope can be stitched together") rather than earned through concrete action and image. The vinyl fragment recurs but its symbolic weight is announced rather than discovered; the final paragraph's "endless hymn of love" and "promise that the scent of hope would travel" tip into direct thematic summary. Some subtextual work appears in the curtains "fluttering like breath" and the room's sigh, but the predominant mode is assertion. The piece avoids false equivalence and gestures toward complexity (broken vinyl completing the song) yet the ending moralizes rather than resonating through image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of hidden migration and "closing loops" emerges through repeated imagery (spiral glyphs, the key's chime, the luminous chamber's pulse). The final image of shadows disappearing into the chamber offers conceptual resonance, but the story states its thesis overtly: "The key's purpose, then, was to bridge the loop between observation and revelation." The ending paragraph moralizes gently ("her journey had closed a loop that spanned reality itself") rather than trusting image and implication. The phrase "quietly deliberate" recurs as a label without dramatized cost, and the resolution is too tidy—every shadow route catalogued, the isle settled, the world bathed in "ordinary light."

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme "mistakes are constellations" is stated repeatedly in abstract language ("dark matter binds the universe," "gateway," "embryonic galaxy") rather than emerging from concrete scene work. The baby tooth and vertebrae repair could yield resonance, but the piece tells us the meaning ("not failures...") in the margins instead of letting image and action imply it. The final sky of new patterns is asserted, not dramatized, and the ending moralizes ("forgiving skeptic's quiet triumph") rather than offering a non-literal answer. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5) applied for the explicit margin note that articulates thesis in prompt-like language.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of gentle illumination emerges through the pearl-and-glass motif, yet the piece states rather than dramatizes the insight: "to share light without fire was to become the gentle weight." The final paragraph meta-commentary ("Thus she taught the world") replaces earned resonance with summary. No complexity or counter-reading is offered; the moral is tidy and explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme (transforming pain into gentle knowledge) emerges from the moss garden conceit and is reinforced by recurring images (honeyed hush, drip pattern, amber glow). However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly—"every drip, every pendant, every proffered stone had stitched together a future where pain could rest in honeyed hush"—rather than trusting the image to carry it. The sister's viral confession remains abstract; Lira's reconciliation with it is asserted, not earned through on-page friction. The 9+ test (ending offers resonant, non-literal answer) is not met due to explicit moralizing in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme—honoring fragile hopes, defying conventional narratives—is stated overtly ("mosaic built against the current," "solemn promise") rather than earned through concrete events. The spiral fragment and cameo motifs recur but do not constrain choice or charge the closure with cost; they remain decorative. The final paragraph moralizes ("every shape of hope...would someday light a new horizon") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Insights are asserted ("she knew," "she sensed") without dramatized struggle, reading as platitude rather than earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.4)
    A coherent theme—memory and ritual as remedy for cultural loss—emerges through the vine's "forgotten songs" and Mara's weaving of light-stories. The piece resists overt moralizing until the final lines, where "the remedy for loss lay not in steel or fire, but in memory sung through forgotten songs" edges toward explicit statement rather than image. The golden pollen and children's instruction offer thematic closure, but the ending delivers a thesis ("sacred practices endured") rather than a non-literal, resonant answer that reweights prior particulars with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of patience, devotion, and mapping emotional terrain emerges clearly from recurring images (starlight, heartbeat, patterns, orchard as witness). However, the final paragraphs tip into explicit statement: "translating heartbeats into maps was not a task but a covenant" and "translating love into luminous maps" read as thematic summaries rather than non-literal answers earned through scene work. The covenant declaration in the penultimate beat operates as label rather than dramatized insight. Motifs (plate, starlight, discarded items) recur frequently but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward a reweighted closure; they remain ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.1)
    A coherent theme—wonder versus reason, ephemerality versus preservation—emerges through imagery of echoes, jars, and reflected light. However, the final paragraph delivers overt thematic summary ("the locksmith had turned broken time into a chorus of stored wonder, a lesson in listening to the periphery") rather than letting the image speak. The "cellar of reason" metaphor is announced and explained rather than discovered through pressure, flattening subtext and risking sermon over resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.1)
    A coherent theme—transformation of burdens into art or release—emerges from the grotto's calcifying weights and the final promise that "any soul who entered with a burden could, by orienting properly their own heart, let it calcify into art." Yet this insight is stated rather than earned through specific struggle; the weaver's actions exemplify the theme without complicating it. The final image (grotto under stars, burdens now constellations) offers lyric resonance but no non-literal turn that reweights prior material with fresh cost. Subtext operates in the recurring "shingled hush" and "whalebone reverie," but the piece leans on prompt labels ("boundary-lessly trapped," "fractal patterns") rather than discovered particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.7)
    The "here and gone" paradox of grief threads through rain beads, steam, and the amber-trapped roar, creating thematic coherence. The rust-hued peace deepening into warm amber at closure offers a resonant tonal shift. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("loss can be a tool, not a trap," "the paradox of here and gone could be lived, not merely mourned") rather than trusting the carved lantern image to carry meaning. The whispered thanks to "the empty space" verges on sentimental declaration. The piece leans toward thesis illustration rather than emergent complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.7)
    Eroded ambitions and regret are named repeatedly but emerge as thesis rather than from concrete particulars. The carousel memory and "promise to never let go of wonder" function as prompt-like Echo rather than non-literal answer. Thematic material is declared in the final paragraph ("I will carry these stories forward") instead of resonating through image. The ghost's "final smile" and "fresh roots" read as convenient symbolic resolution without earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme of hope resurrected through engineering is stated rather than emergent: "to resurrect hope she must puzzle out new equations" and "how functionally creative thinking could resurrect hope" are explicit thesis sentences. The sextant's shift from sea-navigation to "ethical currents" is asserted as metaphor without on-page friction to earn the transformation. The final equation "balanced" and the terminal's "renewed purpose" deliver symmetric satisfaction without ambiguity or moral cost, reducing complex questions of technology and sentiment to a tidy success. The "maze of intentions resolved into order" and "spiral of purpose" are abstract philosophical flourishes disconnected from concrete dramatized experience.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme (time, memory, gentle resilience) emerges through recurring images (crystal, rain, gears), and the final clock chime offers a lyric closure gesture. However, the thematic question is never dramatized through conflict or choice; the scribe's reconciliation is declared rather than earned through specific struggle. Multiple phrases approach sermon territory ("excruciatingly gentle resilience, a beacon for any soul willing to bear the weight of forgotten hopes") without grounding the insight in concrete on-page experience. The crystal-as-teacher dynamic relies on mystical hand-waving instead of particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (truth vs. lies, hindsight clarity) is stated repeatedly in abstract terms ("architecture of lies," "false structures," "salvage truth") rather than arising from concrete particulars. The final image recycles the opening's twilight canal and radio hum without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to the central question. The sundial as motif is mentioned often but does not constrain a climactic choice or charge the closure with cost; it remains decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme (preservation, patience, encoded wisdom) emerges through image and motif rather than overt statement, which is a strength. The fulgurite glass and knotwork carry symbolic weight. Yet the final image—"ready to be shared"—resolves into a neat affirmation without ambiguity or cost, and the "master weaver" sign arrives as convenient validation rather than a thematic reckoning earned through prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—healing through documentation, absence made present—is stated repeatedly in abstract diction ("latitude of grief," "longitude of hope," "geography of healing") rather than emerging from concrete events. The rose's revival in the traveler's projection offers a symbolic moment, but it resolves without friction or cost; the work explains its own metaphor instead of trusting image. No counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the consoling premise.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of bridging mechanism and life emerges from the core images (gears, feathers, egg) and is coherent throughout. However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("beauty could be forged as surely as steel") and summarizes the prince's purpose rather than letting the image resonate. The "bitterly sweet" motif is invoked repeatedly as a label without dramatizing the tension between loss and promise. The piece offers a clear thematic answer but does so through assertion and overt statement rather than non-literal implication.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "scars can sing" motif is repeated across six beats and charged by the coin's "faint, resonant tone," but it remains a stated thesis rather than an emergent property of scene work. The fire-lineage versus water-peace binary is developed through recurring images (black sand's volcanic memory, kelp-drift peace, red thread) and the final dawn image reweights "her father's fire into a beacon of enduring compassion." Yet the ending states the theme ("compassion is a tide that never truly recedes") instead of trusting the coin's hum or the villagers' silent gathering to carry meaning. Thematic echo in the final two paragraphs lowers the score by ~0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges around memory, patience, and the transformation of skepticism, but the final image resolves into tidy affirmation: "belief could be forged from patient defiance" is near-platitude, and Mara's pledge to "guard the liberated memories" reads as an imposed moral rather than a resonant answer. The geese and fountains recur but do not reweight meaning—they simply bookend the quest. No counter-reading or genuine ambiguity lingers; the story tells its theme rather than earning it through contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme (light without fire, generational memory) emerges through image and pattern, avoiding overt statement until the penultimate line. The gear's "infinite approximation" functions as a bridge metaphor that recurs with modest shift. However, the ending whispers the theme aloud ("light could travel without fire, carried instead by memory, mathematics, and love"), flattening earned resonance with summary. No plausible counter-reading or moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—grief as a flowing tapestry rather than a jagged scar—emerges from the ribbon, butterfly, and basin imagery, which recur with shifting weight. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("he understood that the shape of collective grief was not a jagged scar but a flowing tapestry"), reducing resonance to thesis. The carved basin with rain-water is a purposeful image, yet it illustrates rather than complicates the premise. Subtext operates in the greenhouse's "paradox" and Mara's whispered guidance, but the ending explains meaning instead of letting the monument speak. The piece resists tidy morals in its middle beats, then delivers a summary in the penultimate line.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme (incremental repair, human–tide harmony) is stated directly rather than emerging from conflict: "incremental absolution," "shared balance," "redemption." The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "the chorus of countless souls who dared to mend the world" (−0.6). The inscribed rake handle recurs but serves as symbolic ornament without constraining choice or charging closure with non-literal cost. No earned epiphany or resonant reweighting occurs; the ending restates the premise as thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (the shape and persistence of intention across memory) emerges through recurring images—threads, echoes, the circle—and the tapestry's reweighted meaning. However, the final assertion "the shape of intentions was not a weapon but a seed" is stated rather than shown, and the gardener's smile signals resolution without ambiguity or earned complexity. The piece avoids moralizing but delivers its concept through direct claim rather than a non-literal final image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of embracing ignorance as a canvas for change is stated outright in the final paragraphs rather than emerging from concrete action. The kingfisher quill and "groundedly imaginative" are named repeatedly as thematic tokens without altering character choice. The ending moralizes directly: "true mastery lay in embracing what one does not know," replacing scene pressure with a sermon. The lattice-and-aurora imagery could support resonance but is subordinated to explicit thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of forgotten stories revived through music emerges clearly from images (dust swirling as music, luminous ink, pirate's voice) rather than direct statement, which is a strength. The final line attempts resonance ("even dust...could become a storyteller") but reads as a tidy moral summary rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars. The piece avoids overt sermonizing until the very end, where the thematic echo ("teach dust to tell stories") is restated without reweighting prior material through a charged image or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.6)
    "The mirage of safety" appears three times but remains an abstract label rather than a dramatic friction—no choice tests it, no cost reveals it. The final line ("true safety lives inside the brave act of feeling") is overt moralizing that replaces scene pressure with thesis statement. Theme is told rather than emerging from particulars, and the protagonist's ritual enacts symbolic gestures without thematic complexity or counter-reading. The piece gestures toward memory and loss but never grounds them in specific experience or conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—competing truths coexisting, preservation of methods, rational rebellion—emerges organically from the setting and narrator's stance. The cog and sedimentary layers function as motifs that shift meaning at closure. However, the final paragraph tips into thematic statement: "ready to teach the world that competing narratives can coexist without war" verbalizes the lesson rather than trusting the image. The chronic philosophizing throughout ("rationally rebellious," "chorus of truths") edges toward meta-commentary, though the particularity of the sewer and waterworks grounds the conceit sufficiently to avoid full abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (art as reconciliation, silence as canvas) emerges from imagery but is over-articulated in lines like "by subtracting noise, silence could be sharpened into a canvas" and "art could survive even as the world tried to erase it." The rosette motif recurs purposefully and charges the final image when children trace it, lifting the score. However, the ending's summary ("denoted a new beginning," "vanishing arts would never truly disappear") states theme rather than letting the particulars resonate. No counter-reading or ambiguity is offered; the reconciliation is complete and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of renewal versus ruin emerges through the greenhouse motif and the "gentle rebellion" concept, but final-paragraph summary ("proof that even in ruins, a chef who could taste memories could sow hope") states rather than earns the theme through scene particulars. The knowledge fruit's transformation is told symbolically but lacks concrete friction or ambiguity. Subtext is absent—everything operates literally. The closing image (amber glow, humming garden) offers visual resonance but no non-literal answer to a dramatized question.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of wonder versus routine emerges through specifics (bells, drones, amber light) rather than abstraction, and the echo concept offers a fresh angle on collective memory. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "wonder would never again be dimmed by routine" and "kept the toll honest, each ring a promise" are explicit thesis statements that replace scene pressure. The matchbox's riddle ("Echo") is clever but arrives as a solved puzzle without Mara wrestling with its implications, resulting in told rather than dramatized resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated rather than earned: "silence can be as vivid as any color," "we have learned to hear the hush." The orris root shard functions as symbolic convenience, introduced and immediately harvested for meaning. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("I will continue to notice the creeping normality...") instead of letting image and action create resonance. No thematic tension or counter-reading emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.9)
    The nuance-versus-certainty theme is stated overtly ("urged the garden to accept subtlety as a natural tide") rather than emerging from concrete conflict. The foxglove ampoule recurs but its violet glow remains decorative; it does not constrain choice or reweight meaning at closure. The final image—"forever threading kindness through the cracks of certainty"—is a direct thematic assertion rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. Earned wisdom is replaced by philosophical assertion disconnected from scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of "boundless confinement" and the dialectic of chance/certainty emerges through recurring images (staircase, dice, equations), but the final image offers thematic echo rather than earned resonance—"both a cage and a key, bound and free at once" restates the premise without reweighting it through prior cost. The chipped die landing face-up is told as triumph without prior sacrifice that charges the moment. Subtext is thin; the narrative voice explicates rather than implies ("a reminder that some missed chances refuse to be reclaimed"). The piece invites reflection on the concept but does not deliver a non-literal answer earned by on-page particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (kindness remembered across anonymity, lost languages resurrected through color) emerges from concrete images—scroll, note, moonlight, script—and avoids overt moralizing until the final lines. However, "the rooftop greenhouse became a sanctuary where lost languages found voice, and strangers… remembered the quiet power of a single kind gesture" edges into thematic summary rather than allowing the image to resonate without statement. The recurring motif of the moon-tipped brush and ancient scripts accumulates texture but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer; the ending restates rather than transforms. Subtext is thin; Mara's inner life and Jiro's encounter are told more than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of memory, displacement, and cultural rescue is explicitly stated multiple times ("the true rescue lay not in preserving objects but in thawing hearts") rather than emerging from scene pressure. The emerald lens and initialed bread recur but function as symbols deployed for resonance rather than constraining action or forcing a thematic question. The final image—mist painted in jade and rose—gestures at integration but arrives through assertion ("the city's past and future twined") without dramatized tension or non-obvious synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("rewrite fate," "reverse time," "initiate change") is stated overtly in the final paragraphs rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The hunger stone and yoyo function as symbolic tokens without thematic resonance earned through action. Epiphanies are asserted ("He had learned that to initiate change...") rather than dramatized. The ending moralizes ("ingenuity can reverse even the most stubborn puzzles") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer through image. Thematic elements feel imposed by prompt requirements rather than organically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of confronting fear through paradox is stated rather than emergent from concrete particulars. The "photographically cursed rose" and "lingering luminance" recur but function as decorative motifs without constraining choice or accumulating pressure. The paradoxical dream-dictionary note—"Fear is a candle; snuff it with its own flame"—is on-the-nose philosophizing that the story illustrates rather than dramatizes. The ending offers no resonant reconfiguration; the advisor's final bargain is not answered, so thematic cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme ("obstacles into instruments") is stated explicitly multiple times rather than emerging from concrete choices. The final paragraph moralizes ("a testament to his belief") instead of letting image carry meaning. Subtext is absent—every gesture and object is decoded on the page. The "restless euphony" motif recurs as a label without accumulating pressure or shifting meaning. No earned wisdom arises from on-page struggle; the prophet's worldview is identical at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (listening, living patterns vs. fossilization) emerges through concrete images: rusted gate, cracked mosaic, whistle resonance, watchers' light language. The final realization—"the true lost expedition was...the city's own willingness to listen"—offers a non-literal answer but edges toward overt articulation ("she vowed to keep listening, forever"). The mosaic and whistle motifs constrain choice and return with reweighted meaning, supporting thematic coherence. However, the ending's summary tone and lack of dramatized cost prevent full resonance, holding the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.4)
    The theme of noble lies versus truth is stated repeatedly ("noble lies," "pit of lies," "rescue truth") rather than emerging through dramatized choices. The illuminated letter delivers exposition that confirms Arlen's lecture content, functioning as a thematic echo rather than a discovery. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "truth, once rescued, would travel onward on unseen rails" and "future seekers to recapture truth wherever noble lies had taken root." No ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the ending asserts a neat resolution to a question that was never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of preserving forgotten places emerges through imagery (interlaced absence, quiet fire of ink, submerged arches), and the inkwell serves as a modest motif. However, the final vow is stated rather than resonant: "each future repair…would become another stanza" is thematic narration, not an image that reweights prior material. The piece resists overt moralizing but does not offer a non-literal answer to its central question; instead, it declares Mara's resolve without ambiguity or cost. The recurring phrase "interlaced absence" functions more as atmospheric label than pressure-bearing concept.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of preserving truth against erasure emerges from the premise and recurs in the stamp's cipher and the architects' vow. The ending attempts a resonant image (the glowing slab, the stamp as "token of hope") but leans on abstract assertions ("truth outshone fear") rather than concrete particulars. The "reclaimed stillness" motif is repeated label-like without accumulating fresh meaning. Subtext is thin; the story states its theme rather than dramatizing it through conflicted choice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme of transformation through grief emerges through image (polishing dreams, folding cranes) but is undercut by overt statements: "a bridge between grief and the luminous torment of memory," "paradoxical peace of a heart that can ascend even as it descends." The final paragraph sermonizes the theme rather than letting the image resonate. The piece leans on "luminous torment" as a repeated label instead of letting particulars enact the concept, and the ending offers tidy resolution rather than lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—potential as a state of being, not a place—emerges from the geode's fracture and the protagonist's realization. The piece resists overt moralizing, allowing the image of floating shards to carry thematic weight. However, the final lines edge toward thematic summary ("the hunt was over, yet the search… would continue, forever") rather than trusting the image alone. The unfiltered awakening and the bleak sky motifs recur with shifting weight, but the philosophical pivot lacks the friction of competing goods or embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.7)
    "Belonging" is named repeatedly but never made concrete through a character trade-off or image that reweights prior material. The final assertion—"belonging is a frequency that can be tuned by anyone willing to listen"—delivers the theme as direct statement rather than letting it emerge from particulars. The pilgrim's token and the collaborative pulse offer gestural subtext, yet the "missing pieces" are "found…within the collaborative pulse of human curiosity," an abstraction that sidesteps dramatic irony or earned insight. Thematic Echo penalty: the climax articulates the thesis in prompt-like language without embodied cost (−0.5).

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—guilt, false memory, and the cost of withheld truth—emerges from the protagonist's trade and the shore quest, with the carved phrase offering a non-literal answer. The watch hand's return and the phrase's echo at closure attempt resonance without overt moralizing. Yet the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("the weight of that withheld truth had finally been lifted") and "tempered regret" appears as a label rather than arising from scene particulars, diluting the implicit charge.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of forgiveness as bridge is stated outright in the penultimate beat: "forgiveness is not a gift but a bridge built from honesty." The antique drawer pull recurs as a symbolic hinge without prior particulars earning the resonance—it appears, glints, is clutched, then stands as "a simple hinge between past error and future mercy." The final paragraph moralizes rather than letting image carry weight. Epiphany ("mistakes remembered, lessons kept") is inscribed on parchment rather than earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of regret-as-tide and navigational redemption is stated repeatedly ("backlash of regrets," "carry the memory of his regrets as lessons") rather than emergent from scene particulars. The final image offers a mood summary ("quiet jubilation," "steady ember") instead of a non-literal, resonant answer to the central question. "Merrily melancholic" appears twice but functions as ornamentation rather than dramatized contradiction that complicates the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of empathy versus a cold world emerges from the mirror's whisper and the lake's final "breath," but it leans on direct statement ("Empathy is a seed; plant it and the world will bloom") rather than arising from particulars. The baseball and mirror function as symbolic objects without constraining choice. The protagonist's realization that "my dirty past could serve as a compass rather than a chain" is asserted in the final paragraphs, replacing scene pressure with thematic summary. The piece invites reflection, but the closure articulates the thesis rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of transcending death through transformation is stated rather than earned through particulars. The fortune-cookie line is mentioned but never reweighted or tested against cost. The final image offers "tender, infinite embrace" and explicit thesis ("the true magic was not the transformation itself but the cosmic intimacy")—overt moralizing that replaces scene pressure. Subtext is minimal; meaning is delivered through direct assertion and prompt-echo phrasing ("cosmic intimacy," "bridge between mortality and the phoenix's eternal ascent").

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of repentance/healing emerges through recurring images (crack, vapor, blossom, droplet) but the final image offers no non-literal answer to a posed question—problems resolve mechanically. "Choking beauty" and "willingly perplexed" are asserted labels rather than lived contradictions that complicate choice. The family custom of tracing hands appears mid-story as thematic ornament without constraining the cartomancer's tactics. The ending recites cosmic reconciliation ("universe stitched together") in abstract summary rather than a charged particular that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (grief-to-hope, compassion-as-key) is stated repeatedly in summary rather than emerging from concrete images or choices. "Shadow work" and "confronting hidden grief" are named but not dramatized through a specific memory or action that imposes cost. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the dimension would no longer require a locked door; it would welcome all who came seeking healing." No ambiguity or counter-reading survives; the resolution is a thesis statement rather than a resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of transformation and destiny-as-coincidence is stated repeatedly ("orchestrated coincidence," "texture of transformation," "whispering hush") rather than earned through particulars. The fireflies function as symbolic ornament without constraining choice. The final paragraph moralizes the lesson ("to understand the texture… she must first listen") instead of letting image resonate. One positive: the recurring "vibrant hush" accumulates slight textural weight, though it never reweights a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme of quiet revolution emerges through repeated motifs (bronze quill, winking hush, phosphorescent light), but the final image restates the premise rather than reweighting it—"revolution of light without flame" is the opening conceit echoed without transformation. The story favors abstract claims ("darkness could be sculpted into beauty") over scene-earned insight. No ambiguity or counter-reading complicates the tidy moral; epiphany is asserted ("the fort found its own pulse") rather than dramatized through Kael's specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "lingering promise" recurs as a thematic label in nearly every paragraph without accruing specific meaning from events—it names the theme rather than emerging from concrete turns. The final paragraph states the moral explicitly: "the eel herder's lingering promise became a beacon, a borrowed dawn for all who seek the sacred patterns of the sea," a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure with summary (−0.6). The painted rocks and Fibonacci spiral gesture toward "order from chaos," but the insight is asserted ("the universe's patterns were not fixed, but could be coaxed by intentional design") rather than earned through struggle or ambiguity. No counter-reading or genuine cost complicates the tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of scars-as-terrain and censorship is asserted ("furiously tranquil," "quiet ferocity," "beauty within each scar") but not earned through dramatized cost. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the cartography of scars, once mapped, could guide generations toward compassion" (−0.6). Thematic vocabulary ("rarefy," "cartography," "vigil in pause") recurs as lyric decoration without reweighting prior material through a concrete, non-literal final image. Subtext thin; the poet's uncensored act carries no visible consequence or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of questions becoming destinations is stated repeatedly ("turn questions into destinations," "question turned into a path") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The needle card, sundial, and overture function as symbolic tokens without constraining character choice or charging the closure. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "every question, when faced with a diplomatically fierce heart, can become a destination." No resonant image reweights prior material; the ending asserts rather than enacts theme.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme ("beauty from chaos") is stated explicitly in dialogue—"We have rebuilt a garden in stone, and the world will hear its song"—and repeated in near-identical phrasing throughout, replacing earned resonance with assertion (−0.6 for final-paragraph moralizing). Motifs (coffee tin, wildflowers, moon) are introduced and recycled without constraining choice or reweighting meaning at closure. The piece offers no ambiguity or counter-reading; every element announces its symbolic function. The final image is a thematic echo rather than a concrete particular that invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.8)
    Theme of defying time/fate is stated rather than emergent from concrete conflict. The broken clock and encore are symbolic gestures without earned wisdom or non-literal answer. Final image ("time itself had been serenaded") is a neat metaphor but lacks thematic friction or ambiguity. Subtext is absent; every image announces its own meaning (flickering compasses = guidance, arbor = refuge).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of collective memory as living archive emerges concretely through the knowledge fruit and dream pool. The final image—petals as repositories of forgotten chants, the ridge exhaling old stories—reweights the opening premise without overt moralizing. However, the incantation "Let the seed awaken, let the ridge remember, let the rain hear our story" edges toward thematic echo, and the phrase "even empirical whims could be nurtured by shared dreams" reads as a summary statement rather than earned resonance. The piece resists simplistic resolution, but the absence of dramatic cost keeps the thematic answer more illustrative than interrogative.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—forgiveness as a returning tide, unspoken apologies as feeling rather than pigment—emerges through images and the lace-pattern method. The final image ("color only those who listen can truly see") gestures toward resonance. However, the ending tells the theme rather than letting the particular compass-stone-lace triangle earn it; lines like "the color of unspoken apologies was not a pigment but a feeling" are overt thesis statements that flatten subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of resilience and renewal emerges organically through symbols like the chains, seed, and wall, without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the planted shoot and fallen wall, reweighting prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in imagery and implication, but the "wall comes down" metaphor borders on overt, though it avoids sermonizing. Earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of memory and trust emerges organically through images like the coral's "missing song" and device's "amber and teal" chord, without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of preserving fleeting moments emerges organically through Lira's arc, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the lantern's glow, reweighting prior thefts as cherished preservation. Subtext operates in gestures like her whispered promise.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically through images like the cracked bookmark and thawing heart, without direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to safety and control, reweighting prior material through the final image of the room as a cradle for inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of vulnerability as power emerges organically through events like decoding and the vial's price, not direct statement. Ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer with "every betrayal can be turned into a beacon." Subtext in seashell whispers and constellation rearrangement avoids moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of silence and void emerges through imagery and action, not statement, with subtext in the mapping process. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the map's integration into the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the synthesis of mind and matter, with subtext in images like the melting violin representing transient thoughts. The ending offers a non-literal answer through the robot's realization, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Complexity is embraced through the blurring of mundane and transcendent duties.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)

    Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the "blooming withering symphony," without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the garden's whisper, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, and earned wisdom arises from concrete particulars like the polished marbles.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of time's nonlinearity emerges through events and images like "sideways glance," offering a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of belonging emerges organically through images like the chip as a bridge, with a resonant, non-literal answer in the ending hum. Subtext operates through implication, avoiding moralizing, though some abstraction slightly dampens emotional punch.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars—the watch hand's "broken gears" echo fragmented timelines, and the final image of "metronome of redemption" offers a non-literal answer to guilt without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of humility, gradual change, and the power of tiny disturbances are coherent and well integrated with imagery (dust, decay, neutron stars, storm damage). However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements—“The universe preprocesses reality…” and “We are all dust, rearranged…”—which edge toward sermonizing rather than trusting subtext and image. The ending does offer a resonant conceptual answer, but its insight is somewhat over-articulated instead of letting the greenhouse and dust do more of the talking. As a result, the thematic work is strong but not as subtle or complex as a top-tier literary market demands.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.0)
    Thematically, survival, transformation, and finding “purpose in the pauses” are coherent with the glass/frost imagery and the notion of the ledger as a testament. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis outright (“purpose lived not in grand gestures but in the quiet pauses…”) instead of relying on subtext and image to carry that realization. The recurrence of key phrases (“steadily adaptive,” “drifting resonance”) starts to feel like slogan rather than earned wisdom. The ending resonates gently but leans into moralizing clarity rather than complex ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of survival, transmuting trauma, and giving voice to the voiceless emerge coherently from the fork, conservatory, and device, and the final communal chorus extends them beyond Mara. However, the story tends to articulate its insights directly (“She realized that…,” “understanding that her survival was more than staying afloat”), which flattens subtext. The closing paragraphs veer toward gentle moralizing, telling us about hope and redemption instead of trusting the images to carry it. Resonance is present but could be sharper and less didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of rest, remembrance, and grief as “distress signals” seeking a permanent address are strong and coherently developed through the lighthouse lens and the library of erased names. The final transformation of the library into a sanctuary and Marlow’s merging with the light give a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question of where the dead belong. However, some thematic statements slide toward explicit abstraction (“his task was not merely to illuminate, but to revitalize the very concept of rest”), slightly dulling subtext. The piece still leaves a lingering, contemplative aftereffect grounded in image rather than pure moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of solidarity under sanctions, mutual aid, and intergenerational care are coherent and organically linked to the bell, arbor, and children learning knots. The story’s images (anonymous packages, single straw, bell tone as heartbeat) do much of the thematic work without overt sermonizing. However, lines like “the purpose of all this was to build intergenerational support” slide into explicit statement and slightly flatten what the scenes already imply. The ending’s hopeful poise resonates, but could benefit from more ambiguity or a sharper sense of ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of compassion, latent love, and healing through attentive presence are coherently developed, especially in the reservoir-as-lattice image and the finale where the world “breathes back to him.” The integration of Kwan Yin’s tear and the idea of unused love as stored potential gives the piece a strong conceptual spine. That said, insights like “he understood that healing was not a single act” edge toward direct statement, sanding off some ambiguity and complexity that might push this toward true profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—time as a textured, mutable medium where memory and present intermingle—is coherently developed through recurring images: fading photographs, hyperbolic paths, breathing vines, pigments turning to threads. The dissolution of photographs into temporal “threads” effectively reweights earlier details and links loss with renewal. Some lines edge toward overt statement (“the maze’s purpose was not a puzzle to be solved but a conduit…”) which slightly flattens subtext. Still, the ending’s sense of ongoing discovery and charged fluidity offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coherently circles resilience, the breaking of oppressive silence (“When the wall comes down, the seed shall rise”), and freedom forged from unlikely tools (the arrow, the chains). The final image of planting and the first green shoot offers a resonant, non-literal answer: survival and renewal are contingent on shared knowledge and deliberate care. That said, some thematic statements verge on explicit moralizing—“a reminder that freedom can be forged from the most unexpected tools”—and simplify what could remain more suggestive. The piece leans clear rather than complex, with less ambiguity or counter-pressure than top-tier literary work typically sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory as forge, the trace of broken trust, and the transformation of absence into a new language are clear and recurrent, with strong image chains (coral’s missing song, colored pulses, aurora’s lullaby). However, the story veers into explicit statement—“memory itself is a forge,” “memory remains the bridge that stitches them together”—which borders on moralizing and flattens potential ambiguity. The ending does reweight prior images into a hopeful-but-haunted chord, which gives genuine resonance. Complexity is present but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of preserving fleeting “illuminated moments” and redefining theft as guardianship emerge coherently from the moonbeam premise and the final lantern scene. The closing images of travelers’ faces and the station as a haven resonate. Yet the text undercuts some subtlety with explicit thesis statements (“the thief’s true calling: not to steal images, but to preserve the fleeting brilliance of existence”), tipping into mild moralizing. The piece leans toward a tidy, uplifting moral rather than a more complex or ambivalent resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of control vs. care, fragility vs. resilience, and the parallel thawing of ice and heart are woven consistently through motif (glass, meltwater, bookmark). The final image of the room as a “cradle for hopeful inquiry” and the idea that “the thawing heart of the world would beat within every safe zone she forged” reweight prior detail in a satisfying way. There is some drift toward explicit statement (“She knew that to craft safe zones for inquiry she must first abandon the illusion of control”), which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the piece invites reflection on scientific work, vulnerability, and climate change without collapsing into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of betrayal, identity as mask, and vulnerability-as-power are clearly present and interwoven with imagery like the cast, lever, and seashell. However, they’re frequently articulated in overt thesis statements (“promising that I would transform betrayal into a weapon,” “every betrayal can be turned into a beacon”) rather than allowed to emerge implicitly from scene pressure. The final paragraphs lean into moralizing, softening what could be a more haunting or ambiguous resonance. The emotional aftereffect is sincere but somewhat didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of listening to the void, the limits of knowledge, and the paradox of trying to chart what refuses containment are woven consistently through images (silence as geometry, the map dissolving into air). The “covenant with the night itself, a promise to listen” flirts with explicitness but is grounded enough in the ongoing ritual that it doesn’t feel like free-floating moralizing. The final conceptual twist—that the true map exists as echo and hush rather than as artifact—reweights earlier motifs without stating a neat moral. Ambiguity about whether the project succeeds or fails thematically is productive rather than muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of mind/matter fusion, labor as ritual, and second chances looping through time are well woven, especially in the final reframing of janitorial work as “a bridge between the ordinary and the transcendent.” Recurring motifs (violin resonance, droplets, looped timelines, amalgamation) build a coherent conceptual net. Some lines tilt toward explicit thesis (“tangible proof that thoughts could be traced to a source”), blunting subtlety slightly. Still, the ending leaves a clear, resonant conceptual afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of transparency, communal honesty, and non-verbal confession are coherent and nicely mirrored in the light/shadow imagery and the recurring lens. Yet the story repeatedly names its thesis outright (“honesty had freed them,” “to thaw mistrust with transparency”), edging into gentle sermonizing rather than letting subtext and image fully carry the weight. The piece offers a clear moral answer with little complication or counter-pressure, limiting the lingering complexity expected at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of reciprocity, humility, labor, and the coexistence of bloom and decay are clear and organically linked to the gardener’s ritual and the garden’s responses. However, several lines state the theme too directly—“He had mended deception not by trickery but by honest labor” reads like an authorial gloss rather than an emergent insight. The marbles, cracks, and measurable luck do accumulate into a resonant pattern, and the final exchange between garden and keeper has genuine warmth. The piece would feel more literary at the top tier if it trusted images and actions more and declarative theme statements less.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of time’s nonlinearity, the kinship of biology and machinery, and the paradox of “icy warmth” recur through images of sideways time, living station, and resting-yet-moving wings. These motifs do reweight slightly at the end, where time’s sideways motion is linked to the station as organism and to the birds’ “futures undreamt.” However, the piece leans toward assertion (“The experiment proved…”) rather than letting readers infer deeper ambivalence or cost. The thematic field is coherent but relatively safe and uncomplicated, with little moral or emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of liminality—“in between spaces,” silence as meaningful, and wordless communication between living artist and dead prima donna—are woven through image and action rather than thesis statements. The realization that the code is “a pattern of silences” elegantly reweights prior details and avoids moralizing. The final gesture of leaving the dried program in the prima donna’s seat and promising to return lets the piece resonate beyond its scene. Complexity is modest but genuine, with a clear emotional aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of truth, certainty’s fragility, and the relationship between perception and measurement are woven consistently through the fever break, the weather instruments, and the smudged illustration. Recurring images—“swaying certainties,” “auroral sorrow,” margins between seen/felt—reconfigure nicely at the end when sorrow becomes a guide toward honesty and the weight is carried “outward rather than inward.” At times the thematic statement edges toward explicitness (“sorrow can be beautiful when it lights the path to honesty”), slightly dulling the subtextual charge. Nonetheless, the story leaves a clear, resonant conceptual aftertaste grounded in its particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of industrial guilt, the weight of buried harm, and the ethics of unearthing truth are clearly woven through motifs of the swallowed chemicals, the calibrated valve, and the ghost shift’s low hum. Mara’s skeptical yet data-driven engagement with psychics enriches a subtext about secular approaches to haunting—treating superstition as information rather than belief. The ending’s refusal to disturb the wheel offers a resonant, if quiet, stance on letting some confessions remain embedded in infrastructure. It avoids crude moralizing, but the thematic complexity could deepen further if the personal cost of that refusal were more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of silence as restorative, the ethics of witnessing versus intervening, and time’s erosion of thought are coherently woven through river, dust, and origami motifs. However, the central insight is stated outright (“silence births renewal”), tipping into thesis rather than remaining fully in image and implication. The piece favors a single, largely unchallenged idea over a more complex tension—there’s little sense of what might be lost or endangered by this surrender to silence. Resonance is present but stops short of real ambiguity or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme—“ordinary magic” in everyday gestures—is coherent and consistently threaded through the locket, the adaptive music, and the humdrum habits Liora later encourages. However, the text leans into overt statement (“magic does not need grand gestures, only attentive hearts”), which edges toward moralizing rather than letting subtext and image do the work. There is genuine emotional warmth, but the ending feels a bit too neatly inspirational, with limited ambiguity or counter-pressure. The conceptual repricing of the eclipse as a lesson in daily wonder is effective but somewhat on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of memory, realignment versus fracture, and the afterlife of human dreams arise organically from the historian’s work with walls, diaries, and axis imagery. The tapestry and conduit reconfigure the idea of apocalypse into a gentle pivot, which is a nuanced, resonant move. However, some lines state the conceptual takeaway a bit baldly (“not a fracture but a realignment”), slightly undercutting subtext. The piece invites reflection, but the thematic answer feels more explained than felt at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of “open secrets,” encoded lives, and quiet, distributed revolution are coherent and recur through fortunes, microdots, and the lighthouse beam, culminating in a conceptual reframing of fate as something quietly rewritable. Yet the story often states its themes directly (“quiet revolution,” “key of humanity,” “open mysteries”) instead of letting them fully emerge from scene and image. The ending has a resonant image (the gull with the cookie shard) but leans toward pseudo-profound abstraction rather than earned, specific insight. There is some complexity, but not much genuine moral or emotional ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of making the unseen visible, interrogating belief, and reconfiguring a community’s assumptions are woven coherently through the indigo, silence, and rhetorical-sermon motifs. The crowd’s awakening and the anchor turning from threat to beacon give a satisfying conceptual repricing of the initial situation. However, the text leans into explicit statement (“to illuminate hidden assumptions,” “exposing the hidden assumptions that had shackled the city's heart”) rather than letting image and action fully carry the insight. This slightly blunts what could be a more ambiguous, haunting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory as navigation, art as self-realization, and nostalgia repurposed into forward motion emerge organically from the recurring nautilus and horizon motifs. The revaluation of “chronologically homesick” at the end is a clean conceptual turn. However, the final moral-like line—“Your heart is the baton; the world is your score”—edges toward overt thesis and slightly flattens the otherwise suggestive imagery. Subtext remains more atmospheric than conflicted, but the emotional aftereffect is coherent and non-trivial.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of self-integration, owning all timelines, and redefining gravity as inner mastery are coherent and threaded through the tablet, viaduct, and algorithm motifs. The final conceptual move—“to own every timeline, even the fractured ones, is to master oneself”—clearly distills the story’s thesis. However, that last sentence is explicit moralizing that flattens subtext and converts resonance into stated lesson, undercutting what the prior imagery had already implied. Thematically the piece is cohesive but too eager to explain itself, which keeps it below top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of silence as mirror, backward paths enabling forward courage, and the persistence of feeling beneath numbness are coherently woven through images of hush, reversed songs, and the glowing filament. Yet the story undercuts some of its subtlety by explicitly spelling out its thesis near the end (“proved that even when the world is audibly muted, the heart can still compose a symphony of feeling,” “emotional numbness can always be rewound and healed”). These lines verge on moralizing and reduce complexity, offering a comfortingly absolute resolution. Earlier, more image-driven moments of mirrored hush and ghostly drumheads carry stronger, less didactic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—truth and integrity persisting in isolation, and “progressing laterally” around fear-imposed barriers—emerges clearly from Elara’s actions and the final sanctuary image. However, several lines slip into direct moralizing (“reminding her that honesty could survive even when the world shut its doors,” “promising that truth would always find a way”), which flattens subtext into thesis. The best thematic work is in the concrete particulars—the pigeon tube in the shaft, the storm recorder’s notebook echoing in her walking home—rather than the abstract declarations. The ending resonates gently but not with the layered complexity expected at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, loss, and the way scent resurrects history are woven tightly through concrete particulars: amber glass, petrified leaves, incense, lavender tea, and the UV-traced perfume molecules. The story’s final stance—that grief can be transformed into a “lantern of understanding”—emerges organically from Arlen’s experience with the vial and the greenhouse rather than from arbitrary authorial lecture. However, a few lines (“He realized that the impact of memories was not a passive archive but a living current…”) veer into explicit thesis-stating and slightly dilute the subtlety of the otherwise strong imagery. Still, the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question that reweights prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of time as rope/thread, memory as captivity and release, and a “playful ethic” in navigating moral paradox are coherent and echoed through the rope’s history, the tunnels woven of time, and the final act of binding. The rope/time imagery does reweight itself by the end—what was a prison escape tool becomes a chosen knot binding past and future. Yet the piece leans into explicit abstraction (“He reflected that every impossible choice he faced had been a thread in a larger tapestry…”) that states its thesis rather than letting it fully emerge from scene and image. This undercuts some subtlety and keeps the thematic resonance solid but not transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of unfinishedness, ongoing stories, and unbinding silence emerge strongly from recurring images (the bowl, the hush, the ruined orchard). However, the story frequently states its theses outright—“beauty lay not in what was completed” and “the unfinished was a canvas of endless light”—which flattens subtext into moral. Earlier concrete particulars (ash, ship ribs, vibrating copper) carry more power than the late abstract pronouncements. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and pleasant but edges into sentimentality rather than layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Ideas of half-truth, commodified empathy, and the selling of “clean emotional slates” emerge coherently from Mara’s work and the world’s economy of feeling. The recurring language of subsumption, residue, and counterfeit comfort gives the theme textural support, and the ending reframes empathy as a purchasable illusion. However, some lines veer toward explicit thesis (“a bridge between raw insight and the empathy people think they have lost”), softening the subtext. The thematic resonance is strong but would deepen if more conflict or consequence challenged Mara’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of cycles of compassion, unseen labor, and stories as intentional cargo are clear and coherent, with recurrent images (ships, ledgers, locket, readings) supporting them. However, the piece often states its thesis outright (“proving that cycles of compassion are the most reliable cargo any community can transport”), sliding into moralizing rather than trusting implication. The emotional aftereffect is warm but tidy; the story doesn’t probe conflicting costs or darker ambiguities around grief, debt, or obligation. As a result, the resonance is pleasant but not particularly deep or destabilizing.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of belonging, mutual caretaking, and the labor of connection are woven consistently through recurring images—the webs of kinship, interlocking circles, and luminescent ache. The final repricing of the tag as a living, growing symbol of healing is thematically apt and gives the story a resonant, if tidy, answer. However, lines like “proof that…a shared search could rewrite the language of belonging” verge on explicit thesis, reducing ambiguity and subtext. The emotional aftereffect is warm and affirming but somewhat didactic, with little room for genuinely unsettled reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coheres around time as sculptable, pauses as charged rather than empty, and the idea that one must “become the echo” to restore a broken rhythm. The infinity pendant, interrupted cadence, and giant’s nap recur as motifs that shift meaning by the end, culminating in a reweighted sense of non-linear time. However, the closing sentences lean toward explicit moralizing (“a reminder that even the mightiest pauses can be uncaged when one dares to borrow time”), which flattens some of the earned resonance. The piece still invites conceptual reflection, but it edges into telling instead of fully trusting its images.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of ambiguous loss, transformation, and “buried optimism” are coherent and threaded through objects (glass eyes, cracks, petals) in a pleasing way. However, the story leans into explicit thematic statement—“grief plus hope equals a new kind of growth,” “the ambiguous loss was not an absence but a transformation”—that edges toward essay rather than purely emergent meaning. The ending’s garden-of-possibilities image does carry real resonance, but also feels slightly moralizing and tidy. More restraint in overtly naming the thesis would strengthen subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of visibility, grief, forgotten stories, and custodianship of memory are well integrated with specific images (ferromagnetic tape as encoded sunrise, phantom patrons, commuters sensing invitation). The idea that visibility means allowing grief to surface is strong but is occasionally underlined too directly (“She knew that visibility was not merely being seen…”). The ending offers a resonant answer—Maren as quiet beacon—without collapsing entirely into moral, though it edges close. Overall thematic work is coherent and affecting, just shy of subtlety at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of non-coercive transformation and the paradox of control are coherent and supported by repeated images (the leaf, coil, storm, greenhouse). However, insights are heavily articulated in thesis-like sentences—“the most sustainable change was always sustained by releasing control”—rather than left to emerge from scene and image. This direct moralizing flattens what could be a more unsettling or ambiguous lesson about agency and manipulation. The final tone is thoughtful but a bit didactic and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of art as both record and sacrifice, the conversion of grief into something restorative, and the reciprocity between human meaning-making and a damaged world are well integrated. The brooch as compass versus her own “wryly earnest pursuit of meaning” provides a satisfying thematic turn. Some lines veer close to thesis statements (“the true compass was her own…pursuit of meaning”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall, the final image of painting the convergence with preserved colors carries genuine resonance without overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of embracing uncertainty, magnifying everyday magic, and re-framing darkness as fertile/“bright” emerge clearly through recurring images of the pearl, shadows, and echoing music. However, the piece often states its meanings directly (“reminding all who hear that even the darkest tunnels can shine with the light of unseen possibility”), tipping into gentle sermonizing. The final moments with the child’s onyx eyes and the pilgrim’s bow do offer a resonant image of communal, ongoing transformation. The lack of counter-pressure or friction keeps the thematic field relatively simple and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme is strong: memory as a living tide, the necessity of gaps and silences, and meaning as a communal co-creation rather than a single voice’s account. These ideas emerge through concrete patterns (fragments arriving with each dock, the valve shifting from herald to archive, the crowd assembling a map no one alone could draw) rather than explicit moralizing. The ending reweights the premise by extending his curatorial role outward to the wider sea, implying both possibility and burden. Some phrasing (“compile fragments into meaning,” “reactively visionary”) edges toward thematic label but doesn’t fully flatten the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of hidden narratives, art and analysis as ways of knowing, and the ethics of tending “unspoken truths” emerge coherently from the particulars (maps, ledger, phantom punch). The conceptual twist—that the fortress is a living archive and she a conduit—reweights earlier imagery nicely. However, the ending edges toward exposition (“She realized…” “was not a place of stone”) and states insight rather than fully embodying it. Resonant, but somewhat over-explained and lightly contested.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, migration, doubt vs wonder, and reflection emerge organically through the whales, the mutable numbers, and the act of transcription; the final realization that the “unheard symphony” is a feeling rather than a sound reweights prior imagery cleanly. The piece resists a blunt moral, instead offering a quiet answer about how skepticism can become a bridge to communal, contemplative space. Some phrasing edges toward essayistic abstraction (“sculpt space for reflection,” “shared memory”), which occasionally feels thematic-first rather than entirely scene-grown. Still, the resonance of migration as recurring but never identical memory-journey is strong and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic concern with what follows “goodbye” and with transition vs. finality is clear and structurally integrated, especially in the closing image of him saying goodbye to emptiness itself. However, the theme is stated quite directly (“He realized that saying goodbye was not a final cut but a transition…”) and the twin’s line reads close to thesis articulation, reducing subtext. The piece does invite some reflection, but it leans on explanation where more dramatized ambiguity could deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—fairness as reciprocal covenant rather than legal formality, and death as a conduit for ethical rebalancing—emerges clearly from the ink’s function, Mara’s lineage, and the asylum frame. The notion of “mathematics of a fair trade” provides a strong thematic spine, and the redefinition of asylum as “a living covenant of reciprocity” neatly reweights earlier material. However, the story often states its ideas directly (“She understood that the fairness she sought could not be imposed by law alone...”), slipping toward essayistic exposition rather than letting theme arise solely from image and action. The resonance is real but somewhat over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme is coherent and integrated: the interplay of silence, time, and “invented histories” accumulates toward the idea that stories are bridges across temporal voids. Motifs like the lamp’s hum, refracted light, bonsai growth, and pressed textures recur and subtly shift meaning by the end. However, the line “invented histories were not lies but bridges” edges into thesis statement, slightly flattening what had been suggestively embodied in images. The resonance is real and lingers, but the lack of on-page conflict and the touch of explicitness keep it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of erasure, bureaucratic violence, and the ethics of remembering arise organically from the premise and object, rather than through overt moralizing. The repeated focus on “texture” and “layers” of memory gives the piece a strong conceptual spine that reweights itself at the end when he accepts life as a “living archive.” Lines like “Erased histories were the port’s silent victims” verge on explicit statement but still feel grounded in scene. The ending lingers conceptually, though it stops short of a more complex ambiguity or darker cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of myth, epistemology, and the survival of wonder are coherent and well-linked to the objects (shell, compass, cello) and Selene’s profession. However, the story states its thesis quite baldly (“the riddle was not a puzzle to solve but a reminder that myths survive when retold…”) and ends on a fairly didactic “simple, cheering truth.” Subtext exists—in the interplay of grief for the mentor and the observatory’s decay vs. her optimism—but it’s overshadowed by explicit explanation. The piece invites reflection but leans toward essay-like moralizing rather than letting images carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of communal resistance to gentrification, maps as living social infrastructure, and the tension between chaos and order emerge naturally from events and recurring images (chip, graffiti, phoenix). The ending reweights the city as a “living map” and emphasizes ongoing struggle rather than neat victory, which adds some complexity. At the same time, phrases like “blueprint for resistance” and “even before privatization, community could reinvent itself” edge toward thesis and soften subtext. The piece invites reflection but sometimes explains what its images already imply.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of preservation versus loss, human ambition versus inevitable decay, and the attempt to archive fleeting experiences into enduring artifacts are well integrated with the act of photographing the sand grain. The final beats—“captured breath of time,” “hush we leave behind,” and the melancholic gaze at Earth—reweight the whole ritual as elegy rather than mere documentation. Subtextually, there’s a quiet critique of colonial expansion erasing its own past. Thematic statements verge on explicit in places, which slightly reduces the sense of discovery and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of repair, perception beyond sight, and technology as bridge between “broken things and new horizons” emerge organically from action and recurring imagery (mist, light, wings). The final paragraphs offer a resonant answer—quiet, ongoing work as promise—without devolving into outright moralizing. However, a few lines edge toward thesis-statement clarity (“each repaired wing was a promise to the world outside the mist”), slightly flattening ambiguity. The piece invites reflection but largely reinforces a single, harmonious view of craft and progress rather than holding more complex ethical or emotional tension.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of origin, convergence, language as map/magic, and the tension between silence and emergence are coherently woven through condensation patterns, multilingual “Kaltwasser,” and the thawing lake. The notion that “every river is born from ice, and ice is born from silence” verges on aphoristic, but it fits the mythic register and grows from the concrete images rather than pure abstraction. The final convergence of signal, thaw, and her readiness to record offers a non-literal answer about how beginnings are witnessed and inscribed. Complexity is present—tranquility coupled with dread, hope with looming flood—without collapsing into sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of balance between stone and spirit, communal reanimation, and the unseen labor that undergirds community are clearly woven through repeated images (footsteps, bells, hush, the archway). The final image of a town breathing in harmony with the tuner’s invisible rhythm offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how communities are (re)made. However, the treatment is relatively smooth and gentle—there’s little moral tension or ambiguity, and the cost of that balance is idealized rather than interrogated. A touch less abstraction and more dramatized friction would deepen the thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of fear vs. purpose, commodifying the ephemeral, and sharing private transcendence with others emerge cleanly from the vial and temple dynamics. Recurring motifs (“gathered hush,” “lonesome splendor,” sunrise scent) do shift meaning by the end, especially as the vial becomes a communal rather than personal boon. Yet the text leans into explicit statement (“she realized her true motivation,” “offer a fleeting perfume of hope”) where image could suffice, edging toward didactic. The resonance is genuine but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of truth, the burden of warning, and reconfiguring a cursed legacy into guidance are woven through recurrent images (lattice, reef, hush, lighthouse-as-prison/beacon). The line “every warning is a thread, not a wall” is strong but very explicit, edging toward thesis rather than letting the images do all the work. The hush transforming from escape fantasy into earned, quiet redemption at the end has real resonance. Overall, the piece invites reflection without collapsing into full sermonizing, but subtlety could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of cyclical debt, sacrificial love, and transformation from metal to memory are well-integrated, with motifs (bead, roots, frost, endless night) evolving meaningfully by the end. The final image—travelers moved to tears by a “lovingly venomous echo”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about how harm and devotion can coexist in redemption. At times, the piece edges toward over-articulation by repeating key terms (“mournful elation,” “lovingly venomous”) rather than trusting pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme is coherent: renewal, the sanctity of quiet labor, and the idea that breaking ossified rules can restore reverence. Recurring images (orchids, tides, weaving, ruin vs. reverence) are well aligned, and the final image of the labyrinth as beacon supports that. However, the text edges into explicit moralizing (“promising that every ruin could become reverence”), flattening complexity. Subtext is present but relatively simple; there’s little ambiguity or friction to complicate the message.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of diaspora, continuity with ancestors, and faith as something patiently rebuilt through ritual are coherently woven through the imagery of roots, bones, and the sundial. The notion of “interrupted journeys”—of both scholars and pilgrims—is conceptually strong and returns in the ancestral voice thanking Mara. However, the closing paragraphs slide toward sentiment and near-moralizing (“a testament to patient rebuilding and hopeful wandering”), smoothing away ambiguity or sharper costs. The resonance is real but relatively safe and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of margins, obsolete media, and the tension between analog and digital are clearly woven through images of chalk, arcade machines, and the letter’s journey. However, the piece sometimes states its thesis too directly (“the margins held the most luminous stories”), weakening subtext and leaving less for the reader to infer. The final image does reweight earlier material in a satisfying way, but it leans toward essayistic declaration rather than fully dramatized insight. There is resonance, but it lacks the layered ambiguity of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of truth vs power, unheard stories, and wisdom disguised as foolishness are woven consistently through the image system (loom, flame, adjacent possibilities, silence). The final contrast—“History would remember the fire’s glow, not the blade that would later strike”—offers a resonant reweighting of what counts as historical agency. Some thematic lines veer toward explicit statement (“She smiled, knowing that unraveling conspiracies required not only sharp eyes but a heart that listened to the unheard”), slightly undercutting the piece’s otherwise strong subtext. Still, the stitched sky as proof of sewn truth is a potent non-literal answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    Silence, apology, and healing are tightly braided through the shard, unsent letters, and the spirits’ song, yielding a coherent meditation on how truth is released. The final understanding—that the apology required evoking truth rather than direct speech—offers a resonant answer to the initial problem of unsaid words. However, the piece occasionally explains its own meaning (“she understood the apology had never needed words”) instead of trusting images and actions to carry the insight, softening the subtext. The thematic stance is nuanced but leans toward tidy consolation rather than more fraught ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—turning war trauma and “shared anxieties” into resilient, communal strength—is clear and coherently embodied by the coral and cast motifs. The recurring grafting/resilience imagery (brain coral pathways, new meaning on old wounds) builds a solid, non-trivial resonance. Some lines verge on declarative thesis (“promising that the graft she was making would not erase the past”) rather than trusting subtext. Nonetheless, the final image of the droplet and the “lotus-hearted ache” delivers a genuine, if gently overstated, emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.2)
    Themes of art as light, communal healing, and joy reclaimed from sorrow are coherent and threaded through the imagery and outcome. Yet the piece undercuts its own subtlety by explicitly stating its thesis multiple times (“She realized the true power of her craft…”; “May we always find joy where shadows once held sway”). This drifts toward sentimentality and moralizing instead of trusting the images and actions. The emotional aftereffect is gentle but overly tidy, with little ambiguity or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thematic throughline of listening, curiosity, and the relinquishing of certainty is clear and woven through recurring images (reflected sound, nested awakenings, murals reforming). The final choice—to answer with a smile rather than certainty and to promisingly “paint with curiosity itself”—offers a resonant, non-literal response to that theme. However, the theme is at times over-articulated in abstract terms (“to exchange certainty for curiosity”) rather than fully entrusted to image and action. Greater reliance on implication over thesis-language would make the resonance feel less didactic and more earned.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of un-taxable thought, encoded dissent, and community resistance emerge strongly from recurring images: the gourd seed, seedlings-as-language, insects as gossip, and the soil network. The final transformation of the greenhouse into a “living archive of rebellion” nicely reweights earlier material and ties freedom of thought to material, humble things. However, the story occasionally tips into direct thesis-stating (“after thoughts become taxable… the mind’s free verse is auctioned”) and summary moralizing in the final paragraphs. The resonance is real, but some of it is told rather than earned purely through scene.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of art as alchemy, pain-to-beauty transformation, and intergenerational healing are clear and resonant, especially in the final handoff to the distant child. Motifs (blossoms, light, lullabies, reef) echo through the piece and reweight the closing image without overt moralizing. However, the thematic arc is relatively straightforward, with little counter-pressure or ambiguity; it tells us this transformation is possible more than it interrogates its limits or costs. The result is moving but somewhat singular in emotional register.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, preservation, and the cyclical nature of loss are coherent and emerge organically from recurring images (orchids, names, echoes, dunes-to-bloom metaphor). The final beats—regret softening into gratitude, acknowledging that “loss was part of the cycle”—offer a clear, resonant answer to the story’s question. At times, the piece edges toward explicit statement (“so the desert of lost emotions could one day bloom again”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the overall aftertaste is emotionally specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of covenant, memory, and trust versus silence are well woven through promises, chords, and the archive’s muteness, culminating in a resonant image of renewed dialogue. The idea of truth as symphonic and relational (glyphs as promises to the next) is strong and thematically aligned with her mission. However, the thematic patterning can feel slightly over-declared and tidy, with minimal ambiguity or counter-pressure to complicate the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of empathy encoded in infrastructure and the reconciliation of preservation vs. progress are well-embodied by the chain’s “encrypted compassion” and the empathetic algorithm running the floodgate. The narrative meaningfully suggests that technology must carry memory of shared humanity, not just power, and the council elder’s silent conversion reinforces that. However, some lines verge on thesis statement (“not by conquest but by conversation”), nudging toward a tidy moral rather than allowing ambiguity. Still, the final configuration—the city literally watered by empathy—is resonant and conceptually satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, loss, and the layering of past and present are woven effectively through recurring images of dust, maps, songs, and the meteorite’s fading glow. The metaphor of reinvention “like moss blooming over stone” nicely crystallizes the idea that renewal does not erase history, and the birds’ routes literalize the dispersal of small, portable hope. However, the text occasionally slides into explicit thesis statements (“She realized that reinvention does not erase…”) that undercut some of the subtextual power already built by the imagery. The resonance is real but a shade too stated to hit the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thresholds, sacred pauses, inheritance, and the idea of “necessary distances” are woven consistently through the maze, terrace, wind, and logbook motifs. The thematic payoff that “the true distance…is the space between wonder and understanding” clearly reweights prior images. However, that final sentence veers into explicit moralizing rather than letting the images fully carry the insight, slightly flattening the resonance. The piece still leaves a lingering conceptual aftertaste, but with less ambiguity than a top-tier literary venue would favor.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of belonging, communion between land and sea, and the idea that remnants (“ash”) can illuminate new horizons are consistent and organically tied to recurring images (fireflies, constellations, tides). However, the story leans into explicit articulation—“the rhythm of belonging was not a static beat,” “the soft engine that powered the cosmos of belonging”—which edges toward thesis statements rather than fully trusting image and event. The emotional aftereffect is gentle wonder more than complex resonance; ambiguity or friction is minimal. The core insight feels tasteful but somewhat familiar and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece coherently explores memory as tidal, fragmentary, and repairable when the right emotional resonance is found, and the final realization about “disappearing paths” lands as a thematic answer. Recurring images—seeds, colors, tide, bridge—build a consistent meditation on recollection and healing. That said, the theme is sometimes over-explicitly stated (“She realized that the disappearing paths were not lost, but merely awaiting…”) instead of wholly entrusted to image and action. The aftertaste is thoughtful and gentle, but a touch didactic rather than fully oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of creating order and meaning from chaos—and of “serenading monotony with creativity”—is coherent and borne out through the bishops, tide, ink X, and improvised music. However, it’s frequently articulated directly in thesis-like lines (“He believed that magic could happen by ordering randomness,” “I aim to serenade monotony with creativity”), which flattens subtext. The ending reinforces rather than reweights the theme; his whispered vow restates what the story has already made clear. The piece is thematically consistent but leans toward explicit statement over earned, surprising resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of voluntary solitude, art as bridge, and possibility hidden in perceived “gaps” are nicely braided with recurrent images (foam, gaps, moonstone dust, exile as conduit). The final reconfiguration of exile into pilgrimage is resonant and well-aligned with the earlier patterning. However, lines like “the gaps she observed were not empty, but filled with possibilities” edge into explicit thesis-statement territory, slightly flattening subtext. The piece is thematically coherent and affecting, but a bit too willing to explain its insight.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of “illuminating value in the mundane” is clear and consistently echoed through images of nets-as-crowns, glass, ledgers, and ripples-as-scripture. However, the story frequently states its thesis outright (“the purpose of this ritual was to illuminate value in the mundane,” “value lives in every ripple”), which tips into moralizing rather than letting subtext carry the weight. There is some genuine resonance in the recurring stone and ledger motifs, but little counter-pressure or ambiguity to complicate the insight. The result is thematically coherent but somewhat didactic and less profound than its language suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of transforming pain into shared language and the non-transactional nature of innocence are coherent and consistent, especially in the final reframing (“the true bargain had never been about buying innocence, but about gifting it back”). However, the piece relies heavily on explicit thematic statements rather than allowing images and events to carry the weight, which blunts subtext. The moral calculus feels a bit tidy, with little meaningful ambiguity or resistance to the stated lesson. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and hopeful but borders on sermonizing rather than earning complexity through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of hope as a measurable yet co-created phenomenon, and of art and mathematics in resonance, are clear and consistently threaded through balloons, equations, decorations, and the gauge. However, they are sometimes over-explicitly stated—“the gauge was not a broken relic but a mirror”—rather than left to emerge fully from image and action. The piece risks sentimentality by having the community’s revitalization occur smoothly and unanimously, with little ambiguity or shadow. Still, the final image of sea‑etched spirals and living “textbook of optimism” offers a concrete, resonant answer to the initial question.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of memory, stewardship, and collective imagination emerge clearly from concrete images like the film negative, the gifts scholars leave, and the evolving dreams with the seasons. The shift from “legacy’s burden” to shared communion is a resonant answer to the story’s initial question about what walls dream. However, the theme is over-articulated in lines such as “the true map was not of corridors, but of the collective imagination,” which slides toward explicit thesis. Subtext exists but is often translated into overt statement rather than fully trusted in image.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of possibility, perception, and the transformative power of art/children’s songs are coherent and recur through mirrors, doors, and “borrowed heartbeat.” However, the story edges into explicit moralizing in lines like “reminding all who entered that possibilities are merely reflections waiting for a borrowed heartbeat to awaken them,” which flattens nuance. There is little counterpressure or ambiguity—the world readily aligns with his hopeful vision—so the thematic frame feels affirmed rather than interrogated. The aftertaste is pleasant but not deeply unsettling or reconfiguring.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of redemption, the cost of peace, and “anchoring ideals in practice” are clear and recur via swords, feast, and the clipboard-as-treaty. The final images—the terrace as testament, dawn as the “first true step”—offer a resonant, if gentle, answer: peace is paid for in listening and compassion rather than gold. Yet the story frequently states its themes directly (“The price of redemption had been taken, not in gold, but in the willingness to listen...”), edging toward didactic moralizing. Complexity is limited; we see little of why some might resist or fail this ideal, which flattens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    The tension between cruelty and preservation—“a fragment of grace forged from cruelty”—threads through drought, egg, and echo with satisfying coherence. Recurring motifs (cracks as map/veins, echo, resonance) shift meaning by the end, inviting reflection on how legacies are recorded and misread. At times the thematic language edges toward being a bit declarative (“a reminder that even a manufactured drought could not erase the song”), slightly reducing subtlety. Still, the piece leaves a lingering, complex moral aftertaste rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of conformity versus individual expression, and rebellion as art rather than violence, are woven consistently through the prism, echoes, and her song touching “untold stories.” The final reconfiguration—from lullaby to chorus of individual voices—offers a resonant, non-literal answer that fits the established imagery. However, several formulations (“turning conformity into art,” “narrative of revolt”) lean toward abstract slogan rather than emerging solely from particular, pressured moments. The lack of on-page ambivalence or visible cost keeps the thematic treatment from feeling fully complex or hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme—reversing exploitative narratives and granting audiences agency—is clear and coherent, supported by recurring images of strings, reversal, and half-lit epiphanies. However, it is also heavily articulated in thesis-like sentences (“Selene believed that stories could be told with conscience,” “ethical storytelling was less about dictating truth”), undercutting subtext. The final movement leans into explicit moral framing rather than letting the images and choices carry the insight. The result is intellectually neat but somewhat didactic, with limited lingering ambiguity or emotional aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematic throughlines—ephemerality versus remembrance, honoring the unnoticed, and finding non-monumental modes of memory—are well woven through particular images (moth wing, knots, dissolving structures). The final beats reweight the premise by insisting that fleeting, fragile gestures can matter as much as stone monuments. However, several lines verge on explicit statement (“Thus the overlooked histories found a voice...”), slightly flattening the subtext. The theme is coherent and resonant but could trust images a bit more.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, redemption, and thawing emotional cold are coherently embodied in the rope, melting ice, and aurora-lit sanctum. The closing notion that preserving forgotten names “was not merely archival—it was a living conduit that could thaw the deepest cold within any heart” edges into explicit thesis-stating, undercutting otherwise well-earned resonance. Still, the recurring images and the shift from private ritual to communal resource provide a real conceptual reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece engages thoughtfully with themes of reciprocity between traveler and world, the sentience of paths, and renewal emerging from ruin. Motifs like the wafer seal, the directive, and the storm’s “mournful and mischievously hopeful” tone accumulate into a coherent meditation on choice and being chosen. However, several insights are spelled out directly (“She understood that the forest’s paths chose their walkers because...”), edging toward paraphrased thesis instead of leaving more weight to subtext. The ending reweights prior images well, but the thematic statement is a little too explicit for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of frugality versus cosmic abundance, measured devotion, and the union of mathematics and faith are coherent and integrated with the imagery of ledgers, grain, and stars. The recurring ideas of “cosmic ledger” and “dusky harmony” effectively connect his mundane scarcity to a grander order. However, the final paragraphs lean into telling (markets thrumming, grain stores never empty, scholars whispering) that edges toward moral summary rather than allowing implication and image to do the work. The thematic answer feels slightly too tidy and untroubled for elite literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of nonviolent transformation, release of resentment, and the persistence of peace in “cellular memory” are cohesive and supported by the recurring images of touch, vibration, and shifting sanctuary walls. However, the text leans into overt thematic declaration (“her pacifist philosophy proved that the most potent weapons were the subtle shifts of grace hidden in ordinary acts”), which flattens subtext into moral. The ending’s articulation of the sanctuary as a beacon of peace is affecting but also tidy and unambiguous, leaving limited room for complexity or counter-reading. More dramatized struggle and less explicit thesis-stating would raise the thematic sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The thematic throughline about erasing boundaries (between reflection and reality, past and present, self and environment) emerges organically from mirrors, fog, and the dream returning to the orchard. The final realization—that erasing boundaries is “weaving together of separate songs” and expanding the world by erasing space between—offers a resonant answer to the initial premise. That said, several lines state the theme directly (“boundaries are merely shadows of fear”), veering toward didactic rather than fully letting images and events carry it. The complexity is there, but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of renewal, repair, and generational wisdom are coherent and supported by recurring images (leaves, vows, ribbon, cracked quartz). However, the piece frequently states its ideas outright—“accidental wisdom,” “promised that even broken things could find a season to heal,” “reminding them that every fracture holds a seed of renewal”—sliding into moralizing rather than trusting subtext. The final paragraphs in particular tell the lesson quite directly instead of letting the closing images speak for themselves. Resonance is present but blunted by these explicit thematic declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of nonlinear inheritance, memory looping, and knowledge as a communal, temporal network are coherent and well-integrated with the pistachio shell and orchard motifs. The great-grandmother’s appearance and the backward-inherited memories nicely embody the abstract idea. However, the final paragraph tips into explicit moralizing (“knowledge is a garden that grows in loops, and the only way to harvest it is to tend the soil of one’s bewilderment”), undercutting some of the earned resonance. The insight is interesting but a bit too neatly stated rather than left to emerge from image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematic threads—gaps as guides, “unlearned lessons,” listening to “the silence between words,” and the unheard symphony—interweave with the plot in a satisfying way. The idea that what is missing or uncatalogued contains essential knowledge is dramatized through the diary’s omissions and the blank scrolls. Some late phrasing (“saving the knowledge that had never been learned,” “self-fulfilling promise”) edges toward explicit statement, but it remains within the lyrical frame rather than outright moralizing. The ending offers a resonant conceptual answer: careful attention to absence can literally rewrite futures.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme around stories, names, and the transformation of trapped freedom into purposeful liberation is coherent and well-mirrored in recurring images (rust vs. bloom, ink vs. light, silence vs. verses). The final commitment “to catalog the silence of forgotten seas” lands with a clear, resonant answer to the central question of what it means to “recapture.” However, the sentence “the true recapture was not of objects, but of stories that set them free” states the thesis a bit baldly, undercutting some subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme—that absence shapes reality and can be ordered into meaning—is well integrated through the door, seal, rope, and Mara’s professional ethos. The final realization that “absence were not voids but bridges” and the softer tower echo form a clear conceptual repricing of the initial paradox. However, several lines state the theme outright (“The fables whispered that what is missing shapes the world…”, “lesson that absence can be harnessed”), edging toward didactic. Resonance is present but slightly blunted by this explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of balance between echo and silence and the idea that true quiet is relational rather than absolute are nicely embedded in images like the melting crack patterns and the softened energy beings. The recurring attention to “bloom of hush” and “hammered repose” gives the piece a coherent conceptual spine. That said, the line “He understood that the quiet he sought was not the absence of sound, but the balance between echo and silence” slides into explicit thesis-statement territory, blunting some subtext. The ending is resonant but a bit too neatly interpretive for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of pattern versus randomness, renewal after collapse, and the value of damaged things are woven consistently through motifs like the shard, stars, and “thistle-blown hope.” However, the piece frequently states its thesis outright (“prove that coincidences have meaning,” “fate is a thread they can follow”), reducing room for subtext or counter-reading. The closing paragraphs lean into near-moralizing, summarizing the promise of hope rather than letting images alone carry the weight. The resonance is genuine but somewhat over-explained for high-end literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme around collective memory, identity sculpted from experience, and conjecture as a bridge is coherent and developed through recurring images (crystal, shadows, hush, rain). The final realization that conjecture links present to recorded ages reweights the prior imagery in a satisfying way. However, some lines verge on thesis-statement (“His motivation was simple: to sculpt identity from experience”; “the act of conjecture itself was a bridge”), edging toward explicitness rather than trusting subtext. The piece still leaves a genuine, if gentle, afterglow of reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of art transforming despair, play as a serious spiritual act, and turning sorrow into pattern (“note in mosaic”) are coherent and recur across concrete motifs. The final realization—“to filter despair through art, to let hope sparkle in darkness”—matches the imagery of filtering, sparks, and mosaics. However, the epiphany is stated rather explicitly, tipping into mild moralization rather than fully trusting the images to carry the weight. Complexity is limited; the piece doesn’t truly wrestle with ambiguity or the costs of this vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of transition, pauses, and time as cyclical/sea-like are coherently developed through tides, reflections, and the cicada’s song. The final understanding that “the true foretelling lay not in predicting words but in feeling the subtle shift of intention” nicely reweights prior images. However, insight is sometimes over-explained via direct statements (“time is not a line but a sea”), edging toward mild didacticism instead of trusting the imagery. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and contemplative rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of how constraint can hold vastness, and how silence has texture and value, emerge organically from the doll, trellis, and bunkered life. The final image of a cramped space holding “the vastness of a sky” reweights earlier motifs in a satisfying way. That said, some thematic lines (“provided one learned to stretch the contracted heart”) verge on explicit moralizing, slightly dulling the subtext. The piece still invites reflection on interior versus exterior expanses beyond its plot.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of transit, silence, and shared calm are coherent and arise from recurring images (train whistle echo, storm glass, hush carried by passengers). However, they are often stated instead of implied: “Lira’s motivation was clear: to teach silence how to comfort each wandering mind” and “they were all moving toward a destination that was simply peace” edge into thesis-statement territory. The repeated framing of silence as teacher and guide has resonance, especially in the closing garden scene, but the lack of friction or counterpoint makes the insight feel somewhat pre-packaged. The piece invites gentle reflection more than complex reconsideration.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of memory versus possibility and analog/digital unity recur coherently through images of codices, data trees, and the throne as a bridge. The final realization that the stairway is “a bridge between memory and possibility” lands thematically but is stated outright rather than allowed to emerge subtextually. The new ruby flake as symbol of balance between past and “onward dreams” is apt yet somewhat didactic. There is resonance, but the piece leans toward explicit thesis where a more oblique, image-led ending could linger longer.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges cleanly from image and action: scars as conduits, thresholds as bridges, isolation repurposed into connection, teaching darkness to breathe. Recurring motifs (bridges, breath, scars, thresholds, loaded silence) are reweighted by the final image of the sanctuary “puls[ing] with the promise of connection.” The piece edges toward explicitness in lines like “now pulsed with the promise of connection,” which feels closer to thesis than image. Still, the central conceptual repricing of darkness and scars is coherent and resonant beyond the literal scene.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of exploitation vs. trust, transforming oppressive pressure into creative value, and honesty over greed are organic to the premise and character history. However, the story undercuts its own subtlety by explicitly articulating its thesis in lines like “the world would reward those who volunteered honesty over greed, and the pressure of truth would always spawn brilliance.” Much of the latter section shifts from dramatized implication to direct statement and metaphoric abstraction. The resonance is there, but the moral is told rather than allowed to fully emerge from image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of curiosity versus willful ignorance, listening to silence, and reframing “ending” as transformation are coherent and supported by the gramophone and archive motifs. However, they are often articulated directly (“not to shame… but to teach them,” “transforming silence into a new kind of eloquence”) rather than left to emerge from implication. The repeated phrases (“bridge of intuition,” “eloquently silent”) risk pseudo-profundity and dilute subtlety. The ending does offer a resonant conceptual shift, but it edges into moralizing exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of loyalty-as-song versus chain, performance as shared creation, and “possibility” as a living force accrue through recurring images (murmured allegiance, stage, scripts, constellations). The final insight—that his allegiance is now to possibility itself—does reweight prior material, especially the marionette program and the breathing greenhouse. However, some phrasings verge on spelled-out thesis (“understood that loyalty was not a chain but a song”), reducing subtlety. The piece invites reflection but leans on generalized, lofty language rather than fully grounded emotional paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of visibility, care for the forgotten, and the endurance of small kindnesses emerge organically from the dust/button imagery and the foster-care context. The recurring act of “unfurling” histories through dust and light gives a clear non-literal answer: attention can retroactively dignify neglected lives. There is a mild tendency toward on-the-nose articulation (“filed it under ‘Acts of Compassion’”) that edges into statement rather than pure implication. Still, the ending’s image of the button “unfurling new kindnesses” in future hands is resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of memory, narrative control, and resistance to “the tyranny of indifference” are well integrated via recurrent images of reflected maps, revised histories, and coded transmissions. The lagoon’s water as “liquid memory” and the idea of forgotten acts being inserted into public record provide strong thematic machinery rather than mere ornament. However, some lines lean toward explicit thesis (“not by force, but by the quiet persistence of coded freedom”), edging into mild sermonizing for a top-tier venue. The resonance is genuine and coherent, but a touch more obliqueness and complication would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of silence as active force, music as erasure, and the impermanence of both danger and memory emerge organically through recurring images of mist, negative space, and dissolving code. The eerie nostalgia and focus on “hunting silence” invite reflection on the cost of quiet guardianship without spelling out a moral. The ending’s legend-framing and phantom chord effect reweight earlier images, giving a gentle but real afterglow. It stops short of deeper moral or psychological complexity, but the thematic weave is coherent and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of reciprocity between human care and forest memory, and of tending as a form of translation and preservation, emerge clearly through repeated images (seed rows, leaf script, monuments). The closing articulation that the pact “sealed” and that others may become bridges between root and sky offers a satisfying conceptual answer to the opening folklore. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“patient librarians of the arboreal archive”), edging toward statement over subtext. Nonetheless, the symbolic economy of seeds, leaves, and monuments carries genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty in invention and planning is coherent and integrated through repeated motifs (broken clocks, compass, ashes, currents). Yet it becomes over-explicit, especially in the inscription and the closing paragraphs that essentially state the moral. Subtext exists in the way her craft and setting mirror the theme, but is overshadowed by stated lessons. The ending lands emotionally but leans toward didactic rather than open, resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of redemption, the weight of names, and the ethics of measured transformation are strongly woven through the coin, the ledger metaphor, and her childhood beliefs. The kintsugi seam and the final awareness that “every syllable bore a measured heft” give a resonant, non-didactic answer to the story’s questions. At times the language edges toward essayistic abstraction (“redemption was not a single transaction but a continuous negotiation”), which slightly blunts the organic emergence of theme from concrete action. Still, the final image reweights prior motifs effectively without collapsing into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The thematic arc from grief and confession toward healing through imperfect, “broken” laughter is coherent and well embodied in the misaligned harp and crooked tooth motifs. The ending offers a resonant answer—broken music can mend souls; sorrow can be transmuted without erased pain—without slipping into overt moralizing, though “She understood her purpose” leans toward explicit thesis. The luminous ache / laughter blend in the last paragraphs leaves a tangible emotional aftereffect. Complexity is present but relatively gentle; the piece doesn’t fully explore darker or more ambivalent edges of its ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic throughlines—trauma transmuted into mercy, pain as necessary memory rather than something to erase—are organically tied to setting and object. However, the story leans heavily into explicit statement: “mercy equals the sum of understood suffering divided by the willingness to remember” and “to calculate mercy she must first remember the pain” verge on direct moralizing. The best moments are more imagistic, such as the strap turning almost golden under ordinary sun. Overall resonance is strong but lessened by on-the-nose articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of memory, overlooked histories, translation, and the seen/unseen recur organically via the lighthouse, fragment, anchors, and market. The final recognition that “time itself is a series of anchors” nicely reweights earlier imagery without collapsing into a bald moral, though some sentences come close to explicit thesis-stating. The emotional effect is contemplative and gently moving rather than piercing. Overall, the thematic weave is coherent and resonant, if somewhat on-the-nose in its closing reflections.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The “cracks in the façade” motif nicely reframes from structural flaw to guiding frame, tying together ghosts, architecture, and Mara’s vocation of seeing what’s hidden. The theme of acknowledging and recording forgotten lives (the ledger, dust paths, gratitude) emerges organically from the investigation. The ending’s revaluation of her “weightless burden” into purpose is resonant, if a bit tidy and gently affirming. There’s room for more bite or complexity—some cost or ambivalence about carrying these stories forward.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of breaking illusory perfection to reveal a richer, negotiable reality and of capturing “eternity” in a moment emerge clearly from events and recurring images (bottle, frost, rupture, lattice). The final reconfiguration of the library into portals of “eternal now” provides a resonant answer to the opening stakes, even if the emotional cost of this shift remains abstract. At times the story drifts into quasi-thesis language (“testimony that rustling awakenings can rewrite even the most immutable codes”), which flattens subtext into statement. Still, the thematic throughline is coherent and organically woven through the motif work.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of transforming violence into story, reframing history through art, and embracing a revolution of culture over arms are integrated through concrete motifs (shard, mirrors, storms). The ending powerfully reprices what “revolution” means via the line about “a symphony of mirrors, storms, and verses” and the quiet act of pocketing a fragment. Some thematic statements verge on explicit thesis and modestly undercut subtext, but the piece still leaves a resonant, reflective aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of truth versus dishonesty, tending decay, and the dignity of craft (“mending what isn’t torn,” covenant thriving on truthful metal) are coherent and organically linked to the imagery of rust and resonance. The notion that lies can wilt the covenant offers an intriguing ethical dimension, even if it’s never dramatized. The final paragraphs veer toward explicit moral statement (“as long as honest hands tended the rust and truth was spoken”), which flattens ambiguity and makes the theme feel slightly didactic. The emotional aftereffect is warm but relatively tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of thresholds, surrender, and the insufficiency of explanation are well-integrated with recurring images of hinges, tectonic sighs, and rain on stone, culminating in the idea that the sought “place” is a state of being. However, the story undercuts some of its subtlety by stating its thesis directly: “She understood that the place where explanations fail was not a location but a state of quiet surrender.” That line functions as explicit thematic gloss rather than letting the images and situation carry the insight. The resonance is real and coherent, but the authorial paraphrase keeps it out of the very top thematic band.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of ongoing learning, art as bridge, and intergenerational/timewoven connection are coherently woven through recurring images (scars, knots, ropes, the child-self with a carved boat). The final recognition—turning “splinters into bridges” and carrying future alliances across time—reweights earlier motifs without collapsing into a bald moral. At times phrasing edges toward prompt-speak abstraction (“scaffold complexity with simplicity,” “timewoven alliances”) rather than arising purely from lived particulars. Still, the aftertaste is emotionally and conceptually resonant, if more gentle than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    Thematic material around darkness/light, ending/beginning, and seasonal transition is consistent and supported by recurring images (snowmelt, amber light, night-flowers). However, the piece leans into explicit moralizing and paraphrased insight—“the dawning hush was not silence but a promise”—that tells the reader what it means. This undercuts subtext and makes the revelation feel closer to a lyrical thesis statement than an earned, ambiguous reweighting. The emotional aftereffect is gentle but somewhat sentimental and familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece articulates a coherent theme of reclamation of silenced movements and the ethics of archiving, embodied in the lagoon, the diary, and the public broadcast. The final image of the desert’s silence cracking and the zeppelin as a beacon of restored histories offers a resonant, if idealized, answer. However, the theme is often stated directly (“call to conscience,” “echo of justice”) rather than left to subtext, which flattens complexity. Moral and political stakes are largely one-directional, with little room for ambiguity or counterpressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic throughline—that memory, honestly used, can rebuild a civilization more authentically than wish-granting or comforting lies—is coherent and tightly integrated with the images (amber, lanterns, working memory). The past-as-tool-not-chain idea is conceptually strong and the final promise to tend “memory‑woven streets” offers a resonant answer to the premise. However, several sentences state the thesis outright (“His method of working memory proved…”, “comfort lies in truth”), edging into essayistic moralizing. This directness flattens ambiguity and slightly cheapens what the imagery already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, emotional history, language of the dead, and archival responsibility are woven through recurring images (wax cylinders, children’s hands in soil, fruit, foghorn silence). The conceptual loop—prophecy as pattern, archivists as both subjects and instruments of history—offers a satisfying reframing and a resonant final promise of “memory preserved.” However, the thematic core is occasionally over-articulated, especially in the “Thus, the scribe’s mission…” paragraph, which edges toward thesis statement. More implication and slightly less explanation would elevate the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of cyclical time, stewardship, and “borrowed time” as a cultivable, textural resource emerge organically from the covenant, the seed imagery, and the final act of planting. Recurring motifs (acorn cap, frost/phoenix, vortex inheritance) reweight nicely at the end when Mira understands time as thread-like and soil-weavable. However, the story occasionally lapses into near-thesis statements (“taught her that borrowed time could be felt, cultivated, and returned”), which blunts subtlety. The resonance is real, but the piece slightly over-explains what its images already convey.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of listening versus noise, calm amid chaos, and technological mediation as a path to deeper attention is coherent and organically tied to the bell’s transformation. The solstice hush, the precise threshold of the sensors, and the visitors’ silence all support this thematic throughline. However, several lines approach explicit thesis statements (“He had switched the old clamor for a measured listening…,” “favoring listening over noise”) rather than letting implication carry the full weight. The resonance is real but somewhat didactic and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme is clear and coherent: stillness as fertile, vulnerability as strength, honoring the fallen rather than the flamboyantly surviving. These emerge through particular images (traced star paths becoming stories, cracks in the floor reflecting “stars brave enough to fall”) rather than through outright moralizing, though the diction sometimes edges into abstract statement. The final image reweights prior material—especially the lantern and fallen stars—toward a quiet, earned purpose. Some phrases (“flourishing stillness,” “language of stars”) risk pseudo-profundity but are overall grounded enough by the concrete frame.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of silence, memory, interdependence, and stewardship emerge organically from bees, ghosts, and the covenant, and the ending’s amber tear and softening wasteland give a satisfying, quiet resonance. The idea of “protecting the honey of memory” is strong and concrete. At times the text edges toward explicit statement (“a pact between man, bee, and spirit”), slightly flattening subtext into explanation instead of leaving more work to image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematically, the piece coherently explores time as memory and shared story: garage-sale notes, urn ashes replaced by temporal “texture,” grains of sand as individual memories, and clocks that count decisions. These motifs are well-integrated and accrue meaning toward the final tapestry image and the villagers’ lattice of stories. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“a reminder that time, even when broken, could be mended by shared recollection”), but they stop short of sermonizing. The emotional aftereffect is gentle wonder rather than profound disturbance, which is effective but not transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.0)
    Thematically, the story is coherent and focused on honoring incompleteness and resisting “the demand for flawless endings.” The feather, ripples, and woven-dawn tapestry recur as motifs reweighted toward this idea by the end. However, the theme is frequently stated in near-essayistic terms (“true art was never a finished picture,” “a gentle rebellion against the demand for flawless endings”), undercutting subtext and inviting a sense of pseudo-profundity. More of the insight is told than earned through hard choices or irreducible ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of interspecies respect, interconnectedness, and rejecting time-based judgment emerge coherently from the copper-vein network and the final policy reversal. The closing idea—that the pillars’ “secret” is collective willingness to bind together—nicely reframes the earlier technical details in relational terms. However, the thematic statement is quite explicit and leans toward moralizing, reducing ambiguity and subtext. More dramatized friction around the decree and less direct articulation would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    Thematic through-line—homecoming as reciprocal chemical and conceptual reaction rather than a fixed place—is strong and organically tied to Arin’s mission and the amber experiment. Recurring motifs (pilgrimage, footprints, wet stone, amber light) gain meaning at the end when home is reframed as “a pattern of returning,” and the tower becomes a testament to choosing inquiry over awe. However, the theme is occasionally stated a bit too explicitly (“home was not a place but a pattern of returning,” “chemistry of homecoming was not a formula but a dialogue”), which flattens some subtext. Still, the final image carries genuine resonance beyond the literal plot.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—life reclaiming war’s scars, and living languages (birds) translating dead ones into renewal—is well integrated with the action and imagery. The recurring reef/jetty/garden and language motifs organically support ideas of concord and transformation. Some lines veer close to explicit moralizing (“promising that even a battlefield could become a field of flowers”), which softens complexity and edges toward sentimentality. Still, the final images and the “bridge between languages lost and futures born” resonate convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of memory, post-war grief, and “translating distance into closeness” are well integrated through recurring objects (cylinder, leaf, rusted towers) rather than tacked-on commentary. The final act—Rook accepting the role of carrier of voices—offers a non-literal, resonant answer to the piece’s central question about how the dead can still be felt. At times, phrasing edges toward explicit thesis (“stitching the broken world with threads of remembered scent”) but remains within tolerable lyricism. The ambiguity of whether this task is solace or burden adds useful complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of grief transformed into navigation, internalized “true north,” and honoring ancestry through ritual are coherent and organically tied to the compass and sky-sketching motif. The final moves—“not because I sought to escape the past, but because I had learned…”—tip into explicit thesis, edging toward didactic rather than leaving the images to carry the weight. Subtext (pariah as chosen pilgrim, time as canvas) is present but often paraphrased. The piece invites some reflection yet resolves its questions a bit too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    Ideas about amending old wrongs, bridging past and future, and embracing wonder are organically seeded via the sundial, chess pieces, and the curse’s thawing. However, the thematic articulation grows increasingly explicit (“he understood that his role was not merely theft or chivalry, but a bridge…,” “Each listener felt the secret of the spire settle within them”), sliding toward moral summary. The resonance is real but somewhat over-explained, sacrificing ambiguity and subtext that would better suit a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.7)
    Memory vs oblivion, the dignity of “pawns,” and the ethics of whose acts history records all emerge organically through the chessboard, the scroll, and Mira’s vocation. The imagery of luminous absence and traveling shadows supports a thoughtful meditation on overlooked bravery. However, some lines (“she had become the historian of small gestures”) edge toward explicit thesis, reducing ambiguity. The ending still leaves a resonant, if somewhat tidy, sense of quiet moral purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme that “home is not a fixed point but a resonance” emerges organically through the stone’s map-of-feeling symbols, sensory callbacks (pine, rain, lullaby), and the final alignment of Lira and the mountain. The recurring motifs of buried talents and seeding stories reinforce an idea of interior potential reclaimed through painful memory. Some lines nudge toward explicit statement—“home was not a fixed point but a resonance” reads almost thesis-like at this venue’s standard. Even so, the final image of shared breathing and echoing “hidden thunder” offers genuine, if gentle, lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of guilt, self-forgiveness, and the impossibility of undoing past moves are woven nicely through recurring images (pawn, queen, labyrinth, woven hush). The chess-war mistake and the winnowing of regret create a coherent metaphor for reconfiguring one’s life “board.” However, the text undercuts its own subtlety with explicit thesis statements—“He knew forgiveness was not a single move but a series of openings…” and repeated declarations that he has forgiven himself—which veer toward moral summary. The thematic arc is clear and resonant, but a touch didactic for the highest literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of forgiveness, shared memory, and refracted truth are coherent and carried through specific motifs (echoes, the spire, the mural, the chorus), and the final line “We are the echo” reweights prior images effectively. However, the piece frequently states its themes outright (“forgiveness had a price,” “acceptance of loss,” “not in gold but in shared memory and humility”), edging into didactic moralizing. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere but somewhat tidy; ambiguity or resistance would deepen resonance. Still, the thematic architecture is solid and integrated with the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of brokenness, repair, and kintsugi are coherently woven through repeated images (cracks, seams, tapestries, quilting memories), and the final image of a stitched-together world resonates. Yet the story often states its thematic thesis outright—“the philosophy that brokenness could become beautiful,” “each crack holds the promise of a golden line”—rather than letting it emerge from action and image alone. This direct moralizing, especially near the end, flattens ambiguity and subtext. The emotional aftereffect is warm but a bit didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—art as a vessel for holding time, the paradox of “temporary eternity,” and the cost/solace of a private vow—is coherent and well-integrated with the seashell and mirror motifs. The patterned return of promises, reflections, and shells that “glowed like lanterns” builds a clear resonance by the ending. However, the thematic language sometimes becomes explicitly expository (“a gentle reminder that moments can stretch beyond their ordinary span”), edging toward stated thesis rather than purely emergent insight. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t fully embrace ambiguity or tension around the vow’s potential downsides.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    Thematic material about whispers vs. shouts, softened intent, and tenderness as power is coherent and woven through scent, vibration, and light motifs. However, the story frequently states its thesis outright (“proof that whispers truly travel farther than shouts”), edging into moralizing rather than letting scenes and images fully carry the idea. Complexity is limited: we see little tension or potential downside to this worldview on the page. The final cadence has emotional gentleness but stops short of a layered, unsettling aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of grief, return, and “mapping the geography of loss” are woven through recurring motifs (reverse migration, censer, coordinates, moon phases) and pay off in the sanctuary image and the ships turning back. However, the piece occasionally states its thesis too baldly (“She understood that reverse migration was not a folly of longing but a necessity…”), edging toward essayistic clarity instead of trusting subtext. Still, the final paragraphs reweight earlier images in a resonant way, especially the bridge “from loss to hope, stone by stone, moon by moon.” The emotional aftereffect is genuine and specific, if a bit overtly framed.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of empathy after collective trauma, the dangers of weaponized truth, and “psychological safety” as shared vulnerability emerge organically from the object, setting, and Mara’s goal. The glass eye as communal mirror is a strong, specific thematic image that reweights earlier talk of guarded feelings. However, the piece leans into explicit thesis statements—especially in the final sentence about psychological safety and the courage to reflect pain—which edges toward moralizing and flattens ambiguity. A bit more reliance on image over articulation would deepen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, witness, and the desire not to vanish into oblivion emerge organically from recurring images—the pressed flower, the opal dock, the tide’s “gaps,” and the lighthouse lamp. The idea of “borrowed memories” and isolation as a “canvas” recasts loneliness from lack into responsibility, and this is embodied rather than sermonized. A few late lines edge toward explicit statement (“a promise that no one... will ever be lost to oblivion”), slightly flattening the ambiguity. Still, the final image of the imprint and the beam offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s core question about being seen and remembered.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of promise, choice, and the nature of maps are coherent and supported by recurring images (glimmer, ants, doors, maps), culminating in the realization that “the true map was not on paper but in the act of choosing itself.” However, the text leans into explicit thematic statement and paraphrase (“the lingering promise was not a burden but a compass”) instead of trusting subtext and image. The ending offers resonance but borders on didactic, reducing ambiguity. Still, the conceptual integration of vocation, promise, and decision-making is thoughtfully aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of burdened rule, the reinterpretation of “curse” as guide, and integration of the subconscious (“dream as map”) emerge organically from the images and the queen’s arc. Recurring motifs—bleeding starlight, ember, ascent, exhale—do reweight at the end when she binds the starlight to the realm and the grotto is spent. However, the conclusion leans toward tidy reassurance (“newfound peace,” kingdom’s sigh of relief) and underplays lingering ambiguity or cost. The piece gestures toward deeper questions about power and sacrifice without fully complicating them.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of revaluing alchemy away from profit toward presence, friendship, and guidance are coherent and supported by recurring images of light and shared resolve. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit statements—“It was a visible proof…,” “the true alchemy lies…”—that slide into moralizing rather than letting images and choices carry the insight. Complexity is limited; there’s little sense of counter-pressure, skepticism on the page, or moral ambiguity to complicate the idea of “light where others see only ash.” The resonance is pleasant but feels asserted more than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Time as “a cruel editor,” jealousy of past selves, and “feral nostalgia” together build a coherent thematic arc about art, memory, and mortality. The recurring images (grave, fox of mist, scroll/winged messenger) genuinely reweight each other by the end as the grave becomes a marker for unwritten stories. However, the piece at times states its themes in essayistic abstractions (“my motivation remains clear: to distill chaos into narrative”), slightly dulling subtext in favor of commentary. Despite that, the final stance—choosing to keep soaring with full awareness of loss—lands with honest, lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of “ordinary miracles,” alternative modes of sensing, and the sanctity of overlooked objects emerge organically from the setting and Lena’s vocation. Recurring images—the clamp as a conduit for birth, threads as pathways, water level rising, fog lifting—build a coherent meditation on how we perceive and reanimate the past. However, the text leans into explicit statement (“She understood that to unveil ordinary miracles…”; “She realized that even without scent…”) which tips toward moralizing and reduces subtext. The result is resonant but a bit didactic, where the images alone might have carried more conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The thematic through-line of transforming pain into story is clear and emerges largely from images: scars as failed runes, crystal shards as condensed stress, final runes of purpose. The grandmother’s chant, youthful superstition, and tea ceremony give the theme cultural and personal roots rather than abstract sermonizing. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“to transform scars into stories that could heal the rifts of her people”), but the ending image of glowing scars and floating runes does the heavy lifting. The complexity is moderate but genuinely resonant for the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of atonement, the ethics of gossip, and “imperfect miracles” are woven through recurring images: broken chords, broken mirrors, cracked saints, and the orchard’s fall. The final sense that apologies can linger “beyond the silence” and that relics can conduct grace gives a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s moral question. At times the text edges toward explicit statement (“The apology was imperfect, a miracle not wholly healed”), slightly reducing subtlety. Still, most of the thematic heft arises from concrete ritual actions and images rather than overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of illusion vs. truth, unity vs. fragmentation, and “end of history” as doorway rather than finality are coherent and supported by recurring images (spirals, mirrors, constellations, the dictionary). However, the piece often states its ideas directly (“The purpose of her pilgrimage was to unravel cosmic illusions”), reducing subtextual richness. The final reconfiguration—silence as a choir of possibilities, end as threshold—has resonance but edges toward declared philosophy. It invites some reflection but would gain from more thematic implication via concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of time as lived intervals rather than abstract units is clearly woven through recurring images (breath, heartbeats, tide, gears) and culminates in his realization that “clocks measured not time but the intervals between breaths of the world.” This insight grows organically from the ritual and environment rather than feeling imposed, though it edges toward explicit statement. Machine–nature harmony and observer-dependent reality (the horizon as paradox) add nuance. The resonance is genuine but not yet surprising or morally complex enough for the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of permeability, connection among “familiar strangers,” and “letting go” recur coherently through barriers, light, and network imagery. However, they are often stated outright—“Letting go - was not surrender but the precise release of tension”—which flattens subtext into thesis. The ending leans into moralizing (“the act of letting go - of fear, of doubt - was the true catalyst”) instead of trusting image and situation. There is resonance, but it feels explained rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of “lucid contradictions” is woven consistently through gambler vs. professor, library vs. subway, certainty vs. chance, and culminates in the new theorem that unites them. Symbolic elements (mica pane, underground map, ledger) reinforce the idea that hidden, marginal knowledge is as vital as canonical text. However, the piece repeatedly names its core concept (“lucid contradictions,” “theoretically rebellious”) rather than fully embedding it in subtext, edging toward thesis statement. The ending earns some resonance but leans slightly didactic rather than letting images alone carry the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of endings/beginnings, loops, and connection through misdirection are strongly integrated via recurring images (the disc’s loop, wrong numbers, subterranean vs. surface life) and culminate in a resonant reconfiguration of “cultivated estrangement.” The notion that endings can be re-scored into beginnings lands clearly through the Lena episode and the accumulating chorus. However, the piece leans into explicit thematic statement (“meant to bridge the isolation,” “core concept of cultivated estrangement dissolved”) that edges toward essayistic explanation instead of trusting image and implication. This slightly flattens what could be a more hauntingly ambiguous resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—small moments as sacred covenants between past and present, and the fragile labor of remembrance—is consistent and emergent from particulars like the locket, lighthouse pact, and tidal erasure. The final stance (“as long as he could steep each memory in ink, the covenant would never fade”) resonates as a quiet, non-literal answer to the opening premise. However, repeated abstract phrases (“regenerated covenant,” “proximate causes”) edge toward self-conscious thesis language rather than pure scene-driven implication. The piece is tonally honest and moving, but a bit overarticulated at times.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of reciprocity, rumor as connective tissue, and loneliness as a systemic rather than individual condition are coherent and threaded through specific images (the chime traveling rumor chains, the lantern sent onward). The idea that the cure is catalyzing connection rather than a literal potion is conceptually strong, but the story states it directly (“the cure for loneliness was not a potion…”) rather than letting the images carry the realization. Subtext exists in the contrast between a neglected station and revived community, yet complexity is somewhat flattened by the tidy, optimistic resolution. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and pleasant rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic core—empathy, inner cartography, and non-visual ways of “seeing”—is coherent and integrated with the premise. However, the story often states its themes explicitly (“She understood that navigating uncharted emotional depths required more than sight; it demanded…”), reducing subtext and ambiguity. The final understanding of love/loss/hope is moving but framed in generalized, near-platitudinous language. As a result, resonance is pleasant but not as haunting or complex as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of fallibility, revision without erasure, and the value of “listening” to the universe accrue coherently through the seed/orchard and garden-of-data metaphors and the final readiness to plant new seeds. The closing insight—that editing history is “less about control and more about listening”—aligns with prior images but is stated almost as a thesis, edging into mild moralizing. Subtext exists in the interplay of gravity, doubt, and comfort, yet remains largely explicit rather than enigmatic or double-edged. The result is thoughtful but somewhat tidy, without the lingering ambiguity often required at top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and creating beauty from absence are clearly woven through the camera, the harbor, and the “forgotten souls” that the music soothes. The recurrence of “mapping silence” and the final recognition that the music is a “living thread” do reweight earlier imagery with a sense of ongoing, communal authorship. However, some lines verge on explicit thesis-statement (“a reminder that even forgotten souls can craft beauty from void”), flattening ambiguity. The piece invites reflection but tends toward gentle affirmation rather than layered moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of memory, responsibility to lost stories, and the duality of fire (destruction vs illumination) are woven cleanly through repeated images: the phoenix, lava-like murals, ash-dancing dust, and the idea of stories traded like fire. His redemption arc concretizes the thematic question of how a past harm-doer can repurpose the same tools for protection. The ending lets image and situation carry the thematic weight (“heat of compassion,” the mural glowing amber, the promise living in the walls) without overt moralizing. A few phrases (“to protect the stories… even if the world forgets them”) brush the edge of stated theme but stay within acceptable subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of shared sorrow transmuted into hope, ethical transformation in science, and the power of quiet resistance resonate through the recurring images of auroras, drums, and entangled memories. However, the text often states its insights directly—e.g., “a reminder that sorrow can birth light,” “the protocol shifted from cold observation to compassionate collaboration”—rather than trusting implication. This explicitness flattens ambiguity and nudges the piece toward moral fable instead of complex exploration. The final cadence is affecting, but a more oblique approach to its message would better suit top-tier literary expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of quiet influence, hidden networks of communication, and the value of listening are well-integrated with the setting and recurring objects. However, the parchment line “Whispers are the true currents of this city” and the reiterated closing contrast with shouts state the thesis almost verbatim, leaving little room for subtext or ambiguity. The piece doesn’t really complicate the idea or show a meaningful counter-pressure to Milo’s belief. Resonance is pleasant but more illustrative than searching.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of “silent empathy” and teaching darkness the value of stars is clear and consistently threaded through images of mirrors, shutters, and reflected light. However, the piece edges toward explicit statement and repetition (“to teach darkness the value of stars,” “the night’s quiet triumph”) rather than letting implication do the work. The insight—that quiet guidance can awaken latent light—is gentle but not especially complex. The final image has some resonance but doesn’t deeply reweight what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of quiet resistance, collective reflection, and “forests of second thoughts” are coherent and well-threaded through chess, saplings, and synchronized windows. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit thematic phrasing—“each seed a promise of second thoughts,” “the town’s quiet…proving that the softest movements can reshape the future”—which borders on sermonizing rather than letting images carry full weight. The final paragraphs articulate the thesis quite directly instead of trusting implication. There is resonance, but little complexity or counter-pressure to deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of detaching from violence, unlocking guarded hearts, and finding freedom by embracing one’s true nature are coherent and threaded through the scrimshaw and island motifs. However, the piece often states its ideas outright (“defend the fragile peace instead of fueling conflict,” “for she had finally found freedom in embracing her true nature”) instead of trusting image and action. The result is a mild sermonizing tone in the final paragraphs that flattens complexity and ambiguity. The thematic answer feels correct but too tidy for the mythic stakes the story raises.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    The thematic throughline—grief and lightness coexisting under enforced joy—is coherent and supported by motifs (hush, turbines, bouquet, baton). However, much of the theme is articulated directly (“not rebellion but a quiet cultivation of lightness in grief,” “a path toward quiet redemption”) rather than allowed to live in subtext and image. The ending image does reweight prior material, but it’s closely accompanied by explicit thematic gloss. The piece lingers, but the overt moralizing language somewhat flattens its potential resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of freedom, the porousness of boundaries (thought/feeling, sky/lake, sacred/profane), and art as world-rewriting act are coherently woven through recurring motifs (tremor of certainty, dissolving veils, reflections). The final images—the amber-glowing lake and verse as “frost on glass”—nicely reweight earlier material toward an aesthetically framed liberation. However, the treatment is quite direct; lines like “a promise that boundaries are meant to be explored” verge on thesis statement rather than leaving more of the work to subtext. The piece invites some reflection but doesn’t quite achieve a layered, ambiguous resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—beauty in imperfection, and the idea of perception as a series of bartered awakenings—is tightly woven through recurring images (cracks, shards, flawed glass, mismatched plants) and the final glass garden. Lines like “imperfection was the truest melody” verge on explicit statement but are supported by enough concrete, prior images that they don’t feel like unearned sermonizing. The ending reweights earlier material by making her flawed sight a unique, irreplaceable way of seeing. Some thematic notes are repeated a bit too directly, modestly reducing subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of connection, empathy, and the blurring of sensory boundaries (sound/light, artificial/human pilgrimage) are woven through recurring images and actions, not just stated once. The final echo—“even in void there is texture”—and the hand-across-a-void imagery offer a resonant answer to the opening “What if sound can be seen?” by showing that engineered perception can yield genuine feeling. However, the piece occasionally lapses into direct thematic statement (“propelled humanity toward deeper empathy”), dulling some of the subtextual power. The complexity is moderate: suggestive and poetic, but with a slight tendency toward tidy, aspirational conclusions.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—intention as a way to reconfigure grief into generative light—emerges organically from cranes, coordinates, the stencil, and the revived rose. The “curtains of intention” and “genuinely artificial” motifs give a thoughtful angle on how constructed rituals can still seed real change. Occasionally the text edges into explicit thesis statements (“her mourning was not a final curtain but a thin veil she could lift”), which slightly undercuts subtext. Nonetheless, the closing image of new coordinates toward an unseen sunrise offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of inherited responsibility, collective belief, and rebuilding meaning from economic collapse are coherent and organically linked to the tools (tape, ledgers, tunnels, meme-coins). The idea of reverse-engineering markets into “a blueprint of hope” is conceptually strong, and the ending reweights the inherited mystery from burden to guiding principle. However, theme is sometimes over-articulated—“blueprint of hope,” “maps would become the new lexicon,” “purpose”—rather than left fully to image and implication. This slight moralizing edge and lack of counterpressure keep it from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of nostalgia, fragmentation, and purification through embracing unpredictability emerge coherently from the ritual and the transformation. The recurrent images (atoms of nostalgia, veils, broken rhythms) support a conceptual argument about not erasing the past but reweaving it. However, the text undercuts its own subtlety by directly stating its thesis near the end (“true purification comes not from erasing the past…”), veering into explicit moralizing. The resonance is real but a bit didactic rather than fully earned through implication.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, loss, and converting regret into transmissible hope are well-seeded—from the archive of decades-old footage to the stone as a vessel for “the shape of hope.” The final moves (his recording of his own ritual; regret melting into gratitude) offer a resonant answer: legacy is a deliberate, almost liturgical act. However, some thematic commentary is spelled out (“He understood that metamorphose was not merely a change of form but a rebirth of meaning”), edging toward explanation over subtext. The piece still invites reflection beyond the page, but with a bit of overt philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of balance, trust, and shedding deception are coherently woven through objects (discarded shells, broken glass, feathers) and the chameleon’s changing colors. The idea that balance is a dynamic process emerges organically from the reconstruction ritual. However, the closing sentence explicitly states the theme—“balance is not a static point but a river…”—tipping into mild moralizing and undercutting some of the piece’s earned subtlety. Subtext is present but occasionally flattened into direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme is strong and cohesive: scars as stories, time as wound, miracles as “displaced” rather than absent, all braided through recurring objects and images. The revaluation of wounds—“wounds can hold hope” and time as a wound to be read—emerges organically from the ritual and visions, though a couple of lines come close to overt thesis-stating. Subtext largely rides in imagery (meteor hush, moss, roots, coffee rings), with the final understanding reweighting prior particulars. The piece resists simple moralizing but edges toward explicitness in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of unrealized affection, unsent communication, and the possibility of transforming stored sorrow into light are woven deeply into objects and actions (film frames, letters, map-ink, river of memory). The ending’s conceptual shift—that the answer lies not in a single goodbye but in gathering and incubating them—reweights the entire piece without spelling out a moral. Recurring images (thunder/hush, light, constellations) support a lingering resonance about how love and farewell coexist. At times the symbolism trends dense and explicit, but it avoids outright sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of rest-as-cycle, creativity as trapped/stardust, and freedom through patient ritual are coherent and threaded throughout. The recurrence of auroras, stardust, and unspoken words gives the piece a thematic backbone and a clear emotional afterglow. However, the story tips into explicit thesis—“rest was not an end but a cycle,” “the final unspoken word: freedom”—which flattens ambiguity and subtext. More of the insight is told rather than discovered through charged, specific moments of resistance or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coheres around renewal from ruin and the possibility of inner rekindling even in a “dreamless” soul, expressed through recurring images (ash to seed, sparks, archive, lullaby). The final movements—ashes turning to seed, light-trees rising—offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s question of what can follow complete loss. The piece resists overt moralizing, letting image do most of the work. Some lines drift toward generalized lyric abstraction, slightly diluting the complexity of the underlying ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of inner wilderness, perception beyond the ordinary, and “probable miracles” are coherent and integrated with the imagery. However, they’re often stated directly (“not a quest for external wonder but a reclamation of internal wilderness”) rather than allowed to emerge from scene and implication, which flattens subtext. The ending’s hopefulness has some resonance, but the lack of friction or ambiguity around this insight keeps it from feeling fully earned or complex. It reads thoughtful but a bit like polished thesis rather than hard-won wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of unused courage, indirect paths to self-knowledge, and the necessity of vigil over one’s own inner life are coherent and consistently echoed in images (seed under sand, star stamp, ridgeway). However, the piece leans into explicit statement—“She understood then that the vigil in twilight was not a watch over others, but a promise to herself”—which edges toward moralizing rather than letting images and choices fully carry the insight. The courage-as-seed and map-of-the-inner-self metaphors are serviceable but familiar, dampening the afterglow. Still, the final image of setting out again with the talisman does offer a resonant, if slightly neat, answer to the story’s question.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic through-line about the cost of safety, silence, and hope under constraint is strong and coherent. Recurring motifs (silence, discoloration, bolt, fortress skin) reappear in the ending to reweight earlier images. However, the text tends to state its insights explicitly (“They understood that to remain in safety meant to accept the unpardonable silence…”) rather than letting them emerge implicitly, which blunts subtlety. The resonance is present but leans toward didactic clarity over layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme around truth exposing deceit and structures built on lies collapsing is strongly present and coherently mirrored in the library’s “graceful collapse” and the spent pellet sealing truth into stone. Recurring images (crown, rune, ink, collapse) reappear at the end with reweighted meaning. However, the explicit statement “power taken by deceit would always crumble under the weight of truth” edges toward a spelled-out moral rather than trusting the imagery. The piece still leaves a resonant aftertaste, but with less ambiguity and depth than elite literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of ecological memory, erased routes, and the need to “listen long enough” emerge organically from the rituals, atlas fragment, and coral chemistry. Recurring images (missing paths, silence, tapping, mooring/drifting) build a resonant conceptual web. However, some sentences tilt toward essayistic statement (“Even after the fossil fuel ban reshaped economies…”) and lightly sermonize. The ending’s insight is thoughtful but leans more didactic than obliquely haunting, limiting its afterburn.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of cyclical rebirth, listening as a form of agency, and finding meaning in broken systems are coherent and supported by recurring images (hum, engines, stone circle, opera glasses). The final recognition that “meaning was not a fixed destination but a rhythm she could trace” reweights the earlier motifs effectively. Yet the story leans into explicit articulation of its thesis, verging on didactic in the closing paragraphs rather than trusting the imagery alone. Subtext exists but is often translated into direct statement, which blunts some potential resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of tradition vs evolution, human–nature solidarity, and destiny-as-invitation are clearly woven through the embryo, the telepathic plants, and the reconstruction frame. The closing reconfiguration—“implanted destiny was not a command, but an invitation for collective growth”—offers a coherent thematic answer and fits the events. That said, the theme is often stated explicitly rather than entirely emerging from subtext and image, drifting toward gentle sermonizing in the communal explanation and future-vision. The story leans sentimental, with limited space for darker or more ambiguous countercurrents.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of surviving atrocity, embodied healing, and holding hope without denial emerge organically from images like the scarred sapling, somatic cues, and the “pearl of stillness.” The recurrent contrast between sea-roar and internal calm, and between ruins (bombed wedding, dead lighthouse keeper) and new growth, gives the piece emotional resonance. However, explicit statements—“Her purpose, she realized, was to anchor optimism in realism” and “laboratory for that experiment”—veer into thesis language and dampen subtext. The ending still resonates, but the moral is somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme is strongly integrated: broken tarot, bowed shelves, fogged glass, and the “necessary darkness” all serve the idea that fragmentation and descent are prerequisites for authentic creation and healing. The line “the fragmented reality he had feared was not a curse but a canvas” crystallizes the thematic arc without entirely collapsing into moralizing. There are moments of near-thesis statement (“Was it not the purpose of every artist to plunge into the shade…”) that edge toward telling, but they’re still anchored in his lived dilemma. The final hum of the lighthouse in response to his new portrait offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece develops a coherent theme about time’s dilation in crisis as a deliberate, protective “pause” granted by the universe, with disappearing ink and vanishing histories as strong metaphoric vehicles. However, the theme is frequently articulated in direct, thesis-like statements (“the slowdown was not a flaw but a deliberate deferral”), edging into explicit moralizing rather than letting images fully carry meaning. Kael’s arc from anger to mission aligns with the thematic idea of honoring these pauses, and the closing image of patterns lingering until the next crisis does resonate. The lack of ambiguity and reliance on overt explanation keep it from higher literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of truth versus imposed silence, institutional complacency, and scandal as a catalyst for dialogue emerge clearly from recurring images (ice, dormancy, whisper vs. echo). However, the story leans into explicit moralizing and thesis-like statements—“a testament that…”; “she also understood that true change required the quiet courage of those willing to listen”—which flattens subtext. Dissent, scandal, and hope are mostly treated as unambiguous goods, leaving little moral or emotional complexity. The final paragraphs articulate the message rather than letting the images and choices alone carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of quiet strength, burden-as-bridge, and continuity-through-chaos are coherent and strongly patterned via the scrap, sandbags, and rose petals. However, the story leans into overt thematic statements (“silence can hold strength,” “burden can become a bridge”) and repeated formulations, edging toward sermonizing. Ambiguity and counter-pressure are minimal; there is no credible alternative worldview or failure on the page to complicate the hope. The resonance is gentle but somewhat platitudinous rather than freshly earned from messy particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of listening versus grasping, the ethics of “catching” something divine, and the idea that true possession equals release (“not to trap it, but to set it free in a song”) emerge organically from the images. Recurring motifs—the lullaby, patterns breaking and reassembling, transliterated emotions—reweight themselves at the end to suggest that the world is continually sung into new being through attentive hearts. The piece resists overt moralizing and lets the final realization stand in image rather than thesis. However, the thematic palette is relatively narrow, with little complication beyond a single, harmonious insight.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of truth versus complacent narratives, inherited responsibility, and epistemic rigor (proof by contradiction) are well-integrated with the rosewood nib, observatory, and “orbits of regret.” The idea that journalists must “prove that the false premise cannot hold” nicely bridges mathematical method and moral stance. That line veers close to didacticism, but is grounded enough in character and scene to avoid outright sermonizing. The ending’s image of heaven turning pages offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs of tethering cries, rewriting code with compassion, and honoring grief through lullabies generate a coherent and often moving thematic fabric. The final transformation of the lab into a sanctuary where sorrow is translated rather than erased offers genuine resonance. However, lines like “In the end, Lyra understood that to tether a cry was to honor a memory” verge on explicit thesis-stating, nudging the piece toward sentimentality. The theme is strong but slightly over-articulated instead of fully entrusted to image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of unlearning, silence as language, and finding meaning in mess are tightly woven through recurring images (sand mandalas, whispers, hush) and the final reweighting of silence as a gift. However, the story leans into explicit statement—especially “Unlearning, she realized, was not erasing knowledge but shedding the weight of assumptions that muted curiosity”—which drifts into essayistic moralizing. This undercuts the otherwise strong imagistic and emotional resonance. The ending images have grace, but the insights sometimes feel told rather than fully earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—rebuilding after catastrophe through a deliberate, steel-hard empathy—is coherent and tightly woven through recurring images (fire/ash, steel, mosaic, warm coldness). The final transformation of the plaza into a pilgrimage site and “blueprint for rebuilding not just walls, but hearts” lands as a resonant thematic answer. At times, the language edges toward overt articulation (“compassion could be engineered”) rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. Still, the piece invites reflection on how societies encode mercy into structures.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of renewal, lingering art, and hope blooming from desolation emerge organically from the images of closed businesses, orchards that appear after hours, and echoes bridging past and future. The final beats—“every closed business could bloom anew,” “proof that miracles still echo”—tip toward explicitness and sentimentality, but they’re supported by prior imagery rather than coming from nowhere. Subtext around performance as a gift that survives the performer is present, if lightly sketched. The piece favors a tidy uplift over more conflicted or ambiguous resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of doubt vs. wonder, scientific rigor as a path to awe, and “transparent yet resilient” hope are coherently woven through images of light, geometry, and willowglass. The recurring “hidden pathways” motif links neuroscience, art, and emotional clarity, and the final promise to help those “lost in mental fog” gives thematic direction. Some lines verge on explicit moralizing (“even the most skeptical heart could learn to trust a subtle current”), slightly flattening subtext into thesis. Still, the thematic spine feels organic to character and situation.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme around listening to silence, transitional objects as bridges between realms, and the ethics of “speaking for” versus amplifying is strong and organically tied to the mapping practice and the leaf. The final realization—that being the voice of the unknown is amplifying what’s already in others—is resonant, but the sentence stating it is quite direct and borders on thesis. Earlier images (glowing veins aligning with mineral filaments, the caves singing) already carry this idea subtly; the explicit articulation slightly flattens the subtext. Still, the conceptual repricing of her role at the end works.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of collective memory, shared wisdom, and careful stewardship of time are clearly present and woven through recurring images (sand, buttons, echoes). However, the story undercuts its own subtlety with explicit thesis statements like “the world could change when its keepers turned time with care” and “the shared wisdom was not a static lesson but a living conversation,” which verge on moralizing. The ending offers a resonant image (stepping onto the sand-bridge as cliffs listen), but that resonance is partially pre-explained rather than left to emerge. The complexity of the premise is flattened into a relatively neat moral about hopeful, careful futurity.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of courage, redemption, and healing are coherent and supported by recurring images (snow, thaw, light, constellations), and the final realization integrates them. However, the story often states its ideas outright—“unused courage was not a place but a state,” “fixing what's broken required both the courage… and the humility to accept aid”—which flattens subtext into thesis. The ending edges into moralizing about “the world” healing, reducing ambiguity. The emotional aftereffect is pleasant but not deeply unsettling or complex.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs of palimpsest, stitching, fog, and reflection converge convincingly on a theme: distilling complexity without erasing prior layers. The final image of the river’s surface “smooth as a finished stitch” reweights earlier details and offers a clear, resonant answer to the initial promise. However, the closing sentence that explicitly states “to distill complexity into essence was not to erase, but to honor each layer” edges toward essayistic moralizing. Thematic complexity is present but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic through-lines of kindness versus change, memory versus erasure, and timelines that “bend without breaking” are coherently woven through the lantern, bees, and oasis. However, the theme is at times over-articulated, especially lines like “kindness, when offered patiently, can bend even the hardest timeline without breaking it,” which approach explicit moralizing. The strongest moments are image-driven—the lantern becoming “its own sun,” the beehives reanimating—where theme arises implicitly. The piece invites reflection but slightly undercuts its subtlety by explaining what the images already convey.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.1)
    Thematic throughline—care as illumination, tending forgotten spaces, and transforming fear into gentled night—is coherent and supported by recurring images (light in dark corners, rhythm of oars, hush → chorus). However, the piece leans into explicit articulation (“to reflect light into dark corners was the truest form of care”), which flattens some of the subtext that the images already carry. The ending image of the harbor reflecting both lanterns and the gardener is resonant and fitting, but not surprising. Complexity is modest; the story offers a tender thesis more than an ambivalent, many-sided question.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of coexistence, memory as bridge rather than chain, and isolation transmuted into independence are clearly woven through recurring images (sundial, hum, sky-whale, sea of ink) and culminate in a resonant final tableau. However, the piece leans into explicit statement—“brittle awakenings were not failures but delicate beginnings of new consciousness,” “She whispered a vow to translate her isolation into independence”—which edges toward essayistic summarizing. Subtext is present but often immediately glossed, reducing ambiguity and reader participation in making meaning. The thematic through-line is coherent and affecting but not yet subtle or surprising enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of connection, secrecy, and the afterlives of unsent love are coherent and threaded through concrete images (threads, letters, mosaics, constellations). The notion that “every secret is a strand connecting hearts” is effective but also quite explicit, with several lines (“the keeper of secrets, she thought, was a role she could fulfill…”) tipping toward direct statement rather than letting subtext do the work. The ending offers a resonant, if gentle, answer—rejoining the world of whispered hearts as a meaningful act—but with limited ambiguity or complexity. It’s thematically clear and pleasing, but more lyrical than probing.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of subtle resistance to power plays, communal listening, and balance instead of domination are coherent and embedded in the premise. However, the piece leans heavily into explicit statement—“a reminder that power plays could be outmaneuvered,” “proof that hope…can rewrite even the stars”—which flattens subtext into moral. The ending in particular tells the reader what to think instead of trusting images and consequences. The result feels sincere but a bit sentimental and didactic for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, spatial and psychological constraint, and rebellion against forgetting are coherently developed through the compass, organ, and key imagery. The final reweighting—that the real mutiny is against the erasure of stories and self-imposed limits—tracks with the journey and charges the closing vow and dawn. Still, several thematic lines are stated outright (“not against stone, but against the forgetting of stories”; “not a weapon but a symbol”), tipping toward mild didacticism instead of fully trusting image and implication. This undercuts some potential lingering ambiguity and emotional afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of remembrance, the ethics of seeing/feeling, and “unifying opposites” (silence/sound, absence/presence) are clearly woven through objects and images like the quarry, faces-as-voids, and the ribbon. The final stone tear and Mara’s rekindled empathy provide a resonant conceptual answer about how art can make the unseen dead legible again. However, the text edges toward explicit thesis-stating (“She painted each line with the purpose to awaken dormant empathy in the stone itself”) rather than trusting subtext and scene to carry the weight. The thematic pattern is coherent but somewhat over-articulated, limiting its subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, redemption, and how artifacts anchor moral courage are woven effectively through the nail, compass, and “reversible exile” motif. The final mapping image—a red line tracing ancestral courage—nicely reweights prior material and offers a quiet, resonant answer about how stories outlast storms. At times, the piece edges toward explicit thesis (“key to a moral compass that could guide them through the coming storm”), which slightly undercuts the otherwise implicit thematic work. Still, the emotional aftertaste is coherent and earned rather than sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme centers on forgiveness, rewriting “never,” and hope as something literally imaged and carried, which is coherent with the plot and motifs. However, it is frequently stated in near-moral form (“to sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’,” “a promise of redemption”) rather than emerging purely from dramatized pressure. The repetition of terms like “amnesty,” “hope,” and “luminous disbelief” risks pseudo-profundity. Still, the final image of a glowing wet-plate as a portable, fragile hope offers genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic through-lines—loops vs. progress, railings vs. freedom, inherited violence vs. quiet structure—are woven smartly through the money, markers, and train imagery. The closing realization that “circles are not failures but the universe’s method of testing” reweights prior material and links his father’s life, the algorithm, and his new purpose. However, the insight is delivered in fairly bald, aphoristic terms rather than left to emerge wholly from image and action, edging into mild sermonizing. Subtext is present but sometimes crowded out by explicit statement in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of shared burden, reciprocity between seeker and sky, and words as healing instruments are coherent and recur through concrete images (telegram, journal, inscriptions, crystal). The final image—telegram and crystal singing a “lullaby of midnight solace”—nicely crystallizes the idea of a contract between human vulnerability and cosmic response. However, the piece leans into explicit affirmation (“healed the world with words”; “as long as words were spoken, burdens would always be shared”) that borders on sermonizing and flattens complexity. There is little friction or counter-tension to complicate the comforting thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    The piece builds a coherent thematic web around truth, memory, and “what mirrors don’t show,” with the lake’s changing reflection and the seed’s redirected hunger serving as effective images. The final images—a mirror reflecting “truths beneath” and a beacon-seed for those who protect truth—offer a clear, resonant stance. However, some thematic statements are on-the-nose (“She knows that mirrors never show what lies beneath the surface”) and edge toward authorial gloss. The complexity is moderate, leaning more toward affirmation than ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of binding dream to duty, healing scars of history, and curiosity as a path to purpose are coherent and reinforced by recurring images (scars in the hedges, the covenant, the beacon). The shift from a covenant as power to a covenant as responsibility is a solid conceptual turn, and the final image of healed hedges and an early-arriving future offers some resonance. However, the piece leans toward tidy affirmation, with lines like “purpose thrives on curiosity’s fire” approaching moral summary. There’s limited ambiguity or cost to complicate the thematic insights.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of healing, reciprocity, and the reconfiguration of destiny are woven through images of stitching, roots, bones, and amber, culminating in the insight that “bartered destinies were not merely trades, but stitches…in shared renewal.” The orchard’s transformation from entangling broken souls to “healed hopes” provides a resonant, if gentle, answer to the opening void. At times the piece nears explicit thesis-statement territory, slightly flattening subtext (“inlaying meaning everywhere” and the direct articulation of what bartering really is). Still, the thematic arc feels organic to the actions, not imposed on them.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—finding a quieter, self-defined purpose after public failure and the hollowness of conventional applause—emerges clearly from images and context. However, it’s frequently articulated in direct thesis statements (“the true stage is not lit by spotlights but by the quiet conviction…”) that undercut subtlety and subtext. Recurring motifs (echoes, dust settling, the cloth, “after the applause”) do good thematic work but are sometimes pushed toward didactic moralizing. The ending is emotionally resonant but leans toward a neat lesson rather than a complex, lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of translation as transformation, ambition guided toward compassion, and the continuity between language and physics are coherent and organically tied to Lira’s profession and the arbor/seed imagery. The recurring motifs of seeds, ladders/vines, and harmony do reweight themselves by the end. However, the final paragraphs edge close to explicit moralizing (“ambition, once haunted, could be guided toward compassion,” “every translation was a seed”), flattening some complexity. The piece invites reflection but resolves its thematic question a bit too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of migrating identity, paradox, and wonder in the mundane are tightly interwoven through recurrent motifs—tides, moon phases, the creel, and the key of memory. The librarian’s realization that he too must allow his identity to migrate offers a non-literal, resonant answer to the initial problem of stalled time. Occasionally the text edges toward explicit statement (“reminding all of change”), slightly reducing subtlety, but most thematic work is done through image and patterned action. The final image of the glowing creel and unwritten scroll effectively reweights the whole piece toward open-ended, ongoing transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of communal grief, confession, and shared hope emerge organically through the pearl’s function, the child’s confession, and the final image of the caves as a beacon. The recurrent language of “walls,” “crowns,” and “latent radiance” does good work linking world-building to emotion. However, the closing paragraphs edge toward a tidy moral—“vowed to spread the method,” “any heart that dared to hope”—that simplifies ambiguity rather than complicating it. The resonance is genuine but a bit too neatly affirmative for top-tier nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thematic threads—truth versus self-deception, forgiveness as process, mapping and re-mapping the self—are richly woven through recurring images of river, graffiti, bellows, and maps. The final acceptance that “the map I follow is drawn by my own hand” offers a resonant answer to the story’s question of how forgiveness might be approached. That said, theme is sometimes over-articulated in aphoristic form (“Forgiveness is not a destination but a river you learn to cross…”) and in explicit restatements of motive, which tips toward sermonizing rather than trusting subtext and image. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but could be sharper with fewer direct theses and more dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of unspoken words, time as a cipher, and stories awaiting readers are coherent and recur through the watch, crystal, and garden of petals. However, the story tends to state its ideas outright—“I wrote that the library itself was a cipher” and “Each petal holds a promise, a story that once spoken, will never fade”—rather than letting images carry the weight. The final garden image has some resonance, but it leans toward sentimentality instead of a complex reweighting with cost. The thematic arc feels sincere but somewhat over-declared.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars—the weighing of dream vs empire, organic vines vs iron towers, grief as “mulberry ache,” and knowledge tools (violin, coffee, archives) used to choose futures. The ending’s image of a skyward garden nourished by dissenting vines offers a resonant, non-literal answer about autonomy, compromise, and the power of fragile dreams. Some thematic material is stated rather baldly (“Her motivation was simple yet heavy: to weigh a dream against an empire”), leaning toward thesis rather than leaving more space for subtext. Still, the story invites reflection beyond its plot and avoids tidy moralizing in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of honoring fleeting light, making a covenant with the universe, and salvaging meaning from impending oblivion are woven through recurring images (aurora, static, emerald, threshold). The ending reweights earlier material by explicitly framing the act as more than technical rescue—a promise to “honor every fleeting glow.” However, the text leans into direct statement (“not merely a rescue…but a covenant”) where implication might have been stronger, edging toward gentle moralizing. Still, the piece leaves a clear emotional and conceptual aftertaste grounded in its particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.0)
    Forgiveness, rebirth, and contentment are thematically coherent and supported by recurring motifs (vines, seasons, hairpin, wine). However, the story frequently states its thesis outright—e.g., “she understood then that contentment was not a hidden treasure”—which flattens subtext into moral. The resolution offers a clear answer but very little ambiguity or tension in the thematic space. Resonance is pleasant but not haunting or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of doubt, reflection, and “protected vulnerability” are woven clearly through recurring images (mirror shard, cloak of doubt, lighthouse beam) and Mara’s profession. The final re-weighting—that law should be a “living conversation” and that truth is never a single reflection—resonates with the earlier set-up of brittle certainty. However, several lines verge on explicit thesis statements rather than letting implication carry the weight (“reminding anyone who glanced that truth is never a single reflection”). The piece succeeds thematically but could trust its images more and its abstractions less.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—about patience, delayed revelation, and the paradox of making vanishing “appear”—is coherent and consistently woven through motifs (ripples, tides, magnetism, withheld perception). The final insight that the grotto teaches “the art of appearing just as one chose to vanish” reweights prior images effectively. However, several thematic sentences are quite explicit (“She understood that to teach vanishing to appear, she must first withhold her own perception”), edging toward thesis rather than pure emergence from action and image. The resonance is strong but could be sharper with a touch less direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of stillness-as-journey, continuity with the dead, and listening to the world’s residual “pulse” emerge organically from the canyon, arrowhead, and birds. The final inward turn and image of the canyon as teacher reweight earlier material in a satisfying, contemplative way without overt moralizing. That said, the piece circles its core idea repeatedly (“pulse,” “echo,” “centuries of dust”) rather than complicating it, so the thematic field feels somewhat singular rather than richly faceted. The resonance is real but not unusually complex.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.5)
    The thematic throughline—cherishing the simple as sacred against a backdrop of automated creativity—is coherent and well tied to specific motifs (the dim but persistent glow, factories below, fireflies not measured by machines). However, the story leans into explicit statement (“He realized the sacred was not a distant relic but the simple act of letting go”) that edges into moralizing rather than trusting image and action to carry the insight. Recurring phrases sometimes feel like thesis repetition instead of deepening. The final resonance is pleasant and clear but a bit too neat and unambiguous for top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of truth, vow, perception beyond language, and light as a form of reading are coherently interwoven through recurring images (lanterns, “meteor hush,” the key’s phrase, the sigil). The idea that hidden truth, once faced, becomes a beacon for others lands cleanly in the final paragraphs without outright sermonizing. The resonance is more tender and reassuring than complex—there’s little moral or psychological cost—but the conceptual reweighting of “sound” and “reading” is strong. A bit less explicit phrasing at the end (“his hidden truth had become a beacon”) could deepen the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of purpose, alignment, entropy, and resisting cosmic inevitability are organically woven through recurring motifs—coins, static, resonance, contraction—rather than slapped on. The ending reframes purpose as frequency and positions curiosity as a form of rebellion, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the piece’s central question. At times the language comes close to stating the thesis outright (“a note in the grand symphony of contraction”), which blunts some subtlety. Still, the thematic throughline is coherent, earned, and lingers conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme is strong and coherent: naming as an act of ethical attention that turns sacrifice and fear into memory and gratitude. The “echo of sacrifice” motif evolves from abstract concept to embodied chant to the observatory’s answering song, giving the final bridge-from-grief-to-gratitude genuine resonance. While some lines approach explicit statement (“every nameless fear could be named, every silence given voice”), they arise from dramatized experience rather than sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on mourning rituals and memory without collapsing into a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of fragile devotion, humble effort, and harmony between pattern and cosmos are well woven through the bell, dripping rates, and returning fish. The final images (bell on crystal pedestal, rays as “a thousand tiny suns”) effectively reweight earlier motifs. However, the story leans into explicit statement—“even lukewarm magic can mend the universe,” “his brittle devotion…had been the key”—which edges toward moralizing rather than letting the images alone carry the insight. The result is resonant but somewhat on-the-nose for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of collective memory, the ethics of storytelling, and truth as a communal construct emerge organically from the images and the final gathering. The mirrored-water motif nicely supports the idea of reflection and reconfiguration. However, the piece undercuts its own subtlety with explicit thesis statements like “She knew the true power of expunging falsehoods lay not in destruction, but in the quiet construction of truth through stories.” The effect is resonant but somewhat didactic for top-tier literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of wonder versus control and the marriage of intellect and intuition are woven through recurring images (algorithmic starlings, scales of fire and water, the crystal’s hidden heat). However, the piece undercuts its subtlety by stating the thesis outright (“true alchemy begins where logic yields to awe”), tipping into mild moralizing. The ending offers a resonant image but resolves the theme rather neatly, with little lingering ambiguity or cost. It’s coherent and sincere, but not yet complex enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of trust under pressure, duty, and silent communication between watcher, forest, and outpost emerge organically from the buckle, the radio, and the repeated “soundless” imagery. The final “Hold fast” and the crew’s wordless gratitude effectively reweight earlier material without overt moralizing. Complexity remains modest—his choice is clearly “good” and relatively untroubled, with little moral friction or ambiguity. Still, the piece leaves a resonant emotional aftereffect grounded in concrete images rather than abstract commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thematic through-line—healing numbness through action that holds complementary opposites, and reconceiving clones as partners rather than theft—is coherent and organically tied to the blade, brain, and factions. The duplicate/original coexistence and the dojo’s new role as sanctuary offer a clear conceptual repricing of identity and ownership. Yet the piece leans heavily on explicit thesis statements (“The method was simple yet profound,” “a testament that even after ego death, one can rebuild through complementary opposites”) that verge on didactic, especially in the final third. Subtext exists in the imagery (shared pulse, rising dojo) but is often overshadowed by overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of innovation, permeability of spaces, and the power of stories to nourish the strange are coherent and supported by recurring images of flow (air, water, silence, stories). The corpse flower’s bloom as a “beacon” nicely reweights earlier material toward an idea of creative risk inviting future seekers. However, the text edges into overt statement with lines like “safeguarding space for innovation meant more than protecting walls,” which nudges from resonance toward mild moralizing. Complexity is modest: the piece affirms its thesis without much friction or counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The thematic core—grief as something to be tended and transmuted, not erased, so that sorrow and mirth can coexist—is strongly embedded in the recurring images of dust, ash, embers, and off-key lullabies. The final recognition (“the haunted tone…now it served as a backdrop rather than a prison”) offers a resonant, non-didactic answer to the piece’s central question about what to do with haunting. The leaf blower, lullabies, and tunnel all accrue symbolic weight without collapsing into blunt allegory. The main ceiling is that the insight is articulated fairly directly a couple of times, edging toward being told rather than discovered purely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of befriending uncertainty, waiting as discipline, and porous boundaries between known and unknown are consistent and supported by motifs (veil, light, archive, pendant). The final image—the guardian as curator in a garden where stories “dance on the edge of what could be seen”—reweights the premise effectively. However, the text occasionally states its thesis too baldly (“It understood that to make friends with uncertainty was to invite the unknown into its library”), edging into commentary rather than leaving it wholly to image and implication. The resonance is real but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of creative destruction, agency versus destiny, and rebirth from brokenness are woven consistently through imagery (cage, phoenix, frozen bloom) and the crozier’s arc. The final image—cold flame vivifying the realm—offers a resonant non-literal answer to the question of whether broken things can “bloom anew.” However, the theme is sometimes over-articulated in direct statements (“He realized that creative destruction was not merely breaking, but sculpting anew…”) which flatten subtext. More reliance on implication and less explicit philosophizing would deepen the after-echo.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The thematic throughline—endings as beginnings, silence as potential signal, engineered wonder—is coherent and well-seeded via the shard of hush and the “Genesis in Echo” archive label. However, the piece often states its thesis directly (“endings are merely signals awaiting reinterpretation,” “fantasies could be engineered”) rather than letting it emerge from contradiction and consequence. Subtext is relatively thin; there’s little ambiguity or counter-pressure to complicate the “practical magic” optimism. The resonance is pleasant but feels pre-resolved rather than discovered under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of intention reshaping destiny and time as bendable rather than broken emerge naturally through the hourglass and radio motifs. The final image of the empty hourglass as testament to “sound and pattern rewrote destiny” pulls the conceptual threads together. Yet several sentences slip into explicit thesis-stating (“intention can align the cosmos”), which blunts subtext and reduces complexity. Moral and emotional aftereffect are present but somewhat tidy and didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece has a coherent thematic spine about the measurability of imagination and the materiality of connection, and the sinew thread / golden bridge imagery supports that. The final reflection on every passerby carrying “their own sinew thread of possibility” neatly aligns with the architect’s quest. However, some statements edge toward explicit thesis (“he realized that the true eruption was not the burst of color or rain, but the quiet realization…”) rather than letting images carry the weight. The resonance is clear and genuine but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of depth vs. sky, tradition vs. progress, and the ethics of curiosity are coherently threaded through the anchor link and alien lattice motifs. The recurring use of the chain link, from relic to tool to symbol, gives thematic material a concrete spine. However, the story undercuts itself with explicit didactic explanation (“the link represented the balance of forces, the anchor of tradition and the chain of progress”), flattening subtext into thesis. The ending still carries resonance, but it feels more explained than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, care for the forgotten, and the quiet importance of “incidental heroism” emerge organically from the premise and are reinforced by motifs of echo, light, and preserved color. The final promise to “guard this echo and any others” offers a resonant answer to the central question of what one does when the dead still call. However, the text undercuts some of its subtlety by stating its thesis directly (“Incidental heroism is often born from moments like this,” “My duty—to protect vulnerable voices—”), tipping into mild sermonizing. The lack of on-page moral or emotional friction also keeps the thematic arc from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of memory, infrastructure, and standing with the forgotten emerge organically through the decayed facility, etched scientist names, and her final act of burial. The codex as a map of “invisible things” nicely aligns with a concern for what the world neglects to monitor. However, the resolution leans toward a tidy, almost ceremonial reassurance—that “the invisible threads of the world would never be forgotten again”—without much ambiguity or visible cost to that choice. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t quite complicate its own consolation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of failure as teacher, systems’ hidden flaws, and the dignity of miscounted lives emerge organically from the images of the shard, glitch, and ghost. The final realization that the ghost is “a mirror” gives an effective conceptual repricing of the threat. That said, the last paragraphs tilt toward explicit moral statement (“ensuring no death certificate would ever again be signed by a glitch”), which flattens some of the otherwise strong subtext. The piece still leaves a resonant emotional afterimage, but with a slightly too-neat moral frame.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—on what it means to preserve a language, and the paradox of saving texture by locking it away beyond living tongues—emerges organically from the concrete images of echoes, bone, and the cursed diamond. The final recognition that the language of texture will be “locked forever in the echo tunnel” yet might one day be heard by those who “listen to stones” offers a nuanced, non-moralizing answer to the central question of remembrance. There is rich subtext about art as a kind of burial and about the costs of archiving the untranslatable. A slight weakness is that a few lines verge on explicating the theme rather than letting image alone carry it, but overall the resonance is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of reconfiguring monstrosity, alchemizing bitterness into laughter, and “frostbitten hope” thawing are coherent and supported by recurring images (frost, humming leaves, laughter). However, the piece increasingly states its thesis outright (“the joke was that the universe itself had been waiting for someone to laugh at its own darkness”) rather than letting it emerge from scene work and image. This explicit moralizing in the latter paragraphs flattens complexity and reduces lingering ambiguity. The resonance is pleasant but a bit pat for top-tier literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—gentle, resonant rebellion and the possibility of beauty regenerating a deadened world—is woven consistently through music, heart rhythms, and organic vs mechanical imagery. The reconfiguration of the statues into life-guardians and the softened gears embodies a non-violent, transformative stance convincingly. The locust shell’s final emptiness as a beacon and the phrase “in the gap between knowing and understanding” give a solid conceptual repricing of soft power. Some lines (“a promise that even the most tarnished wonder could one day bloom fully”) edge toward stated moral rather than leaving the resonance purely in image.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of broken promises, absence, and fragile peace are coherent and supported by recurrent images (storm, voids, circuitry, mail). Yet the story often states its thesis outright (“He knew that broken promises could only heal where the voids between them were acknowledged,” “In the end, the mail he delivered was not ink but a promise…”), undercutting subtext. The final paragraph in particular shifts into explicit moralizing rather than trusting the concrete images to carry meaning. There is resonance, but complexity and ambiguity are blunted by explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of listening to silence and transforming absence into motion is coherent and woven through images of hush, fog, and song. However, it’s also stated explicitly multiple times (“interpret silence as possibility,” “true craft was not wood but the art of listening to the void”), edging into thesis rather than emergent meaning. The ending offers a resonant conceptual answer but with limited ambiguity or counter-pressure; it feels assured more than earned. Subtext exists in the circus’s forgotten laughter, but the piece often explains what its images already imply.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, the geometry of narrative, and the bridge between scientific and mythic modes are woven consistently through images (Möbius strip, hyperbolic maps, analog recollections) rather than through overt moralizing. The ending image—Mara logging the event in a ledger that itself embodies the measurable/mythic bridge—offers a resonant, concept-driven closure about where stories “live.” However, the piece mostly affirms its thesis without friction; there’s little thematic complication or counter-pressure to deepen the inquiry. Emotional aftereffect is gentle wonder more than a charged, lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central theme—that shared longing becomes a connective, enduring light rather than a solitary puzzle—is coherent and arises from the pattern of actions and images. Recurrent motifs (light, jasmine, the pearl, the sea carrying wishes) accrue meaning and are reweighted in the closing paragraphs. However, the story leans into explicit statement (“the cipher of longing was not a puzzle to be solved but a bridge…”) that edges toward thesis rather than trusting implication. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and pleasant, but the insight feels somewhat declared rather than wrestled into being.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of fear vs courage, the untying of “tangled thoughts,” and the power of intention emerge clearly from the locksmith’s act and the later travelers’ responses. The luminous filament as a “living bridge between fear and courage” is a strong thematic image. However, the final paragraphs become overtly explicatory (“They learned that… a reminder that every tangled thought can be untied”), sliding into moral summary rather than trusting implication. This explicitness flattens what could be a more ambiguous, lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.5)
    Memory, ritual, and the reconfiguration of habits are thematically coherent, supported by recurring images (rings, constellations, flood, songs) that reweight the final scenes. The line “When habits break…” recurs as overt thesis, which edges toward explicit moralizing but is at least grounded in the grandmother’s lullabies and the village’s recovery. The reclaimed orchard-as-song and the living archive of the fairy ring form a resonant, non-literal answer about how communities remember. More ambiguity or visible cost in the restoration could deepen the thematic aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—resilience, mentorship, and the transformation of exile into a chosen, reversible journey—is clear and grounded in recurring images of damaged texts, tea-leaf geometry, and gentle restoration as a kind of battle. The notion of “combative tenderness” is strong and made concrete in how she coaxes the library back to life, particularly the final assurance that the stories “will not be exiled again.” Yet the text also states its ideas overtly and repeatedly (“turning exile into a reversible pilgrimage,” explicit pentagon as “symbol of resilience”), which blunts some subtextual power. The ending resonates, but it edges close to thematic over-articulation rather than trusting image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Central themes of hope, renewal, and the endurance of wonder are clearly present and coherently echoed through recurring images (color, light, song, interwoven worlds). The orchard as a nexus of realms and the idea that sorrow can be “transmuted into wonder” give the piece conceptual unity. However, the thematic treatment is quite tidy and sentimental; there are no counter-pressures or darker notes to complicate the vision. The story tells us hope persists rather than earning that insight through difficult choices or genuine loss.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—silence as an active, crafted sanctuary that can hold grief—is integrated through images of hush, nets, masks, and starlight. The story offers a resonant answer to its implicit question of what to do with lingering sorrow: tend it patiently, give each fragment a place to rest. However, some lines verge on declarative thesis (“The secret was simple: every mask she repaired held a fragment of a soul…”), reducing subtlety. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and contemplative rather than piercingly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of empathy, remembrance, and the porous border between known/unknown are thoroughly woven through maps, rain, and stone, culminating in the idea that the tear is a portal rather than a defect. The closing assertion that the henge and chapel stand as “proof that empathy could rewrite the borders” edges toward explicit thesis, but it’s still grounded in the specific ritual we’ve witnessed. Resonance is strong for the length, though limited conflict keeps the thematic struggle from feeling fully hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of grief, transformation, and “the physics of letting go” are strongly present and coherently tied to the objects and actions (wires, transmission, snow globe, currents). Yet the piece often states its ideas directly—e.g., “the physics of letting go revealed itself as a gentle equation: tension minus attachment equals the luminous path of release”—which edges into thesis rather than emergent insight. The repetition of the phrase “physics of letting go” and explicit moralizing slightly dull what could be a more resonant, image-driven ending. The emotional aftereffect is thoughtful but somewhat over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of connection between code and feeling, and of unspoken needs craving embodiment, is well integrated with the flowers, graffiti, and storm imagery. The final transformation of the courtyard into an archive of “flowers, code, and melody” offers a resonant, if gentle, answer to the initial premise. However, lines like “a plea for connection, for touch, for belonging” verge on explicit statement rather than letting images carry the full weight. There’s emotional afterglow, but complexity is modest and largely uncontested.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of joy beneath anguish, memory, and a disciplined, non-consuming form of love recur coherently via the spire’s history, the diary, the jars of laughter, and the servant’s stance. The final image of him returning the tools and quietly recommitting to seeking hidden joy offers a gentle, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the thematic import is sometimes stated rather than fully dramatized (“a heart that loves without being consumed”), edging toward didactic clarity. The complexity of the cost of such detachment remains underexplored, limiting deeper ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of absence as a vessel of memory is clear and organically tied to clouds, rope, telescope, and gondola-as-shrine. However, it is also over-explicitly articulated in lines like “to prove that empty spaces remember” and “a quiet testament that even emptiness remembers,” which edge toward thesis-stating rather than letting images carry the weight. Recurring motifs (broken string, dust-laden starlight, comet) do shift meaning toward closure in a satisfying way. The piece invites reflection but could trust subtext more.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of limits as thresholds, art as defiance of erasure, and interior versus exterior sky emerge coherently through recurring motifs (coin, constellations, secret safe, demolition). The final image of the sky held inside a fallen building offers a strong non-literal answer to the premise, reweighting “limits” as maps rather than walls. However, the text leans on explicit thematic phrasing (“She felt that discovering limits was a gift…,” “the map to new horizons”), edging toward telling rather than letting images fully carry the insight. This slight didactic gloss flattens what could be a more haunting, ambiguous aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs of light, language, mapping, and guidance interweave nicely, especially the polyglot interpretations of light and the final acknowledgment by the starlings. The thematic suggestion—that knowledge and attention can transform isolation into guidance and shared glow—emerges organically from events rather than sermonizing. However, the piece leans toward a tidy, almost purely uplifting resolution with limited ambiguity or visible downside. That smoothness slightly blunts the lingering, complex resonance expected at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs of time, repair, reflection, frost, and light accrue into a coherent theme about mending what is broken—externally (clocks, mechanisms) and internally (memory, hope). The final image of the “rhythm of repair” pulsing in his chest and the steady clock under his arm offers a resonant, non-literal answer without explicit moralizing. Some phrasing edges toward soft abstraction (“a lullaby for the ages,” “quiet hopes”), which slightly blunts the potential sharpness of the thematic insight. Still, the piece leaves a distinct emotional aftertaste of wistful, patient repair.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Community, mutual care, and reexamining how resources are shared emerge clearly from concrete images: the watering bell as shared nourishment, the nebula as respite, strangers becoming family. The recurring bell and arches reweight meaning at the end, with “brambled hope” nicely capturing a non-naive, tangled optimism. However, the theme edges into explicit moralizing (“so that no one ever again went thirsty”) rather than letting the images fully carry the insight. Ambiguity and moral complexity are modest, keeping this strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of brokenness, time, and beauty in imperfection are woven through recurrent images—the scarred lighthouse, cracked puppet head, and Elara’s own “cracks mending.” The final realization that “beauty lay in being beautifully flawed” resonates with those particulars but edges toward explicit moral statement rather than fully trusting the images. The lullaby as patterned ticking and silence hints at a rich subtext about how we hold or soften apocalypse across lifetimes. Overall, the thematic fabric is coherent and affecting, if a bit over-articulated at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of imperfect redemption, cyclical duty, and “graceless beauty” are woven through imagery (wounds, ash, sighing orchard) and pay off in the ending’s bittersweet contrast between saved travelers and an unhealed landscape. The idea that an act can be miraculous yet feel like a wound is convincingly earned by the orchard’s continued curse and the caretaker’s emptiness. There is a small amount of explicit thematizing (“The purpose of this grim ritual is not selfish”), but it does not override the images. The final cadence, with the labyrinth as a wound and the travelers’ safety as the brighter glow, leaves a clear, resonant aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of translating separation into connection and grief into generative structures are strongly woven through recurring images (chrysalis, bridge, foam, lattice) and Mara’s choices. The final beats with the regional bridges and Lio’s chrysalis elegantly echo and reweight the opening loss. Occasionally the language edges toward explicit thesis (“relic of redemption,” “each joint a quiet tribute”), which slightly flattens what is otherwise earned resonance. The piece still leaves a concrete emotional after-effect and a coherent, organic thematic throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic core—stories beginning in quantified silence, absence transmuted into light—is coherent and threaded through motifs of empty slots, voids, and moonlit gaps. The closing insight, “the place where stories begin is not a location but a moment when absence is quantified and turned into light,” neatly crystallizes what the narrative has been enacting. However, that line edges into explicit thesis, undercutting some of the piece’s potential for lingering ambiguity or reader discovery. The resonance is real but slightly over-articulated for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of inherited guilt, transformation of pain, and the precariousness of healing are woven through concrete images (salt and fresh water, burnt cumin and citrus, brittle walls). The idea that emotional contagion can be turned from curse to conduit is dramatized rather than merely asserted, especially in the refiguring of the pavilion from storage to release. A few sentences verge on thesis (“if he could balance the taste, the bitterness would not dominate”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the final image of “brittle resilience” and seasonable memory offers a resonant, non-didactic thematic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of connection over isolation, art as communal infrastructure, and the revoicing of the marginalized (“forgotten voices of the past and the future alike”) are coherent and supported by recurring images of silos-to-bridges and interwoven languages. However, they are articulated with a certain didactic clarity (“the only way to heal the city’s scars was…”) that edges into thesis-stating rather than subtext. Little counter-pressure or thematic ambiguity appears—no sense of what might be lost, or who resists this healing—so the resonance is somewhat tidy. The final image of humming bridges and a unified city does reweight the prior motifs, giving a satisfying if safe closure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, abandonment, and the ethical stance of not just cataloging but reviving forgotten dreams are strongly woven through recurring images (caravans, unsung songs, unfinished works, the humming shards). The canyon as living archive and Aria as self-appointed “archeologist of abandoned dreams” create a coherent conceptual frame. However, some thematic material is articulated rather than fully implied—“She realized that…she must not only record them, but revive them” spells out the insight a bit too directly for top-tier literary subtlety. The ending does leave a resonant afterimage, but the complexity remains moderate rather than deeply ambivalent or challenging.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of vigilance, stewardship of knowledge, and the ethics of rewriting reality are coherent and supported by recurring images (seeds, light, inversion, prisms). The final lamps-as-seeds-of-vigilance image offers a satisfying resonance between inner watchfulness and institutional responsibility. However, lines like “She understood that vigilance, like seeds, must be tended” edge into explicit moralizing, spelling out what the images already show. The thematic arc is solid but somewhat overarticulated, limiting its ambiguity and afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematic throughlines—empathy in motion, cracks as sources of music, silence as a canvas—are strongly woven into the imagery and structure. However, the story tends toward explicit statement (“empathy in motion was not a hollow ideal,” “taught that even the deepest silence can be a canvas”), which flattens some subtext and edges into gentle moralizing. The best moments let theme arise from particulars, such as the porcelain insulator’s transformation from a muting device to an empathetic resonator. The final archive-of-cracks image carries real resonance despite the on-the-nose phrasing around it.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of finding beauty in difficulty, exile as reframed vocation, and covenant-as-conversation are coherent and threaded via chess imagery, the stone, and the eclipse. Yet the piece inclines toward explicit statement—lines like “sorrow can be a compass” and the spelled-out phrase “What is hidden shines when darkness yields” verge on thesis. The final paragraphs articulate the meaning quite directly rather than letting image and action carry more of the weight. The resonance is pleasant but a bit didactic for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematic intent around empathy, listening, and “cataloged silences” is clear and genuinely integrated—naming silences to reveal invisible ink is a strong metaphor. However, the story edges into explicit statement (“He understood then that the path to empathy was not a road paved with grand gestures…”) that borders on sermonizing rather than trusting the images. Complexity is limited: there’s little friction, ambiguity, or counter-pressure to complicate empathy as an uncomplicated good. The final vow and opened workshop resonate, but in a fairly tidy, didactic way.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of serenity, humility, and interconnectedness are clear and consistently echoed through motifs (the seed, scent shifts, doodling custom, “undercurrent of wisdom”). Yet the execution leans heavily on explicit statements such as “serenity can be cultivated within motion,” edging into moralizing summary rather than letting scene and image carry the insight. There is little counter-pressure or ambiguity; the piece reassures rather than complicates. The final paragraphs feel like a thesis restatement more than a non-literal, reweighting image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of resilience, symbiosis with environment, and cultural memory (“ancient practice of listening to the gathering of echoes”) emerge clearly and coherently from the events. The final realization that resilience lies not only in the artifact but in listening practice offers a mild conceptual reweighting. However, the thematic statement is somewhat on-the-nose and tidy, and the story shies away from any harder ambiguity or cost. The emotional aftereffect is gentle wonder rather than a deeply resonant moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of foresight, guidance through unseen currents, and the interplay of machinery and weather recur through the patch, compass rose, and wind-mapping. The final image of the patch “pointing toward a new horizon” and the town’s measured next breath offers a gentle thematic cadence. However, some thematic language is a bit declarative (“foresight could be cultivated even in silence”) and the arc doesn’t quite confront a deeply fraught question. The resonance is pleasant and coherent but not especially layered or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—art as an act that inscribes wonder into silence and stone—is clear and coherently threaded via recurrent images of hush, aurora, and echo. However, it’s often told explicitly (“her purpose was to certify wonder as essential”) rather than emerging solely through implication, which flattens some potential nuance. The ending’s notion of a continuum of travelers and songs offers genuine resonance and conceptual repricing of the cavern as a “living archive of wonder.” The lack of conflict keeps the philosophical insight more meditative than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.5)
    The core theme—that true guardianship embraces quiet failure and multiple paths—is coherent and threaded through motifs of hush, echoes, and weaving worlds. However, key thematic beats are stated in thesis-like lines (“true guardianship is woven from quiet failures,” “the old keepers had clung to one path”), edging into moral summary rather than emerging purely from scene. The final image carries some resonance, but the emotional aftermath feels more serene and programmatic than layered or ambivalent. There is room for more complexity in how failure costs her personally, rather than functioning chiefly as a generalized insight.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme is robust and coherent: emotion as a mutable, transposed function, empathy as something that can be encoded, borrowed, and redistributed. Recurring images—the halo fragment, ink, vanishing stars, topaz dust—reprise meaningfully at the end, reweighting the experiment as an ongoing, costly dissolution of self/other boundaries. However, several thematic statements are delivered in explicit, essay-like language (“She realized that to truly understand...”), which slightly blunts the subtextual power earned by the imagery. The piece still invites reflection beyond its surface, but leans a bit too hard on direct articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central theme—small, wonder-filled encounters stretching into legend—is consistent and clearly built through the pendant, mentor’s lesson, and ridgeway becoming a pilgrimage site. However, the story often states its ideas directly (“the world thrives when brief encounters are stretched,” “proof that wonder can be coaxed from even the most routine of paths”), edging into didacticism. There’s little counter-pressure or ambiguity; no one resists wonder or pays a price for it. The resonance is pleasant and coherent but lacks the complexity and subtlety expected at a top literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of stored sorrow, the ethics of releasing emotion from objects, and “truthful lies” as a mode of revelation emerge organically from the ritual and imagery. The shift from a purely empirical quest to a burdened stewardship of emotional history is a strong thematic turn. That said, the story edges toward overt statement in lines like “the truth of her hypothesis crystallized” and “the world could no longer pretend that feelings were safely locked away,” which slightly flatten what the scenes already imply. The complexity is there, but a touch more trust in subtext over explicit thesis would strengthen it.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of sacrifice, connection across distance, and weaving absence into meaning are coherently developed through motifs of loom, thread, silence, and amber light. The final recognition that “sacrifice…would always be the loom of tomorrow” ties the images together, but edges into explicit thesis-stating rather than letting the images alone carry the insight. There is genuine resonance, yet the piece leans a bit on declared wisdom instead of purely emergent meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of "bartered awakenings" and resilience-from-rubble is well integrated: the memory sacrifice, the transformation of rubble into crystal vines, and the villagers’ stirred "azure defiance" all echo this idea. Recurring motifs (rubble, awakenings, azure, hums) accrue meaning and reweight the final image without needing overt moralizing, though the speech explaining "giving up a fragment of fear to gain a slice of future strength" edges toward thesis-statement territory. Complexity is somewhat limited—there’s little sense of what resilience might cost beyond one discrete memory, and no counter-example or failure to deepen the idea. The ending does offer a resonant, non-literal answer, but it’s more uplifting than interrogative.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    Truth versus concealment, and the idea of “weaving between worlds” as an ethical obligation, emerge organically from plot and imagery. The final paragraphs reweight the premise toward communal knowledge and responsibility, giving the ending genuine resonance. Yet the language edges toward thesis-statement (“weaving between worlds was not a task but a promise”) rather than letting implication carry the full load. Thematic through-line is strong but a bit over-articulated and less morally tangled than the set-up allows.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of safety, memory, anonymous care, and emotional infrastructure (a “lighthouse for hearts”) emerge organically from the ritual and the stone/letter metaphor. Recurring images—sea glass, stones, light/dark—are reweighted at the end when the haunted room becomes a sanctuary powered by collective memory. However, some lines tip into explicit statement (“a simple promise that safety could be bottled and shared,” “a lighthouse for hearts as much as for ships”), nudging toward mild moralizing rather than trusting subtext. The resonance is real but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of ending and rebirth, using “ancient shadows” to forge a hopeful dawn, and a bittersweet transition from an old world to a new one are coherently threaded through the imagery and climax. The last-print-newspaper motif and the “Shadowed elation” mood effectively suggest a mournful joy at necessary change. However, the text occasionally edges toward explicit statement (“In that moment, Mira understood the prophecy: the world would not end, but would be reborn in shadowed brilliance”), making some resonance feel interpreted rather than fully earned through scene alone. The thematic complexity is appealing but not yet at a startling or multi-layered depth.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    Thematic threads—beauty as warning (“iridescent caution”), certain people attracting stories, and the responsibility of witness—are coherent and recur across wing, donor heart, and loom. The scroll’s line that “stories cling to people who carry iridescent caution” states the thesis quite directly, undercutting some subtextual power. Still, the ending image of Lira as a conduit/guardian reweights prior images and leaves an emotional afterglow of responsibility and wonder. Complexity is present but somewhat tidied into a neat answer rather than fully contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of mundane miracles, the measurability of sorrow, and the quiet witness of trees emerge organically from motifs like the sextant, grid, and oak. The transformation of quantified grief into “measurable peace” is a strong conceptual rephrasing. However, the ending leans into explicit statement and sentimentality (“as if the world itself approved,” “a quiet testament to the power of mundane miracles”), reducing ambiguity and subtext. The thematic answer is graceful but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of communal healing, memory as seed, and light/music knitting a fractured world together are coherent and supported by recurring images. Yet they are also heavily spelled out—“the true alchemy was not in transmuting metal, but in weaving together the hearts of all who listened” reads as an explicit thesis. Subtext and ambiguity are limited; most symbolic elements arrive already decoded for the reader. The ending is emotionally warm but edges into didactic rather than resonant complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of paradox, mistakes as teachers, sanctuary vs. engagement, and hidden knowledge are coherent and sustained through recurring images (library in plain sight, staying/ leaving, nested riddles). The final realization that he can carry grief outward without abandoning safety offers a resonant answer to the initial tension. That said, key thematic lines are stated a bit on-the-nose (“every mistake held a lesson, and that to hide it was to deny the very heart that sought love”), reducing subtext and making the piece feel a touch sermon-like. Complexity is present but somewhat smoothed into a clean moral takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of sacredness in the mundane, memory, and “tenuous absolution” are consistently woven through bread, ruins, vines, and the empty chair. The final invitation to “any who wander after the birds fly south” effectively reweights prior details into a quiet, communal offering without explicit moralizing. However, some repeated phrases (“tenuous absolution,” “heuristically gentle,” “uncloak”) begin to feel like declared thesis points rather than fully dramatized insights. The resonance is genuine but a shade too self-conscious for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, archival labor, and resistance to oblivion are woven through concrete images—the hum of frozen books, luminous vows as filaments stitching time, the ledger humming at the end. However, they’re also articulated quite directly (“her motivation—to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion—was not mere duty,” and especially the explicit thesis “that memory, measured gently, could outlast oblivion”), which flattens some subtext. The final vow image is strong, but the spelled-out moral edges toward sentimentality and reduces ambiguity. Resonance is solid but not subtle enough for higher-band literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    Trust, time, and cyclical conflict form a coherent thematic web, embodied by the “truce of hush,” the watch fob, and the repeated sense of uneasy peace. The moment where she listens for “the sound of trust breaking” and the dawn extinguishing of the lanterns are strong thematic images. Yet the narrative leans into explicit thesis statements (“Her motivation was to capture the sound of trust breaking,” “may the sound of trust never shatter again”) that feel a touch didactic for a high-literary venue. The ending leaves a resonant uncertainty rather than a neat moral, which helps its aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of attunement to emergent systems, the interweaving of technology and ancient rites, and humans as conduits of planetary mood arise organically from the particulars. Recurring motifs—the compass, taste, forest ballots, weather-carrier cloaks—subtly reweight meaning by the end, culminating in Arin recognizing his own “personal weather.” The closing sense that “any luminous skeptic daring enough to taste the world would forever find direction” skirts explicit moralizing but mostly reads as earned synthesis of prior images. The ambiguity about how much is science vs. ritual remains productively open rather than fuzzy.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of suppressed creativity, inescapable calling, and the transformation of sorrow into generative force are consistently woven through the lock, the luminous ink, and the cave’s “auroral sorrow.” The final image—Lena leaving with renewed creativity while the painting glows as a portal—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about honoring one’s calling and returning to the source. A few lines (“a testament to resolved callings,” “taught her to rectify her own silence”) flirt with stating the theme a bit too directly. Still, the bulk of the thematic work is carried by image and action rather than explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of “candor in small moments” reviving a damaged society is woven tightly through the zinc plate’s reactions, the lost conversations, and the clean-air vent, generating real conceptual resonance. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis directly (“She believed that candor in small moments could stitch the torn fabric…,” “She understood now that candor in small moments could restore whole worlds”), tipping into overt moralizing. This dulls subtext and reduces room for reader inference. The images themselves are strong enough that less explicit explanation would raise the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of wonder, silence as language, and art as preservation are clear and recurrent, with strong image-based support in the iceberg, copper arm, and listening bluff. The final promise that “symphonies of truth will never be silenced” offers a resonant but somewhat on-the-nose articulation of the piece’s thesis. Subtext exists—in the neighbors’ silent communion and the gulls’ quiet, for instance—but the repeated abstract phrases (“color of wonder,” “symphonies of truth”) verge on mantra rather than fresh re-weighting. Still, the emotional aftereffect is coherent and earned from the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of transforming fear into hope, harmonizing machine and organic life, and balancing fire with peace are well-integrated through the box, roses, and Vira’s arc. The reweighting of the box—from repository of fear to seed of calm—nicely embodies the central idea. However, the final third leans into explicit statement (“a testament that even the strangest organic chaos can be contained, miniaturized, and transformed into hope”), edging toward moralizing rather than trusting images. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and reflective but somewhat too neatly resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.5)
    The core theme—listening heals and connects a community—is coherent and supported by recurring images of letters, whispers, and stories. However, it is often stated directly (“Her motivation, to prove that listening heals…”) rather than allowed to emerge solely from scene and subtext, which flattens complexity. The piece leans toward a tidy moral rather than embracing ambivalence or deeper ethical tension. The final image with the child and the sea sound is gently resonant but not reweighting enough to overcome the didactic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of vulnerability-as-strength, liberation through encoding, and quiet defiance against oppressive systems are coherently threaded via dice, crystal, journal, and ocean imagery. The final turns—legend among divers, dice waiting for the next dancer, the ocean weaving solidarity—reweight earlier images effectively. Some lines verge on being explicative (“a liberation that resonated far beyond the rusted walls”) rather than fully trusting image and scene. Overall, the thematic architecture is strong and resonant, if occasionally a touch on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The thematic throughline—that nothing is truly deleted, only compressed or hidden, and that small, tender acts can retrieve and hold vast losses—is coherent and well integrated with objects (wildflowers, lantern, salt crystals, whale). The final conceptual reframing of gravity pockets as repositories of memory is effective, and the closing promise about deleted things being found again resonates. However, the line “Mara understood then that deleted memories were not lost” edges toward explicit thesis-statement, slightly flattening what could remain fully in image and implication. The piece still invites reflection beyond itself without collapsing into platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of silence as power, hidden codes, and peace maintained through veiling are clearly woven through recurring motifs (hush, lattice of calm, river of stars). The final image reweights earlier material by showing the world quietly altered and the code forever unread, which offers a gentle conceptual repricing of secrecy as protection. However, the piece leans toward a single, tidy moral valence—silence as uncomplicated good—without exploring tensions or ambiguity. The resonance is pleasant but not particularly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—truth vs agreed-upon lies, listening to what is usually mute, transforming scholarship into relationship—is coherent and quietly resonant. Recurring motifs (sugar, meteors, the seal, stone language) reappear in altered contexts, supporting thematic depth. However, the narration explicitly states realizations (“the purpose of my quest became clear”) that could be more powerfully earned through image and action alone. The piece invites reflection but flirts with didactic paraphrase instead of fully trusting its own symbols.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.0)
    Thematic intent is very clear: solitude can become strength, memory can be archived rather than suppressed, and isolation repurposed into independence. Recurring motifs (seashell, quarantined memory, last star/dawn) support this, and the final lighthouse image reweights earlier material. However, the story leans heavily on explicit thematic language (“translate isolation into independence,” “tool for self‑reliance”), edging into sermonizing rather than letting insight fully emerge from scene particulars. The resolution feels tidy and unambiguous, limiting complexity and lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of forgery-as-salvation, forgiveness of the unfinished, and reconfiguring artistic lineage are well seeded and recur via the thorn, the hidden script, and the idea of “calibrated treason.” The narrative’s conceptual work is strong: the ancient scribes’ forgery reframes Liora’s own practice, and the garden/rose lineage suggests a nuanced take on purity versus adaptation. However, the explicit statement “I will forever unlink the shackles of expectation and write only what the heart commands” lapses into direct moralizing and flattens some of the subtext into thesis. The ending still resonates, but it edges toward sermon where a more image-driven close could have been more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central theme—that echoes are unfinished stories and that honoring them transforms grief into connection—is coherent and organically tied to the singer’s role. Recurring motifs (echoes, shells, threads, humming) build toward a resonant conceptual answer. However, the story undercuts its own subtext by stating the thesis almost didactically (“people echo when their stories remain untold”), tipping toward explanation rather than letting the images carry the weight. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere but somewhat softened by this explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of salvaging purity from wreckage, collective hope, and truth as a delicate, reparative craft emerge organically from the dream-shard and melted-globe imagery. The recurring “window of connection” and lattice of dreams give the idea of interdependence concrete shape, and the ending image of her carrying starlight in her veins reweights the journey. Occasionally the language flirts with abstract sermonizing (“truth, carefully woven, could expose the hidden beauty even in the deepest wreck”), but it doesn’t fully collapse into moralizing. The aftereffect is contemplative and cohesive, if not startlingly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of hidden labor, attentiveness, and gratitude for unseen work are coherent and consistently threaded through nets, fireflies, moon paths, and the bamboo whisk. However, the story states its thesis quite directly (“He understood then that the patterns were not merely visual, but woven from intention, patience, and the quiet labor of countless unseen hands”), tipping into essayistic explanation instead of letting scene and image perform that work. The final reprise with fireflies “spelling out” gratitude is thematically neat but verges on tidy allegory rather than leaving a more complex, ambiguous aftertaste. The resonance is pleasant and clear but lacks the layered friction or moral ambiguity expected at the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of truth vs. “comfortable lies,” stillness vs. chaos, and the repurposing of a wasteland into sanctuary are coherent and organically tied to the diamond and the orchard. The inscription—“Only in stillness does the truth shine brighter than any lie”—neatly crystallizes the story’s central idea. However, the ending lapses into overt moralizing and thesis-summary (“each page a testament…,” “truth could bloom”), which flattens nuance and reduces subtext to explicit statement. The piece invites reflection but does so more by assertion than by leaving charged ambiguities on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central theme—that darkness/“ancient shadows” can be retooled into a scaffold for hope—is coherent and echoed structurally in the transformation of storm, coils, and shadows into light. Motifs of variant allegiance, prophecy, and covenant recur and do reweight the final image of the dawn forged from darkness. However, the text often states its themes directly (“promised a covenant: ancient shadows would be wielded as lanterns for the new era”), edging into thesis rather than letting implications do the work. The moral/emotional complexity is modest; ambiguity about costs or failures is largely absent.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of intergenerational memory, art as translation, and redemption from loneliness are cohesive and emerge through recurring images (music box, jars, dunes, amber light). However, some thematic statements are baldly expository (“His mission… was to become the translator between generations,” “his redemption now glowed like amber”), edging into sermonizing rather than letting scenes carry the insight. The ending does offer a resonant answer—the lonesome splendor becomes a “shared hymn”—but the moral terrain is relatively tidy and untroubled by counter-pressure. The piece lingers pleasantly rather than hauntingly.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ideas of redemption, the ethics of power, and the reconciliation of science and spirit emerge organically through the Heart’s function and Elara’s engineering rituals. The story’s ending—where the crystal absolves Elara even as she calibrates it to heal others—offers a resonant, image-based answer about earned grace and responsible stewardship. A few lines lean toward thematic declaration (“world’s last chance at redemption”) rather than letting images fully carry the weight. Still, the piece leaves a clear emotional aftertaste tied to its particulars rather than a spelled-out moral.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of “patient revolution” and honoring stillness is coherent and threaded through the viaduct, ice, and mantra. However, the story leans into explicit thesis language—“a patient revolution,” “unyoke the rush, honor the still”—which edges toward sermonizing rather than letting images carry the whole weight. The ending does offer a resonant answer (patience as quiet, transformative force), but ambiguity and complexity are limited; the moral calculus is straightforward. Emotional aftereffect is contemplative but not haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.0)
    Ideas of entangled memories, resistance, and institutional neglect are thematically coherent and recur via the lantern, the etched symbols, and references to preventable deaths. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit articulation (“data alone could not unshackle a system that fed on fear,” “controlling influence of the city's neglectful overseers”) rather than letting scenes and images imply its thesis. The ending comes close to moralizing by summarizing what the tunnel “seemed” to mean and the future it heralds. The resonance is present but somewhat over-explained and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of redemption, second chances, and turning apology into concrete change are clear and organically tied to the clockwork heart and chaplaincy context. However, the piece edges into sermonizing with lines like “every soul deserves a chance to rewrite its own rhythm” and the explicit framing of his new ministry, which state the moral rather than trusting implication. The repetition of “deserved” and “second opinions could breathe new life” adds sentimentality more than complexity. Subtext exists in the mechanical/organic heart parallel but is often undercut by overt explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of irreverent awe, play as defiance of fate, and the transformation of chaos into meaning emerge organically through the bell, algorithm, and kaleidoscope motifs. The final image—pushing the absurd farther with a jubilant rainbow and “footnote in the endless ledger of irreverent awe”—nicely reweights the opening. Still, the piece avoids any darker or countervailing forces, so the thematic effect is charming but relatively shallow.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of digital afterlife, the persistence of memory, and the transformation of absence into presence are well-integrated through motifs (deleted songs, hidden sublayer, recurring numbers). The final message, “We are still here, stored in the silence you felt as absence,” neatly crystallizes the thematic argument but does so in explicitly thesis-like language that borders on didactic. Lia’s shift from abstract curiosity to relational responsibility for the dead grounds the theme in character. The resonance is real but a little too tidy and articulated to feel fully layered.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—empathy becoming action, wholeness from fragments, shared anomaly becoming ordinary through understanding—is clear and reinforced by recurring images (crystal, mirrors, lighthouse, shared breath). However, it is also heavily told: lines like “She understood that the true power lay not in the stone but in the willingness to listen” flatten subtext into explicit moral, edging toward sermonizing. The piece invites some reflection on how compassionate attention can alter a hostile environment, but it doesn’t embrace much ambiguity or friction. The thematic answer feels sincere yet somewhat pre-packaged rather than emerging from knotted, particular conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of mortality, acceptance, and the ethics of presence in disaster relief emerge organically from the marina, the storm-wreckage, and her status as a euthanasia tourist. Recurring motifs (wind, ice, the parasol tip, “fold in patience,” “sound of endings”) carry clear symbolic weight and are reweighted by the ending. However, the piece undercuts some of its subtlety by stating its takeaways directly (“solace is not the absence of endings,” “guide a soul home”), drifting into quasi-moral summary. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere but edges toward the didactic rather than leaving more space for ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of destined mismatch, transformation of pain into nourishment, and “intersubjective understanding” between past and present are clear and consistently threaded through the letter, soil, and vines. However, they’re often stated in thesis-like language (“His motive was simple yet profound: to nurture intersubjective understanding…”) rather than fully earned by dramatized moments, veering toward pseudo-profundity. The recurrence of mismatched lovers, scars, and roots does build a coherent thematic web, but the insight risks feeling pre-packaged rather than discovered. The ending offers resonance, yet its emotional complexity is somewhat flattened by explicit commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Listening, sanctity of attention, and the portability of wisdom form a coherent thematic spine, nicely mirrored in the desert recording “resonance” and the Keeper walking between seen and unseen. However, the piece leans into overt articulation (“the true sanctuary lived not in stone or sand”) that borders on sermonizing rather than relying solely on implication. The closing image of him carrying the echo outward has genuine resonance and avoids a tidy moral. Theme is strong but could trust subtext more.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of memory, communal grief, and hope as a transforming force are coherent and supported by recurring images (arcs of photos, vines, feather, light through cracks). Yet the story leans into explicit statements—“We will transmute pain into a masterpiece,” “Because hope, like light, finds its way through every crack”—that edge toward moralizing rather than letting subtext and image fully carry the weight. This slightly sentimental over-clarity blunts what could be a more complex and lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of language as living memory, the inadequacy of dictionaries, and testimony as an offering emerge organically from the crystal, library, and “last dictionary” premise. The repeated movement from “reticence” to “weathered innocence” to resolve creates a coherent emotional argument. At times, the story edges into explicit thesis statements (“not merely lexical but a living pulse of humanity”), softening subtext. Still, the final offering page and fading glow leave a resonant, non-moralizing image.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—aging as loss, memory as echo, and the futility/beauty of trying to preserve what inevitably fades—emerges organically from objects and actions (chalk, tapes, fog, tide, ghost ship’s horn). The recurring motifs reweight themselves at the end, especially when he realizes capturing aging means allowing it to ripple outward to future listeners. The line “to capture the sound of aging was not to trap it, but to let it ripple outward” edges toward explicit statement, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the emotional aftereffect is coherent and resonant rather than didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of channeling chaos into purpose, constancy amid tremor, and “harnessing the ephemeral” emerge organically from the mechanical and cosmic imagery. Recurring motifs—the spinning hand, escape velocity, falling leaf, luminous ache—gain weight by the end, especially as the observatory becomes a sanctuary where “time’s relentless spin could be coaxed into purpose.” However, some lines state the theme too directly (“He knew his work would echo whenever foundations shake…”) veering toward mild sermonizing rather than trusting implication. The ending still leaves a reasonably resonant, non-didactic afterimage despite that explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of transformation, brokenness into wholeness, and endings as a kind of beginning are coherent and supported by the recurring vinyl and cloud imagery. The notion that “endings are not loss but transformation” is powerful but also stated in fairly direct, almost didactic terms, especially in the staff’s keepsake scene. Subtext—such as the tension between bodily failure and spiritual continuity—tends to be spelled out instead of fully trusted to image. Still, the final image of lives “humming inside the clouds” offers a satisfying, if slightly sentimental, thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of cycles, observation versus revelation, and hidden inner life (“where shadows go”) emerge organically from loops, gears, and the isle’s core. The final understanding that noon shadows retire into a time-folded heart has conceptual resonance, but the story also lapses into explanatory lines (“The key's purpose, then, was…”) that flatten subtext. The resolution feels more like an elegant answer than a complex reweighting, with limited ambiguity or emotional aftershock.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of redemption, reconfiguration of error, and the binding power of “mistakes” recur through constellations, vertebrae, roots, and the baby tooth, giving the piece clear conceptual coherence. The final conceptual repricing—“Mistakes are not failures; they are the dark matter that binds the universe together”—reweights prior images, but it crosses into explicit thesis-statement territory. Subtext and image do much of the work already; the direct moralizing dulls some of the potential resonance. The ambiguity around the scholar’s fate and the ethical cost of her act remains under-explored, limiting thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of gentle illumination, nonviolent influence, and quiet purpose come through clearly via the recurring images of sea glass, the pearl of stillness, and unlit light. The conceptual throughline—light that calms rather than burns—is coherent and emotionally pleasant. However, the piece drifts into explicit moralizing (“Thus she taught the world...”) and neat takeaway rather than letting subtext and image fully carry the weight. Complexity and counter-pressure are minimal, giving the insight a somewhat platitudinous feel.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of transforming trauma, memorializing pain as “gentle knowledge,” and building a quiet, collective countercurrent to viral spectacle emerge naturally from the garden’s transformation and the pendant’s use. The repeated “honeyed hush” and “protected vulnerability” motifs reinforce a coherent argument about the value of soft, sustained care. Some lines edge into explicit thesis (“preserving pain as gentle knowledge”), tipping toward statement more than implication. Still, the final image of data and moss bridged by Lira’s breath carries genuine emotional resonance and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme coheres around artistic responsibility, the ethics of using others’ hopes, and resistance to “the current of conventional narratives.” Recurring images—the spiral seashell, current, mist, closing pages—are reprised at the end to suggest that honoring fleeting hopes can “light a new horizon.” The piece avoids outright moralizing, though occasionally leans on vague uplift (“new horizon,” “current of stories never truly ceased”) instead of sharper particulars. Thematic resonance is present and pleasant but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.0)
    The themes of memory, tradition, and song-as-remedy emerge organically from the ritual and imagery of vines, stories, and the moon’s blessing. The final realization—that “the remedy for loss lay not in steel or fire, but in memory sung through forgotten songs”—is coherent but veers close to spelled-out moral. Subtext does function in the repeated motifs of hush, listening with reverence, and golden stories, but the ending’s explicit statement slightly flattens potential ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect is gentle and warm rather than deeply unsettling or complex.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of patience, care for the discarded, and transforming love and loss into guiding maps emerge organically from image patterns (discarded shards → constellations; heartbeat → luminous routes). The final recognition of her work as a “covenant” reweights the earlier ritual and the orchard’s breathing, giving the ending a gentle but real resonance. Some lines edge toward explicit statement (“translating heartbeats into maps was not a task but a covenant”), which slightly undercuts subtext. Still, the aftereffect is cohesive and emotionally grounded rather than merely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of wonder versus reason, preservation versus imprisonment, and attention to the “periphery of existence” are coherent and sustained through recurring images of echoes, reflections, and jars. The conceptual shift—“the cellar of reason was not a prison but a library”—gives the piece a clear thematic statement, but it borders on explicit moralizing rather than letting the images fully carry the insight. The idea of broken time turned into “a chorus of stored wonder” is resonant and fits the closing vision of travelers learning to listen differently. Overall the thematic work is strong but somewhat tidy and declared rather than allowed to remain provocatively ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of transformation—burden into feather, sorrow into song, grief into art—are woven through recurring motifs (calcification, orientation, weights, the grotto’s breath). The closing promise that future souls can “orient properly their own heart, let it calcify into art” effectively reframes the grotto as an ethical-aesthetic engine, a conceptual repricing of suffering. However, that explicit line edges toward moral statement, slightly flattening the otherwise implicit, image-driven resonance. The piece still invites reflection on how pain can be reweighted, but with a bit of sermon-like clarity that keeps it shy of top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of grief-as-tool, “here and gone,” and transforming absence into a vessel are coherently woven through recurring images (roar to sigh, mane shadows, crystallized sap, rust to amber). The final image of the lantern as a quiet beacon for others has real resonance and emotional clarity. Yet the text undercuts its own subtlety with explicit thesis statements—“loss can be a tool, not a trap” and overt explanations of her motivation—which feel more like essay than dramatized insight. This moralizing edge flattens complexity and keeps the thematic work from fully inhabiting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    The themes of regret, self-bargaining, and the endurance/erosion of ambition are woven organically through the imagery of the carousel, the stories, and the ghost of her younger self. The ending offers a resonant answer: she cannot reclaim unbroken ambition but can reconfigure it into a commitment to carry stories and wonder forward. Some lines, like “eroded ambitions now sprouting fresh roots,” verge on direct thematic statement and slightly blunt the subtext. Still, the piece invites reflection on memory and selfhood without collapsing into a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of reclamation, engineered hope, and repurposing old tools are coherent and recur through the sextant, redirected flows, and beacon. However, much of the thematic content is told directly (“framework of possibility,” “ethical currents,” “resurrect hope”) instead of emerging from implication and scene pressure. The ending tips toward moralizing assurance rather than a complex, slightly uneasy resonance. There is conceptual ambition, but the treatment is cleaner and more didactic than elite venues typically accept.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of time as memory, gentleness as strength, and making peace with abandoned hopes emerge organically from the clock concept and weather motifs. The recurrence of rain, petrichor, and the crystal’s whispers effectively frame reconciliation as a quiet, embodied process rather than a grand revelation. That said, the piece edges toward neatness—“to make peace with that abandoned dream” and “a promise that time could heal” come close to stating the thesis. There’s limited moral or emotional ambiguity, so resonance is warm but not particularly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of truth, lies, hindsight, and time are coherent and recurrent, with the sundial and city architecture effectively embodying them. However, the story leans heavily on explicit statements (“he realized that hindsight clarity was not merely a recollection, but a tool…”) rather than letting subtext and image carry the weight. The final vow and “time, truth, and lies… measured by the same invisible hand” line verge on thesis-like moralizing. The resonance is present but somewhat didactic instead of quietly inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—knowledge as living thread, preservation through patient listening, reciprocity with the past—is well integrated through motifs of seeds, knots, storms, and fog, and the final vow to “sow their knowledge like seeds into future minds” feels organically earned. However, the piece comes close to articulating its thesis directly in a couple of lines, and with relatively low narrative pressure the insights risk reading as gently asserted rather than hard-won. The resonance is real but quiet, with limited complexity or counterpressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of grief, unmarked loss, and healing through attention emerge organically via images of obituaries for the living, absent names, and the reviving rose. The closing shift from “lonesome splendor” to “quiet hope” reweights prior material effectively. Some phrasing (“geography of healing,” “explained absences”) leans toward conceptual labeling rather than pure image, which slightly dulls the subtextual power at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of reconciling technology with ecology and redeeming flawed beginnings are consistent and supported by recurring images (gears, feathers, stalactites, the phoenix). However, the piece leans into overt moralizing and summarizing in its final third (“the kingdom learned that beauty could be forged as surely as steel”), which flattens subtext into stated lesson. The prince’s insight feels more like an announced thesis than a hard-won realization emerging from conflicted experience. The resonance is pleasant but veers sentimental and tidy, undercutting the complexity the premise invites.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of transmuted trauma, inherited guilt, and compassion as a transformative “tide” are clear and organically tied to images (black sand, fire, graft, migrating clouds). However, the piece leans into explicit articulation—“determined to prove that scars can sing,” “turning her father’s fire into a beacon of enduring compassion”—which edges toward moral statement rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. The ending offers a satisfying, if tidy, answer: pain becomes song and sanctuary if tended with love. Complexity (e.g., ambivalence about her father or villagers) stays mostly offstage, limiting the lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, belief, patience, and transformation from skepticism to guardianship are coherently woven through images of fountains, constellations, and the geese’s pause. The final image of scattering memories as seeds offers a resonant, non-literal answer about stewardship and renewal. However, the thematic articulation turns slightly didactic in lines like “even a skeptic can become a keeper of light,” stating the moral rather than fully trusting image and action. Complexity is present but somewhat smoothed into uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of nonviolent illumination, generational responsibility, and the transmutation of destructive knowledge into compassionate guidance are well integrated through recurring images (gear, petals, fire vs. light, sonar). The realization that “the gear’s infinite approximation was not a number but a bridge” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how light can travel without harm. Some lines lean close to explicit thesis (“she understood that light could travel without fire, carried instead by memory, mathematics, and love”), softening the subtext slightly. Still, the closing filament of light pulsing with sonar tones provides a strong, image-based thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of grief as a communal, transforming force emerging through material patterns (stone, ribbons, migration, poems) is strong and coherent. Recurring images reweight nicely at the end, especially the ribbon-heart and water gliding over “ribbon-etched” stone. However, lines like “the shape of collective grief was not a jagged scar but a flowing tapestry” edge into thesis-statement, slightly flattening subtext. With a touch more obliqueness and ambiguity, this could be truly resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of ethical labor, stewardship, and “incremental absolution” are coherent and well-integrated with the clock/tide imagery. However, they are stated too directly and repeatedly (“incremental absolution,” “ethically diligent,” “chorus of countless souls who dared to mend the world”), drifting into sermon-like affirmation. Subtext is largely replaced by explicit philosophizing, especially in the closing paragraphs. The final image resonates conceptually but lacks the messy ambiguity that would deepen its aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of memory, misread motives, healing versus hiding, and intention as a non-linear, cyclical force are clear and woven through Marlowe’s story and the final seed metaphor. However, the piece leans into explicit statement (“the shape of intentions was a circle,” “was not a weapon but a seed”) rather than letting images and events fully carry the insight. This asserts wisdom more than it earns it through conflict, edging toward pseudo-profundity. The resonance is present but somewhat didactic and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of ignorance as fertile ground, the fusion of rigor and imagination, and innovation within constraint are coherently woven through recurring images (maps, lattice, barley, spire). The ending’s notion that modeling “inscribed outcomes onto the world’s fabric” nicely reweights earlier material conceptually. However, the final paragraphs lean into explicit thesis statements (“true mastery lay in embracing what one does not know”), edging toward moralizing rather than purely emergent insight. The resonance is strong but somewhat didactic for a top-tier literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematically, the piece coherently explores how forgotten matter (dust, old scores, pirate signals) can be reanimated into story, with the dust motif nicely reweighted at the end. The pirate broadcast as subversive lifeline for a starved culture is suggestive and resonant. Some lines (“Her motivation was simple yet profound: to teach dust to tell stories”) tilt toward thesis-statement rather than pure scene-based emergence. The gentle, hopeful closure lingers pleasantly, though not with profound complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of memory, erasure, emotional honesty, and the false promise of safety are woven through recurring images (ash, shattered porcelain, vanishing point) with decent coherence. The gallery’s transformation and the crystallized emotion offer a solid non-literal answer about the value and cost of feeling. However, the explicit line “true safety lives inside the brave act of feeling” undercuts subtextual power by spelling out the moral. This direct statement flattens what the images had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of historiography, plural truths, and stewardship of knowledge are strongly present and tightly braided with the imagery of sediment, gears, and water. However, they’re often articulated directly in thesis-like sentences (“teach the world that competing narratives can coexist without war,” “agonizing over a single truth is less fruitful than nurturing a chorus of truths”), which undercuts subtext. The piece does invite reflection on how stories shape infrastructure and survival, but it leans into explicit moralizing rather than trusting image and implication. The resonance is solid but somewhat didactic for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of reconciliation, communal art, and the transformation of silence into a generative space recur coherently through the zither, rosette, and library imagery. The story earns some resonance in specific moments, especially the child and veteran offering imperfect sounds that nonetheless become part of the tapestry. However, the narration leans into explicit thesis statements (“She knew the method—by subtracting noise…”) and assurance (“a world where art never vanished”) that verge on sermonizing. The result is affecting but somewhat tidy and overtly stated rather than fully left to subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of renewal versus ruin, pruning of dead ideologies, and listening to forgotten memories are woven through concrete acts (pruning vines, tasting collective memory, spores of lullabies). The “gentle rebellion” concept is appealing and distinct, but at times the language tips into thesis (“The gentle rebellion was not a war of fire but a quiet pruning of old ideologies”), reducing subtext. Still, the final image of a humming, memory-laden garden as beacon offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening problem of a deaf civilization. The thematic impact is strong, though limited by relatively soft conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of wonder vs. routine, loss vs. pause, and the city’s “voice” returning as echo are integrated through concrete motifs (bells, drones, blackout, echo). The riddle’s answer conceptually reweights the earlier hive failure, and the final communal ritual image has real resonance. However, the text leans into overt explanation—“She understood that the drone beehive failure had not been a loss but a pause”—rather than fully trusting image and action. The moral texture is thoughtful but somewhat tidy and declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of attention, normalization, and how spaces become “alive” through shared hush emerge organically from images of houses, objects, and the bay rather than pure declaration. The idea of sanctification through displacement and listening is fresh, especially in the cracked teacup anecdote and the shard’s lingering pulse. That said, the final third leans into overt thesis statements (“I realized that my role…”) which edge toward explanatory rather than purely image-driven resonance. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and reflective, but a touch more ambiguity or friction would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    Thematic intent—nuance softening ossified certainty—is clear and woven through recurring images (cracks, threads, mosaics, violet light). However, it’s articulated too directly (“nuance was not a flaw but a bridge,” “weaving certainty into a tapestry now speckled with nuanced colors”), bordering on moralizing rather than letting subtext do the work. Because there’s little on-page resistance, wisdom comes as declaration rather than being wrestled out of conflict. The final image does reweight the premise conceptually, but with limited ambiguity or bite.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of missed opportunity, flaw-as-stabilizer, and confinement as creative catalyst emerge organically from the dice, the chip, and the staircase, with a nice late pivot when he reframes his goal (“not… a single regained moment but the grain of every lost breath”). Recurring images (dice, steps, chip, “boundless confinement”) do real thematic work and the final image of each step as both “cage and key” offers a resonant, non-literal answer. At times the prose edges toward explicit thesis statements (“Mathematically, the chipped side acted as a constant offset…”) that flatten subtext into explanation. Strong, but a touch didactic in spots for elite-level subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Thematic throughline—lost languages as a metaphor for forgotten gratitude and remembered kindness—is clear and organically tied to the scripts, brush, and notes. The story risks over-clarity in lines like “proving that strangers indeed remember kindness,” which leans toward thesis rather than leaving space for reader inference. Still, the final image of the greenhouse as a “saffron-lit bridge” where gratitude is spoken without words carries real emotional resonance. Complexity is modest: there’s little challenge or shadow to the kindness motif, but it’s honestly earned rather than saccharine.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic core—art as a vehicle for memory, identity, and communal healing after displacement—emerges strongly from the bread initials, the displaced artisans, and the lens that reveals “ghosts of memory.” However, the story occasionally lapses into thesis-statement mode, most notably “the true rescue lay not in preserving objects but in thawing hearts,” which undercuts subtext. The final legend framing and the prism of hope in rose-tinted mist provide a resonant conceptual repricing of dread into bittersweet acceptance. Complexity is present but somewhat smoothed into a comforting moral.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    Motifs of reversal (counter clockwise clocks, yoyo motion, reverse-engineering) and “latent radiance” support a theme about rewriting fate through ingenuity and careful deconstruction of the past. The final image of the dormant hunger stone waiting for “another seeker” gives a gentle conceptual repricing. However, the last paragraphs slide into overt thesis (“He had learned that to initiate change, one must first deconstruct the past”), edging toward essay rather than pure scene-earned resonance. Thematic material is thoughtful but somewhat over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece coherently explores fear as something that can be forced to consume itself—“snuff it with its own flame”—and the idea that cleansing others of dread may condemn the cleanser to carry a permanent curse. Recurring motifs (lingering luminance, reflections, ink, the cursed rose) build a textured meditation on contamination, memory, and exposure. The advisor’s line about “trick[ing] fear into revealing its weakness” edges toward thematic statement but is justified by the ritual. The ending’s offer of becoming a “beacon” for others’ dread provides a resonant, if somewhat abstract, thematic charge without slipping into overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    The thematic throughline—turning hindrances into harmony—is coherent and supported by recurring images (roots, branches, clouds, tides all repurposed as music). However, the theme is also stated directly (“His motivation was simple yet profound...”), which flattens some potential subtext. Without conflict or counterpressure, the idea doesn’t gain much complexity; it’s elegant but a bit didactic and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of listening versus stagnation, pattern recognition as a way of knowing, and a community’s willingness to heed what it lives upon are woven concretely through turtles, shells, and the lost expedition. The final insight—that the city itself was the “true lost expedition” in its refusal to listen—reweights prior material without feeling like a tacked-on moral. Occasional phrasing skirts abstraction (“becoming a fossil upon the turtles’ backs”), but the recurring motifs generally carry the thematic work. The ending offers a resonant conceptual repricing rather than a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme is coherent and tightly woven: noble lies as glue and cage, truth as something both compassionate and stark, mirrored by the decayed station. However, much of it is delivered as direct thesis (“noble lie dissolve, not as a betrayal but as a transformation into transparent honesty”), veering into moralizing rather than subtext. The images (ivy, pit of lies, steam, rosebush) support the idea but often feel like vehicles for the argument rather than emergent meaning. The ending offers a clear but overly tidy answer instead of a resonant, unsettled reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—memory versus erosion, the ethics of witnessing decay, and the cost of being an “archeologist of abandoned dreams”—emerges organically through action and recurring images (ink, absence, submerged structures). The final pages, with her vow to keep cataloguing ruins and the “hush of her blaze” growing louder, offer a resonant if gentle answer: quiet, obsessive preservation as rebellion against oblivion. Occasionally the piece edges toward overt statement (the repeated phrase “archeologist of abandoned dreams,” explicit noting of “interlaced absence”). Still, the emotional aftertaste is earned through specifics rather than pure abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of “honest origins,” knowledge as sacrificially protected, and light/preservation emerging from darkness are coherently woven through the stamp, the blackout, the architects’ choice, and the tidal buoys. The repeated images of “reclaimed stillness” and “dappled resolve” create a clear thematic pattern without outright moralizing. The ending offers a resonant answer—truth as foundation for rebuilding—though it edges close to neatness, with limited ambiguity or moral friction. It’s thoughtful and integrated, but not yet deeply unsettling or complex.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of grief, memory, and the paradox of healing (“ascend even as it descends”) are well integrated into recurring images—the basilica, cranes, shadow, and dream-light all reweight the idea of luminous torment. The final image of sorrow turned into hopeful stars offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. At times the text edges toward thematic restatement (“bridge between grief and the luminous torment of memory”), slightly flattening subtext into statement. Overall, though, the piece invites reflection on the costs and limits of transforming pain.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of grief, latent possibility, and the ethics of what one does with “unused potential” accrue organically from the imagery of maps, seams, and pools redefined as a state of being. The geode’s fracture into “tiny suns” and the shift from revenge to awakening give the ending a resonant, if quiet, emotional aftertaste. However, some thematic statements are more told than implied (“He realized the unused potential was not a place but a state of being”), edging toward thesis rather than subtext. The complexity is there, but a lighter, more image-driven touch at the end would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of belonging, unity, and collaborative curiosity are coherent and reinforced by the observatory’s transformation and the shared act between Lira and the pilgrim. However, they are frequently stated outright (“the frequency of belonging was the pulse of every living star”; “belonging is a frequency that can be tuned by anyone willing to listen”), tipping into didacticism. Subtext is thin; the piece tells us what the symbols mean instead of letting images and actions carry more of that burden. The emotional aftereffect is gentle but not particularly complex or haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.0)
    The thematic spine about truth, false lineage, and the moral cost of fabrication is coherent and well-seeded through profession, setting, and motif. However, the theme is articulated too baldly—“the weight of a withheld truth is heavier than any crown” functions as a thesis statement, repeated and then literalized in the carvings, tipping into moralizing. The story invites some reflection on memory and identity but settles on a tidy redemptive takeaway. Subtext exists in images (tide, carvings, the watch) but is often overshadowed by explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of atonement, learning from error, and forgiveness as an earned bridge are coherent and supported by recurring images (rope, drawer pull, storm clearing, scarred stone). However, they are often delivered in explicit aphorisms (“forgiveness is not a gift but a bridge built from honesty,” “Mistakes remembered, lessons kept”) that reduce subtext. The final image of the world’s “collective sigh of relief” and the simple hinge between “past error and future mercy” does provide genuine resonance. Overall, the piece leans a bit didactic but maintains emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of aligning heart and action, re-framing regret, and sustaining fragile faith are consistent and tightly woven through compass, horizon, and tide motifs. The ending image of faith as a “steady ember” offers a clear thematic answer: acceptance with ongoing cost rather than clean erasure. However, some insights are articulated in a slightly didactic way (“backlash of regrets was merely a tide that could be ridden”), edging toward stated thesis rather than fully trusting image and action. The piece is emotionally sincere but occasionally flirts with sentimentality and over-tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of redemption, empathy in a cold world, and the past as guide rather than stain are coherent and interwoven with the mirror and baseball. However, they’re often articulated directly (“Empathy is a seed; plant it…”; “I realized that my journey was not just about erasing the past…”), tipping into on-the-nose moralizing instead of letting subtext and image do more work. The closing image of the past as compass has genuine resonance and reweights prior material. Greater reliance on implication and less explicit thesis-stating would lift this toward a more literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rebirth, intimacy across death, and the cost of binding oneself to the more-than-human world emerge coherently from the phoenix, the spices, and Liora’s final role as guardian. The “cosmic intimacy” of shared breath, twin moons for eyes, and the orchard’s approving sighs builds a clear thematic throughline. However, the last paragraphs lean into explicit articulation (“the true magic was not the transformation itself but the cosmic intimacy…,” “Forever”) that edges toward sentimentality and reduces ambiguity. The lingering emotional effect is warm and gentle rather than deeply unsettling or complex.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motifs of cracks, constellations, traced hands, and accumulating dew cohere around themes of intergenerational connection, reclaimed time, and the possibility—and cost—of repentance. The broken saucer healing into a crystal blossom and the droplet on the twins’ foreheads reweight earlier images without stating a moral outright. At times the language edges toward sentimentality or pseudo-profundity (“believing the syllables could stitch the broken saucer and heal the world”), softening complexity. Still, the ending’s quiet reconfiguration of loss and beginning carries genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of grief transmuted into hope, nonviolent transformation, and compassion as a cosmic force are strongly woven through Kwan Yin’s tear, the shadow work metaphor, and the final open garden. The story earns some emotional resonance via concrete images (photograph-tears as needle, unborn children’s echo), but it edges into explicit moralizing (“welcome all who came seeking healing”; “pacifist’s legacy lived on”) that slightly flattens complexity. Ambiguity or ethical tension around pacifism, sacrifice, or who gets saved is minimal. The ending answers its thematic question clearly but a bit too neatly for elite-literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of transformation, destiny-as-coincidence, and the moral texture of charity are coherent and recur through concrete motifs (fireflies, volcano, glowing sand, prophecies). However, the story leans heavily on explicit thematic phrasing—“texture of transformation,” “orchestrated coincidence,” “vibrant hush”—reiterated rather than deepened, which edges toward sermonizing. The epiphany that “transformation was not a single event but a texture woven through every breath” is conceptually apt but stated outright, limiting subtext. Emotional resonance is present but managed and tidy rather than complex or troubling.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of illumination, quiet rebellion, and ideas as nonviolent contagion are well integrated through recurring images (light without flame, phosphorescent moss, winking hush, coded sundial). The blackout-as-canvas and fort “finding its own pulse” nicely reprice the premise conceptually. However, the thematic arc is relatively tidy and untroubled—there’s little acknowledgment of cost, backlash, or moral ambiguity in rewriting obedience into subversion. The resonance is real but somewhat idealized, keeping it strong rather than profound.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of fate vs agency, order coaxed from chaos, and transforming a curse into a guiding pattern emerge organically from the ritual and its outcome. Recurring motifs—“lingering promise,” “borrowed dawn,” mathematical sequences—are reweighted at the end when the promise becomes a “living map” for others and her curse a compass. Some lines (“order could be forged from chaos,” “the universe’s patterns were not fixed”) edge toward explicit thesis rather than fully trusting image and implication. Still, the final resonance is clear, and the story invites reflection on how intentional design might bend seemingly fixed cosmic rules.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of censorship, trauma, and transforming pain into shared cartography are coherent and reinforced through recurring images (scars as cities/rivers, the map, the observatory ritual). The final understanding—“not a wound to be healed but a terrain to be traversed with reverence”—is potent but borders on essayistic thesis-statement. Several lines in the final third (“guide generations toward compassion”) slide into explicit moralizing rather than letting images carry the weight. The resonance is real but slightly blunted by this didactic edge.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central theme—questions becoming destinations, dignified chaos tamed into purposeful pattern—is clear and consistently echoed in objects and images. The final act of mapping the overture onto the sundial offers a conceptual answer that reweights earlier motifs. However, the text leans on repeated thesis-like formulations (“turn questions into destinations,” “dignified chaos”) that verge on slogan rather than subtext. The piece flirts with profundity but sometimes tells its meaning instead of letting it fully emerge from scene.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of forging beauty from anarchy, stories as bricks in a sanctuary, and resistance as cultivation rather than violence are coherently woven through objects (pennies, books, seeds) and actions (rebuilding, planting, welcoming travelers). The “false bottom” motif as hidden fertile soil in both tin and lives is effective subtextually. However, several lines verge on outright thesis statements (“to forge beauty from anarchy,” “We have rebuilt a garden in stone”), tipping from resonance into mild sermonizing. The piece invites reflection but keeps complexity relatively gentle and unconflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of defying time, negotiating with fate, and the transformative power of art emerge organically through clocks, schedules, reels, and the encore. The clock’s final single tick and cessation work as a resonant image, suggesting time has been serenaded and subtly reweighted. There is no overt moralizing, and the ambiguity of what exactly “rewriting fate” entails invites reflection. Still, the piece stops short of a deeper, character-specific moral or emotional paradox that might move it into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of empiricism versus myth, individual versus collective memory, and doubt as a generative force emerge naturally from Mara’s work translating dream symbols into “stubborn facts.” The seed as living archive and the monsoon as both threat and carrier of stories give the ending a resonant, non-literal answer: cultural memory survives through a collaboration of rigor and imagination. However, a few lines edge into thematic statement (“even empirical whims could be nurtured by shared dreams”), slightly flattening what is otherwise elegantly implied. The complexity is solid but not quite as layered or surprising as the best literary work in this register.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of regret, apology, and communal healing via attention to “unspoken apologies” are well-integrated through recurring images (cerulean, tides, lace, compass). The final realization that the color is “not a pigment but a feeling” reweights prior imagery in a satisfying way, even if it edges toward explicit statement. Subtext about isolation (“after the severance”) and quiet, ritual care as a mode of repair is present but under-explored in conflict terms. Because the conflict itself remains low-intensity, the thematic arc, while resonant, can’t quite reach a more complex, high-stakes register.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader via notebook entries and dialogue ("We are all dust"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty for stating the thesis. This overt moralizing flattens potential subtext into a simple lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative voice ("smuggler's ledger was not merely a record... but a scorched testament"), violating the show-don't-tell rule. The ending moralizes directly ("purpose lived not in grand gestures"), flattening potential subtext into a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("music... that honored each wave") and repeated keywords rather than emerging from subtext. The resolution offers a tidy, distinct lesson that tells the reader how to feel instead of earning resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story relies heavily on explicit thematic statements (e.g., "Marlow understood that his task was... to revitalize the very concept of rest") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action. The subtext is text; the metaphor is explained to the reader rather than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.0)
    Theme is delivered through explicit exposition and sermonizing ("reminded them that the purpose... was to build intergenerational support") rather than emergent subtext. The moral conclusion is stated by the protagonist in summary, precluding any interpretive depth or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and narration ("healing was not a single act") rather than emerging organically from dramatized events. The story explains its meaning directly to the reader, leaving no room for subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader ("Mara understood that the maze’s purpose was not a puzzle... but a conduit") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending restates the premise in abstract terms ("dissolve the static and embrace fluidity") without earning the insight through narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=2.2)
    The narrative explains its own metaphors explicitly ("Mara understood that the ‘wall’ was a metaphor"), destroying subtext. The theme is delivered via sermonizing assertions ("planting resilience," "freedom can be forged") rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial statements ("memory remains the bridge," "trust, even when broken, leaves a trace") rather than emerging from subtext or action. This "thematic echo" flattens the resonance into a moralizing summary.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Lira realized the thief’s true calling") rather than emerging organically from the conflict. The concept of "destiny" is repeated as a label but remains abstract, failing to integrate with specific character decisions. The ending sermonizes rather than resonating through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and narration ("reminder that even broken things can mark new beginnings") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending articulates the message directly in the protagonist's thoughts, flattening the resonance into a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=2.6)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed sermonizing ("proving that vulnerability is power") rather than subtext or action. The ending reduces the narrative to a moralizing summary ("every betrayal can be turned into a beacon") that preaches to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of mapping the unknown is overshadowed by the mechanical repetition of specific phrases ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") which appear seven times total. These motifs do not evolve or deepen meaning but recur as static labels, reducing the thematic resonance to a checklist exercise.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story explicitly tells the reader the theme ("boundaries between cleaning and creating blur," "mundane mysticism") rather than letting it emerge from action. This over-articulation flattens resonance, turning the narrative into a lecture on its own meaning rather than a dramatized experience of synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("honesty had freed them") rather than emerging from subtext or dramatic irony. The story relies on "Thematic Echo" where the prompt's concepts are stated as factual conclusions in the narration, flattening the potential for nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, culminating in the garden literally speaking the theme ("turned cracked promises into shining pathways") to the protagonist. This violates the subtext rule by stating the thesis directly in dialogue. The themes of "duality" and "blooming withering" are asserted through repetition rather than emerging organically from action.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is asserted through exposition ("time moves sideways") rather than emerging organically from the drama. The concept is treated as a prompt requirement to be stated, rather than a human experience to be explored, resulting in a "message" that feels disconnected from any lived reality.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly told to the reader ("not a cipher of letters but a pattern of silences") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending leans into sentimental summary ("gratitude for the secret") instead of earning resonance through subtext. The result is a moral that feels applied to the story rather than discovered within it.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is heavily explicit, culminating in a sermonizing final sentence ("reminder that sorrow can be beautiful...") that summarizes the moral instead of letting the image resonate. This direct statement of meaning flattens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of industrial guilt is explicitly stated ("emotional tonnage of a confession," "frequency chart of guilt") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The reliance on telling the reader exactly what the wheel represents removes nuance and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, culminating in the character writing the thesis statement ("silence births renewal") in a journal. This overt "Thematic Echo" flattens subtext and reduces the narrative to a simple lesson rather than an earned experience.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is stated explicitly and repetitively ("ordinary magic," "nurture lifelong wonder") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story moralizes its point, leaving no room for ambiguity or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than dramatized, culminating in a summarized moral ("not a fracture but a realignment") that feels unearned. The lack of subtext and the reliance on "telling" the meaning reduces resonance to a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.5)
    Themes are delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("open secret," "accidental prophecies") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The ending resorts to moralizing summary about "rewired lives" and "hidden truths" instead of earning resonance through specific, dramatized particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing ("journey a testament to the power of one color") rather than earning its theme through subtext. The inclusion of the prompt element "rhetorical devices" as a literal noun phrase within the narrative breaks immersion and reads as a checklist insertion rather than an organic part of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing, particularly in the final fortune cookie message which acts as a summary thesis statement. The phrase "chronologically homesick" serves as a told label for the theme rather than emerging organically from the action, and the ending reduces the narrative to a simple aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing at the end ("to own every timeline... is to master oneself") rather than emerging from the narrative. This didactic conclusion flattens the potential for subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing statements ("only when the silence is mirrored can the heart be unshackled") rather than subtext. The ending summarizes the lesson ("emotional numbness can always be rewound and healed") instead of allowing the imagery to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.0)
    Thematic work is delivered through direct assertion ("honesty could survive," "truth would always find a way") rather than subtext or action. The story relies on moralizing summaries to generate significance, resulting in a lecture-like tone rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through direct explanation ("He realized that the impact of memories was not a passive archive") rather than subtext or action. The story lectures the reader on its meaning instead of letting the imagery resonate independently.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on "Thematic Echo," explicitly inserting prompt phrases like "ethically playful" and "impossible choices" as descriptors instead of dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The villagers understood that beauty lay not in...") rather than emerging organically from action and subtext. This didactic approach replaces narrative pressure with a sermonized conclusion, triggering the penalty for thematic summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is explicitly stated via exposition ("Her aim was simple yet profound: to fuse insight with empathy") rather than emerging from subtext. This over-explanation flattens potential resonance into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("grief plus hope equals a new kind of growth") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending relies on summary assertions of "ever-lasting wonder" and "buried optimism," falling into the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern where the moral is preached to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("She knew that visibility was not merely being seen...") rather than subtext or action. The emotional resonance is asserted by the narrator rather than earned through the dramatic situation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Marlowe understood that true transformation required him to step back") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action.

    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("she knew the exchange was complete: the island had given her meaning..."), which flattens resonance. The story relies on a transactional fable logic that simplifies the complexity of "threshing meaning" into a tidy, sermonizing conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative relies on explicit moralizing ("reminding all who hear," "even the darkest tunnels can shine") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action. The result is a sermonizing tone that tells the reader exactly how to interpret the events.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of communal memory is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed narration ("turned a lonely exile into a communal chorus").

The resolution offers a tidy, sermonizing affirmation of the premise without exploring complexity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is handled with extreme literalism, culminating in a physical ledger actually titled "Unspoken Truths." Subtext is nonexistent as the narrative explicitly states the significance of every element ("not a place of stone, but a living archive"). The result is a surface-level engagement with the prompt's concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is explicitly summarized by the narrator ("reminding her that memory, like migration, is a journey"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The story explains its meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext or action.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.8)

The ending summarizes the moral rather than embodying it in a resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.5)

The result is sentimental and didactic, lacking the complexity or ambiguity of high-end fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.5)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit moralizing ("loss was part of the cycle," "memory could survive the void") and the labeling of abstract concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("exile could become a bridge," "gaps... filled with possibilities") rather than emerging from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on explicit moralizing ("She reminded herself that the purpose...", "Mira understood that...") to convey meaning, destroying subtext. The theme is stated as a lesson learned rather than emerging organically from a struggle between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=3.3)

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.1)

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("He understood that the quiet he sought was not the absence of sound...") rather than emerging from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme that "laughter heals" and "broken music can mend" is coherent but delivered through platitudes rather than dramatized complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story violates the prohibition on explicit moralizing by reciting the theme as a literal equation ("mercy equals the sum..."). This didactic summing-up in the climax flattens subtext and reduces the narrative to a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.0)

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.5)

    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("motivation was simple yet profound: to foster interspecies respect") and moralizing conclusions. The story explicitly states its thesis ("secrets revealed by compassion") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from subtext or complex action.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial assertions ("curiosity could forge homecoming," "chemistry of homecoming was not a formula but a dialogue") rather than emerging from subtext.

This approach eliminates ambiguity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than emerging from subtext, culminating in a moralizing summary ("promising that even a battlefield could become a field of flowers"). The final paragraph relies on "Thematic Echo," explaining the story's meaning directly to the reader instead of letting the imagery resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explication, with the central premise ("translate distance into closeness") repeated verbatim as a motivation and conclusion. Emotional resonance is asserted by the narrator ("Rook’s heart thumped") rather than evoked through subtext or specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text ("chart a path that honored both loss and hope"), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. The narrative relies on moralizing assertions to generate resonance instead of allowing meaning to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.5)
    Theme is delivered through didactic assertion ("understood that his role was not merely theft") rather than emerging from subtext.

This overly directive approach prevents any genuine resonance or ambiguity from developing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition and moralizing ("Mira understood that each missing pawn represented..."). The ending offers symmetric satisfaction that explicitly states the lesson rather than earning resonance through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, summarizing its theme ("home was not a fixed point but a resonance") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. The result is didactic and lacks interpretive depth.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed moralizing ("He knew forgiveness was not a single move...") rather than emerging organically from the action. The text repeatedly explains the meaning of its symbols (labyrinth = winnowing regrets), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and sermonizing dialogue ("We are the echo," "The stone remembers"). The ending relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the protagonist states the thesis directly to the audience, flattening any potential nuance or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story explicitly defines its own symbolism ("golden seams... were not literal metal but the luminous intention of kintsugi"), which collapses subtext into a lecture. This didactic intrusion explains the theme to the reader rather than allowing it to resonate through action and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated on a prop ("Keep this promise...") rather than emerging from the narrative. The resolution feels like a sentimental fable with a tidy moral, lacking subtextual depth or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narration and dialogue multiple times ("whispers travel farther than shouts"), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation.

This overt moralizing flattens the narrative into a thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated to the reader ("she understood that reverse migration was not a folly... but a necessity") rather than emerging from the subtext of the action. This didactic approach flattens the emotional resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Elian understood that the true map was...") rather than emerging organically from action. The lesson feels like a platitude pasted onto the ending rather than a hard-won insight derived from the narrative crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=2.7)
    The theme is delivered via a tidy, moralizing conclusion ("tempered by starlight") that feels unearned by the preceding action. The story resolves complex trauma (recurring dreams, neglected kingdom) with a simplistic magical fix, preventing any resonant ambiguity or depth.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("true alchemy lies in...") and on-the-nose symbolism rather than emerging organically from action. The result is a sermonizing tone that tells the reader what to feel instead of earning resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through direct statement and definition ("literal manifestation of feral nostalgia") rather than emerging from subtext. The text explains its own meaning repeatedly ("time is a cruel editor"), removing ambiguity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly preached to the reader rather than emerging from subtext ("She believed that ordinary miracles lived in such forgotten fragments"). The dialogue and narration constantly explain the meaning of the actions ("You are a conduit for love's first sigh"), leaving no space for the reader to interpret the story independently.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("to transform scars into stories") rather than emerging organically from action or subtext. The tonal control collapses in the final line with the awkward adverb cluster "smiled softly brightly," which forces a sentimental mood over earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme is articulated explicitly rather than emerging from subtext, culminating in a moralizing summary ("apologies, like music, can linger...") that flattens the resonance. The concept of "imperfect miracles" is repeated as a label rather than demonstrated through complex moral outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.5)
    Themes of unity and illusion are delivered through direct exposition ("She knew that only through spiral arbitration...") rather than subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=2.6)
    The theme is delivered through didactic assertion ("Letting go - was not surrender but...") rather than emerging from the narrative action. The "quiet wildfire" motif clashes tonally with the damp, fungal setting, appearing as a forced prompt insertion rather than an organic metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=2.6)
    The theme is explicitly stated via narrative assertion and repeated labels ("lucid contradictions," "balanced insight") rather than emerging organically from the conflict. The story tells the reader the moral ("widen perspectives responsibly") instead of allowing meaning to arise from the consequences of the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is articulated through explicit exposition ("She believed that by teaching endings how to begin," "endings are merely the start") rather than emerging from subtext or action. This didactic approach flattens the emotional resonance, as the story interprets itself for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("history beats in the smallest of things") rather than emerging from subtext or dramatic irony.

    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing ("Lira recorded... that the cure... was not a potion but the act of catalyzing connections") rather than emerging from subtext. The story explains its meaning to the reader, leaving no room for resonance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.6)
    The story leans heavily on explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("universe rewards those who can unbend"), which acts as a sermon rather than a resonant subtext. The theme is delivered through direct statements ("editing history was less about control and more about listening") rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action, resulting in a flat, lecture-like aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the narrative voice ("a reminder that even forgotten souls can craft beauty from void"), stripping the ending of subtextual resonance. The "joyful sorrow" is asserted as a label rather than emerging organically from the action. The story relies on telling the reader what to feel rather than constructing a scenario where that meaning is inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing statements ("He understood that his flames... could now be turned...") rather than emerging from subtext. The resolution offers a tidy, sermon-like answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("Thus the tale... became a living chord"). This explanatory summation replaces resonant subtext, triggering the penalty for sermonizing endings.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=2.2)
    The story fails the "Thematic Echo" test significantly; the theme is explicitly stated in the protagonist's motivation and then literally written on a note at the end ("Whispers are the true currents of this city"). This overt moralizing replaces subtext and resonance with a lecture, offering a tidy, unearned answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly told to the reader ("teaching darkness the value of stars") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The reliance on abstract assertions about "hope" and "empathy" prevents a deeper, more complex thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed assertion and moralizing metaphors ("planting forests of second thoughts") rather than organic subtext. The ending explicitly states the lesson ("The quiet has spoken"), violating the principle of allowing the reader to infer meaning. It feels didactic, prioritizing the message over the narrative experience.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("Mara knew the island was a test... where one must detach") rather than emerging from subtext or action.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized through dialogue and narration ("cutting away the weight of grief," "carving a path for lightness"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The ending restates the thesis ("carving light from sorrow"), collapsing subtext into a moral lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed assertion ("aesthetically driven testament to freedom") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending moralizes explicitly, telling the reader what to feel instead of earning resonance through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme of connection is delivered through heavy-handed summary ("cathedral of shared feeling," "notion of isolation dissolved") rather than subtext or dramatized interaction. The story moralizes about empathy and kinship, telling the reader exactly what to feel instead of earning the emotional resonance through specific, grounded particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.6)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by heavy-handed exposition that explains the metaphors to the reader ("She understood that the curtains of intention were not literal drapes"). The concept is delivered through didactic assertion rather than emerging organically from subtext or action.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through direct telling ("confiding that the pattern she sought was not merely profit, but a blueprint of hope") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story moralizes about rebuilding without grounding the concept in concrete, dramatized human experience.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing rather than narrative implication. The final paragraph acts as a lecture ("They would too learn that true purification comes not from..."), summarizing the story's thesis in a way that deflates narrative tension and reduces the experience to a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("metamorphose was not merely a change of form but a rebirth") rather than dramatic enactment. The reliance on abstract labels and told-only epiphanies ("revelation felt softly deliberate") flattens potential subtext into a lecture on hope.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("mapping the hidden architecture of deceit") and concludes with a direct moral sermon in the journal entry.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("wounds can hold hope") and aphorisms rather than dramatic enactment. The ending summarizes the lesson instead of allowing it to emerge from the narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=2.9)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing and thematic summaries ("He understood now...", "He realized...") instead of allowing meaning to emerge from action. The theme is delivered as a sermon on "internal wilderness" and "probable miracles," resulting in a lack of subtext and an unearned, tidy resolution that feels like a platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("courage as a seed sleeping," "map of the inner self") rather than subtext or action. The ending reduces the narrative to a didactic fable where the meaning is explained to the reader rather than resonating through specific, earned imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("They understood that to remain in safety meant...") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The heavy repetition of "frostbitten hope" and "unpardonable silence" acts as a blunt instrument, forcing resonance that the dramatic action does not support.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, culminating in a summary statement ("power taken by deceit would always crumble") that flattens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed repetition of keywords ("delayed revelation," "periodically eternal") rather than organic subtext. The ending veers into sermonizing ("humanity that some changes are only visible..."), explicitly stating the moral instead of letting the image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition at the climax ("She realized," "She finally understood") rather than emerging organically from the action. The conclusion offers a tidy, stated moral about "cycles and rebirth" that feels unearned by the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.9)

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed moralizing, explicitly stating the protagonist's purpose ("to anchor optimism in realism") rather than allowing it to emerge from action. This sermonizing approach essentially lectures the reader, replacing subtext with a direct thesis statement that reduces narrative resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly preached to the reader via rhetorical questions ("Was it not the purpose of every artist...?") and summary statements. The narrative lacks subtext, preferring to state its thesis ("fragmented reality... not a curse but a canvas") directly in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story explicitly explains its themes to the reader ("slowdown was not a flaw but a deliberate deferral") rather than allowing them to emerge from subtext. The ending leans into moralizing ("world would no longer be caught unaware") rather than resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=2.4)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("symbols of hope birthed from scandal"), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. The story functions more as a fable with a stated lesson than a narrative exploring complex truths.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is undercut by explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("he knew that to catch... was not to trap it"), which replaces dramatic resonance with a sermon. The story resolves into a simplistic binary that avoids the complexity of the central desire, instructing the reader on how to feel rather than earning the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("dawn of accountability," "intervene in the narrative") rather than emerging organically from the conflict. The phrase "orbits of regret" is repeated as a label for the theme rather than developed through subtext. The ending moralizes the outcome instead of letting the action speak.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=3.5)
    The ending devolves into explicit moralizing ("In the end, Lyra understood that..."), flattening potential subtext into a stated sermon. The theme of healing is asserted through summary and "miracle" results rather than emerging from the friction of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=2.4)

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed didacticism ("compassion could be engineered," "mercy forged in steel") rather than emerging from narrative subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("proof that miracles still echo," "hope can always be summoned"). Subtext is absent, replaced by sentimental assertions that simplify the narrative's complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story explicitly states its themes and tone ("willowglass hope," "curiosity meets compassion") within the narration, violating the show-don't-tell principle. This "Thematic Echo" at the end flattens resonance into a moralizing summary rather than earning it through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the final paragraph ("She understood that...") rather than allowed to emerge organically from the action. The lack of subtext and ambiguity reduces the narrative to a simple parable with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.3)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the final paragraph ("realizing that to distill... was not to erase, but to honor"), which violates the "show, don't tell" principle. The concepts of "palimpsest" and "percolate" are repeated as keywords rather than explored through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed moralizing ("kindness... can bend even the hardest timeline") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative preaches its conclusion explicitly, reducing the story to a fable with a pre-determined moral lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("power plays lose their edge when all ears listen as one") rather than subtext. The resolution offers a simplistic binary where unity is achieved via technological mind-nudge, lacking nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme drifts significantly, moving from spatial rebellion to the "forgetting of stories" and finally to music/freedom without a cohesive thread connecting them to the action. The ending relies on a "thematic echo" (explicitly stating the theme of stories binding humanity) rather than allowing resonance to emerge from the dramatic specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermons ("truth lay not in seeing but in feeling") and stated beliefs rather than emerging from subtext. The narrative dictates the moral ("unifying opposites," "awaken dormant empathy") instead of allowing the reader to infer meaning from the events.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("world still needed librarians who could map bravery"), which violates the show-don't-tell principle. The "reversible exile" concept remains abstract and is explained rather than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of loops and circular paths is coherent but delivered through explicit moralizing ("realization that circles are not failures") rather than emergent subtext. The "robber's legacy" motif provides a nice frame but feels disconnected from the central algorithmic plot until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=2.7)
    The theme is delivered through repetitive, sermonizing assertions ("words could heal with words," "share the burden") rather than emerging organically from subtext or conflict.

The resolution offers a simplistic moral panacea rather than a complex engagement with the premise of burden-sharing.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of stillness and continuity is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed repetition of keywords ("pulse," "echo") rather than emergent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=2.7)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed telling ("quiet construction of truth," "shared narrative") rather than emerging from dramatic action. The story lectures the reader on the power of storytelling instead of trusting the narrative to demonstrate it.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial assertions ("She understood that safeguarding space...") rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.0)
    The text explicitly explains its own symbolism ("The link was more than a relic; it represented the tension..."), robbing the reader of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing lectures ("Incidental heroism is often born from moments like this") rather than subtext or action. The protagonist's "duty" and "heroism" are asserted by the narrator rather than earned through the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit, lecture-like assertions ("true craft was not wood but the art of listening") rather than subtext. The story repeatedly explains its own meaning to the reader, violating the "show, don't tell" principle regarding thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of reconciling science and art is coherent and consistent throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("reminding every listener that longing, when shared...") rather than emerging from subtext. The narrative voice explains the meaning of the symbols ("cipher of longing," "metaphor") instead of allowing the reader to interpret them.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing rather than subtext, culminating in a literal "equation" of letting go that flattens the narrative into a sermon. The text tells the reader exactly what to feel and think, violating the principle of earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("the unspoken need was to be felt, not just parsed") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The ending reduces the narrative to a fable with a tidy lesson ("even silent code craves song"), preventing genuine resonance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue and narration ("We are no longer strangers," "reminding everyone that together they could create sanctuary") rather than emerging from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.0)

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed telling ("controlling influence," "resistance") and an explicit moralizing summary at the end. The final image of the tunnel thanking the narrator is sentimental and reduces the complex premise of systemic neglect to a tidy, magical resolution.

    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing, particularly when the Keeper explains the lesson to the villagers in a summary statement. This reliance on a "Thematic Echo" to articulate the thesis undercuts subtext and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and platitudes ("We will transmute pain into a masterpiece," "Hope, like light...") rather than emerging from dramatized experience. The story asserts emotional resonance through labels instead of earning it through subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial statements ("pattern of growth was not merely lexical but a living pulse") rather than emerging organically from the action. The "realization" feels unearned, presented as a lecture to the reader rather than a discovery made through the character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=4.7)
    Thematic explication is heavy-handed ("reminding him that forgetting was as inevitable as the tide"), explaining the symbolism to the reader rather than allowing resonance to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme is delivered through abstract "telling" and repeated philosophical assertions ("yearning to break free," "some forces endure") rather than emerging organically from dramatic action. The result feels more like a parable than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("endings are not loss but transformation") rather than emerging from the subtext of events. The narrative tells the reader exactly how to interpret the moment, resulting in a didactic and sentimental tone.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme of "cycles" and "closing loops" is delivered through explicit exposition and summary rather than subtext or image. The ending relies on a "realization" that tells the reader exactly what to think ("Lira understood that...") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from the action. The result is a tidy, moralizing conclusion devoid of resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("Mistakes are not failures..."), which flattens resonance into a sermon. The "constellations" motif is repeated frequently rather than allowed to emerge organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Thus she taught the world...") rather than emerging from dramatic conflict. The ending reduces the narrative to a didactic fable about peace and light, lacking the complexity or ambiguity required for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is hammered home through the relentless repetition of the prompt phrase "honeyed hush" (used 5+ times) and explicit statements about "grafting new meaning." Subtext is absent, replaced by overt moralizing that resolves complex grief with a simple magical fix.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies on didactic meta-commentary, explicitly stating its themes ("ultimate story would be a mosaic... against the current") rather than allowing them to emerge from subtext. The narrative feels like a solipsistic exercise in writing about writing, offering no insight beyond the text's own assertions. The "hope" vs. "doubt" dynamic is handled through broad abstractions rather than specific, resonant particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.0)
    Theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("realized that the remedy was... memory") and a summary epilogue rather than subtext or action. The resolution offers a tidy, simplified lesson that lacks the complexity or resonance expected in literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=3.4)
    The story relies heavily on "Thematic Echo," explicitly stating its themes ("translating heartbeats into maps was not a task but a covenant") rather than dramatizing them. The result is a sermonizing tone that tells the reader what to feel ("patient reverence") instead of evoking it through subtext and action.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative relies on heavy-handed explication of its theme, directly telling the reader the moral ("a lesson in listening to the periphery," "cellar of reason"). This didactic approach replaces organic subtext with labeled assertions, flattening potential resonance into a lecture. The concept of "wonder" is asserted rather than evoked through the specific particularities of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of transmuting pain into beauty is coherent but delivered through assertion and successful magic rather than dramatized struggle. The ending relies on a summarized "moral" ("burdens were no longer shackles") rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explication ("reminding her that utility can coexist with reverence," "loss can be a tool, not a trap"). Instead of allowing resonance to emerge from the action, the narrative sermons the reader with the moral. The emotional conclusion is asserted via summary rather than earned through the character's specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is heavily explicated rather than allowed to resonate through subtext. Phrases like "stitching them together like a quilt of regrets" and the final dialogue ("I will carry these stories forward...") deliver the moral directly to the reader. This explicit summarizing of the emotional arc flattens the potential for genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures ("equations... for the very sentiment") rather than subtext or action. The ending relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the prose summarizes the moral ("infinite nature of engineering and hope") instead of allowing it to emerge from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story explicitly tells the reader what to feel ("beacon for any soul," "time could heal") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action. The ending relies on sentimental moralizing that feels tacked on, reducing the theme of memory and time to a simple, tidy platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.2)
    Theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("hindsight clarity was not merely a recollection") and heavy-handed metaphors. The story asserts its meaning through internal monologue rather than allowing subtext to emerge organically from action.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial sermonizing ("He understood that preserving... required... willingness to listen eternally") rather than emerging from dramatized action. The text relies on abstract assertions of wisdom rather than subtext, leaving no room for reader interpretation. The "lesson" feels imposed and circular, validating the character's initial state without testing it.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.0)
    Theme is asserted through repetitive labels ("geography of healing") rather than dramatized through subtext or action. The story explicitly tells the reader how to interpret the events, leaving no room for resonance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and summary in the final paragraph ("testament to hope," "beauty could be forged"), which triggers the penalty for sermonizing. The narrative relies on telling the reader the lesson rather than allowing it to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial sermonizing ("reminding Mira that compassion is a tide," "scars can sing"). The story relies on "Thematic Echoes" where the narration explains the moral significance of every action, leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("belief could be forged," "skeptic can become a keeper") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending offers a sentimental summary that explains the meaning instead of letting the subtext resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("she understood that light could travel without fire...") rather than dramatized experience. The ending relies on a summary of the lesson learned rather than a resonant image that leaves space for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly preached by the mentor and the narrator ("not a jagged scar but a flowing tapestry"), precluding subtext. The resolution offers a sentimental moral rather than a resonant, complex truth derived from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("chorus of countless souls who dared to mend the world") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The concept of "incremental absolution" is stated repeatedly but not tested; the story acts as a delivery vehicle for a moral lesson rather than an exploration of it. The ending summarizes the meaning instead of allowing it to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.3)
    The story relies on "Thematic Echo," explicitly stating its thesis ("not a weapon but a seed") in the final paragraph. Subtext is replaced by sermonizing assertions about intention.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("true mastery lay in embracing what one does not know") rather than emergent subtext. The ending summarizes the lesson in an abstract way, flattening the potential for resonance. The story creates a "Thematic Echo" where the narrative voice simply states the thesis instead of allowing the reader to infer it from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("the city learned that even dust... could become a storyteller"). The concept of "story famine" is resolved too neatly, and the repetition of the prompt phrase "teach dust to tell stories" replaces organic thematic development with assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("true safety lives inside the brave act of feeling") rather than emerging organically. This "sermonizing ending" flattens resonance by summarizing the intended meaning in a slogan, violating the show-don't-tell principle of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("teach the world that competing narratives can coexist") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending reduces the narrative to a sermon, lacking subtextual nuance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing statements ("art could survive even as the world tried to erase it") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story explains its meaning to the reader instead of allowing the narrative events to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme of pruning memories to foster hope is stated explicitly in dialogue and narration, leaving little room for reader interpretation. The ending leans into sermonizing ("proof that even in ruins..."), summarizing the moral lesson rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the action and consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered didactically, with the drone literally spelling out the message ("Echo") and Mara explaining the moral to passersby. This violates the "show, don't preach" principle, resulting in a sermonizing ending rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.2)
    Theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and summary in the final paragraph ("I understand that..."), treating the reader to a sermon rather than a dramatically earned insight. The result is a tidy, simplistic lesson rather than resonant complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme ("nuance vs. certainty") is delivered through explicit, repetitive moralizing rather than subtext or dramatization. Phrases like "nuance was not a flaw but a bridge" reduce the narrative to a lecture rather than an explored experience.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial explanation ("Aric realized that the texture he sought was not...") rather than emerging organically from action and subtext. The narrative lectures on the value of imperfection and "missed chances," leaving little room for reader interpretation or emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial assertions ("proving that a quiet act of kindness...") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story leans heavily on moralizing explanation, leaving little room for ambiguity or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("true rescue lay not in..."), reducing the narrative to a sermon. Emotional resonance is asserted by the narrator rather than earned through the subtext of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("ingenuity can reverse even the most stubborn puzzles"). The story lacks subtext, relying on direct authorial statements to convey meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated through the "dream dictionary" notes ("Fear is a candle..."), rendering it a lecture rather than an earned subtext. The concept of "unbosoming fear" remains a vague abstraction that doesn't deepen the narrative beyond the surface-level plot.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("His motivation was simple yet profound") rather than dramatized subtext. The central concept acts as a manual for the magic rather than a thematic exploration of struggle or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=4.5)
    The ending falls into the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, explicitly stating the moral ("the true lost expedition was not... but the city’s own willingness to listen"). This summarizes the meaning instead of allowing it to resonate from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed repetition of phrases like "noble lies" and "pit of lies" rather than subtext. The story lectures the reader on its moral conclusion instead of allowing meaning to emerge from dramatized events.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and repeated phrases ("interlaced absence," "archeologist of abandoned dreams") rather than subtext. The story tells the reader exactly what to feel about memory and loss instead of allowing it to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("truth outshone fear") and repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("reclaimed stillness") rather than subtext or action. The resolution offers a simplistic, distinct moral that flattens complexity and lacks resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but heavily explicated; the narrative relies on summarizing the meaning for the reader (&quot;symphony that both comforts and condemns,&quot; &quot;paradoxical peace&quot;) rather than letting it emerge from the action. This &quot;Thematic Echo&quot; at the closure flattens the resonance by telling the reader exactly how to interpret the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("realized the unused potential was not a place but a state of being"), flattening resonance into a moral summary. This overt "Thematic Echo" replaces dramatic subtext with a lecture on the prompt's concept.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through didactic exposition and explicit moralizing ("belonging is a frequency that can be tuned") rather than emerging from dramatic action. The ending relies on a sermonizing summary that violates the penalty against articulating the story's thesis in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly spelled out in the dialogue of the driftwood ("weight of a withheld truth is heavier than any crown"), reducing subtext to a fortune-cookie moral. The resolution ties up the thematic thread too neatly, leaving no room for ambiguity or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed aphorisms ("Forgiveness is not a gift but a bridge") and explicit notes ("Mistakes remembered, lessons kept"). The story tells the reader what to feel instead of allowing resonance to emerge from the action. The moralizing ending flattens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=3.3)
    Themes are stated explicitly in the narration ("regrets as lessons rather than shackles") and prompt echoes rather than emerging from subtext or action. The resolution offers a tidy moral summary that flattens the complexity of the "betrayal" into a simple lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=2.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed sermonizing. The mirror explicitly articulates the moral ("Empathy is a seed; plant it..."), and the narrator states their thematic goal directly. Subtext is replaced by overt didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme of cosmic reunion is coherent but undermined by the jarring inclusion of the "fortune from cookie" element, which breaks the high-fantasy tone. The resolution feels sentimental ("cosmic intimacy") rather than earned through the gritty particulars of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.7)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit "telling" of the emotional import ("believing the syllables could stitch... heal the world") and a sentimental resolution. The concept of "cloudbound repentance" is explained through exposition rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action or the cost of the character's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("shadow work was not merely a repair; it was an unveiling") rather than emerging organically from the narrative action. This over-articulation explains the subtext to the reader, reducing potential resonance to a stated summary.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explication and moralizing summaries ("transformation was not a single event but a texture woven through every breath"). The story tells the reader exactly what to think rather than allowing meaning to emerge from subtext or action. The "prophecy" device reduces the thematic arc to a simple transaction where the character is told she is special.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed narration ("revolution of light without flame") rather than subtext or action. The resolution, which implies a technologically induced consensus, undercuts the concept of a genuine revolution of ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and summary rather than subtext ("order could be forged from chaos," "living map for eternity"). The ending relies on a fable-like projection of the future to assert significance, rather than letting the scene's imagery carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and sentimental assertions ("beauty within each scar," "guide generations toward compassion") rather than subtext or action. The narrative shouts its lesson, leaving no room for reader interpretation or genuine resonance. The ending reduces the complexity of trauma to a simple, magical cure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated multiple times ("turn questions into destinations") rather than emerging organically from the action. The final paragraph devolves into a sermonizing summary of the lesson learned, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty for explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is explicitly stated in moralizing summaries ("reminded them why they rebuilt: to forge beauty from anarchy") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The story relies on sentimental assertion rather than complex, particularized experience, resulting in a fable-like flatness.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story aims for profundity regarding art and time but lands on pseudo-profound assertions ("a pact with destiny"). The theme is told to the reader through the narrator's interpretation rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of preserving collective memory is coherent but delivered through explicit statements and prompts ("ideas instead of sugar") rather than emergent subtext. The resolution offers a tidy, affirmative answer to the thematic question, lacking the complexity or ambiguity required for higher resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and aphorisms ("the color of unspoken apologies was not a pigment but a feeling"). The story relies on "Thematic Echo" in the final paragraph, summarizing its own lesson rather than allowing meaning to emerge from subtext or action.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the accretion of small alterations; the whisper line is the only overt thesis, but it is grounded in the prior dust/crack imagery, so the −0.4 Echo penalty is mild. The refusal of triumph in favor of “relief” lends honest humility.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from iterated scorch-and-ice imagery: creation born of damage, purpose found in pauses.

The lattice of unspoken stories reweights the familiar “stored love” trope into visual, material terms. Final image—viaduct blossoms glowing with reclaimed compassion—offers a quiet conceptual repricing rather than a stated thesis. Minor deduction for the “pilgrim of sparks” epithet that nudges toward thematic label.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges as the tactile fragility of time; fading photographs and dissolving pigments carry it without sermon. The final scent-of-memory image offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Some symbolic layering (halo fragment, hyperbolic geometry) remains ornamental, preventing the leap to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: illumination as ephemeral memory-theft becomes illumination as communal memory-keeping. The lantern’s final flame is a non-literal answer that reweights every prior stolen sunset. Subtext resides in gesture—handing a rose is also handing over ethical custody. Minor deduction for the final whispered promise verging on overt thesis, but it remains a private vow, not reader sermon.</question>

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as renewable memory-medium, not moral. The final line “silence births renewal” is the唯一的抽象语句，但其代价已由“thoughts dissolve like ink in water”在前文具身化，故未落入说教。母题未用象征打卡，而是通过感官层递的静强度重新赋义，留下可与之争辩的暧昧：见证是否为另一种介入？

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ordinary magic emerges organically via curl, harp, and communal hush; the refrain “magic does not need grand gestures” is stated late, blunting subtext. Still, theme lingers through final image of midwife gifting curls—earned reconfiguration without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    The “open secret” motif emerges organically from fortune-cookie form, and the final reconfiguration—private lives now publicly re-codable—carries understated ethical weight. Theme avoids moral slogans, instead crystallizing in the gull’s cry that “rewires” strangers. The paradox of accidental prophecy is named but not explored in contradiction, keeping ambiguity intact yet slightly under-complicated.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges—“perception can be rewired by focused attention and repetition”—through the indigo motif and echo spiral rather than statement. The final image reframes the earlier “muffled clarity” as civic renewal, a resonant reconfiguration. No moralizing sentence intrudes. The concept of “unraveled stillness” stays abstract; a more grounded social example earlier would have lifted the score further.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: the cost of turning private longing into public music. No moralizing; final fortune is image-based baton/score metaphor. Motif of mirrored horizon reweights from illusion to instrument without abstract statement. Childhood memory reframed as musical notation feels earned through shell spiral, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of embracing all fractured selves emerges imagistically rather than through dramatized self-confrontations; no single echo-self is given weight. Subtext operates in mirrored light/water imagery, but refrain risks self-paraphrase (“darkening brightness” ×3).

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges—integrity grown in isolation—through images, not slogans: the lone cat, sealed tube, and promised chronicles. Subtext of recording versus transmission (storm notes vs pigeon) quietly reframes knowledge as living carrier, not archive.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from pattern-grooves: time is grainy filament that can be woven or surrendered, never possessed. Subtext in rope’s glow—history’s afterimage not owned but donated. Final image reweights premise without moralizing; reader left to feel the cost of preserved vs released memory. No thematic echo line; complexity maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through iterative image chain: ash → seed → echo → unfinished canvas; no explicit thesis. Final re-pricing—“unfinished was a canvas of endless light”—offers resonant non-literal answer. Subtext resides in silence as living medium rather than absence. Ambiguity is purposeful: decay becomes generative, no moral is stated.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: the commodification of empathy turns insight into narcotic illusion. The half-truth motif is lived—every scent is a partial, sellable lie—never lectured.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through motif accretion—misdelivered envelope, silent fishermen, locket photo—rather than overt thesis, avoiding final-paragraph moralizing. The reweighting is quiet: anonymous sailors’ stories move from unheard to publicly read, a conceptual repricing of communal memory. Ambiguity is present but thin; no counter-reading challenges the nobility of the gesture. Emotional after-effect is gentle rather than piercing because the protagonist’s personal stake remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of communal belonging emerges through the arbor’s refracted light and the weaving ritual, never sermonized. The interlocking-circles glyph migrates from graffiti to living leaf, a quiet conceptual repricing that invites reflection on how symbols grow with care. No tidy moral is stated; the final glow is an image, not a lesson. Ambiguity lingers: the unseen artist may still be watching, the ache may return, so the reader is left to tend the web.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: time as sculptable medium, echo as identity. Motif of interrupted cadence migrates from rumor to city heartbeat to Mira’s own pulse, reweighted when she becomes the echo.

Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the eternal obligation she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges cleanly: ambiguous loss reframed as generative equation. No explicit moralizing; the final petal image reweights prior sorrow without commentary. Recurrent motifs—glass eyes, cracks, droplets—accumulate rather than decorate, culminating in the numeric glow that re-prices grief. Complexity is acknowledged yet stays somewhat tidy; a counter-argument or residue of unresolved pain would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of quiet custodial visibility emerges through the tape’s glow rather than exposition; the final image invites reflection on who gets to be seen caring for collective memory. Subtext operates in gesture—her stepping forward is both self-reveal and offering—avoiding moral summary. The concept of grief-as-archive is implicit, not labeled, giving the piece modest resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges as “sustainable growth demands relinquished control,” enacted through coil, storms, and leaf instead of lecturing. Copper coil and reluctant greening recur with shifting valence—first intervention, then conduit, finally relic of learned humility. Final image of greenhouse mist reprises rain-on-trellis but reconfigures scale (nursery → world), supplying non-literal answer. Avoids sermon; only the mentor line flirts with articulation yet stays inside dramatized memory.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the image-exchange: art as the island’s memory, rain as pigment. The closing ribbon-of-rain image reweights earlier grief without moralizing. One tiny echo of prompt language (“thresh meaning”) is tucked mid-story, not deployed as final thesis, so resonance stays intact. Ambiguity—will the mist truly heal?—lingers credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—unseen forces can magnify wonder—emerges imagistically, not stated. Reprising “bright darkness” offers quiet CR that reweights fear into promise. Yet insight is generalized; ambiguity feels safe rather than troubling. Subtext relies on lyrical echo instead of contradictory gesture; no counter-readings complicate the wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges as the impossibility of single-authored history; the sea’s silence is granted equal page-space with shanties and logs. Subtext lives in gesture—placing a child’s sun-drawing inside a military herald’s valve reweights glory as innocence without commentary. Final image’s “map that no single voice could have sketched” offers resonant, non-literal answer: meaning is collaborative or it drowns. Ambiguity lingers—who keeps the valve tomorrow?—yet avoids sermon, landing just under the 9-band where a fiercer moral risk would live.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of cartographing silence emerges through concrete recursion: surface cracks → ledger lines → star maps. Final promise to “paint every silent song” reconfigures the city itself as co-author, avoiding explicit moral and letting image carry resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the tile’s migration patterns and whale arcs: memory is migratory, never identical, yet repeatable as felt architecture. Subtext resides in silence—the unheard symphony—rather than exposition. The final image reweights skepticism from adversary to bridge, avoiding moralizing. Only a faint echo of “sculpt space for reflection” in closing whisper risks thematic echo, but it is absorbed into sensory image, not statement.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: goodbye as dimensional fold, not termination. Subtext resides in magnetic dust and mirrored older self, avoiding explicit moral. Final reweighting is elegant, but the lyric overlay (“something persisted beyond it”) flirts with abstraction. Still, ambiguity feels earned, not asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of equity-as-alchemy emerges through ink-image, equation-circle, and final bureaucratic exhalation—never stated. Subtext lives in objects: lilies (death) vs glowing ink (vitality) reweights “deathly vitality” from tone to philosophy. Final image reconfigures asylum from legal shield to living covenant—Conceptual Repricing with social cost undeniable. No sermon, tidy moral, or prompt-echo lines.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges obliquely: invented histories as compassionate falsities that keep communal memory alive. Subtext resides in tactile metaphors—pressed petals, refracted lanterns—rather than assertion. Final image of labyrinth inhaling hum reweights premise: stories are bridges, not lies. avoids moralizing; resonance lingers in the reader’s re-evaluation of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges via the accumulation of ghost-stories: erasure is systemic, but memory can be smuggled back through layered whispers. No explicit thesis; the final image of the narrator as “living archive” reweights the opening death-certificate void. Subtext resides in the label’s sepia filter—history is a tint you can choose to see. Ambiguity lingers: will the port truly remember, or is the archive only skin-deep? Complex, unsentimental, and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through acoustic recursion: myths survive because art re-sounds them. Subtext resides in the shell-to-cello transduction rather than exposition. Final image—melody drifting over cliff—repackages the thesis as sensory aftereffect, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: she still walks toward sunrise, new riddles inbound.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—community self-mapping versus corporate seizure—emerges through cartographic imagery rather than slogan. Phoenix mural reprises fish/gear graffiti vocabulary, giving closure a visual rather than moral answer. Subtextual silence on Mira’s future loyalties invites reader projection, avoiding thesis sentence. Dock-worker whisper heritage stays abstract; specificity of artisan quarter recovery keeps theme grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges as the paradox of archival permanence achieved through inevitable loss: the photograph preserves what it dooms by exposing it to light. No character ever utters a thesis; the idea is woven through the darkening film strip, the rover-forgotten cavity, the colony expansion. The final whispered blessing is a gesture, not a moral, leaving a resonant aftertaste of noble futility. Complexity is honored—the universe “receives the offering” yet remains indifferent—so the piece avoids pat conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of invisible craftsmanship as surrogate sight emerges through refracted light patterns and the drone’s eventual departure; no explicit thesis stated. Final prismatic droplets non-literally answer the implicit question—what is a maker’s vision worth?—by showing it shipped outward while she remains, a resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges from recurrence of birth images—ice → water, silence → signal—without moralizing. The final image of the lake singing while the world listens reweights the premise: maps are momentary, rivers remake themselves. Ambiguity lingers: is the broadcast salvation or mere witness? That counter-reading is invited, not resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: balance as audible covenant between human rhythm and stone. Subtext lives in gesture—the fork’s hum replaces spoken contract—and final image of shoppers unconsciously guarding that balance avoids moralizing. The concept stays implicit; no character articulates a thesis, so the reader completes the metaphor. Return of the fork’s resonance in market breeze reweights earlier material, achieving quiet resonance without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.2)
    Theme—perfume as bottled eternity—announced repeatedly in exposition rather than emerging from events. Subtext drowned by overt thesis lines: “harness the ephemeral,” “scent of eternity,” “bridge worlds.” Final paragraph moralizes the message, replacing image with sermon. No counter-readings or ambiguity offered; sentimentality untempered.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges—every warning is a thread, not a wall—through image, not assertion; final hush reweights earlier false alarms. No moralizing line, no echo of prompt language. The lattice-as-confessional motif shifts from protection to transmission, giving conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: debt as living compost, love as toxin that feeds new growth. The returning “mournful elation” reweights from dirge to triumph in the final image, a non-literal answer that trusts the reader. No moralizing, no allegory—just the bead’s pulse insisting remembrance is the price of beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of renewal through outlaw art emerges organically via stitched light overtaking cracked stone; no thesis is stated. Subtext of precedents breaking under soft insistence is embodied in the guildmasters’ silent kneel. Ambiguity lingers: will the tide ever return? Final sunrise-on-plate image reweights earlier emptiness with quiet awe, satisfying the non-literal answer test.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without statement: diaspora return as reversal of entropy, time measured not in hours but in remembered bones. Subtext lives in gesture—roots recoiling equal ancestors accepting her hand. Final image of sunrise bands across the threshold offers Conceptual Repricing: the tomb becomes threshold, faith becomes porous to the living. Avoids explicit moral; slight ding for the voiced “thank you” which over-articulates what the image already conveys.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: marginalia as luminous future-fossil. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing. No motif is forced; chalk, clipboard, and drone recur naturally. Avoids echoed prompt language, though “futuristic nostalgia” is named once mid-text.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: suppressed voices → star-silk → courier receipt. Final ash image reweights the candle’s earlier “eternal” promise into spent sacrifice. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers—will the map arrive in time? Subtext lives in gesture (whisper to flame, smile at dawn). Lacks the extra frisson that would push to 9.0 but sustains complexity without tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from repeated images—coral, mist, ink—shifting from fragility to porous strength without explicit statement. Subtext lives in gesture: the droplet sealed onto plaster is the non-literal answer that grafts memory onto resilience. No moralizing; the ache remains ambivalent. The final image reweights the premise, achieving Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme—art as communal memory—emerges through the luminous mural and the shared laughter, but the text can’t resist spelling it out: “the true power…was not merely to illuminate walls, but to illuminate hearts.” That final-sentence sermon clips subtext. The fresco fragment’s dissolution offers a conceptual reprice, yet the absence of felt cost keeps the resonance polite rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    The notion that art restoration can be re-painted with curiosity emerges organically from the nickel-refracted murals; no explicit thesis is stated. The final etched coin image offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. A half-point deduction because the theme is single-strand—there is no competing value to complicate the moral calculus—so the resonance, while clean, is not yet complex.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: art as living coral that turns injury into ecosystem. The refrain of reef-shadow joy evolves from decoration to treaty without overt moralizing. Subtext whispers through sensory return: salt, glow, echo, pollen—each re-weighted across centuries. The final image of a child continuing the song offers quiet conceptual repricing: art outlives artist, but the piece avoids pat closure by keeping the poet’s personal cost oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of memory’s cyclical fragility emerges through repeated light-and-echo imagery rather than statement. Final image of “choir of resurrected echoes” reweights earlier ritual as communal, not solitary. Avoids explicit moral; ambiguity remains whether preservation equals restoration. Some abstraction—“museum of extinct feelings”—skirts sentimentality but stays evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from pattern, not sermon: encrypted compassion is first amber residue, then living algorithm, then civic covenant. Final image—“each drop a word”—reweights the premise without moralizing. The tremor between progress and preservation remains unresolved yet newly speakable, achieving resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of layered renewal—moss over stone—emerges through recurrence of trails, dust, and songs rather than exposition. Subtext resides in gesture: tying a shard to a bird’s leg is both memorial and release. The final image (map glowing on the wall) answers the thematic question implicitly: memory travels best when launched, not locked. Avoids sermon; ambiguity lingers—will the humming fade completely?

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: sacredness resides not in doors but in the pause where distance becomes memory, re-priced when child turns back to share the fractured hush. No moral is stated; instead, scent of corn husk and silent mirrors sing the reconfiguration. Recurring “necessary distances” shifts from spatial to spiritual measure, charged in final silhouette fractured into thousand mirrors. Counter-readings linger: is guardianship liberation or new entrapment? Complexity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of belonging emerges through mirrored constellations (desert/sea) and the final image of sky-maps carried ashore. Subtext remains soft; no competing value complicates the longing. The resonance is pleasing but single-note, lacking the friction needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—memory’s fragility and the emotional labor required to keep stories visible—emerges through the seed-to-color transliteration engine rather than exposition. The rose-colored sigh at closure reconfigures the opening “cheerful gloom” into earned melancholy, inviting reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges obliquely: pattern versus erasure, art as controlled ephemera. Subtext lives in gesture—bishop tilts, ink bloom, swept-clean boards—never in thesis statements; the final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. The emotional aftereffect is wistful exhilaration, earned through sensory particulars rather than assertion. Complexity is honored: no tidy moral, only the quiet dare to keep serenading monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of chosen solitude as creative conduit emerges imagistically rather than by assertion; no moralizing line spoils the effect. Recurrent tide/ink imagery reweights exile from wound to womb, achieving quiet resonance. Ambiguity remains—readers may question whether art justifies isolation—but the piece invites rather than answers. No motif feels grafted; each return is incremental.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: value is not intrinsic but refracted through attentive seeing. The final image of “jeweled crowns” reconfigures prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—harbor ledger “balances” hints at unspoken losses—yet the insight remains contemplative rather than urgent, keeping it just below the 8.5 tier.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: history is a shared acoustic dream that must be listened into, not owned. The negative’s reprise from ash to lantern reconfigures legacy from burden to communion without moralizing. No character articulates the thesis; the final “warm ash” image lets the reader feel the shift. Ambiguity remains—scholars’ tokens may dilute or enrich the dream—inviting reflection beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of possibility-versus-reflection emerges through mirrored imagery and children’s lullabies, but the story ends by stating the thesis outright (“possibilities are merely reflections waiting for a borrowed heartbeat”). The reprise is pretty yet didactic, blunting subtext; resonance is more ornamental than reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without thesis: redemption priced not in coin but in communal listening, enacted when cricket song and clank of armor coexist. The ebony sheet’s transformation from bureaucratic prop to covenant mirror reweights “flawed beauty” from decorative phrase to lived paradox. Final image of broken-yet-whole dawn avoids moralizing; resonance arises from particular swords touching particular stone. Only lacks a sharper earlier irony to complicate the gentleness ideal.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: engineered annihilation can coincidentally birth immortal memory—no authorial thesis stated. Subtext resides in the salt flat’s double role: graveyard and transmitter. Final image of “broken glass that somehow felt whole” reweights prior cruelty into uneasy grace. No final-paragraph moralizing; tear tastes of sand, not sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from concrete sensory oppositions: chastity vs. courtesan, silence vs. chorus, snow vs. light—never abstractly sermonized. The alarming serenity motif modulates from eerie calm to insurgent hymn without losing coherence, re-weighted in the last line. No tidy moral is imposed; the reader is left holding the prism of possible readings, satisfying complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the mirrored reversal motif rather than didactic statement; the final image reweights “ethical storytelling” from slogan to embodied possibility. Ambiguity is purposeful—audience autonomy is promised, not proved—creating lingering reflection. The puppet-show concept is stated, not dramatized, so theme leans abstract; still, the dome’s silence and reversed dishes feel earned. No final-paragraph sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of invisible lineage emerges through gesture—moth wing, glowing knots—rather than statement; the silence that “speaks louder than any spoken word” offers a resonant, non-moral answer. Subtext resides in material humility: temporary reeds outshine stone monuments. Final image reweights earlier “blushing stillness” from mood to covenant. Avoids explicit thesis, though mid-paragraph aphorisms (“time seemed both frozen and flowing”) flirt with over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—memory as thaw—emerges through recurring melt imagery rather than statement. The final auroral applause is an image, not a moral. Yet the concept stays one-note: forgetting is cold, remembrance is warm; counter-readings are not invited. Subtext is thin because no character resists or misuses the names; the ethical dimension of resurrecting the dead is unraised. Still, the emotional after-effect is coherent and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: the collapse of human-made preservation directives and the rise of forest autonomy. No moral is stated; the final image of vines welcoming future travelers reweights the question of chosen paths. Subtext operates through the seal’s playful hum—nature enjoys its own sealing—avoiding overt thesis. One fresh inflection: the bunker’s decay is not tragedy but liberation, a reversal that feels earned by accumulated imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of scarcity into surplus: frugality becomes the very engine of cosmic access. Subtext lives in the tile’s hum and the market’s later quiet prosperity—no moral is stated. The final image of glyphs beside constellations reweights the premise without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: whose prayers are answered, and at what unseen tariff?

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through the repeating image of the reappearing pin: memory as physical, peace as infection. No moral is stated; the final image of the wanderer’s anger dissolving into stone reconfigures the premise with quiet conceptual cost. Subtext resides in touch and silence rather than exposition; ambiguity lingers about whether the change is permanent, inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of boundary-erasure emerges from action: inhaling fog dissolves the line between self and orchard, mirror and sky. Final image—“erasing the space between”—is earned through the breathing ordeals, not moralizing. Subtext whispers that hope needs containment yet remains wild; ambiguity lingers in the scent of never-tasted apples. No thesis statement; resonance grows from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: persistence as natural cycle, not moral. The deciduous vow image re-weights at closure, answering the generational-wisdom question without sermon. Subtext sits in gesture—tightening the ribbon equals tightening covenant. One soft echo: “accidental wisdom” is named in last line, a mild thematic echo (−0.2) but still fused to image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges as the surrender of linearity for networked time; the constellation map is the non-literal answer that reweights earlier pollen and shell motifs without moralizing. Subtext resides in mirror-whisper and pollen settling—inheritance as luminous debris—keeping the insight embedded in image. The refrain “simply complicated” risks thematic echo, but it is folded into voice rather than final assertion, so the penalty is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges cleanly: knowledge is completed only when silence is heard. Subtext stays implicit—no character spells out the moral. The unheard symphony motif accrues meaning, ending as the score the scrolls teach. However, the concept’s weight is more cerebral than emotional; the reader appreciates rather than aches.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of reclamation-through-story emerges via mosaic of ink, mirrors, and petal-portals; no authorial thesis stated. Final image of lantern-fleet implies custodian eternity without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is she savior or condemned cataloguer? Complexity maintained, but earlier abstract “trapped freedom” phrase is a light echo-hit (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    The “fables of absence” theme emerges from the rope-whispered stories and the vanishing door, resisting explicit moralizing. The final image of absence as “bridge” reweights earlier material, but the insight is delivered in the penultimate paragraph rather than compressed into the last line, muting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges without statement: quiet is not absence but calibrated balance between echo and silence, shown when ice fissures melt into dripping silence. The stone’s glow and the beings’ dimming reweight the idea at the end, offering a Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing, no “lesson”—just the final image of gold-veined charts pulsing with heartbeat. Slight abstraction in “bloom of hush” keeps it from top band.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of meaning-through-fragility emerges organically from prism > shard > rekindled network; refrain from moralizing until penultimate clause (“proving that even the smallest coincidence can kindle a future”), a minor echo that still lets image do final lift. Subtext relies on silence/hush paradox rather than interpersonal tension, acceptable for lyric mode but limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—collective memory as light-geometry—emerges organically from the archivist’s measurements and the crystal’s tonal map, avoiding explicit thesis. The sunrise silence that leaves “shadows…quiet testament” offers a non-literal reweighting: knowledge now inscribed, future readers compelled to repeat the ritual. Pre-emptive nostalgia threads through but never crystallizes into a moral; the piece trusts image over assertion. Minor drift: “identity sculpted from experience” is stated twice; the second near-summary dulls subtext by −0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges via image pattern: fire as movable mosaic tile reweights the ancient belief that color can speak. No moralizing—final image is silent glow on stone. Ambiguity lingers: is the light hopeful or merely decorative? Serious playfulness stays intact, resisting tidy uplift. Subtext carried by scent and echo, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely: transitions are liminal mirrors where reflection, not force, dissolves deadlock. The tide proverb and cicada trill echo without sermon, letting silence and shimmer carry meaning. Subtext is strongest in the leaders’ eye-flicker, wordless surrender. Final image of “sea ever ebbing, ever returning” offers resonant non-literal answer, but a hairline slide toward abstraction keeps it just shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: the vastness of experience is compressible into the smallest vessel if attention is disciplined. Subtext operates through image rather than assertion—doll as portable cosmos, trellis as externalized lung. Final image reweights prior claustrophobia without moralizing. No motif checklist abuse; “gilded hush” recurs only when it crystallizes choice. Complexity acknowledged: the silence flavors remain fugitive, resisting ownership; Lio gains wonder but not escape, embracing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges obliquely: silence as learnable solace, not moral lesson. Recurrent “vaulting hush” reweights from ambience to inner cargo at closure, avoiding sermon. No character articulates thesis in prompt language; final line invites, not declares. Ambiguity lingers—peace is portable yet unmeasured—yielding honest after-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without sermon: breath as gift and burden, scars as living circuitry, isolation as the price of connection—each image carries conceptual cost. The final image of the threshold-be-bridge reweights every earlier burnt span, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtext breathes in silence—the sanctuary’s loaded quiet is the lesson—avoiding explanatory gloss. No thematic echo or moralizing paragraph; complexity stays intact because the keeper’s victory is also his erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of alchemizing coercion into creation grows organically through the bolt’s biography and the glowing ledger; no moral is stated. The final image—travelers bartering concepts—opens a resonant societal mirror without sermon. Ambiguity lingers: diamonds vanish if “pressure” ceases, so value stays conditional, not redeemed. Subtext is carried mainly by objects (bolt, ledger) rather than dialogue silence, but the after-effect is concrete and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—silence as truer eloquence—emerges through the gramophone’s paradoxical quiet and the council’s “silent betrayal,” avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the quiet crank beside the open scroll reconfigures meaning without statement, though the insight is more cerebral than emotionally searing.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of loyalty-as-song emerges through vapor bridges, phantom applause, and final murmured pact; no moralizing statement. Allegiance shifts from unseen audience to possibility itself, reweighted by bodily price. Ambiguity lingers: is the knight erased or amplified? Resonance arises from organic image pattern, not thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of archival resurrection emerges organically from dust, light, and silhouettes—never sermonized. Subtext operates through visual metaphor: the button’s polished center literalizes “small kindness” persisting inside tarnish. Final image reframes prior neglect as future beacon without moralizing. One soft spot: “Acts of Compassion” file label edges toward thesis-statement; slight dip for that.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through image chain: coins/ripples → forgotten footsteps → public memory reclaimed. No moralizing; final “coded ripple” reweights prior “scattered coins” without statement. Subtext in silence of citizens listening via “cracked radios” carries the emotional after-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges: art as preventive silence versus prophetic noise. Subtext lives in the choice to whisper rather than roar—an ethical renunciation of spectacle. Final image of the disappearing dewdrop reweights the premise: salvation is impermanent, requiring eternal return. No moralizing; resonance stays implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of remembrance-through-care emerges via living parchment metaphor; subtext whispers that human order must bow to forest syntax, but the final gratitude leaf verges on stating the thesis, trimming the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges as improvisation over perfectible order; the compass inscription is the only overt statement, arrived at through ordeal, so it lands as CR rather than lecture. Recurring images—broken clocks, swirling leaves, ash-smell—accumulate into a coherent meditation on uncertainty without moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: Mara will now sell clients “uncertainty as feature,” a resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers but is purposeful, not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from iterative equation-building rather than thesis: mercy = suffered / remembered. Subtext lives in strap’s metallurgical change—pewter → almost golden—implying transmutation without moralizing. Final image answers the thematic question by showing the cost of remembering rather than declaring it. Ambiguity remains: formula is personal, not universal, inviting reader algebra.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through image chain: light-as-memory, market-as-archive, wind-as-voice. No moral statement; final whispered promise lets reader carry the illumination. Subtext of translation-as-survival finances every micro-alignment. Minor drift toward abstraction in “time itself is a series of anchors” line, but resonance re-weights prior material without platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of acknowledgement versus erosio emerges implicitly through found ledger and ghost chorus. No moral is stated; resonance rests in the attic hatch left aglow. Subtext is carried by object gestures—mainspring heartbeat, dust footprints—rather than articulated insight. Complexity is modest but cleanly organic to the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges from mutability of perfection: fragile glass, negotiable reality, compressed time. No moral spoken; final lattice image reweights earlier “perfect system” as living illusion. Subtext operates through light refraction and ink shimmer rather than declaration. The Whisper’s song remains ambiguous—both lullaby and storm—inviting counter-readings without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of truth-tempered renewal emerges through rust-to-lattice imagery rather than authorial statement. The covenant’s wilting near dishonesty is asserted but never dramatized, so the thematic question stalls at abstraction. The final amber lattice re-weights prior rust imagery, offering quiet resonance, yet the absence of a tested lie leaves ambiguity toothless.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: explanatory hunger dissolves into sensory surrender—epiphany seeded in the first sentence’s “slow, breathing sigh.” The repeating “hinged awakenings” image reweights at closure when the water-stair literally hinges open, avoiding abstract sermon. Ambiguity is preserved: surrender is neither triumph nor failure, just a stance crystallized. No final-paragraph thesis statement; the storm on the horizon extends the question rather than answering it.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges implicitly: art as vessel for communal memory, wood as time’s archive. The lantern’s projected ropes and the final child-self image reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—lifting the slide, feeling the arch “breathe”—but insight never sharpens into contradiction or loss. The closing lullaby affirms continuity rather than complicating it, leaving resonance pleasant, not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: night blooming as communal promise reframes solitude into shared continuum. Subtext lives in glass layers—what looks opaque can transmit memory if aligned. Final image reweights “dawning hush” from silence to pledge, achieving conceptual repricing. One hedge: the word “promise” is uttered narratively near the end; though earned, it flirts with overt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—archives are not neutral; remembering is insurgent—emerges through image, never thesis. Shift from private notebook to sky-borne loudspeaker reweights “library” from repository to weapon. Subtext in Qadir’s silent fingertip trace: even illiterate sand can read resistance when inscribed with refuse. Final violet glow on brass offers resonant non-literary answer: history’s gloss is forged from obliterated voices, now mirrored back at the desert.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as civic resurrection tool versus amber stasis of false comfort. Subtext sits in the empty bottle—once sealed promise, now hollow echo—an image that reprices the premise without overt statement. The refusal to use “easy magic” is asserted, not tested, so moral complexity stays theoretical. Resonance lingers, but the absence of a lived consequence keeps the insight slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges via recursive agriculture imagery: time as cultivable soil, seeds as memory, frost as fallow field. Subtext operates in gesture—empty basin, translucent hand—never thesis. The closing plea “Teach me the feel…” invites reader to keep touching temporal fabric rather than delivering a moral. Returned-time cycle avoids tidy aphorism; ambiguity lingers in the cool cheek imprint that feels like sand, not salvation.</answer>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s perceptual filter: synesthetic cold-perfume, seed-coat shimmer. Syntax lengthens under calm, fragments under vortex swirl, matching emotional weather. Diction (“vortex inheritance,” “furiously tranquil”) coins without jarring; pattern is taught by repetition. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal register remains horticulturally precise yet mythic.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—listening over noise—emerges through bell timbre shift and solstice hush, never sermonized. Microclimate data and glue timer embody the concept in concrete particulars. Final image reweights earlier “clamor” without moralizing. Avoids explicit thesis, lets sensory payoff speak.

    Theme of flourishing stillness emerges from concrete pattern—silent station, lantern glow, cracked floor—never sermonized. Final image reweights silence as fertile ground, achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: fingertip arcs, ribbon curl. Ambiguity lingers—strength is quiet, not triumphant—avoiding tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of silence-as-preservation emerges imagistically; the final amber tear offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior color motifs. No moral is preached; meaning crystallizes through glass and ghost refraction. Subtext relies on echoing chromatic symbols rather than character contradiction, so complexity is aesthetic, not ethical. Still, the lyric accrual feels organic and avoids platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from the garage-sale cipher motif: memory hides in mundane detritus and is rewoven into shared time. The final image—sky stitched with silver-sand constellations—offers a conceptual repricing that makes the capsule’s damage feel inevitable, not moralized. No character articulates a thesis; the urn’s transformation from ash-holder to time-key carries the subtext. Ambiguity lingers about whose memories are whose, inviting re-reading without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from recursive image-chain: shattered mirror → stitched tapestry → woven dawn → solitary star; no moralizing sentence distills it. The incomplete as luminous rebellion is reconfigured in the final floating feather-star, delivering CR without abstraction. Subtext lives in silence: the lagoon’s hush is the world assenting to imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as “respect is reciprocal circuitry”; no overt thesis stated. The copper/wood/stone binding reconfigures human temporality, implying ecology can rewrite social law. Subtext lives in gesture—visitors’ palms pressed to oak—rather than exposition. Final whispered secret is image-driven, leaving aftertaste of sacred abiotic covenant rather than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: home as mutable pattern, not geography. Subtext lives in gesture—offering spent amber beats any moral statement. The final image reweights “bronze quiet” from atmosphere to shared human-alien cadence, achieving resonance without sermon. No tidy moral, no thematic echo penalty; complexity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: battlefield → garden via linguistic memory. The refrained “narrow vastness” reweights from spatial descriptor to existential paradox in the last line, achieving Conceptual Repricing. No moralizing; the silence after the dropped phrase lets the reader feel the cost of peace built on loss.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of reclamation through memory emerges wordlessly from the sequential unveiling of wars encoded in color; no character moralizes. The autumn leaf’s copper veins recycle the sky’s earlier amber glow, re-pricing both as living circuitry rather than dead ornament. Final promise to the wind offers Charged Poise: connection is possible only if someone consents to be haunted. Ambiguity lingers—will the voices drown him?—but complexity is embraced, not tidied.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges obliquely: navigation after cartographic erasure, the ethics of memory as constellation. Subtext resides in silence—grief unspoken, turbines now stilled—and the final map of “possibilities” offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Recurrence of sky-sketching and compass rose is organic, not symbolic graft; each return reframes loss as ongoing orientation. The piece avoids tidy profundity, leaving the reader with charged ambiguity: true north is internal, perpetual, and unreachable.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—memory as playable, theft as restoration—emerges through the chess-swap ritual rather than exposition. The pocket lid’s returning lullaby reweights the meaning of “thief” into archivist-bard. No moral is declared; the village children’s new dreams supply quiet resonance. Avoids tidy binaries between crime and gift.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: home as inhalable melody rather than map coordinate. Motif of “hidden thunder” migrates from book-pages to ribcage without authorial commentary, achieving resonance through image shift. No moralizing close; the final exhalation is an earned, ambiguous chord—reader invited to hear the silence that follows. Childhood courtyard functions as mythic fragment rather than sentimental trigger, keeping theme clear of nostalgia syrup.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of forgiveness-as-process emerges through chess metaphors and the unweaving ritual, avoiding explicit moral. The final image of the "woven hush" now singing implies redemption without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Forgiveness-as-debt emerges from bone-memory imagery and the spire’s cold shards, avoiding overt thesis. Final image—“We are the echo”—offers resonant non-literal answer, reweighting earlier refrains. A hairline slip into thematic echo-recitation in the wind-whisper line is cushioned by its choral dispersal.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically: brokenness as beauty via narrative repair. The kintsugi idea is stated, but the closing sunrise-sea image re-prices it without moralizing. Subtext resides in the statue’s liquid light—acceptance of scars. No tidy maxim; the concept lingers as perceptual after-image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of mirrors, shells, and painted light: art as a fragile vessel that traps flux. The final canvas pulsing like a “living reminder” offers Conceptual Repricing—eternity redefined as private, portable, unshared. No moralizing; the silence after the last brushstroke invites the reader to feel the cost of hoarded beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges without statement: tenderness as technology—soft intent can steer the world. The cork’s cracked face in dawn-light reprises the “pulse” motif, repricing whispers as seaworthy. No moralizing; the fisherman’s murmured gratitude is implication enough. Ambiguity lingers: did the garden scent truly amplify, or did Mara simply will coincidence into myth? Either reading is supported, giving thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through the glass-eye mirror conceit: shared vulnerability beats isolated guarding of pain. No explicit thesis until final sentence, and even there the phrasing is imagistic, not sermonic. Subtext operates in the smugglers’ sudden silence—greed confronted by its own reflection. The “fractured grace” tonality keeps sentimentality at bay; sorrow is acknowledged but not cured.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of memory-as-shelter emerges through tide-gaps → pressed petals → lamp-gold ribbons, never sermonized. Final image offers non-literal answer: remembrance is a living beam, not an archive. Ambiguity accepted—who was the stranger—without equivalence. No echoic thesis line; insight stays implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—maps as choosing, not chosen—emerges through the final image of endless horizons. Subtext whispers in the ants’ discipline and the chip’s brass teeth, but the story over-articulates in closing paragraphs (“the true map was not on paper”). Still, the concept reweights earlier motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of sovereignty vs. private haunting emerges imagistically; crown as key is lovely reconfiguration. No moralizing statement; ambiguity survives. Recurrent starlight motif reweights from curse to map, fulfilling organic emergence. Absence of societal fallout keeps resonance personal, not realm-wide, capping upper band.</question>
    <question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person lyric omniscient stays consistent; diction elevated but matching mythic register. Rhythm varies, uses fragment (“Follow,”) for beat acceleration. Metaphors occasionally layer three-deep (“silk ribbons stained with dark ink”) yet pattern is taught early and holds. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause inactive.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges via iterative glow imagery: light from ash, presence from ephemera. Final whispered line reweights premise without moralizing. Subtext stays poetic but safe; no genuine moral ambiguity or loss complicates the uplift. Resonant but lacks bite.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through the scroll’s mutations rather than editorial comment: inscription turns to wing, archive turns to flight, burying turns to birthing. The nostalgic ache stays credibly ambivalent—smile and heart-ache simultaneous—so the piece avoids moralizing. Final reprise of “jaded wonder” crystallizes the tonal paradox without spelling a thesis, inviting reflective after-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: scentless touch can still midwife wonder. The final image of the clamp “humming” reweights every prior tactile beat, yet the piece drifts toward explicit thesis (“ordinary miracles”) in the closing whispers, slightly diluting resonance. Still, the particulars of fog, gear-oil, and newborn cries keep the insight anchored in lived detail.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through concrete recurrence: breath, crystal, feather, tea all reconfigure from wound to witness. Final image—“luminous verses ready to be read”—offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing; ambiguity lingers about who will read them.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of “imperfect miracles” emerges concretely through cracked mirror metaphor and finally through flawed yet lingering musical apology—avoids moralizing. Subtext in silence of falling trees and paper-chord aftermath invites reader to weigh absolution without reply. No echoic thesis line; final image reweights earlier gossip-as-exorcism concept with undeniable social cost. Complexity kept: apology may never reach Mara, keeping theme ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of breath vs. tick imagery; final reconfiguration reframes time as lived interval, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext resides in the key’s temperature and the horizon’s dissolution—no reader-level sermon. Ambiguity is productive: ritual as devotion or trap.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of "letting go as permeability" emerges via recurring image of breathable barriers and soft pulses rather than explicit thesis. Final click reconfigures revolution as gentle release, not seizure of control—an elegant CR. Subtextual weight is modest because no prior rigid rule is dramatized to be let go; still, the concept harmonizes setting, method, and closure without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the equation on the seat: the sum of diminishing halves equals unity, imaging her need to integrate loss (mother) and risk (gamble). No moralizing—final theorem is an action, not statement. Clover melancholy tone recurs in caretaker’s hum and rain residue, reweighting at closure when lantern gutters against ledger—quiet answer larger than plot.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly: endings are raw material for beginnings if someone listens long enough to re-loop grief into song. The disc’s accumulating voices make the abstraction audible. The final “Thank you” whispered by an unheard speaker offers a quiet Conceptual Repricing that reweights isolation as communal resonance—effective, though Mara’s own change is still off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges: memory’s ink can outlive erasure; particulars of lighthouse/fisher pact and child-image give it flesh. Subtext whispers through sea-echo and ledger-sigh, avoiding thesis statements. Final starlit image reweights prior motifs without moralizing, though the abstraction “weight of small moments” edges toward echo.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: reciprocity as praxis, not slogan. The moon fragment’s chime traveling “along the rumor chains” reconfigures empathy from abstraction to sensory event. Final image—lantern handed onward—offers resonant, non-moral answer: loneliness is eased only by continuing the chain. No final-paragraph sermon; insight stays implicit in the act.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges from concrete merges: languages dissolve into one chord, proving that empathy demands surrender of safe outsider stance. Final image—“trail of soft notes for any future traveler”—re-prices her victory: she becomes the map, not the mapper. No moralizing; insight stays inside the luminous pulse she carries. Subtext hums in ring’s meteor iron and forest’s sigh, never stated.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through recurrent gardening/astral images: pruning, seeds, buds, orbits—history as cultivar rather than ledger. No moralizing statement; final “listening” offers Conceptual Repricing that reweights authority—control surrendered grants clarity. Ambiguity is purposeful: anomaly neither punished nor conquered, merely interpreted. Subtext whispers that revision itself is the only permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without thesis statement: silence as compositional material, forgetting as generative. The returning empty camera recharged at the end converts from vanity object to tablature, reweighting prior material. Subtext resides in gesture—fingerspell a note no ear will attribute. The final image invites multiple readings (solace, erasure, legacy) while avoiding moralizing; the joyful sorrow tone is earned through concrete paradox rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of redemptive creation emerges through fire-as-illumination rather than statement; the phoenix image re-weights without moralizing. Subtext in the vandalized portrait (self-judgment) is effective. Sentimentality is avoided, but the mentor’s promise edges toward explicit thesis, capping lift.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges as sorrow can birth communal light if someone volunteers to carry the rhythm indefinitely; no character articulates this thesis. The returned memories shift from pathology to gift, reweighting the lab’s premise without moralising. Final image of steadily glowing lagoon offers quiet conceptual repricing: grief becomes usable energy. Subtext rests in silence—the staff never speak—so the institutional change is read entirely through environmental echo, an elegant restraint that avoids preachiness.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: the final parchment re-prices the city’s communicative economy from noise to whisper. No character lectures; the insight is earned through the storm-driven test. The refrain “whispers travel farther” is never stated outright, avoiding thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the accumulative weave of light; no explicit moral is stated. The re-weighting of night as self-luminous is resonant and non-literal. Motifs (mirror, shutters, stars) recur with shifting significance, culminating in the final lattice. Some lines flirt with soft aphorism (“language of listening without words”) but theme never collapses into overt thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of quiet as civic catalyst emerges through image chain (mist → hush → unspoken words → amplified stillness), avoiding explicit moral. Final line reweights “quiet” from passivity to collective power. Subtext relies on light-signals and saplings rather than interpersonal tension, so resonance is atmospheric, not character-ironic. Theme stays coherent but leans on lyric repetition rather than surprising re-configuration.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges obliquely: art as covert grief-work inside a happiness regime. The final image reframes prior motifs—shavings as “whispers,” bouquet as archived decay—without moral statement. Ambiguity is purposeful: reader must decide if the baton is tool, trophy, or tombstone. Minor deduction for one line that nears thematic echo: “a silence that honored both joy and grief.”

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of permeable boundaries emerges through repeated image of dissolving veils rather than thesis statement. Final star-reflection acts as Conceptual Repricing, shifting boundary from barrier to lens. Subtext resides in sensory fusion—sound becomes color, ice becomes mirror—avoiding abstract moral. The motif stays particular; no late symbolism grafted for convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of imperfect grace emerges from the reed’s metallic sighs and cracked vase, never sermonized. The final image of name-spectrum glass flowers reconfigures beauty as fracture without moralizing, inviting counter-readings of disability as alternative sight.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges from synaesthetic communion rather than thesis: “What if sound can be seen?” is asked aloud yet answered only by the shared sigh. Golden shadows recur with shifting weight, moving from wonder to fragile reciprocity. No moral is stated; the final dimming lamp leaves ambiguity intact. Subtext lives in touch and timbre, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges as the alchemy of fake → alive, artifice → life, without moralizing. The “genuinely artificial” paradox recurs in lantern-glow, paper cranes, and finally the phosphorescent bloom, each iteration gaining luminous ethical weight. Subtext resides in silent folds and thread-paths rather than exposition. The ending image refuses tidy comfort: bloom is real, but its light is still borrowed from death-metal grief, leaving honest ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from the spiral image: speculation’s crash demands a new cartography of belief. No explicit thesis is stated; the final droplet reframes prior motifs (cards, tape, song) without moralizing. Subtext resides in the hum matching a lullaby—culture as inherited vibration. Complexity is honored: hope is not guaranteed, only made legible.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of cyclical hope vs ephemeral memory emerges through mirrored children and the stone’s preservation, but it is stated in repeated abstractions (“shape of hope,” “promise alive”) rather than concrete consequence. Final image reweights earlier motifs (kite silhouette) yet lands softly moralizing. Subtext is thin; the library’s breathing and stone’s glow are overt allegory rather than charged silence.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: reconstruction through self-exposure, balance as tended river. The chameleon’s re-attached tail becomes a non-literal answer—wholeness requires shedding, not adding. No final moralizing; the journal line is earned aphorism. Ambiguity lingers in the “whispers” carried off by mist, inviting reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges implicitly: unexpressed affection as a cosmic archive waiting for retrieval. The refrain of “never mailed” good-byes and the final image of shadows applauding fuse personal and metaphysical registers without sermonizing. Ambiguity is purposeful—the gazer leaves humming, love still “unused” yet mobile—so the reader continues to weigh emotional hoarding versus release. Final chord resolves earlier musical motif, giving a non-literal answer that avoids tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: trapped imagination as stardust memory, released through obsessive ritual. Subtext operates in silence—poems never quoted, only their growing volume implied. Final image of archway humming with leftover verses offers resonant non-moral answer. No late thesis statement; “freedom” line is borderline but offset by immediate sensory payoff, keeping high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of archive and forest: forgotten possibilities are replanted as living light, refusing the moral that ashes must stay dead. The fractured lullaby—burning-leaf sighs harmonized with new growth—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without sermonizing, though a final-line “reminder” nudges toward overtness.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges as the re-pricing of courage from heroic virtue to seed-like latency—an insight earned through tactile map, not maxim. Subtext is carried by object handling: ticket click, chest glow, sunrise brush. No explanatory sentence moralizes; final whispered gratitude lets image speak. The concept stays modest and coherent, resisting grand pronouncements, hence strong resonance without 9-level surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges via color shift and bolt reprise: silence transmuted from prison to covenant. Subtext resides in the bellhop’s wordless vigil and the guests’ mute assent. Final image reconfigures premise without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—crack may bring sunrise or deeper frost—inviting reflection beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of truth dissolving false sovereignty emerges via ink, rune, crumbling architecture—never sermonized. Final image of collapsing stones singing renewal reweights earlier “graceful collapse” motif without explicit moral. Ambiguity lingers: is titan guardian or destroyer? Minor abstraction keeps it from 9—cost is cosmic, not personal.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning is not destination but rhythmic participation—cycles of stasis and reignition. No overt thesis statements; final vow is whispered to horizon, not explained. Opera glasses and stone circle form a returning duality (micro/macro) that reprices the premise: cosmos is mirrored in human collectives. Subtext operates through imagery rather than dialogue, inviting reflection on repair vs. rebellion without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—tradition rewritten by love, not fear—emerges through communal chorus of plants; avoids explicit moral. Subtext resides in moss-whispers and vine-cradle, not sermon. Final image of ‘collective heartbeat’ reweights earlier rebellion into stewardship, offering quiet resonance. Complexity is modest; no counter-argument given page time, yet avoids tidy moral—earns mid-high 6 band.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through iterated natural images rather than statement: wind-blown lavender, scarred sapling, and tidal pulse quietly argue that life persists past ruin. The promise whispered to the oak is the only overt articulation, but it is earned through prior sensory pattern. Ambiguity remains—hope is planted, not guaranteed—avoiding moralistic tie-off. Final image of shared breath between woman and world reconfigures meaning without slogan.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: brokenness as generative medium. Subtext resides in gesture—spiral walk = self-portrait in motion—and in final image where phoenix card re-prices “shattered deck” from curse to palette. No moral delivered; ambiguity lingers: is he prisoner or pioneer? Emotional after-effect is concrete ache rather than sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the recurring vanish/appear ink trope: memory and history are erasable unless witnessed. The ending’s scent-whisper offers a non-literal answer—perception itself is the brake on erasure—without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, but the abstraction keeps resonance cerebral, not gut-level.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from iterated images: quiet engraving → sheathed blade → tranquil blaze → rose petal compass. No explicit thesis; final image of villagers holding petals is the non-literal answer. Subtext operates in silence: the scrap’s “prayer” is never decoded aloud, letting reader complete meaning. Moral complexity preserved: pacifism is not preached but enacted at physical cost (weight carried, past remembered). Avoids sermonizing even in Lira’s final whisper.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—art as receptive vessel, not capture—emerges through image chain: spike as stylus, echo as song, net for firefly-notes. Subtext avoids moralizing; final smile encodes the answer. Resonant reprise of “feral lullaby” reweights prior material with quiet ambiguity. Could ascend higher if echo carried social or relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—truth as corrective gravity—emerges through the “orbits of regret” hologram and the nib’s lineage; no moral is stated, yet the idea is repeatedly named rather than dramatized in conflicting actions. Subtext is thin: the journalist’s arrival carries no hidden agenda, Mira betrays no mixed motive. The closing image of sky “turning the pages of a fresh edition” is resonant but arrives as a single metaphoric lift; complexity is suggested, not tested through character contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from sound-translated-into-comfort: sorrow cannot be deleted, only re-voiced into bearable cadence. Subtext lives in insect wing, recorder dust, letters hidden beneath drawers—no explicit thesis. Final image—city exhaling lullaby—offers resonant reconfiguration of grief as shared lull, no moralizing. Complexity preserved: guilt remains, only its timbre changes.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges implicitly: meaning arises not from collecting fragments but from releasing assumed coherence—shown via sand grains let go and lilac unease dissolving. Subtext lives in gesture: tile’s sigh-shed, chalk’s final spiral, violinist’s bow agreeing with sand—no moralizing. Final image of mist-veiled peace reweights earlier lilac disquiet without stating thesis. Complexity lingers: silence as language invites counter-readings about erasure versus clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from image pattern—fire, steel, fracture, stitch—never from thesis statements. “Aberrant mercy” is dramatized as a civic engineering choice, not preached. Final image of children laughing through broken arches reweights the premise: compassion is infrastructure, not sentiment. No moralizing paragraph; resonance is left quietly humming underfoot.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly: abandoned artistry can seed future possibility if offered as gift. The coin’s shift from Tower to sunrise image reconfigures meaning without verbal moralizing. Subtext resides in scent and chime, not exposition. The final apple-fall reprises curtain-call applause, letting readers reprice “closed” as prelude.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited ghost POV sustains synesthetic perceptual signature—colors hum, violin sighs, cinnamon thickens—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax swells into long breathless phrases during the song, then relaxes into single chiming falls, mirroring emotional arc. No dialogue, so no register clash; narration stays inside plausible ghost lexicon of theater and hue. Compressed lyric elision is taught early (“synesthetically blessed”) and paid off in the color-rippled sky.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from the tension between measurement and miracle; the willowglass image reconfigures skepticism into transparent trust without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—touching cool geode to hot skin—rather than declaration. Final line’s “promise that understanding could be beautiful” is earned by the sensory dialogue she has just staged. No platitudes; the conceptual repricing is the professional risk of sharing un-peer-reviewed data.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—listening as authorship—emerges through mapping metaphors and the final inversion: she hears herself reflected in stone. Subtext resides in the silence she amplifies, not in stated thesis. The ending reweights the leaf from relic to oracle without moralizing, achieving resonant ambiguity. No tidy maxim is offered; the caves’ song is invitation, not answer.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from pattern: collective memory (buttons) + living echo = time is communal, not linear. No explicit moral; final image of sand-bridge lets reader feel the re-weighting. Subtext in button engravings (“cliffs will listen”) reconfigures prophecy without stating thesis. Minor drift: “shared wisdom” is named once, but the choral grain-song afterward earns the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of self-redemption through symbolic courage emerges imagistically; moral is never declared. Silver hush, ash-marked skin, and stitched light form a running motif that reframes brokenness as continuance rather than erasure—earned by final image. Subtext stays light; most meaning is carried on surface imagery, limiting resonance. Still, complexity is respected: no tidy absolution, only acceptance and guardianship of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly: memory is not erased but stitched, honored layer by layer. Palimpsest image migrates from river surface to moral logic without authorial nudge. Final mirror-river image offers non-literal answer—acceptance of layered self. Avoids tidy moral; avoids overt thesis statement; could use one sharper contradiction to deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges as “resilience through receptivity”: fractured timelines safeguard memory precisely by refusing erasure, and kindness is the sun that lets the cracks breathe. No thesis statement; meaning accrues via recurrent lantern-glass / sun-pattern imagery that culminates in Conceptual Repricing—light becomes internal engine. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: the oasis exhales, not because past is fixed, but because it is belatedly witnessed. Complexity preserved: oasis will still resist future changes.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through recurring light/dark materiality rather than statement; “to reflect light into dark corners” is dramatized, never sermonized. The closing “resilient glow” re-prices the lockmaster heirloom and the gardener’s ritual without moralizing. One soft echo: “protected vulnerability” is named twice—acceptable because the second instance is embedded in bodily sensation, not thesis. Complexity holds—no tidy moral, only an open covenant with night.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of coexistence emerges imagistically—sundial reflects whale, whale ribs mirror stone arches—without moralizing. Subtext relies on light-echo doubles (memory↔present, isolation↔community) that culminate in the sunrise re-pricing. The rejection of “brittle awakenings” as failure is subtly earned through Mira’s final whispered vow, not asserted. Ambiguity lingers: independence is declared but unproven, letting resonance outweigh message.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through the accumulation of sealed confessions: secrecy is not hoarded but released into a public cosmos that will re-circulate love. The final star-map offers a non-literal answer—secrets become constellations, visible yet untouchable. No moral is stated; the image reweights the premise that connection requires surrender. Subtext operates in gesture (placing the petal) rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges as “interference as fragile unity,” built through recurrent sonic images rather than thesis statements. Subtext resides in the unheard low frequencies—power felt, not explained. Final shimmer reconfigures prior star-chart material without moralizing. Avoids overt allegory; complexity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges inductively: spatial mutiny = memory’s refusal to stay buried. The crystalline key etched with constellations reweights the concept from treasure to communal compass. No overt thesis; final garden image offers ambiguous afterglow—knowledge glows but must be tended. Subtext of “music shapes space” is enacted, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: erasure versus reclamation, sight versus touch. The ribbon’s return as glinting tear is a perfect non-literal answer. Avoids overt thesis, but the concept of “awakening empathy in stone” is voiced once and drifts toward anthropomorphic shorthand, nudging it down from resonance into decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—memory as navigational instrument—emerges through maps, compass, and the new red line inked after the storm; no explicit thesis. Subtext resides in the reversible exile motif, reweighted when the ancestor’s spirit is “loosened” yet immured in concrete. Final image of the red line tracing courage across time offers resonant CR without moralizing. One near-echo: “moral compass” flirts with cliché but is saved by literal compass presence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of redeemable oblivion emerges from repeated pixels, flutters, plates—images that can be re-written. Final reconfiguration rescues the vanished, reframing erasure itself as data awaiting playback. No moral is stated; resonance is optical and musical rather than preached. The concept stays particular to this ridge, avoiding universalist decal.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars: looping data vs. looping train vs. looping legacy, all charged by the final image of Arlen walking toward a new co-working space—an exit turned entrance. No overt moralizing; the pocketed euro reweights “circles are not failures” without stating it. Foreign bills and circus safety-rails braid into a quiet meditation on measured hope. Resonance lingers because the concept of circularity is repriced, not lectured.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: “words heal with words” is enacted when her whispered telegram literally opens stone. The daylily scent’s return beside the crystal reweights shared burden from poetic motif to functional key. No final moralizing; the lullaby of light is image, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers—will future dreamers answer back?—inviting reflection without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without statement: dream-duty fusion is enacted, not preached. The covenant’s shift from power-pact to promise-of-service is repriced in the final cobalt pulse. Ambiguity is preserved—will the beacon consume her?—earned by the image of healed hedges. No moralizing, no tidy epigraph; resonance lingers in the scent of rain-kissed pine.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges as reciprocal repair: every destiny she barters plants hope inside the giver and the orchard, turning exploitation into mutuality. Subtext is carried in image—ash-to-amber, bone-to-soil—rather than statement; no final moral is preached. The orchard’s exhale and Maelia’s lantern-thread offer a resonant, non-literal answer: healing is shared graft, not self-filling. Complexity is honored; she remains a wanderer who will keep bartering, implying ongoing ethical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges non-didactically: translation as cultivation, not extraction—every decoded glyph a seed that must die to become shared fruit. Subtext lives in magnetic grammar: static discharge = unspoken grief; alignment = consent to let go. The final image of arbor branches “like welcoming arms” reweights earlier haunted ladder into an embrace without moralizing. Avoids explicit “moral” sentence; resonance lingers in the taste of iron on the tongue.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of identity migration emerges through moonlit imagery and the creel’s song rather than explicit thesis, avoiding sermonizing. The final image—key melted into bamboo—reweights routine as a living vessel, offering quiet resonance. Subtext lurks in the creel’s whispered coasts and the librarian’s slowed gears, implying acceptance of impermanence without stating it. Complexity is honored: no moral is extracted, only an invitation to write anew.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from image sequence: sealed bunker doors vs. open shell spiral, rust vs. lavender, crown as halo not metal. No explicit thesis; instead, “the world inside the caves had found a new crown of compassion” reweights the concept of shelter. Ambiguity lingers—will surface dwellers accept this new communion?—inviting reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of map-making: cartography of the soul must be drawn on mutable mud, not paper. Graffiti wisdom—“forgiveness is not a destination but a river”—avoids sermon by being etched, finger-traced, and finally embodied in the river’s reflection. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the low hymn of the patched bellows.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges as the paradox of archival permanence: unspoken words gain eternal life only when finally spoken. The crystal’s projection and the petal’s laughter reweight “voice” from human utterance to botanical-bibliographic event. No explicit thesis is stated; the final whisper is invitation, not moral. The ambiguity is productive—readers must decide whether the garden is liberation or trap—yet the emotional aftereffect is unmistakable: awe at the cost of naming.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of preservation-as-covenant emerges through imagery, not statement: static patterns = forgotten stories, emerald = archived light. Final image reweights prior material—beacon promises future witness, answering the oblivion threat. Avoids moralizing; resonance is atmospheric, not didactic. Yet theme remains monolithic; no counter-readings or character-specific irony complicate the covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of cyclical rebirth emerges through grape and season imagery rather than thesis; final image of glowing hairpin reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture—choosing to shield grapes, not enemies—inviting reader to infer forgiveness as daily labor. Ambiguity preserved: betrayal scars remain, contentment is seasonal, not permanent. No echoic articulation of “cycle” in closing lines sustains resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through iterative chime/certainty motif rather than statement; final image reframes “protected vulnerability” as a living conversation inside the law—complex, unspoken, charged.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: the paradox that mastery of appearance requires embracing disappearance. The pond-ring cipher and mirror reprise reweight“vanishing” from curse to craft without explicit moral. Subtext is carried through imagery (stone, rings, iron filings) rather than assertion. Final smile crystallizes the reconfiguration, avoiding sermon; ambiguity lingers about what “teaching vanishing” will cost her students—nice thematic leak.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of stillness-as-motion emerges through concrete recurrence of echo, pulse, and lattice; no abstract statement. Final image—starlit inward gaze—reweights earlier bird patterns as internal code without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: will the pulse later lure her outward? The refusal to leave carries conceptual cost: she trades freedom for custodianship, rendered in dust settling on shoulders—earned wisdom, not platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: mechanized fireworks vs. fireflies that “refused to be measured.” The keystone’s final pulse offers a non-literal answer—value lies in the unquantifiable—without sermonizing. Ambiguity is preserved: the cities below remain efficient, the mage still penniless, yet the reader feels the repricing. No final-paragraph thesis statement; the image does the work.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—perception can be synesthetic language—emerges through concrete imagery rather than thesis: every object leaks hue when struck by sound. The teal chord’s arrival reweights earlier “meteor hush” motif, turning silence into visible heartbeat. No moral is stated; final whisper invites continuation, not closure, maintaining ambiguity. Subtext resides in the paradox of “hiding behind truth” to find revelation—Eli’s solitude becomes conduit for communal sky-lantern glow. Resists tidy profundity; resonance lingers as after-image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: curiosity as rebellion against thermodynamic doom. Backwards prophecy motif reweights from esoteric curiosity to existential instruction at the final coin flip. No moralizing—resonance arises from the humming coins matching the cosmos’s dying chord. Final image of Silas as “note in the grand symphony” offers non-literal, charged answer to the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—grief transformed by linguistic sacrifice—emerges through image, not statement; the aurora is the non-literal answer. Forgotten phrases return as constellations, reweighting sacrifice from loss to gift. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the unspoken names still drifting skyward.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the concreteness of dripping water and warming metal: patient attention can mend imbalance, yet only through accepting the limits of “lukewarm” power. No moral is stated; the cosmos simply flickers in acknowledgment, letting the reader feel the repricing. Subtext resides in silence—the bell’s former muteness and the river’s withheld life—rather than exposition. Final image refracts sunrise into “a thousand tiny suns,” a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without asserting a maxim.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of collective memory reclaimed from myth emerges through image chain, never stated; the reservoir’s shift from scar to watching eye reweights meaning. Subtext lives in lantern reflections and shared silence—no moralizing line.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: the integration of logic and awe is enacted, not sermonized, through the crystal-flame-starling chain. Subtext lives in gesture—her trembling finger on the shard edge concedes more than any interior monologue. Final image of the orchard breathing at sunrise offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo penalties; insight is earned through sensory particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of custodial trust emerges through tactile particulars (buckle, vine, static) rather than statement. Final image of silhouette against dawn reweights prior silence into covenant without moralizing. Some risk of thematic echo in “watcher’s burden” phrasing, yet it remains character-bound. Subtext in the crew’s silent gratitude deepens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of reintegration after ego-death emerges through the Duplicate’s awakening rather than thesis statements. Final image of twin pulses offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Occasional abstractions (“vivify dead parts”) slightly dilute subtext, yet the silence-versus-slash pairing keeps complexity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—stories as soil for imagination—emerges via the garden legend, but the final image reweights only the players’ awe, not Mara’s worldview. Subtext is thin; no silence or gesture complicates her victory. Insight is safe, complexity avoided.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: grief is not a void but raw material for song. Repricing occurs when off-key wind becomes laughter’s carrier, reweighting haunting from prison to backdrop. Subtext lives in gesture—the cord cradle returned like a violin in its case. No explicit thesis; final image of wind-backed giggles offers non-literal answer. Minor docking for “true haunting” tag in penultimate clause—slightly overt—but resonance survives.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without moralizing: uncertainty as companion rather than enemy, crystallized in final mist-wing where stories breathe unfiled. Subtext carried by recurring frost/petal imagery shifts from desolation to invitation. Final image of guardian heart “beating in time with the garden’s sighs” offers non-literal answer—acceptance of endless ambiguity. No thematic echo or final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance arises from specific particulars (pendant pulse, unfurling roses). Complexity retained: cult threat lingers, breach still possible.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of creative destruction emerges through iterated image: grinding, brushing, shivering wood, cold flame—no abstract lecture. The crozier’s rebirth as half-relic/half-phoenix reconfigures sanctity itself, implying broken institutions can mutate rather than merely mend. The final dawn of possibilities is shown via shadows receding, not stated; ambiguity lingers—will the realm now expect every shattered thing to bloom? Emotional aftereffect is awe tinged with dread: transcendence bought by eternal winter-fire.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—endings are raw material for beginnings—emerges through image (shard lowered at dawn) not thesis. Subtext lives in the hush: silence is not vacancy but unstruck note. Moral complexity kept: city remains rusted, rebirth is sonic, not utopian. Final chord reframes earlier “forgotten frequencies” without moralizing, delivering resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: intention as cosmic needle, sound as thread. The empty hourglass reprises as a re-weighted symbol—emptiness becomes compass—avoiding explicit moral. Subtext resides in image (sand defying gravity) rather than sermon. Final image answers the core question—can one person mend ruptured time?—with a wordless visual that feels earned yet avoids tidy profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without pronouncement: connection is both material and imagined, a public yet intimate filament. The final image—city pulsing with passerby threads—re-weights earlier eruptions as civic heartbeat rather than private hallucination. No moral, only resonant reconfiguration. Subtext lives in gesture: the thread’s tension is the unspoken cost of empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges as the negotiation of depth versus ascent, encoded in the anchor link’s iron weight and the alien lattice’s weightless vectors—no character sermonizes the metaphor. The final return of the rusted link to the statue re-weights the symbol without commentary, letting the reader feel the city’s new axis between memory and horizon. Subtext operates in silence: no one debates whether to leave the trench; the test glide simply happens, and the hush afterward is the moral. The piece avoids tidy morals but leans so hard on communal awe that individual consequence is left unexamined, blunting lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: echoes, photographs, hearing aids as carriers of lost song. Final image answers the question “who will listen?” with quiet vow to guard. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about scale of guardianship. Wisdom is earned through concrete sensory discovery rather than abstract assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of remembrance-as-responsibility emerges through the codex’s glowing amber strands and the sea-foam names of dead scientists; no explicit thesis stated. Burial of the golden map reweights the premise: tracking invisible things now means protecting them from exploitation. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally—quiet triumph felt in receding tide. Ambiguity lingers (who will listen next?) without confusion, sustaining resonance beyond the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges implicitly: systemic quantification of life vs. lived embodiment. The ghost’s cold tally and the shard’s eventual warmth reweight the premise without moralizing. Subtext stays in gesture—ink fleeting, porcelain enduring—avoiding abstract statement. Final aurora image invites reflection on fallible archives; complexity acknowledged, not resolved into tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the metamorphosis of loss into legacy: extinction becomes inscription. The flawed diamond reweights from curse to crucible, the birds from omens to co-authors; no moral is stated. Final image of “long shadows that whispered the same song” offers non-literal answer: memory can outlive utterance if encoded in matter and motion. Ambiguity lingers—will anyone ever decode the bone-tunnel?—yet the story commits to the cost of that uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges concretely: cosmic darkness answered not by conquest but by shared laughter. Subtext carried in the static’s tonal shift and silver moss smile—no explicit moral. Bitterness-to-joke transformation is shown via moss color change and body-felt ripple, not stated. Final image reweights mythic sorrow as playful gravity, inviting ambiguous reflection without tidy maxim.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: organic rhythm vs. mechanical monotony reweights through the final amber-coated spires without moralizing. Recurring “resonantly soft” shifts from fragile resistance to transformative force, giving the reader a conceptual afterglow that resists tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of mending absences emerges from the envelope’s mantra and the mirrored drone ascent rather than exposition. Final image reweights the bottle from weapon to “calm sky,” achieving Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: peace is a crossing pattern, not a treaty.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without statement: listening as creative act, silence as raw material. Motif of “interpret silence as possibility” is never moralized; it is enacted as Mara physically re-halos the horse. Final image—mirrors reflecting endless un-sung songs—reweights the premise: every future listener must pay the same price. The after-effect is concrete: reader hears hush long after page ends.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of memory-as-geometry emerges through image (Möbius ceiling, star-lake projection) rather than statement; the final constellations silently reprice the library’s function. Ambiguity lingers—whose memory was it?—but the refrain “where stories truly live” edges toward echo in the last paragraph, slightly over-articulating the mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: longing transmuted into shared light. Jasmine scent and dissolving filament reprice the pearl metaphor from private nostalgia to communal beacon, avoiding moralizing. No echo-statements of “this is about longing.” The final image rewards reflection without tidy closure, inviting the reader to carry the light.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through image-pattern—lock, ribbon, filament—rather than statement. Final filament as living bridge reconfigures fear into courage without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: whose fear, which travelers? That open charge is earned by particulars. No final-paragraph thesis drop; resonance stays imagistic.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of “quiet mentorship as resistance” emerges through the mosaic of shards and the lullaby geometry; no overt thesis, but the final whispered vow reweights earlier exile into pilgrimage, offering resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of wonder-as-custodial-act emerges through seed-sharing and orchard chorus, never sermonized. Final image of “hope blossomed anew” skirts close to echo-statement, but the traveler’s departure keeps it in scene. Subtext is strongest in the pruner’s silence: he gives away the fruit of centuries without asking return, implying wonder is only real when circulated. Still, the absence of personal cost blunts thematic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of silence as restorative vessel emerges imagistically without moralizing; the secret’s final whisper crystallizes the concept that grief must be housed, not silenced; ambiguity lingers—spirits settled yet still present—inviting reflection; slight over-reliance on abstract noun pairs (“lucid unrest,” “interlaced hush”) keeps it from full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from concrete returns: rain, stone crack, map tear—each re-weighted from damage to doorway, making the final glow an unspoken answer to “can silence be read?” No character sermonizes; the thesis is imaged, not stated. Ambiguity lingers—future framers will retest—so complexity survives. The only soft trace of “shielded openness” appears verbatim once, a micro-echo that barely grazes the 0.4 deduction line, keeping score high.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the recurring image of tangled/untangled threads and the globe’s frozen storm that must dissolve to release light. The final shatter reweights the motif: letting go is not loss but the only path by which memory becomes constellation. No moralizing—wisdom stays in the image. The Amelia echo keeps the theme oceanic and aerial at once, resisting tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of “silent code craving touch” emerges wordlessly from the graffiti’s color-shift and the silver petal runes; no authorial thesis intrudes. The final wall-mural reprises the opening press-imprint, reweighting the same motif from tool to shared heart—an earned resonance. Quiet, non-moralizing, and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—joy persisting beneath frozen sorrow—emerges through shifting light, not exposition. The diary’s color-map of emotions and the crystal-jarred laughter are particulars that reweight the premise. Final whispered promise offers quiet conceptual repricing: service itself becomes the vessel for joy. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the returning amber glow.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges via cloud-emotion ledger turned sky-elegy; no overt thesis. Final comet-image reprices the void from absence to palimpsest—conceptual cost felt without exposition. Subtext lives in brass inscriptions and broken-string lullaby, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: emptiness both records and erases, a resonant irresolution.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: the ethics of borrowing sky-light from living constellations (starlings) to chart human paths. No moral is stated; the final halo asks whether导航值得偷天火. Subtext whispers through silence—no crew dialogue, only engine and bird cries—leaving reader to weigh wonder against implicit drain. Ambiguity is purposeful and haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without statement: repair as transitive love—fixing time for others while surrendering personal stasis. The driftwood-frayed coat and ticking storm under his arm reweight the premise: mending externalizes one’s own erosion. No moralizing; the sunrise promises endless voyages yet leaves the locksmith homeless, a charged poise. Subtext whispers through silence and mirrored fractures rather than thesis lines.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of collective nurture emerges through bell, water, vapor, and shared breath, never sermonized. Final image reweights chalk from child’s game to covenant tool. Mythic tone avoids tidy moral by leaving next season uncertain. Echo of “brambled hope” risks slight thematic statement yet is saved by sensory context.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the cracked puppet and cracked tower: beauty inheres in fracture, not repair. The lullaby’s migration from mechanism to sea reweights “beautifully flawed” from label to lived axiom without sermonizing. Subtext resides in object-gesture—the puppet’s grin widening is the story’s true dialectic. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer: stars echo the promise, leaving moral ambiguity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of cursed caretaking as wound-care emerges from image-chain (ash-fruit, reed-whorls, graceless light). No final moral—ending image of “wound that will never heal” reweights earlier orchard sighs. Subtext in birds’ indifferent gaze crystallizes cost without statement.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: “emptiness becomes conduit” via foam, chrysalis, bridge. No moralizing—final whispered promise is image, not thesis. Recurring foam reweights from chaotic spray to structural lattice. The loosening of grief is felt, not labeled, in the bright laugh that ends the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—stories are born from measured silence—emerges through enacted metaphor rather than assertion. Final silver word “origin” is a quiet conceptual repricing that invites rereading without moralizing. Recurring image of bottled moonlight shifts from private hope to communal seed, reweighting prior beats. Could edge higher if theme probed a counter-reading (what stories die when silence is filled?).

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of collective guilt transmuted through sensory ritual emerges implicitly; no character moralizes. Image-set of tide, salt, citrus, and coral accretes meaning without overt statement. Final taste-shift reweights earlier bitterness into possible redemption—an earned conceptual reprise. No tidy moral, no final-paragraph thesis, but because escalation remains imagistic rather than ethical, resonance stays in high-mid band, not 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as living geology, resurrection versus preservation. Subtext resides in mirror-shard = neuron metaphor that fuses human and mineral archives. Final fade-out offers resonant reweighting: archives are ephemeral, archeology is ongoing communion, not capture. Avoids moralizing; the canyon’s hum answers without verdict, leaving plausible counter-reading that Aria’s quest is quixotic.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vigilance as cultivated fire emerges inductively from seedlings‐into-lamps, avoiding overt thesis statements. The prism motif quietly refracts knowledge into “many hues,” but the spiral/eye doodle never acquires new symbolic weight, so theme stays pleasingly single-track rather than resonant. Final image avoids moralizing, letting the soft lamp-glow reprice the library’s eternal watch.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of “empathy in motion” emerges organically via cracks-become-chords; no character sermonizes it. Final image—porcelain sentinel glimmering—quietly reframes object from mute utility to empathic amplifier. Ambiguity is preserved: is the song actually heard beyond grove or merely projected? However, over-reliance on abstract noun “empathy” in narration edges toward thesis-statement; trimming one or two instances would strengthen subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through chess-eclipse fusion rather than statement; final sliver of light reweights prior sacrifices without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—covenant could still fail—inviting reflection. No thematic echo penalty; insight stays imagistic. Loses top sliver because conceptual cost is less emotionally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—empathy via attuned listening—emerges through synesthetic cataloguing rather than statement. Final image of glowing pages guiding “lost travelers” reweights prior silences into communal harbor without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: whose stories, what price? Subtext resides in metallic breath and unseen ink, not explanation. Avoids tidy thesis; resonance is sensory, not platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme—serenity cultivated through motion—emerges via recurring images (doodles, scent shifts, tide-thought) rather than overt thesis. The final image of villagers inhaling the “wildflower hush” reweights the motif without moralizing. Some phrasing drifts toward the abstract (“undercurrent of wisdom,” “twin roots of serenity”), blunting subtext, but the overall arc resists tidy closure and invites lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Resilience emerges as an emergent rhythm between planet and listener rather than a moral. The dissolved arrow tip reconfigures “source” from object to participatory practice, an earned conceptual repricing. Silence and echo motif shifts from eerie absence to purposeful listening, charged in the final line. No overt thesis is stated; the theme lives in the image of glowing particulate soil.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges as the ethics of atmospheric stewardship: silence is not emptiness but stored force, and foresight is the civic duty to guide unseen currents. The patch’s compass-rose literalizes the moral—machines, like cities, need calibrated airflow. No moralizing sentence states this; meaning accrues through tarp-thread imagery and the final exhale. The loveliest echo: “hazy precision” itself—an oxymoron that reweights the premise that clarity can be soft, intuitive, female.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges as the quiet argument that beauty is a renewable resource inside coldest silence, proven by the cavern’s exhale after song rather than by exposition. Subtext lives in gesture—the re-wrapping of still-warm paper—so the final image answers the thematic question without sermon. A slight drift toward abstraction in the closing litany of “continuum” keeps it from full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—empathy as transposable mathematics—emerges through the refracting topaz light and the cracked halo’s spectral spray, not authorial statement. The final image reconfigures the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful, inviting counter-readings about the violence of commodifying feeling. No echoing platitude cheapens the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of transmuting memory into myth emerges through recurrence of “germinate” and aurora-as-tapestry, avoiding overt thesis. Final image of pilgrims arriving re-weights the ridge as legend factory, but remains gentle—more invitation than indictment—leaving ambiguity slightly under-charged.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the prism’s color-spill: memory is not private but migratory. The truthful-lie paradox is embodied in frost that is both ice and light, never exposited. Final image of “shadows lengthened and brightened” offers resonant, non-moral answer to the stakes. Avoids thematic echo perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of sacrifice-as-loom emerges through recurring weave/silk imagery rather than statement. Final image of orchard glowing with “memory of the amber bead” offers resonant non-literal answer. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers. The motif of weaving gains weight, but amber bead itself could have reprised to deepen reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of bartered awakenings emerges through the silk’s physical exchange, not authorial sermon. The blade-as-rebuilder subverts weapon trope, letting theme crystallize in object. Final image of dancing arch-shadows offers non-literal answer: renewal is communal resonance, not moral dictum. A trace of template cadence in “each hammerfall echoing the planet’s own steadfast chorus” nudges toward statement, keeping the score just shy of 7.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges without sermon: truth as a lattice one must weave between worlds to release, not a jewel to own. The green shard’s refracted light and the final star-drift reweight the idea that knowledge becomes bearable only when shared. No character articulates a moral; the image of awakening bodies against dissolving glass carries the resonance. Minor abstraction in “promise rather than task” line is forgiven because it crystallizes rather than summarizes.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of shared, fragile safety emerges through the spiral-to-glass image pattern; no moral is stated. The reprise of “bottled safety” in the pocket reweights the premise with quiet CR. Ambiguity lingers—does the chain really work?—inviting reflection without confusion. One hairline slip: “luminescent ache” is named twice, slightly asserting the emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges cleanly: renewal through embracing darkness, not conquering it. The motif of green light refracted into shadow recurs and reweights at the end without overt statement. Subtext stays in image—“luminous ships” steering darkness away—avoiding moralizing. The concept resists tidy optimism yet avoids nihilism, achieving plausible ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of “iridescent caution” emerges organically: beauty that warns is shown via wing, scroll, and loom rather than asserted. Final image—light cascade carrying stories—offers a non-literal answer to the magnetism question, reweighting earlier motifs. Avoids preachiness; no character voices the thesis. Weakness: theme stays one-note; no plausible counter-reading or moral ambiguity is invited, keeping it shy of 9-territory.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: quantified grief → immeasurable relief via humble attention. No authorial thesis; the final ledger note is action, not sermon. The oak’s rustled approval reweights the earlier “what trees witness” question into quiet answer: they record sighs, then forgive. Ambiguity lingers—will future keepers believe the ledger?—avoiding tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as compost for communal dawn. The motif of woven dawns shifts from decorative hope to social binding agent, reweighting the premise at closure without overt statement. No final moral is preached; the resonance arises from the orchard’s exhalation of color. A slight abstraction keeps it shy of the 9-band—readers feel uplifted but not personally interrogated.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of “wisdom through owning error” emerges from mirrored blankness rather than overt statement. The owl sigil and spiral return only once, so motif feels ornamental, but the nested paradox structure is enacted by the blank mirror-book. No moralizing paragraph; the final image whispers the lesson. The refusal to demonize solitude keeps the theme from sentimental slide.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of sacred ordinariness emerges through concrete particulars—warm crust memory, vines reclaiming marble—avoiding direct thesis; final image of crumbs in amber tea glow offers resonant, unsentimental reconfiguration, though slight poetic overwrite tempers top band.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of silence: archival detachment becomes intimate rescue, demonstrating that meticulous measurement can outlast cosmic erosion. No character verbalizes the thesis; the argument is borne by the transduction of vibration into light. The final whispered vow re-prices oblivion itself, turning it from threat into corridor. Ambiguity lingers—will anyone else read her map?—but the moral calculus remains legible and complex.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of inherited distrust emerges from brass timepiece and inherited lullaby of “trust breaking,” culminating in the final whisper that accepts unease as safety. No moralizing; the reprise of salt-ferment air reframes comforting unease as the only sustainable peace. Lantern extinction image reweights the premise: light equals target, darkness equals fragile safety. Ambiguity lingers—will Lila replay this night forever?—earned through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: attunement to planetary mood versus technological mapping. The compass as “learning paths” and forest “election” reframes knowledge as negotiation, not control. Final image reweights earlier skepticism into quiet belonging without sermonizing. Minor abstraction of “secret heart” flirts with pseudo-profundity but is saved by the tasted metallic note that makes the insight corporeal.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through the recursion of light/reflection: creativity is not found but recognized as already inside the fractured self. The broken lock’s hum of “unsolved riddles” quietly reweights to “answered” when the portrait’s mirrored heart aligns. No moral is stated; the final lullaby is an image of ongoing obligation, not triumph. Counter-readings possible—has she merely swapped one prison for another—adding complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges entirely through images—plate color, bottled voices, unfurling vines—never once named as “truth.” Final image of the sky healing reweights every prior “small moment” without moralizing. Subtext in the bottled conversations (price and hope) lets the reader feel civic despair without exposition. A hairline deduction for the quasi-allegorical convenience of the sky-vent, but the emotional aftereffect is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through the recurring equation of silence, motion, and color; no character moralizes the thesis. The final image—iceberg still pulsing in darkness—offers a non-literal answer: vigilance itself is the wonder. Subtext resides in neighbor glances and gull silence, implying communal pact without stating it. Some phrasal echoes (“color of wonder,” “symphonies of truth”) flirt with abstraction but are saved by sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: machine memory and organic chaos can hybridize into a living calm. The final image—warm box roots tangling with vine—reweights the earlier fear-object without moralizing. No abstract thesis is stated; the resonance is optical and tactile. One stray line—“a testament that even the strangest organic chaos can be contained… into hope”—edges toward explicitness, holding this shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from the parade of specifics rather than an articulated thesis: the locket, the boy’s photograph, the grandfather’s sea-echo all argue that stories survive when someone leans in. Final image reconfigures meaning—quiet becomes currency—without sermon. Subtext stays in gesture (handing over the locket) and silence after the sea-echo; no moralizing paragraph caps the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from concrete pattern: encoded ink → dice response → crystal memory, turning privacy into transferable artifact. Subtext in dance: pirouette as cipher key implies vulnerability is choreographed, not confessed. No moral stated; final smile is earned stasis that accepts exposure of the lab. Recurrent spider-web time image reweights patience from trap to craft—resonant without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from particular repetitions: pressed flowers ↔ flattened memories, gravity pockets ↔ compression of forgetting. Final image reweights prior material—lantern’s glow now stores whale-song, making deletion reversible yet portable. Ambiguity lingers: who decides what returns? No explicit moral; resonance carried by salt-tinged silence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges obliquely: silence as constructive force, mapping absence to avert apocalypse. Subtext lives in mirrored surfaces—brook, wing, night—each reflecting the idea that unseen quiet can rewire destiny. No moral is stated; the brook’s resumed song is the non-literal answer. The crane wing’s reprise as “secret beacon” reweights the opening image from artifact to ark, achieving resonance without assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges without label: language as living conspiracy between people and built time. The returned image—window latch as word—reweights every prior architectural detail into a dictionary. Subtext operates in gesture (sugar spoon = admission ticket to secrecy). No moral is stated; the ending’s resonance is the quiet recognition that fluency will be measured in creaks, not publications. Ambiguity is purposeful: we cannot tell whether the tutor is ghost, metaphor, or mortal eccentric, and the story gains rather than loses from that uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through recurrent images—shell, ledger, garden light—shifting from quarantine to self-archive. Subtext relies on lyrical echo rather than dramatized contradiction, so insight feels asserted (“solitude became a source of strength”) rather than wrested. The final sentence’s “new archive waiting to be filled” offers quiet conceptual repricing, resisting moral statement, hence no final-paragraph penalty. Ambiguity is present but thin because no prior scene work complicates the equation; solitude→independence reads as single-note triumph, not tensioned duality.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: the idea that forgery can be mercy, that treason against purity can heal incompleteness, is shown through ink, thorn, and dissolving key. Final image of humming marble offers a non-literal answer—art continues as vibration, not artifact. No final-paragraph thesis statement; the lullaby hum lets ambiguity linger. Minor deduction for overt “calibrated treason” refrain that edges toward echo-chant.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the recursive image-set: melted globe / broken compass / gull-with-glass—all fragments of a purity that exists only when re-collected from strangers’ dreams. Final image (sunrise promising illumination of countless shattered dreams) offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence: no exposition explains why the sea grieves. The refrain of borrowed starlight reweights from décor to circulating life-blood, earning quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from recurring images of nets, stitches, firefly flashes—hidden labor made luminous. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: world is “stitched together by hidden patterns.” Subtext is carried in gesture (whistle, whisk set down) rather than exposition. Ambiguity lingers: appreciation is vowed, not achieved, keeping complexity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of curse into clarity: “Only in stillness does the truth shine…” is etched, not narrated, letting the image re-weight the premise. Subtext lives in gesture—her smile at the cradle, the whispered thanks—avoiding final-paragraph moralizing. The orchard’s shimmer at dawn offers conceptual repricing: wasteland re-valued as sanctuary without authorial commentary. No motif checklist; dust/diamond recurrence is causal, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of reclaming ruin into hope emerges through recurring mirror/light images rather than exposition. The final gold-washed clouds reconfigure prior “broken hymn” into communal covenant, satisfying resonance. Yet the absence of protagonist cost keeps the insight slightly abstract, not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of redemptive sound versus analytical control emerges through action (spectrometer + copper drum) without sermon. Final image of beam merging with crystal hum reweights earlier motifs, yet the absolution delivered to Elara feels solitary; world-scale grief remains abstract, yielding a pleasing but not haunting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the iterative moon paths rather than thesis statements—patience is shown as accumulated attention, not preached. Final image reweights the premise: the lake’s “patient eyes” retroactively re-illuminate every prior glimmer. Resonance is specific to ice, basalt, magnetism; abstractions avoided. No moralizing line mars the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of resistance against structural neglect emerges through the lantern’s re-purposing and the reversed flow; no explicit thesis stated. Subtext resides in the etched symbols and the groan of steel—history’s unpaid debt. Final star-like droplets reprice the meaning of seepage from threat to hope, achieving conceptual repricing. Complexity is honored—no tidy moral, only a shifted current.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the convergence of redemption and repair: “every gear a memory” reweights the premise that contrition can be calibrated. The final image—a hymn-tuned music box in a fog-bound coat—offers a Conceptual Repricing: mercy is portable but mechanical, relentless. No final-paragraph sermon; the heart’s thump is the moral. Complexity lingers—does grace need winding?

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of irreverent awe emerges through kaleidoscope rainbows and gears laughing at espresso jokes, but it stays ornamental—no ethical torque or re-pricing of wonder occurs. The bell’s silence-as-punchline is clever, yet the insight feels pre-installed, not wrested from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of absence into presence via archived metadata; no character sermonizes the moral. The final image—“the archive pulsed with the living echoes”—reweights all prior “forgotten songs” without abstract statement. Subtext is carried in gesture: the act of reposting a fabricated tribute is simultaneously betrayal and resurrection. The reader is left to contemplate who else might be stored in the silence we scroll past daily.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: shared attention transforms anomaly into ordinariness, light into communal guide. The final image of blossoming green reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext resides in silence and mirror-ripples rather than articulated insight, inviting reflection on empathy as collective refraction.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically from salvaged wreckage and lace-filtered moonlight: solace lies not in avoiding endings but in attuning to their music. No final-paragraph thesis monologue; last whispered gratitude lets image carry resonance. Subtext of passive suicide tourist converted to passive witness is subtle yet coherent. Wind-as-lullaby motif returns with shifted emotional weight, fulfilling reconfiguration without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from repeated images of mismatch—vine/lover, fire/earth—never stated as thesis. Final image of “quiet harmony” offers resonant, non-moral answer. Subtext lives in gestures: tendrils curl like doomed lovers, sentinel smiles at incompleteness. Avoids final-paragraph sermon, but “passionate subtlety” is named once (−0.3) rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—wisdom must be tended like fire—emerges through desert imagery rather than explicit sermon. Peripheral awareness as sanctuary is an intriguing conceptual twist, but the idea is restated (“the true sanctuary lived… in the act of listening”) rather than dramatized. The closing image of star-patterns echoing teachings offers quiet resonance, yet lacks conceptual repricing because no prior rule is overturned.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of communal memory-as-salve emerges through imagistic repetition—lavender, arcs, feather—rather than exposition, satisfying emergence rule. Subtext relies on silhouettes and scent, avoiding explicit thesis until the final “quiet promise kept,” which still nudges toward moral summary (−0.3). The reconfiguration is felt collectively, yet Mara’s private stakes evaporate, leaving thematic center slightly hollow. Ambiguity is present but safe; no counter-reading challenges the healing premise, reducing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: the irreducibility of living language to fixed archives. Subtext resides in the crystal’s refusal to be catalogued—its sonic glow answers only to witness, not inscription. Final image of the folded page as “delicate prayer” reweights prior dictionary-death premise without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful: future readers may or may not hear the echo, leaving complexity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from particulars: chalk as ephemeral archive, fog as memory-storage that refuses permanence. Final image reweights premise—dispersed dust is not defeat but necessary release. Subtext in gesture: pressing chalk to stone is an embrace of impermanence. Avoids moralizing; resonance floats like the horn of a ghost ship—heard, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—order wrested from chaos by listening to the smallest natural pulse—emerges imagistically, never sermonized. The luminous ache deepens from vague haunt to steady pulse, re-pricing the premise without moral tag. Recurrent leaf/clock imagery accumulates ethical weight: fragility can steer cosmic machinery. The refusal to name the insight aloud keeps it subtextual, though the sentiment flirts with preciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges implicitly: wholeness can arise from visible fracture. The motif shifts from “broken song” to shared keepsake fragments, reweighted at closure without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—curtains fluttering like last breaths, vinyl crackle substituting for voice. Elegiac tone risks sentimentality but is grounded in tactile specifics (pine-rain scent, staff dividing the shard), yielding restrained resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge demands patient, iterative closure of one’s own observational gaps. The spoon-ripple backstory and migrating shadows braid into an epistemological argument without authorial sermon. Final image reframes noon darkness as migratory rest, offering resonant ambiguity—yet the insight feels gently cerebral rather than morally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges from the reversal of bone-setting: instead of fixing a living patient, Mara implants alien life into a dead shell, turning her redemptive craft into star-mapping. Subtext lingers in the tooth’s borrowed pulse—salvation may itself be an act of appropriation. Final marginal note is a touch explanatory but brief enough to retain resonance. Complexity survives: skeptic and believer coexist without moral ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of reclamation emerges through organic metaphor: digital scars lullabied by living systems; no overt thesis, yet the final firefly-amber mirroring reweights confession from public wound to private pollinator—resonant, unsentimental, with plausible counter-reading that quietism can’t erase viral violence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from pattern: binding fleeting hopes into逆流 mosaic—never stated, only enacted. Subtext lives in shell’s spiral—memory’s endless curve—recharged in final glow. Final image (notebook shut, sea-calm resonance) offers non-literal answer to “who owns hope?” without moralizing. Ambiguity persists: hopes may still escape, yet promise of “new horizon” lingers—complex, unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—memory as ecological repair—emerges through the recurring motif of song-threads rewoven into living bark. No moral is stated; the final image of “pages of an ancient book turning” reweights the earlier “golden stories” without commentary. Subtext stays implicit: transmission to children hints at cyclical stewardship. Complexity is modest but coherent; resonance lingers in the ear metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the conceit: maps of feeling, not roads. Subtext lives in gesture—spiral pattern = pulse, lighthouse shards = guidance for the unseen—never sermonized. Final image of snowfall-as-promise reweights earlier “moving stillness” without moralizing; ambiguity lingers: who will dare listen? The orchard’s inhale affirms her craft yet hints at future solitude. No echoic thesis line; resonance is imagistic and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the recurring motif of reflection—light, echo, memory—without explicit thesis. The cellar/library re-pricing reframes earlier images (bronze plates, crystal facets) into a meditation on preservation vs. imprisonment. Ambiguity is purposeful: wonder is both caged and freed. Final image of starlight on the crystal offers non-literal answer: even stored wonder remains open to cosmic re-reading. No moralizing sentence appears.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of sorrow transmuted to art constellation emerges organically via the calcified statues and the closing promise that any visitor can crystallize heart-burdens. It avoids explicit moralizing, letting the final lullaby image carry reweighting. Yet the insight is decorative—beauty as release—rather than morally complex or risky. Subtext stays safely inside its own shimmering skin.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of “loss as tool not trap” emerges wholly through image and action—no sermon. The rust-hued peace modulates from mournful to accepting, final lantern image re-pricing the silence without moral cue. Subtext operates in the sap’s amber vault and the rain’s metronome—no need to name grief stages. One minor echo risk: “harvest lessons from loss” edges toward thesis, but it’s buried early and not repeated.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of reclaimed wonder emerges through image-chain: rust → golden carousel light → lagoon’s luminous arc; no thesis states it. The ghost as younger self keeps ambiguity—companion or conscience—inviting counter-readings. Final image of “eroded ambitions now sprouting fresh roots” reweights prior despair without moralizing. Sentiment is skirted because the cost (lifelong burden of others’ stories) remains implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically: reclamation of abandoned systems as an act of quiet stewardship. The sextant’s evolution from sea-tool to ethical compass reweights the motif without explicit statement. Final image of stars saluting the terminal offers resonant, non-moralizing closure. Minor abstraction around “sentiment that had fled” keeps it from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from pattern: time as memory, not measurement; sentiment as legitimacy. Subtext lives in breath metaphors (crystal sigh, pen breathing, sanctuary sigh) that quietly argue emotion is the only true clock. No moralizing; final whispered gratitude lets reader feel the repricing. The robin’s muffled song is the world’s consent to private time.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: salvaging mechanical locks becomes salvaging narrative locks; the sundial’s truth-measure reweights civic myth. No moral is stated—the final smile at the ribbon of gold is the non-literal answer. Subtext lives in glints: the radio’s hum = lullaby for a world waking from its own lies; water-as-mirror = memory that can be wiped clean. The concept avoids pseudo-profundity by staying tethered to the tactile tool in hand.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Voice is lyrically compressed yet precise: “sky bruised with violet,” “mirror of memory,” “calm storm of purpose”—patterns taught in first paragraph and paid off in final sunrise. Syntax mirrors canal glide—long fluid sentences that breathe, then short beats at the lock turn. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains the seeker’s synesthetic attention to light, metal, water. The elevated diction is earned by the mythic register and never slips into corporate register.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of listening-as-preservation emerges through image rather than statement, capped by the seed-constellation echo. The refusal to rush is implicit, but the lack of on-page risk keeps it from higher resonance. Subtext in fishermen’s silent ropes is elegant; final image avoids moralizing, offering quiet reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges without statement: recording absence becomes the only resurrection possible, yet perpetuates the loneliness it seeks to heal. Subtext lives in gesture—the thread glowing “like a dying sun” revalues nostalgia as burden. The final image answers the thematic question wordlessly: the map is endless, the guide is alone, the garden leans closer.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: mechanical conquest vs. fragile life, encoded in the cradle’s gear-and-crystal hybrid. Subtext resides in the phoenix’s lament—an implicit critique of the palace’s original sin—never spelled out in moral tags. Final image of “suspended garden of gears and feathers” offers resonant reconfiguration without thesis statement. Complexity is present but leans romantic rather than thorny; ambiguity is sentimental, not unsettling.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of transmuting ruin into nurture emerges through image pattern—firefighter, volcanic sand, coin-song—never preached. Final dawn image offers non-literal answer: black sand turned molten amber promises regeneration. Ambiguity persists—villagers’ gratitude is whispered, not staged; complexity intact. Avoids moralizing, though “compassion is a tide” drifts toward Echo; saved by imagistic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges without thesis: memory’s value is re-priced from sealed grief to shared sky-light. Subtext in “defiant hush” implies political refusal to let city forget itself. Final constellation image offers non-literal answer—liberation means re-seeing ruin as map. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether citizens will drink the light.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges as light = memory + math + love, never sloganized. The gear’s infinite approximation becomes a bridge, re-figured in the closing filament; no character moralizes. Troubling serenity complicates the glow with "shadows of forgotten wars," keeping ambiguity alive. After-effect is quiet wonder rather than message.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—grief as migratory, communal tapestry—emerges through accreted images of butterflies, ribbons, poems, flowing water; no explicit thesis is stated. Final basin that “sings” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers about whether sorrow is eased or merely made beautiful, sustaining aftertaste. Slight abstraction in Eliam’s interiority keeps it from higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of incremental absolution emerges through the rake’s tiny prayers rather than authorial statement, but the cosmic phrasing (“chorus of countless souls”) edges toward overt echo. Subtext is strongest when the glowing carvings rewire the pendulum: a quiet image that lets reader feel repair without moralizing. Yet the absence of any counter-argument or failure keeps complexity polite; the tide never talks back, so the question resolves into uplift rather than friction.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: intention as circular seed, not weapon. Final image reconfigures premise without moralizing. Recurrent motifs (circle, seed, case) reweight at closure; ambiguity lingers credibly. Avoids explicit thesis; insight is earned through concrete ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically: ignorance as navigable terrain, futures writable by disciplined imagination. Subtext resides in the kingfisher quill’s iridescence—beauty weaponized into data—and in the barley’s golden echo of obsidian. No explicit moral; final image of “bright horizon of a transformed people” reweights the opening void. Prompt-echo phrase “groundedly imaginative” is used once without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges obliquely: archival labor + pirate broadcast = forgotten voices resurrected through communal listening. No character moralizes; the eventual cheering is the argument. The dust-as-medium motif shifts from passive archive to active voice, reweighting the premise at closure without overt statement. Subtext operates in the shawl’s hum and the ledger’s glow—objects that carry suppressed history into public air.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: the mirage of safety is first promised by whispers, then exposed as an illusion once the emotion is fixed in brittle crystal—truth is literally woven into walls, proving safety can only be braved, not granted. No explicit thesis; the final smile is a somber marvel at resilience, letting readers feel the paradox that fragility is the only honest fortress. Recurrent ash/porcelain/powder motifs accrue meaning rather than check-box symbolism. Ambiguity is fertile: is the crystallized emotion love, grief, or both? The story refuses to name it, honoring complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: multiplicity of truth vs. need for usable past. No explicit moralizing; final image of cog-tick recharges earlier “chorus of truths” without sermon. Subtext resides in silence—rats & mudskippers as jury, sewer as academy. Nuance acknowledged: seafarers and subterraneans both “right,” no forced balance. Insight earned through sediment handling, not assertion. Ends on quiet but charged poise that invites rereading.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First-person voice maintains a dense, clause-stacked cadence that mirrors obsessive intellect; diction stays high but fits self-declared philosopher. No dialogue, so register mismatch risk avoided. Perceptual signature strong—light as “dripping acoustics,” time as “layers we excavate.” One micro register drift: “conceptual repricing” reads like evaluator intrusion, not narrator idiom, but isolated. Rhythm accelerates subtly under pressure without drumbeat monotony. Elision is minimal and taught early (“competing narratives” named by word 150).

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through refrains of subtraction, silence, and braiding: no moral is stated. Final rosette glow offers non-literal answer—art survives by embedding in new voices, not objects. Subtext lives in gestures: loosened shoulders, small hands tracing rosette. Expectant resignation complicates hope with fatalism, resisting tidy uplift. The vanishing-arts motif recurs with shifting weight, satisfying the “return with difference” test.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from the recurring “prune” motif: cultural renewal through selective forgetting. No overt thesis; the final image of singing leaves offers a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture—vines applaud by shedding—rather than declaration. Ambiguity lingers: will outsiders taste or destroy the garden? Complexity embraced.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is chef-particular: synesthetic tasting of memory, diction of palate and spice, syntax that layers clauses like flavors. Perceptual signature is consistent—“the air itself were whispering,” “rust into fleeting ruby veins.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Rhythm accelerates with alignment pulse; compression under pressure is chef-apt. Pattern of metaphor (taste = knowledge) is taught early and repaid at closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through concrete returns: failed buzz → echo → citizens’ hush, showing wonder as auditory afterimage. Subtext operates in gesture—drone hovering over matchbox instead of speaking. Final image reframes maintenance as communion without moralizing. Complexity acknowledged: wonder needs absence; no tidy redemption of hive. Insight is earned via sensory particulars, not pronouncement.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as colonizing force that turns observation into communion. Subtext lives in objects—cup, flower—made vessels by displacement, implying sanctification is accidental, not willed. Final image of streetlights “thanking” the houses reconfigures the gaze without moralizing. The concept avoids explicit thesis statements; only the shopkeeper’s “shard of hush” borders on echo but is brief enough to tolerate.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme emerges as the inverse of petrifaction: stone that learns to breathe ambiguity. The foxglove ampoule’s violet pulse reframes “poison” as medicinal nuance, re-pricing certainty without moralizing. Subtext lives in the animate-yet-lifeless tension—garden smiles in stone, statues inhale without lungs—inviting reflection on how systems fossilize. Final lullaby image avoids thesis statement; resonance is optical and sonic rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through iterated concrete acts: scar-as-flaw becomes the engine of infinity. No moralizing; the ending image of the scarred die facing up re-prices imperfection as the true driver. Ambiguity lingers: is endless ascent freedom or deeper cage? Resonant without tidy answer.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically from recurrence of moon-lit messages and unsolicited notes; no final moralizing. The idea that graffiti of gratitude can outlast language is resonant but floats at allegorical altitude; slightly too neat. Still, ambiguity lingers—city smog never lifts—so complexity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges as “identity survives through shared art”; repeated initials (bread, stone, lens) shift from loss-marker to ownership-marker. Subtext resides in gesture—breaking bread equals reclaiming narrative space—avoiding moral statement. Rosewater dread motif reweights at closure, now sweet-bitter rather than paralytic. Slight abstraction keeps it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: the right to author others’ time is both triumph and trespass. Beacon-as-sunrise reconfigures the “low tide” fatalism into perpetual day, yet the maker’s erasure shows the cost of god-play. No moral is stated; the sailor’s whispered rumor carries the ambivalence. The yoyo’s return from toy to cosmic key is the particular that universalizes the question. Complexity is honored—hope and dread share the same pulse—earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of fear feeding on its own reflection emerges implicitly through mirrored visuals and the advisor’s confession, avoiding overt thesis. Subtext resides in sensory degradation (sweet rot, copper taste) rather than articulated insight. Final bargain complicates the victory—beacon function serves others while cursing bearer—supplying plausible ambiguity. Resonance is dampened because “fear” remains a universal placeholder instead of a specific memory or guilt unique to Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—transmuting hindrance into harmony—emerges through iterative imagery rather than statement, though final sentence drifts toward thesis (“his mission unchanged”). Subtext mostly repeats literal action; silence vs. sound dialectic stays on surface. The orchard’s gratitude is asserted, not dramatized, reducing complexity. Still, the conceit is cohesive, avoids moralizing, and leaves pleasant after-chime.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: mapping as listening, not control—expedition lost by becoming the map itself. Subtext lives in gesture (whistle wail = question) and image (spiral shells = eternal migration). Final image reweights “lost expedition” from tragedy to transcendence, achieving CR. No moralizing; the dread/sunwash dialectic modulates but never resolves into comfort, preserving ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges without pronouncement: the glowing letter is both shield and cage, a concrete object that reweights the meaning of “noble lie” from protector to prison. The rose’s last petal, the ivy cathedral, and the frozen silver ink form a returning triptych whose final configuration argues that compassion and honesty must coexist in the same brittle metal. No moralizing paragraph; the resonant answer is the image of light caught in ink, offering future scholars not a verdict but a tool. Ambiguity lingers—will the next traveler choose hope or history?—yet the story’s stance is clear: lies must transmute, not endure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of memory vs. erasure emerges through concrete ritual (notes in cracks) rather than assertion. The interlaced absence motif accrues meaning as each column’s hollow becomes a shelf for confession. Final image of moonlit brass offers resonant re-pricing: artifacts outlast stone. Quiet ending avoids moral; only drift is “abandoned dreams” phrase echoing prompt too baldly.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—knowledge vs. myth—emerges through the stamp’s evolving meaning: heirloom → seal → cipher → charter key. The ending image of tidal-powered lights reframes “stillness” as active stewardship, a resonant reconfiguration. Yet the council’s frictionless agreement lets the moral question glide rather than bite. Subtext is present but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of alchemy—private loss rendered into shared beauty—emerges through imagery of glass, light, and flight rather than exposition. The basilica’s ascent/descent reconfigures meaning: transcendence rooted in submersion, an earned paradox. Subtext in crane-folding is implied, never sermonized, though the phrase “luminous torment” edges toward self-conscious lyric refrain. Final choir of voices offers ambiguous benediction: comfort and indictment coexist, satisfying the call for complexity without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from pattern: star trails → missing pieces → shared chord, never stated as thesis. Final image reweights “belonging” from personal to cosmic scale without moralizing. The pilgrim’s murmured verses and the carved token keep subtext in gesture; no character utters a lesson. Ambiguity persists: frequency is heard but undefinable, inviting reader tuning.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: “manufactured lineages” versus the irreducible weight of withheld truth. The driftwood phrase and watch hand serve as non-literal rebuttal to the protagonist’s trade, avoiding moralizing; the aftertaste is a credible ethical repricing rather than a stated lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges as forgiveness as shared bridge-building rather than gift; the drawer pull’s hinge image reconfigures the concept without sermon. Subtext lives in gesture—the rope slipping into mist—rather than dialogue. The circled prisoner list (“Mistakes remembered, lessons kept”) risks thematic echo, yet it is embedded in the prop, not narrated. The ending’s quiet inhale invites reflection without tidy moral, satisfying the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: navigation as self-forgiveness, regrets as tide to ride. No explicit moral; final image of steady ember reconfigures prior flickering faith. Subtext resides in compass silence and water applause—gesture, not statement. Avoids sentimentality, yet insight is slightly generalized; greater specificity in the final reprise could deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through mirror-refracted alt-self and bioluminescent response to tossed relic—empathy as seed, not sermon. Avoids final-paragraph moralizing; last line is image-driven resonance. Slight abstraction keeps it from 8.5+ territory, but complexity and ambiguity hold.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of eternal reciprocity emerges through reciprocal embodiment rather than statement; final image of nightly spice offering crystallizes the cycle without moralizing. Subtext would sharpen if the cookie fortune’s ambiguity re-entered to reweight the permanence of her choice, but the piece avoids overt thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—time, mourning, and redemption—emerges from concrete objects (cracked saucer, crystal blossom) rather than exposition. The final image of star-rain reclaims seconds without moralizing, satisfying the non-literal answer test. Occasional near-abstractions (“universe stitched together the torn fabric of beginnings”) flirt with pseudo-profundity but stay moored to the prior saucer / stitching motif. Ambiguity is preserved; no closing thesis is asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—“grief transmuted into genesis through compassion”—emerges from the tear-crystal’s trajectory, not exposition. The garden’s nameless hues reprice the earlier “long-dried tears,” converting sorrow into regenerative light without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: generosity as accidental prophecy, transformation as something you cannot hoard. The firefly tapestry reprises earlier images and re-weights charity from depletion to cosmic alignment. Ambiguity is preserved—no moral is preached. Final image offers quiet conceptual repricing rather than sentimental uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: soft light as covert power, beauty as insurgent tool. The cradle literalizes “ideas without fire”; the glass roses’ facets echo refracted dissent. No moral is stated; the final “quiet thunder” image reweights the blackout from silence to seedbed. Subtext in guards’ “secret smiles” is enough; ambiguity lingers about what ideas sprout, avoiding tidy truisms.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges as the human hunger for agency inside an indifferent cosmos; no character lectures us—meaning accrues through stone-math, tide-breath, and flame-map. The final image answers the central question non-literally: cosmos-rhythm is not fixed, but it demands endless conduit-ship from the seer. Ambiguity is productive—does the flame seed hope or merely disperse her burden? Subtext in gesture (kneeling, whispering to sky) avoids profundity clichés. One stray “lingering promise” echo near the end keeps it from 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the concrete ritual: scars are not pathologies but geography to be walked with reverence. Subtext operates in the envelope’s hollow, the timer’s tick, the ink that glows only after surrender to storm. No late echoic statement; the final image of travelers finding the timer beneath floorboards extends the map without moralizing. The emotional aftereffect is quiet awe—readers feel invited to traverse their own scars rather than erase them.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: rebuilding as resistance, books as bricks, wildflowers as ideology—no moralizing lines state the thesis. Subtext resides in the recurring “false bottom” motif: every life hides fertile space. Final image of lantern-verses offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the implied question “can anarchy birth beauty?” The choir-of-voices stanza flirts with abstract grandiosity but stops short of sermon; ambiguity lingers about survival outside the prison.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges as the reclaiming of time through art: the encore is not for listeners but to make the clock surrender. Subtext resides in image—flickering compasses become steady stars—rather than statement, offering a non-literal answer to how mortals negotiate fate. No moralizing paragraph intrudes; the final bow is to echo, not lesson. Ambiguity lingers: did time stop or merely consent, a counter-reading that enriches rather than confuses.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: empirical rigor + communal dream = living archive. No explicit thesis; final amber blossom is non-literal answer. Subtext resides in lantern glow as empirical confirmation of myth. No final-paragraph moral. One near-echo—“let the rain hear our story before it falls”—skirts thematic statement but arrives as ritual speech, not authorial nudge. Resonance lingers: memory must be planted before storm.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of unspoken apology emerges through recurring compass hue rather than lecture. Final image—sky mirroring regret yet promising forgiveness—offers resonant reconfiguration without moral. Lace pattern as pedagogy hints at repair-through-attention, but remains symbol rather than dramatized insight. Subtext would sharpen if tutor’s own unspoken apology were jeopardized.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: neutron stars, butterfly dust, rotting wood—all embody gradual change as cosmic and earthly law. Subtext thrives in silence (the greenhouse “exhaling,” dust settling unseen). Final line (“smallest speck can steer the fate of a broken world”) risks summation but is earned by preceding images and avoids moralizing. The central question—can insignificance enact change?—is answered non-literally through the greenhouse’s quiet revival.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: resilience as quiet adaptation, not spectacle. The frost patterns—ephemeral yet guiding—mirror how meaning persists in transience. Final image (glass singing under stars) offers a non-literal answer: purpose glimmers in liminal spaces. Avoids moralizing; instead, the sealed glass container and hidden ledger compartment embody the idea that survival hides in plain sight. Recurring motifs reweight prior loss into legacy without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of silence, survival, and resonance—not stated but embodied in the tuning fork’s tone and the conservatory’s exhalation. The final image reweights the storm not as erasure but as material for a “tapestry of sound,” offering a non-literal answer: healing isn’t forgetting but harmonizing. Avoids moralizing; instead, the “unshaken marvels” motif accrues meaning through use. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid—the visitors’ whispers, the closed case resting “like a heart.”

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: rest isn’t passive oblivion but active sanctuary forged through stubborn care. The lighthouse lens reweights “distress signals” from cries for rescue to invitations for peace—a Conceptual Repricing. Final image (“library’s glow seeped into the abyss”) offers non-literal answer: even the forgotten can be housed. No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete particulars (phosphorescent ink, marble tablets, rusted cradle).

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—solidarity as lifeline in isolation—emerges through the bell’s evolution from tool to covenant, never stated outright. Subtext thrives in silence: anonymous straw-wrapped bundles, unthanked elders, children’s knot-tying lessons. The ending reweights “amplified quiet” as communal attunement, not emptiness, offering a non-literal answer to sanctions’ dehumanization. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from particulars (bell’s echo, pantry filled).

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: healing as continual revealing through breath, not singular act. The reservoir isn’t liquid but potential lattice—unused love as dormant energy awaiting release. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing: blossoms glow with compassion’s memory, sparks travel to passersby. Subtext thrives in silence and light; no platitudes, only earned resonance through concrete ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of decaying photographs, hyperbolic geometry, and the living bridge—time as a trembling fabric to be felt, not solved. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the maze isn’t a puzzle but a conduit, and discovery is endless because time is fluid. No moralizing; resonance arises from the child witnessing dissolution and the garden responding with growth. The central question—can perception be unbound from linearity?—is answered through image, not assertion, with cost embedded in the vanished photographs.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: resilience through shared knowledge and ecological stewardship. The recurring motif of “wall” shifts from physical ruin to metaphor for intellectual hoarding, reweighted decisively when it falls post-planting. The final shoot cracking dry crust offers a non-literal answer to despair—hope as action, not wish. No moralizing; subtext lives in image and gesture, especially the arrow’s fletching scattering light like constellations.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: trust’s rupture leaves audible traces worth preserving, not erasing. Subtext thrives in images—coral’s “missing song,” sparks as “forgotten promises”—avoiding moralizing. The final chord of “amber and teal” offers a non-literal answer: brokenness and hope coexist sonically. Yet the epiphany leans slightly abstract (“memory itself is a forge”) without grounding in a specific human betrayal, softening emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: fleeting beauty must be preserved, not possessed. The final image—lantern igniting crystal scrolls into mirrors of past/future—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thief’s moral dilemma without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (pressing ear to destiny’s door) and object (moonbeams as memory). Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in concrete action—pouring light onto a wick—not abstract reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from Mara’s labor: safety arises not from domination but from fragile equilibrium, mirroring climate response. The final image—a cradle replacing cold command—offers a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting “control” as nurturing. Recurring motifs (bookmark, heart-thaw vials) accrue meaning without moralizing; the story resists binaries, embracing complexity in Mara’s quiet resolve. No explicit thesis is stated; resonance stems from concrete particulars, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: betrayal reframed as fuel, vulnerability as power. The seashell’s whisper and backward-name constellations offer non-literal resonance without moralizing. However, the phrase “vulnerability is power” in the climax edges toward thematic echo, risking abstraction. The amber vial’s price—confession—grounds the concept, but the final line (“hovered on the edge of the universe”) leans poetic over precise, softening the conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the oracle’s futile-yet-devoted act: that meaning resides not in capturing the void but in bearing witness to it. The final image—map dissolving into “marbled hush”—offers a non-literal answer to the booklet’s question (“how does one chart a void that refuses containment?”) by showing containment is impossible, yet resonance endures. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and object use; no moralizing intrudes. Ambiguity lingers (Is the echo enough? Is listening sufficient?), but the cost—ephemeral knowledge—is undeniable, avoiding sentimentality or false profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: cleaning as creation, matter as vessel for mind. The ice violin’s dissolution reframes janitorial labor as sacred ritual without moralizing. Subtext thrives in the “mundane mysticism” of sweeping ice flecks that “might hide a lingering thought.” Final image—a bridge between ordinary and transcendent—answers the central question non-literally: thoughts arise from the intersection of resonance and receptivity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme emerges organically through recurring images—doodles, puddles, projections—that shift from ambiguity to clarity without moralizing. The final image (truth glowing “ambiguously clear”) reweights the entire premise: honesty need not be shouted to be transformative. Subtext thrives in silence, light, and reflection; no character articulates the thesis. The story resists binaries, embracing ambiguity as a form of integrity. Epiphany is earned through Mara’s quiet labor, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: humility and honest labor transform broken pacts into pathways. The final image—the fountain whispering names of polished stones—resonates as a non-literal answer to whether gardens remember keepers. Subtext thrives in gesture (vines crowning, not strangling) and avoids moralizing. However, phrases like “mended deception” and “wisely pragmatic heart” flirt with label-speak, slightly blunting the ambiguity that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of mechanics and biology: time as a pliable dimension sensed by flora and avians alike. The final image—buds unfurling “not forward, but sideways”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Lira’s hypothesis without moralizing. Subtext thrives in paradox (“icy warmth,” “mechanically warm”) that mirrors the central idea. However, the insight borders on lyrical assertion rather than earned struggle, slightly softening its conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning resides in negative space—in between sounds, pages, and time. The final stanza reveals that silence, not sound, was the ghost’s secret, reweighting all prior imagery without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (tracing water marks, placing the dry program in an empty seat). The story avoids binaries; sorrow and reverence coexist, and the ghost’s departure feels like grace, not victory.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: truth isn’t abstract but measurable through blurred boundaries of sight/feeling, data/emotion. The final image—ink glowing with mountain sighs—offers a non-literal answer: honesty absorbs environment’s breath, transforming sorrow into guidance. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (smudged petals, trembling needle). Complexity persists—certainty remains “swaying”—yet closure reweights it as beautiful when it lights the path.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: some truths must remain buried to spare the present. The valve wheel’s calibration to “density of secrecy” offers a non-literal answer—truth as measurable burden. Final image (“quiet prayer he never intended to utter”) resonates without moralizing. Skepticism vs. haunting isn’t resolved but held in tension, honoring complexity. No thematic echo or abstraction mars the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: silence isn’t absence but generative force. The final line “silence births renewal” avoids moralizing by arising from embodied experience—the ink dissolving, the river’s hymn, the books’ exhalation. Subtext operates through image (origami folds as chant, obsidian as womb) and restraint (no explanation of mechanics). The keeper’s epiphany reweights the library’s purpose without tidy resolution, leaving ambiguity about whether witnessing alters what’s witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: the baby curl’s echo across generations reframes magic as continuity of attention, not spectacle. Final image—midwives gifting curls, elders tapping sticks—offers non-literal resolution that reweights “ordinary magic” as communal practice. Avoids moralizing; subtext lives in gesture. Slight overstatement in phrases like “legend” and “reborn in the echo” edges toward sentimentality but doesn’t undermine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as active resonance, not passive storage. The dragon tapestry’s reweighted meaning—from artifact to key—answers the central question without moralizing. Final image (“living pulse of a world whose axis has been gently shifted”) offers non-literal closure that reframes all prior fragments as living conduits. Avoids sentimentality through concrete specificity (scorched leaves, gilt thread), though the “last sigh of humanity’s dream” risks near-platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: open secrets as both vulnerability and vessel for continuity. The final image—the gull carrying a torn cookie—reweights the premise without moralizing, suggesting truth propagates beyond control. However, the “quiet revolution” claim borders on abstract assertion, slightly diluting subtext. The paradox of accidental prophecy now made deliberate offers nuanced commentary on fate and authorship, though the ethical weight of encoding others’ lives remains underexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, color, and sound—not stated but enacted. The central question (“What is louder than a scream heard in a vacuum?”) reframes perception itself as the battleground, answered non-literally by the “gentle roar” of truth. Hidden assumptions are exposed not through exposition but through the indigo flare’s visual logic. The ending reweights all prior stillness as complicity, offering renewal without moralizing—resonance built from concrete particulars, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—longing as compass, not burden—emerges organically through Lian’s mapping of childhood memory onto shell and ice. The final fortune (“Your heart is the baton; the world is your score”) avoids moralizing by embedding insight in action: releasing the glass cookie externalizes internal shift. Subtext thrives in silence (“upended hush”) and objects (nautilus as memory-compass). Central question—can one conduct unseen melodies?—is answered non-literally through the lake’s chromatic ripples, reweighting all prior images without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: self-mastery requires embracing all timelines, not conquering them. The final image—tablet fragments sealing into fractured timelines—offers a non-literal answer that reweights every prior echo and regret. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (runes, viaduct, algorithm). However, the phrase “periodically eternal” borders on pseudo-profundity, slightly marring thematic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as fertile ground for feeling, not absence. The “filament of hush” and backward/forward songs serve as non-literal metaphors for emotional processing, culminating in the insight that reverse paths can guide forward courage. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete action (rewinding wax shells) and image (glowing filament matching heartbeat). The final paragraph invites reflection without stating a thesis, and the concept resists binaries—numbness isn’t evil, just reversible.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars: truth as something that moves through hidden channels, not declared openly. The final image—tube in shaft, cat as silent witness—offers non-literal resolution: integrity persists in quiet acts. Avoids moralizing; “honesty could survive even when the world shut its doors” is earned through action, not assertion. Ambiguity lingers (will the message arrive?), but resonance is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from scent-memory collisions, avoiding moralizing. The central question—why smells trigger tears—is answered not with explanation but with resonant reconfiguration: grief becomes a lantern that illuminates forgotten histories. The final image (Arlen stepping into twilight, carrying crystal shadows) offers a non-literal resolution that reweights every prior sensory detail. Subtext thrives in silence—the extinct plants “whisper” through aroma, embodying irrecoverable loss without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: time as both rope (binding past/future) and thread (weaving possibility). The final act—binding the frayed coil—offers a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting prior material: escape becomes preservation, loss becomes legacy. Subtext operates through image (rope frays echoing sighs) and gesture (ethically playful grin masking reverence), avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—was sealing the echo sacrifice or synthesis?—without confusion, inviting reflection on wanderers’ collective longing.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of sound, silence, and storytelling—not stated but embodied in the bowl’s resonance and the violin’s seed-like note. The central question—can beauty exist in incompleteness?—is answered non-literally through the final image: sparks as “quiet promise” that the story continues. Subtext thrives in gesture (placing the bowl at fire’s edge) and object behavior (vines whispering trapped notes). No moralizing; ambiguity lingers without confusion, honoring the unfinished as fertile ground.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: the commodification of emotional authenticity as both exploitation and mercy. The final image—Mara promising to “subsume sorrow into a comforting illusion”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether counterfeit empathy heals or harms. Subtext thrives in gesture (sealing the vial before rational doubt intrudes) and setting (grotto’s “subtle smile” mirroring hers). Avoids moralizing; instead, it lingers in ambiguity—her trade is cynical yet tender, transactional yet necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from objects and actions: the locket’s journey reweights silence into legacy, avoiding moralizing. The final image—listeners feeling hope from unnoticed deeds—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether compassion cycles reliably. Yet the “Compassion Register” verges on thematic echo, and the fishermen’s sudden gift-giving feels unearned by prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: belonging is not found but cultivated through shared vulnerability. The interlocking circles evolve from elusive tag to spiraled reed sculpture, embodying how connection expands through contribution. No moralizing—insights arise from Lira’s discovery and Arlen’s vow, not exposition. The final reconfiguration—that the ache softens into steady glow—offers a non-literal answer: healing isn’t erasure but transformation through collective care.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: time is not a river but a malleable substance shaped by attention and sacrifice. The infinity pendant’s loops mirror the cyclical nature of echoes, and Mira’s sketchbook “filled with the sound of time itself” reframes art as temporal sculpture. No moralizing—insight arises from concrete acts (pressing pendant into water, releasing it skyward). Final image reweights the premise: pauses aren’t breaks but generative seams. Ambiguity lingers (Is the giant real? Is time truly bent?), but resonance is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of recurring images—glass eyes, mosaic cracks, dripping stalactites—culminating in the insight that “grief plus hope equals new growth.” Subtext operates through silence, vibration, and geometry rather than declaration; the final petal-fall reweights prior loss into hopeful direction without moralizing. The story resists tidy binaries, presenting emotion as solvable yet mysterious, calculable yet poetic. Ambiguity lingers (What was lost? Who was mourned?), but the emotional aftereffect—buried optimism—is concrete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: visibility as ethical witness, not spectacle. The “sense memory of the city’s first sunrise” reframes archives as living grief, not dead data. The ending offers a non-literal answer—Maren’s shimmering presence—without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of observation, restraint, and natural reciprocity—never stated outright. The final image of the leaf’s reorganized veins offers a non-literal answer: healing is self-directed when space is given. Subtext thrives in gestures (fingers lingering on copper coil) and silence (the whispered promise). The story resists moralizing, instead letting the linden’s quiet unfurling reprice human notions of agency and care.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: paint as ground grief, rain as memory, art as covenant. The ending offers a non-literal answer—renewal isn’t water returned but meaning preserved in mist-varnished cliffs—repricing the wars’ trauma as generative. Subtext thrives in objects: the brooch isn’t jewelry but a compass calibrated to artistic integrity. No moralizing; resonance stems from Mara’s quiet return to paint the convergence, proving art endures even when hope is fleeting.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: unseen forces, when embraced, magnify hidden magic in ordinary life. Subtext lives in image—the amber tear, seed bread lifted into notes, child’s laughter becoming pearls—not assertion. The ending offers a non-literal answer: wonder resides not in foresight but in surrender to mystery. Avoids moralizing, yet the final paragraph flirts with abstraction (“magic hidden in everyday breath”), slightly diluting the otherwise earned resonance rooted in crystal, shadow, and song.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning arises not from completion but from shared incompleteness. The valve’s transformation—from herald of triumph to sponge of silence—reweights the premise without moralizing. Final image (community forming a map no single voice could sketch) offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how to navigate absence. Subtext lives in gaps, echoes, and the courage to let silence speak.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: truth resides not in fixed archives but in lived, silent narratives, and mapping becomes translation. The ledger’s glowing pages reprice the premise—maps are thoughts, colors are constellations—without moralizing. Final action (placing warm punch beside ledger) offers a non-literal answer: stewardship, not possession, is the resolution. Subtext thrives in tactile silence; no prompt-like thesis mars the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of doubt and wonder, embodied in the tile’s mutable primes and whale-song verses. The final image—whale breaches as “punctuation marks in the night”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: meaning resides not in decoding but in inhabiting patterned recurrence. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (memory never exactly repeats), yet emotional aftereffect is concrete. Recurring motifs (tile, whales, stars) accrue weight without symbolic shouting.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: goodbye as magnetic pivot, not severance. The twin’s whisper (“the world does not end; it folds”) offers non-literal insight that reweights all prior farewells. No moralizing—resonance comes via dust particles echoing goodbyes and the cavern’s sigh of relief. Ambiguity lingers (what lies beyond?), but the conceptual cost—eternity must include endings—is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: fairness as fluid reciprocity versus rigid law, tested through con artistry’s redemption. The final image—ink equations dissolving asylum bureaucracy—offers a non-literal answer: safety requires shared vulnerability, not legal shields. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (mathematical contract, liquefied doubts). Ambiguity lingers (can systems truly change?), but complexity isn’t false-balanced—corrupt officials vs. honest trade carries ethical weight without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, light, and inscription—history as both loss and reparation. The final insight (“invented histories were not lies but bridges”) avoids moralizing by grounding itself in the physical act of writing and the bonsai’s living form. Subtext thrives in the gap between the mute town and the rustling leaves that “sing” his stories. The refrain of refraction ties perception to time, offering a non-literal answer to how we recover what silence has swallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of erasure, memory, and archival labor—never stated outright. The final image (label as promise to keep gathering) offers a non-literal answer: truth resides not in documents but in layered witness. Subtext thrives in objects (death certificate vs. poison label) and setting (containers as steel tombs). Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the tension between official death and living remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of seashell, cello, and ledger—myths persist not through factual accuracy but through artistic retelling and stubborn curiosity. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the riddle dissolves into “a simple, cheering truth” that wonder survives via sound and story. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (the shell’s pulse, the cello’s echo). Subtext thrives in silence (Hale’s absent presence) and implication (tides as memory). Minor flaw: “epistemic compass” verges on jargon but is grounded by immediate metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: community resilience through encoded culture and adaptive spatial politics. The phoenix mural reweights the premise—not rebirth as erasure, but as protective synthesis of old and new. Subtext thrives in the graffiti’s duality (art/protest) and Mira’s dual allegiance. Avoids moralizing; the final image—children playing beneath the chip’s glow while elders plan—offers resonant ambiguity: hope is active, not passive, and victory is provisional.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the grain as memory-bearer, chemical timing as elegy. The ending reweights "dawning hush" from silence to active witness, answering the central question—can transience be captured?—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gestures (lowering the tripod, whispering to void) and avoids abstraction. Ambiguity lingers: will archivists truly hear the hush, or is this solace self-granted?

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: broken things can bridge to new horizons through meticulous, unseen care. The hummingbird’s repaired wing becomes a non-literal answer to the central question—how do we guide what we cannot see?—reweighting the premise that blindness limits vision. Final lines avoid moralizing; instead, “blind sight” crafting “luminous futures” resonates through concrete action, not assertion. Ambiguity lingers: is the drone truly autonomous, or merely an extension of Mara’s will?

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges through the tension between cartographic certainty and fluid reality: maps grow obsolete, rivers merge before their source dissolves, and silence births ice that births rivers. The final image—a “thin vein of water” glinting like a map line—offers a non-literal answer: origins are not fixed points but moments of convergence revealed through risk. No moralizing; resonance accrues via concrete particulars (glass, phrasebook, falcon). The conceptual repricing lies in accepting that mapping requires surrender to flux.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: balance between human pulse and architectural silence is restored not by decree but by resonant rhythm. The final image—children’s laughter weaving into rebuilding cadence—offers a non-literal answer: community thrives when spirit and structure listen to the same beat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: ephemeral beauty must be shared, not hoarded. The final image—releasing the scent into morning air—offers a non-literal answer to “can time’s hush be bottled?” without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: warnings as threads, not walls; silence as redemption, not erasure. The final image—bodies rising in “grateful silence” as the boy becomes a beacon—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the cry-wolf paradox. Subtext thrives in the lattice’s prayers and the hush’s mythic quality, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (Are the bodies real? Is this vision or action?), yet the emotional aftereffect—peace through purpose—is earned through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of debt, love, and resonance—never stated outright but embodied in the bead, the vines, and the ghost bride’s sacrifice. The final image reweights the premise: redemption isn’t linear repayment but cyclical resonance, where loss fertilizes future awakenings. Avoids moralizing; instead, travelers “weep with gratitude” from an echo they can’t name. The central question—can love be both poison and cure?—is answered non-literally through the orchard’s luminous bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of weaving, memory, and stone, resisting moralizing while offering a resonant answer: reverence arises not from rule but renewal. The final image—travelers guided by unseen threads, old guildmasters kneeling—reprices the value of tradition versus innovation without stating it. Subtext thrives in silence, absence, and luminous veins, avoiding sentimentality. However, the phrase “true art lay not in rule but in renewal” edges toward thematic echo, slightly undercutting the otherwise earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: faith as patient, embodied reconnection across diaspora and death. The restored altar offers a non-literal answer—ancestors speak not through magic but through renewed ritual. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “cautious enchantment.” However, the final sunrise metaphor verges on tidy resolution, slightly diluting complexity. Subtext thrives in root/bone symbiosis, mirroring fractured yet enduring lineage.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning resides in margins, not centers—a truth revealed through chalk lines, forgotten futures, and rooftop mailboxes. The final image (letter vibrating with “whispered margins of humanity”) offers a non-literal answer to Mara’s quest without moralizing. Subtext thrives in juxtaposition: analog chalk vs. quantum projection, idle arcade vs. pulsing heartbeat. No platitudes; insight arises from concrete acts (drawing, tracing, mailing), and the epiphany—“margins held the most luminous stories”—is earned through sensory accumulation, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: truth resides in gaps and adjacent possibilities, not official records. The final tapestry offers a non-literal answer—truth is constructed through patient, marginalized labor—and reweights every prior image (loom, flame, leaves). No moralizing; resonance arises from the contrast between the courier’s ignorance and the embroiderer’s quiet certainty. Wisdom-as-foolishness reframes power itself as a fabric to be rewoven.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as both wound and vessel, healed not by words but by the act of evocation. The final image—fireflies as “bright promise waiting for a new voice”—offers a non-literal answer: apology transcends speech when truth is embodied. No moralizing; complexity lingers (healing requires surrender, not articulation). Motifs (shard, condensation) accrue meaning without tokenism—they enable the thematic pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the coral motif: resilience as regrowth over scars, not erasure. The final image—shared anxieties blooming into quiet strength—offers a non-literal, resonant answer to war’s fragmentation. However, the line “I am scared of night because the sky is a cracked mirror of bombs” edges toward thematic echo, risking explicitness. Subtext thrives in gesture (placing the droplet) but occasionally slips into declarative lyricism (“turning shared anxieties into quiet strength”).

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: light as tilled emotion, art as communal memory, joy as recoverable even in ruin. The final image—laughter echoing through centuries—offers a non-literal answer to loss, reweighting silence into chorus without moralizing. Recurring motifs (fresco fragment, fog, pensive mirth) accrue meaning, and the artist’s realization (“true power… to illuminate hearts”) feels earned through embodied action. Avoids sentimentality by grounding transcendence in tactile detail (photon-kissed pigment, mist-softened laughter).

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of sound, memory, and restoration—curiosity as generative force versus certainty as stasis. The final image (ripples turning echoes into murals) offers a non-literal answer: listening begets creation. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether this is liberation or loss. The hobo nickel’s evolution from secret to conduit reframes the entire premise, fulfilling Conceptual Repricing with resonant specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of seed, soil, and secrecy: resistance as cultivation, not confrontation. The final image—a greenhouse transformed into a “living cipher that could outlast any tax on thoughts”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (Mirabel’s pause, the seedlings’ leaf-turns) and avoids binary oppositions; bureaucracy is evaded, not defeated, preserving complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: art as alchemy of suffering, where scars become petals. The central question—can pain be redeemed through creation?—is answered non-literally in the final image: the shell becomes a library of light, and a child continues the work. Subtext thrives in gesture (pressing the postcard to his ribs) and image (nebulae blooming like roses), avoiding moralizing. The “blossom armistice” concept reweights light/shadow duality without stating a thesis, though its abstract phrasing risks slight opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: memory persists through fragile, deliberate acts of care, not grand gestures. The final image—the cracked chime ringing as the traveler steps into clouds—reweights all prior rituals as necessary, ongoing labor. No moralizing; subtext lives in objects (the chime’s fractured harmony = fragmented memory). The “desert of lost emotions” blooming again is earned through concrete action (sealing sound in vials), not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through action: truth as symphonic dialogue, not static record. The covenant reframes silence as betrayal, and Elara’s method (“interconnected promises”) embodies trust as active reciprocity. Final image—wind stirring parchments, archive breathing—answers the central question non-literally: memory lives through engagement. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the keepers’ silent gratitude, implying ongoing duty.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the chain’s transformation from measuring tool to empathy ledger and the floodgate’s redefinition from power source to conduit of shared humanity. The final image—water as “a word in the ongoing encrypted compassion”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (the elder’s clasp) and environment (ash aligning like notes). Avoids false equivalence: preservation and progress are reconciled not by compromise but by reimagining infrastructure as relational.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of dust, paper, meteorite, and flight—reinvention as layering, not erasure. The final image (the glowing map as testament to coexisting balance and memory) offers a non-literal answer to loss: echoes persist when carried outward. Subtext thrives in gesture (attaching slivers) and silence (vendors humming back), avoiding moralizing. The moss-over-stone metaphor feels earned, not imposed, though the “lost songs” motif occasionally borders on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: thresholds as pauses where distance becomes meaning, woven through grain, code, and breath. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the sacred is not found but carried—and reweights the maze from prison to ritual space. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete acts (hand on map, step into stalks). Ambiguity lingers (What is the butterfly effect? Who are the unseen architects?), yet resonance is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of celestial mapping and tidal memory, culminating in the insight that belonging is a “flowing sequence” echoing stars and currents. The burnt feather’s transformation into a map of forgotten tides reweights its meaning without moralizing. Subtext thrives in images: fireflies as living stars, ash remembering a comet, walls breathing lullabies. The ending offers a non-literal answer—belonging as dynamic alignment—resisting tidy resolution while leaving emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: paths vanish not from loss but from lack of emotional resonance, and healing requires gathering fragments with feeling. No moralizing—insight arises through concrete acts (seed + glass = hue = path). Final image—Maren’s “heart a mosaic of hopeful sorrow”—offers non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting “missing pieces” as recoverable through empathy. Ambiguity lingers (new seeds promise mysteries), avoiding tidy resolution while affirming purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: chaos contains latent order if one listens. The bishop’s repositioning, ink swirl, and violin notes all dramatize this without moralizing. Final image—clean bishops after the tide—reprices the premise: creation is temporary, but intention imbues meaning. Avoids sentimentality; the applause is for revelation, not spectacle. Subtext thrives in gesture (tilting bishops) and silence between acts.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: chosen solitude as conduit for universal expression. The central question—can mortal flesh carry cosmic meaning?—is answered non-literally through the glowing forearm rune and silvered night-bloom. Subtext thrives in images: obsidian ink swallowing darkness only to return it as constellations, dust drifting toward dawn. No moralizing; the final stanza carried “to every wandering soul” invites reflection without assertion. The theme resists binaries—exile isn’t rejected but reconfigured—embracing complexity with quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of light, water, and craft—worth is revealed through attention, not inherent. The final image of the harbor “reading between lines of wind and water” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the phrase “noctilucent reckonings” edges toward label-speak, and the insight borders on familiar lyric tropes (mundane as sacred). Still, the specificity of the glazier’s ritual and the prism’s refraction elevate it beyond platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from object and action: cracks become lenses, pain becomes light, silence becomes language. The final image—a cascade of luminous syllables settling on children’s faces—offers a non-literal answer to whether suffering can be made communicable. No moralizing; insight arises from the box’s transformation via collective understanding. The paradox of “hard softness” embodies thematic complexity without false equivalence, and the central question (Can pain be translated?) is resolved through concrete, resonant particulars, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: hope as a measurable, communal resonance between art and logic. The final image—shoreline pathways turned into a “living textbook of optimism”—offers a non-literal answer to whether belief can be calibrated. Subtext thrives in the gauge’s transformation from instrument to mirror, avoiding moralizing. Yet the epiphany leans slightly toward assertion (“mathematics of hope were etched into the world”) rather than pure dramatization, costing it full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: silent histories live in stone and require attentive listening. The final image reframes mapping as participation in collective memory, not extraction. Subtext operates through gesture (tokens left by scholars) and silence (the hum). Avoids moralizing; instead, offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the true map is of shared imagination.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—possibilities as dormant reflections awaiting activation—emerges organically through image and action, not assertion. The final doors reprice the premise: mirrors don’t just reflect, they reveal futures. However, the closing lines verge on thematic echo (“possibilities are merely reflections waiting for a borrowed heartbeat”), slightly undercutting earned resonance with near-moralizing. Subtext thrives in the lullaby cipher and trembling mirrors, avoiding sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the clipboard’s transformation from burden to hope-canvas, swords as feast-offerings, celestial rhythm as moral compass. No moralizing—the final hymn is “flawed beauty,” echoing the opening. Redemption’s price is shown, not stated: listening, compassion, relinquishing grudges. The recurring “slow dance” motif reweights war’s futility into fragile unity, offering a non-literal answer: peace as ongoing practice, not victory.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between engineered erasure and fragile preservation. The final image—a drought-born salt flat amplifying an extinct bird’s wingbeat—offers a non-literal answer to whether cruelty can coexist with tenderness. Subtext thrives in gesture (vanishing boot prints, sealed quartz) and avoids moralizing; the story resists binaries, allowing the philanthropist to be both monstrous and mournful. The recurring crack-map shifts from instrument of control to relic of “fractured grace,” reweighting the premise without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, voice, and conformity, crystallized in the transformation of snowflakes into narrative punctuation and echoes into rebellion. The ending offers a non-literal answer: quiet defiance can rewrite collective stories. However, the phrase “lullaby of conformity” borders on thematic labeling, and the moral—that individual voices break monotony—edges close to assertion in the final paragraph, slightly undercutting subtextual restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from Selene’s ritual: power in storytelling resides not in the teller but in the listener’s interpretive autonomy. The final image—puppets turning toward the audience with “half-lit knowledge”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful; the “half-glow” resists didacticism while affirming ethical responsibility. No thematic echo or abstraction mars the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Lira’s actions: remembrance need not be monumental to be meaningful. The moth wing, knots, and bioluminescent moss coalesce into a non-literal answer—the quiet anthem carried by wind proves more enduring than stone. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture: the grotto “inhales,” clouds “bow,” and Lira’s smile mirrors the stillness, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights the entire premise: what vanishes can still guide, if honored with intention. No false equivalence; the story stakes a clear position against historical erasure without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through action: memory as living conduit, not archive. The final image—Eira’s name joining the chorus—offers a non-literal answer: preservation requires ongoing participation, not passive storage. No moralizing; insight arises from copper glowing, frost becoming light. The rope’s transformation reweights the premise—memory is woven, not frozen—fulfilling Conceptual Repricing with emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of path, walker, and promise—rejecting passive destiny in favor of reciprocal selection grounded in narrative balance. The final image offers a non-literal answer: paths listen and reward “precise playfulness,” reweighting the initial question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (placing the seal), silence (the bunker’s hum), and the storm’s dual mournfulness and hope. No platitudes; insight arises from concrete particulars like spores anticipating footfalls and the seal’s teasing hum.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: precise human measurement, when infused with devotion, resonates cosmically. The final glyphs beside constellations offer a non-literal answer—accounting as sacred practice—without moralizing. Recurring “ledger” imagery accrues weight, and the covenant’s prosperity reward avoids sentimentality by tying blessing to wisdom (“rewarding those who measured wisely”).

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the music box’s behavior and the sanctuary’s response, never stated outright. The final image—wanderer kneeling in gratitude as anger dissolves into stone—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether resentment can be released. Subtext thrives in silence, vibration, and cellular memory, avoiding moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: Is change truly lasting? Can one act undo bloodshed?

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: boundaries dissolve not by removal but interweaving (“separate songs”). The final realization—that erasing space between expands the world—is earned through concrete ritual, not stated. Subtext lives in vapor-sealed brass and apple-scented wind; no moralizing. The dream as “luminous thread of hope” avoids sentimentality by tying to tangible repair and ongoing duty.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from recurring images: cracked quartz, falling leaves, tangled ribbon—all reweighted by the end to signify renewal through care. No moralizing; wisdom is “accidental” yet earned via action. The final image—sunlight through stained glass on mended lenses—offers a non-literal answer: healing isn’t restoration but realignment with living cycles. Subtext thrives in gesture (kneeling, whispering vows) and avoids binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (shell cameo), action (inquiry), and setting (orchard/bathroom), rejecting tidy binaries in favor of paradox (“knowledge is a garden that grows in loops”). The final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer: tending bewilderment, not harvesting certainty, is the path to insight. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the “brightened disquiet.” The great-grandmother’s whisper deepens lineage complexity without resolving it sentimentally.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge isn’t stored but co-created through curiosity and silence. The “unheard symphony” evolves from ambient detail to resonant metaphor for epistemological humility. The ending offers no moral but a reconfiguration—the blank scrolls teach how to listen between words—reweighting all prior imagery without statement. Ambiguity lingers (What are the next rescues?), but the core insight feels earned through Selene’s precise, embodied acts, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: forgotten language holds latent freedom, and storytelling resurrects silenced voices. The garden’s blossoms bearing lost words offer a resonant, non-literal answer to linguistic erasure without moralizing. Subtext thrives in recurring images—cracked mirrors, rust, emerald light—that shift from decay to renewal. However, the insight (“true recapture was not of objects, but of stories”) borders on declarative summary, slightly undercutting earned resonance despite strong imagistic groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: absence shapes reality as powerfully as presence. This isn’t stated but demonstrated through the rope’s reweaving, the door’s dissolution, and the frozen clock. The final line—“clarity thrives when the unknown is acknowledged”—resonates without moralizing, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. The “fables of absence” aren’t abstract; they’re embodied in objects and actions, avoiding pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: quiet is not absence but balance between echo and silence. This insight arises from concrete action—melting ice, humming stone—not exposition. The final line (“he had conjured the quiet… by listening”) offers a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting earlier fractures as guides rather than damage. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the energy beings’ departure, suggesting peace is fragile, not permanent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: fractured things become whole through alignment, not perfection. The “thistle-blown hope” motif evolves from private metaphor to communal symbol without moralizing.

    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of light, stone, and rain—collective memory as geometry, not just narrative. The final image (shadows as “quiet testament”) offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence: the crystal’s fading whisper implies memory’s fragility, while the archivist’s smile suggests acceptance of burden. Avoids abstraction by rooting insight in concrete acts (measuring, recording, tracing), though “preemptively nostalgic” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of fire, mosaic, and chant—hope as fragmented, collective creation rather than grand salvation. The ending offers a non-literal answer: despair is not erased but filtered into art that lingers for others. Avoids moralizing by grounding insight in concrete acts (stitching rags, releasing sparks). Resonance arises from the reweighted “note in mosaic,” now glowing with shared defiance rather than forgotten silence.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of tide, pause, and cicada—time as cyclical, conflict as tidal. The final image reweights the opening metaphor: “time is not a line but a sea,” transforming abstract philosophy into embodied wisdom. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete observation. The cicada’s silence post-transition underscores that true foresight lies in sensing intention, not predicting words—a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: vastness can dwell in confinement if perception expands. The porcelain doll’s paradox (“intangibly tangible”) mirrors the story’s core insight—silence has texture, taste, and form. Final image avoids moralizing; instead, the humming corridors embody earned resonance. Subtext thrives in gesture (placing the doll, whispering gratitude) rather than exposition, though the phrase “gilded hush of the heavens” borders on ornamental abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of sound, silence, and transit—never stated outright until the final whisper, which avoids moralizing by being diegetic and character-bound. The storm glass’s transformation from predictor to catalyst to empty vessel reweights the premise: comfort isn’t found but taught through disciplined attention. The ending offers a non-literal answer—peace as collective breath—resonating with earlier images without tidy resolution. Subtext lives in droplets “ringing without sound” and silence that “settles like dust on a page.”

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)

However, the thematic resolution leans slightly toward harmonious synthesis without exploring the tension’s darker or more ambiguous edges.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme—renewal through sacrificial isolation—emerges organically from concrete particulars: burning bridges as reverence, scars as conduits, breath as lesson. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing: the keeper’s silhouette merges with starlight, proving darkness can exhale. Subtext thrives in silence (“loaded quiet, dense with the breath of countless unseen eyes”) and gesture (leaving the humming ring as relic). Avoids binary resolution; ambiguity lingers (who are the unseen eyes?) while affirming earned connection.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: survival trauma becomes the very tool for alchemical transformation, rejecting extractive promises for collaborative creation. The final image—diamonds scattering mushroom glow into “shadowseam wonder”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: can pressure birth beauty? Yes, but only when volunteered honestly. No moralizing; the ledger’s violet glow and dissolving spores imply cost without stating it. Recurring motifs (bolt, pressure, glitter) accrue meaning through use, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: true history resides not in records but in patterns sensed through patient attention. The “bridge of intuition” isn’t stated but enacted—Lian’s physical actions embody the thesis. The ending reweights silence from void to vessel, offering a non-literal answer: legacy is preserved not by proclamation but by listening. Avoids moralizing; the confession’s content critiques willful ignorance, and Lian’s response models curiosity as antidote. Resonance lingers without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: loyalty as song, not chain; possibility as collaborative performance. The marionette program’s reappearance—now glowing—reweights its meaning from relic to living conduit. Final image (night as canvas awaiting sunrise) offers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, vapor, and spores; no thematic echo or abstraction mars resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from object and action: the button isn’t a symbol but a catalyst that reconfigures archival silence into voiced care. The final image—a blank file stirred to life by the same mechanism—offers a non-literal answer to whether small kindnesses endure. Avoids moralizing; resonance accrues through pattern (dust → silhouette → sketch) rather than assertion. However, the thematic equation of dust = memory verges on over-neat, slightly softening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: indifference is tyranny, and memory is resistance. The final image—water as a living chart, echoes reappearing from depths—offers a non-literal answer to how the oppressed rewrite history: not by force, but persistent ripples. Avoids moralizing; instead, the lagoon’s shimmer embodies hope. Recurring motifs (key, reflections, transmission) accumulate meaning without forced symbolism, though the phrase “tyranny of indifference” borders on label-speak.

The final image—a phantom chord lingering in the valley’s breath—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (can sound undo doom?) without moralizing. Recurring motifs (dewdrops, mist, prisms) accrue meaning, culminating in the saxophone case clicking “like a secret seal,” which reweights earlier whispers as sacred duty. Ambiguity lingers (will he return?), resisting tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: remembrance as active reciprocity between human and forest. The final image—moonstone dust rising as mist after the leaf offering—reweights all prior acts as covenantal, not merely scholarly. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (twine altars, seed rows, glowing water). The story resists binaries, honoring both order (rows, decoding) and mystery (spirits, prophecy), with ambiguity lingering in the promise of “new riddles” each season.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from object and action: the compass isn’t explained but enacted, its inscription (“let uncertainty guide the heart of invention”) feeling earned because Mara has already lived its truth through tactile exploration. Final image—a clock pulsing with waterfall rhythm—offers non-literal answer: time isn’t repaired but reinvented through embrace of flux. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “uncertainly certain” while rejecting false binaries (order vs. chaos).

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of naming, brokenness, and repair—never stated outright. The final image (coin sealed with a “sunrise caught in a river of steel”) offers a non-literal answer: names carry weight not as anchors but as seams of golden intention. Subtext operates through silence (the absent search party), gesture (whispering twice), and the kintsugi act itself. Avoids moralizing; instead, it embraces ambiguity—redemption is continuous, not complete—and resists tidy resolution while affirming quiet purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through precise particulars: grief requires not absolution but mirth; broken music can mend souls. The final image—laughter echoing as a joyous hum—offers a non-literal answer to whether sorrow can be redeemed, reweighting all prior spectral sighs. No moralizing; insight arises from Mara’s embodied act, not reflection. Ambiguity lingers (Can all grief be healed this way?), but the story stakes a coherent claim on laughter’s reparative power.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of pain, memory, and calculation. The equation avoids moralizing by grounding abstraction in sensory particulars—the humming roots, the glowing moss, the pewter’s warmth. Final resonance lies in the strap’s transformation from shackle to beacon, offering a non-literal answer: mercy requires holding pain, not transcending it. However, the phrase “mathematics of mercy” risks pseudo-profundity despite strong contextual anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: overlooked histories gain voice through attentive seeing, not declaration. The final image—fragment light spreading as incense for unsung sailors—offers a non-literal answer to “how do we honor what was lost?” Subtext operates through gesture (whispering promises, sketching the lighthouse) and avoids moralizing. Complexity is preserved: memory is both personal inheritance and collective beacon, with no tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: truth resides in fissures, not façades; listening is reparative labor. The cracked ceiling isn’t flaw but frame—a non-literal answer to how we honor the forgotten. No moralizing; resonance comes via ledger, mirrors, and ticking heart. Ambiguity lingers (what promises were broken?), but closure reweights the premise: hauntings are archives awaiting witness. Final image of stars syncing with Mara’s barrel offers earned, unsentimental hope.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically: perfection is illusion; true wonder requires rupture. Subtext lives in action—Mara doesn’t state this but enacts it by breaking the system. Final image (lattice of eternal moments) offers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. The bottled whisper’s evolution from threat to catalyst reweights all prior imagery, achieving Conceptual Repricing with lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme—sorrow as catalyst for creation—emerges organically through the shard’s journey from weapon-forging hands to story-crafting ones. Subtext lives in gesture (covering mirrors), silence (elders’ softened arguments), and image (fractured edge as compass). The ending offers a non-literal answer: true revolution is symphonic, not combative. Avoids moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (translucent cloth, burnished sorrow) rather than abstraction. Final vow (“Let the mirrors remember…”) deepens without stating.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: truth as structural integrity, decay as memory, repair as prayer. The covenant of rust reframes corrosion not as failure but as archive—mended not by force but by coaxing iron to “remember its original song.” Final image (music box playing at dawn) offers non-literal resolution: harmony restored through honest labor, not conquest. Avoids moralizing; instead, the luminous lattice embodies the thesis. Subtext thrives in gesture (whispered incantation, gentle alignment) rather than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of collection and surrender: the futility of capturing ephemera versus the grace of yielding to mystery. The final image—Mara walking toward gathering rain, compass aloft—offers a non-literal answer: awakenings reside not in destinations but in openness to the next drop. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (petrichor, compass, water-staircase). The fossil-lined cavern and star-water whirl reweight earlier motifs without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: learning as bridge-building across time, where scars become stories. The final image—a child holding a carved boat—reweights all prior driftwood as vessels of wonder, not waste. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (salt-smelling palms, glowing ropes). However, “timewoven alliances” edges toward abstraction without enough on-page friction to ground its conceptual weight, slightly diluting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: night bloom as a metaphor for hope persisting in darkness, unlocked not by logic but by layered memory and attention. The final image—flowers unfolding beneath a listening moon—offers a non-literal answer: blooming is a shared secret, a dialogue between eras and elements. Avoids moralizing; instead, the cathedral’s hidden lenses reframe perception itself as the bridge. Subtext thrives in the postcards’ collective memory and the “umbral tenderness” that wraps Mara—a phrase that encapsulates the story’s ethos without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: truth as recoverable light, memory as collective responsibility. The crystal’s spectral paragraphs and the zeppelin’s broadcast reject passive archivism in favor of active restitution. Final image—lanterns illuminating nomad faces—offers non-literal resolution: memory reclaimed becomes communal beacon. Avoids moralizing; complexity resides in the diary being both “key and cage,” honoring silence while breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as generative force, not nostalgic chain. The final image—lanterns reflecting new households born of recalled intention—offers a non-literal answer to whether the past can build futures. Subtext thrives in objects: the amber bottle shifts from vessel of broken promise to empty echo, reweighting “comfort” as truth. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars like “cracked jars refilled with ideas instead of oil.”

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as active preservation, not passive storage. The orchard teaches that dead languages live through emotional resonance, not just syntax—a non-literal answer to “why does the city sing?” Final image reweights prior material: children’s hands in soil become the seed of future archivists. No moralizing; complexity abides in the loop’s inevitability without redemption or escape. Subtext thrives in objects (wax, vellum, fruit) rather than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: time as cultivatable texture, not commodity. The final image—Mira planting a seed shimmering with “vortex inheritance”—offers non-literal resolution, reweighting earlier abstractions into actionable wisdom. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “borrowed time”’s ethics. Recurrence of “wild serenity” deepens subtext without redundancy, though “furiously tranquil” borders on label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the bell’s transformation: true understanding requires disciplined receptivity, not brute signaling. The final note fading into “solstice quiet” offers a non-literal answer—listening as rebellion against “ever-growing clamor”—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gestures: laying aside the rope, recording data at dawn. Avoids binaries; the old mechanism isn’t evil, just insufficient for this new covenant with chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: vulnerability as fertile ground for quiet strength, stillness as active flourishing. The final image—cracks in stone reflecting brave stars, dawn arriving within—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Recurring motifs (lantern, star paths, hum) accumulate meaning, and the story resists tidy resolution, embracing ambiguity in cosmic empathy. No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as sacred duty, memory as fragile covenant. The final image—the amber tear sealing cracked earth—offers a non-literal answer to whether unspoken words can heal. No moralizing; subtext thrives in gesture (tracing ruby lines) and object (glowing box). Recurring bees/honey motif shifts from elegy to latent revival, reweighting loss as stewardship without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: time is mended not by mechanics but shared memory. The garage-sale notes forming a lattice of stories reprice the initial quest from individual revelation to communal ritual. The final image—Mara walking a tapestry of moments—answers the central question non-literally, avoiding moralizing. However, the insight leans slightly toward lyrical affirmation rather than confronting ambiguity or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the feather, lagoon, and fragmented mornings—beauty thrives in the incomplete. The final image of the glowing lagoon reweights prior fragments into a living tapestry, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the insight borders on stated moral (“true art was never a finished picture”) in mid-text, slightly undercutting subtextual resonance. Still, ambiguity lingers in the quiet rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from copper-wire rituals and stone-tree dialogue rather than assertion. The final image—Mara sustained by the orchard’s vigor—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: can respect for non-human life extend human meaning beyond death? Subtext operates through gesture (children sketching oaks, visitors pausing in gratitude), avoiding moralizing. However, the phrase “willingness of all beings to bind together” edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting the otherwise earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: amber as time-capsule, dusty footprints as artificial pilgrimage. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—home as reciprocal dialogue—without moralizing. However, “bronze quiet” and “chemistry of homecoming” verge on pseudo-profundity when repeated abstractly. The strongest subtext lives in images (amber light on wet stones), but late passages lean into declarative lyricism (“curiosity could forge homecoming”) that borders on prompt-echo.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: language as ecological bridge, memory as fertilizer, silence as fertile ground. The final image—garden scent rising over dead reef—offers a non-literal answer to loss: not healing, but coexistence. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (reef won’t return, but lavender sprouts). Recurring “narrow vastness” motif reweights scale and purpose without overt symbolism, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as bridge across loss, not erasure of grief. The leaf’s “mute testimony” and “tinted revelations” avoid moralizing, instead offering a resonant, non-literal answer—closeness through preserved sensation. Final image reweights the wasteland as “tapestry stitched from whispered myths,” transforming desolation into continuity. No platitudes; ambiguity lingers in whether voices are real or imagined.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of ritual, memory, and temporal distortion—loss is not overcome but woven into a new cartography of hope. The final image of a “map not of streets but of possibilities” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: how to navigate when all bearings vanish. Subtext thrives in silence, vibration, and charcoal lines; no moralizing intrudes. However, the conceptual elegance slightly overshadows human messiness, edging toward lyrical abstraction without grounding friction.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: theft as restitution, play as sacred duty, wonder as bridge across time. The final image—children spinning the sundial, absorbing the spire’s secret—answers the central question non-literally: amending the world means passing wonder forward. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete actions (carving, swapping, descending). Ambiguity lingers (what next betrayal?), but the cost—eternal vigilance—is legible in Lysander’s recurring smile under violet skies.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: small acts sustain hope during collapse. No moralizing—insight arises from concrete particulars (child offering blanket). The chessboard’s missing pawns reframe power structures, and the nomadic penumbra embodies history’s selective gaze. Final image (“quiet compass for any ruler”) offers resonant, non-literal answer to “What survives crisis?” Ambiguity lingers (Will rulers heed this record?), avoiding tidy resolution while affirming Mira’s role.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object, setting, and action: home as resonance, not fixed point, is demonstrated through the stone’s hum syncing with the mountain’s ribs. The final image—pages releasing scent instead of ink—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence: the mother’s lullaby echoes distantly, implying loss without exposition. Ambiguity lingers (Is the mountain alive? Is memory real?), but never confuses the emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: forgiveness as iterative “openings,” not single moves, resonates through chess metaphors without moralizing. The final image—village breath releasing as time advances—reweights prior stillness as earned rebirth, not escape. Subtext thrives in silence (“woven hush”) and action (dissolving pawn), avoiding abstraction. Yet the insight borders on neat; the absence of counter-readings (e.g., is self-forgiveness deserved?) slightly flattens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: forgiveness requires surrender of singular truth for plural memory. The final line (“We are the echo”) offers a non-literal answer—identity as resonance—not moralizing. However, phrases like “the price of forgiveness had been paid in the language of art” verge on thematic echo, slightly diluting subtext. Complexity is preserved; no tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the kintsugi metaphor enacted through narration—brokenness becomes luminous not by erasure but acceptance. The final image (“stitching distant hearts together across the abyss”) offers a non-literal answer to whether stories can heal fractures. Subtext operates through recurring motifs (charm, seams, breaths) that accrue weight without moralizing. However, the phrase “kintsugi intentions” borders on thematic labeling, slightly undercutting full subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of art, memory, and impermanence, crystallized in the final image: a painted seashell holding “temporary eternity.” The story avoids moralizing; instead, it offers a non-literal answer—eternity resides not in preservation but in loving re-creation. Recurring motifs (mirror, shell, canvas) accrue meaning without forced symbolism, and the vellum’s cryptic message (“eternity will linger within a breath”) reframes the entire quest as internal. Subtext thrives in silence: the painter never speaks, yet his devotion radiates through gesture and gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: tenderness as force, silence as reach. The final cascade of humming light reweights the premise without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars—jasmine, brass lantern, cracked cork. However, the epiphany (“whispers truly travel farther”) borders on thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph, slightly undercutting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the navigator’s labor: reverse migration as necessary cartography of absence. The censer foot’s evolving patina and the lattice engine transform abstract loss into audible currents, avoiding moralizing. Final image—ships turning westward like constellations—offers non-literal answer: home is not a place but a path retraced through grief. Subtext thrives in silence (the hush before dawn) and gesture (lifting the censer), resisting binaries while embracing complexity of return.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: empathy without virus, truth as cultivation not compulsion. The glass eye’s transformation—from smuggled relic to communal mirror—answers the central question non-literally. Final paragraph avoids moralizing; “courage to reflect it together” arises from prior particulars (truffles, moss, storm). Subtext thrives in silence, glances, and the eye’s “frozen tear” quality—no prompt-like thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as fragile yet persistent, isolation as fertile ground for connection. The Edelweiss—alpine, out of place, enduring—mirrors the stranger’s gesture and Marlowe’s response without overt symbolism. The final image reweights silence: gaps become “ribbons of gold that whispered of memory,” offering a non-literal answer to whether fleeting lives matter. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (pressed bloom, tidal cadence), and ambiguity lingers—Who was the stranger? Why Edelweiss?—without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: decisions are relational acts echoing kept promises, not isolated choices. The final image—maps pulsing with light as travelers approach—resonates without moralizing, reweighting earlier solitude as connection. Subtext thrives in ants as guides and water as timekeeper, avoiding abstraction. Only slight over-articulation (“empirically intuitive”) risks pseudo-profundity, but earned wisdom prevails.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: disenchantment healed not by power but by understanding dreams as maps. The recurring dream reframes from curse to guide, offering a non-literal answer about listening to inner voices. However, the final vow (“ensuring no future dream would bleed unchecked”) edges toward moralizing, slightly undercutting ambiguity. Subtext thrives in images—crown as key, fireflies as fragile pact—but risks sentimentality in the closing sigh of clouds.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: true alchemy is seeing light in ash, valuing presence over profit. Subtext thrives in gesture—the shared brush dips, whispered vow—and avoids moralizing until the final whisper, which borders on explicit but is redeemed by its intimate delivery. The nautilus shell’s curl mirrors thematic recurrence, reweighting “returning differently” as cyclical renewal rather than linear progress.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of scroll, soaring, and grave—nostalgia as both burden and engine. The ending offers a non-literal answer: stories, not death, mark time; the grave becomes generative. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (birch bark warming, fox dissolving). Ambiguity lingers—can he truly soar again?—but the emotional aftereffect (jaded wonder as “soft blanket”) feels earned, complex, and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: ordinary miracles reside in forgotten fragments, revealed through attentive care. Subtext lives in silence, fog, and metal—not stated but enacted. The ending offers a non-literal answer: love’s first sigh is carried not by flesh but by steel, reweighting the entire premise. No moralizing; resonance arises from the screw’s transformation and Lena’s quiet kinship with the passing mother. Complexity is preserved—miracles require loss (smell, anonymity) to be seen.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: wounds become narratives that bind rather than isolate. The final image—scars glowing as “luminous verses ready to be read”—offers a non-literal answer to whether pain can be repurposed, reweighting every prior mention of runes and scars. No moralizing; resonance arises from the quill’s transformation, the grandmother’s chant, the tea’s heartbeat ripple. Ambiguity lingers (will these stories heal others?), but emotional honesty grounds it in embodied hope.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: gossip as both wound and balm, forgiveness as imperfect reconstruction. The broken mirror metaphor refracts through actions (spiral of torn scores, lingering chord), avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer—apologies persist beyond silence—reweighting earlier destruction as potential space for resonance. Only slight risk of sentimentality in “gritty miracles can be sweet” tempers full thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: truth is not found but forged through recursive synthesis (“spiral arbitration”), and endings are thresholds, not termini. The final image—dictionary humming on a pedestal, temple awaiting the next wanderer—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in paradox (“journeying inward while walking out”) and resonant objects. However, the theme leans toward abstract cosmology over human-scale complexity, limiting counter-readings and grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: time as relational rhythm, not linear tick. The recurring image of “razor edges” shifts from mechanical threat to shoreline respect, reweighted by the shepherd’s realization. No moralizing—the insight arises from concrete particulars (key’s hum, water’s lap, gear tremor). Final image offers non-literal answer: measurement is “quiet agreement between machine and nature,” reconfiguring the premise without stating it. Ambiguity lingers (is the sea answering?), but cost is undeniable—he walks away from his post.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: “letting go” reframes security as responsive attunement rather than rigid defense. The laser’s beam—harmless yet revealing—embodies this paradox, and the final image (birds applauding invisible guardians) offers resonant, non-literal closure. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from testing the system in crisis. However, the phrase “quiet wildfire of progress” borders on abstraction, slightly diluting the otherwise earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of gambling, grief, and mathematical inquiry, crystallizing in the “lucid contradiction” theorem that embraces both certainty and chance. The final image—closing the ledger while lighting the lantern for the next wanderer—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in objects (mica pane as mediator between order and chaos) and avoids abstraction. However, the mother’s death functions more as mood than active thematic counterweight, slightly limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the loop’s evolution: endings as cyclical beginnings, isolation as bridgeable. The final image—Mara stepping out as the disc spins on—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the unspoken “Thank you”) and object (the disc’s charged reuse). Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in tactile ritual rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: small moments hold cosmic weight, and remembrance is an active, cyclical ritual. The locket’s return in the final image reweights its meaning—from frozen sepia to “tiny moon” reflecting covenantal glow—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in tactile details (walnut ink, tarnished glass) that embody impermanence and care. However, the phrase “regenerated covenant” edges toward abstraction, and the lighthouse pact feels invented to service theme rather than arising from character history, slightly diluting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: loneliness is cured not by objects but by initiating chains of generosity. The moon rock’s echo becomes metaphor for human resonance, and the final image—fragment sent in a lantern, next keeper extending a joke—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (sharing warmth through “imagined reciprocity”) and avoids sentimentality. The central question (“Can connection be catalyzed?”) is answered through action, not assertion, and the ambiguity lingers: will the chain hold? That uncertainty enriches rather than confuses.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: true navigation requires empathy, not sight. The final image—Lira walking “blind yet seeing”—reweights all prior sensory detail into a non-literal answer about inner cartography. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (ring’s resonance, bark’s pulse). Ambiguity lingers (What does she do next?), but emotional honesty avoids sentimentality—love, loss, and hope converge as felt experience, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: editing history requires listening, not control; redemption lies in coexisting doubt and confidence. The pen’s transformation—from relic of failure to instrument of repair—reweights prior material without moralizing. Final image (“stars aligned… seemed to smile”) offers non-literal answer: universe rewards humility that embraces paradox. Subtext thrives in gesture (whispering to pen) and silence (anomaly’s dimming echo), avoiding abstraction while resisting tidy binaries—chaos isn’t vanquished, only harmonized.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: creation thrives in forgotten moments, absence can birth melody. The final image—Lira walking toward cliffs, vowing to return—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture, water, and moonlight; no thematic echo or sermonizing. The paradox of “joyful sorrow” encapsulates the story’s emotional and philosophical complexity without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: fire as destroyer vs. preserver, stories as cultural fire. The phoenix mural offers a non-literal answer—redemption through art, not erasure. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (tapestry fragment, scorched circle).

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: sorrow births light not through assertion but through the lagoon’s transformation, the orbs’ ascent, and the staff’s dream-altered protocols. The ending offers a non-literal answer—rebellion as communal rhythm—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the unspoken pull in researchers’ dreams) and gesture (Lira’s whiskered cheek touched by memory-orb). Avoids sentimentality by grounding hope in tangible consequence: protocol shifts, seedlings sprout, stars pulse—resonance made material.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars—the coin, map, storm—not moralizing. The final parchment (“Whispers are the true currents”) offers a non-literal answer that reweights all prior actions without stating a thesis. Subtext operates through silence, resonance, and the contrast between static radios and carried whispers. Ambiguity lingers: is the labyrinth sentient, or is Milo projecting?—but the emotional truth of quiet persistence feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the guardian’s silent labor: empathy as active listening that transforms perception. The final image—night holding stars “like secret fireflies”—offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. However, “silent empathy” remains abstract; it’s illustrated but not tested, limiting thematic depth. Resonance is strong but leans lyrical over conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: quiet attention as revolutionary praxis. No moralizing—insight arises through saplings, synchronized glass, and vibrating stone. The final line—“The quiet has spoken”—reprices silence from absence to active force, reweighting every prior image. Ambiguity lingers (Can this sustain?), but resonance is earned through concrete particulars: pawns becoming queens, iron hearts pulled together, forests sprouting where doubts grew.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from Mara’s duality and the scrimshaw’s function: true freedom requires releasing the tools of past conflict. The final image—harbor calm as “after-glow of a battle fought with love”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Recurring motifs (whale song, combative tenderness) accumulate meaning, though the “guarded hearts” concept risks abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: freedom through aesthetic transgression, boundaries as illusions to be rewritten. The final image—verse hanging “like frost on glass, beautiful and inevitable”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.

    Theme emerges organically from Selene’s actions: bartering awakenings reframes imperfection as generative. The final mural—“woven from shattered reflections,” each crack named for jasmine scent—offers a non-literal answer to her quest: beauty resides in fissures, not wholeness. Subtext thrives in silence (plants’ whispers) and material (cracked glass), avoiding moralizing. The glassblower’s whisper (“true glass... celebrates the story each fissure tells”) resonates without stating thesis, and the closing image of glass flowers ensures ambiguity lingers—awakenings require perpetual renewal, not final mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of light, sound, and neural mapping—never stated outright. The central question (“What if sound can be seen?”) is answered non-literally through synesthetic communion, reweighting perception as shared feeling. Final image—the lab as “cathedral of shared feeling”—resonates without moralizing. However, the epiphany edges close to pseudo-profundity (“even in void there is texture”) without grounding it in a specific, flawed human limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of “genuinely artificial” light seeding real life—a non-literal answer to whether memory can fertilize rebirth. Subtext operates in veils, folds, and coordinates: intention as active unveiling, not passive hope. The final crane pointing to an unseen sunrise reweights all prior acts without moralizing. Complexity endures—mourning isn’t erased but repurposed—and the jeweler’s quiet oath avoids sentimentality while resonating beyond the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: cultural resilience as pattern recognition amid digital ruin. The final image—a droplet reflecting a “miniature universe”—offers a non-literal answer to whether meaning survives market collapse, reweighting earlier motifs (tape, cards, ink) as tools of reconstruction. Subtext operates through gesture (kneeling to confide) and object (tape as conduit), avoiding moralizing. Complexity is preserved—hope is “blueprint,” not guarantee—and earned through concrete acts, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: true purification arises from embracing fragmented pasts, not erasing them. This is embodied in the historian’s erratic pilgrimage and the pagoda’s response to broken rhythm. The final image—his legend becoming “one more atom of nostalgia”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (trembling hands, deliberate missteps) and environment (walls exhaling memories), avoiding abstract declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the twin-child motif and the stone’s transformation—hope as something fragile yet preservable through attentive witness. The ending offers a non-literal answer: legacy isn’t in grand acts but in shared, silent footage that carries unbound longing forward.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of deception, healing, and balance—never stated until the final journal line, which resonates rather than moralizes. The chameleon’s shifting hues reweight “truth” as fluid yet recoverable, and the river metaphor reconfigures balance as active tending. Subtext thrives in gesture (curling wrist, drifting tail tip). Avoids binary morality; the con leaves scars, but reconstruction is possible through honest shedding.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of scars, time, and forgotten miracles—never stated outright but embodied in coffee rings mirroring wounds and sand whispering lost stories. The final image reweights all prior material: wounds as vessels of hope, time as readable text. Avoids moralizing; instead offers a quiet, non-literal answer—that healing resides not in erasure but in listening. Subtext thrives in botanical dialogue and meteor-hush atmosphere, resisting binary resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: unused love gains meaning only when gathered and witnessed. The final image—shadows applauding “love finally set free”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Motifs (letters as birds, film as memory) reweight prior material, and ambiguity lingers (Where is love stored? In the act of remembrance). Avoids sentimentality by grounding abstraction in concrete ritual (sealing wax, celluloid melting).

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: creativity as cosmic inheritance, silence as prison, rest as generative pause. The final image—verses lingering “like dust on the wind”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (tracing stars, leaving the instrument) and image (auroras dimming as universe “exhales”). However, near the end, “freedom” borders on thematic echo, slightly undercutting ambiguity; the insight is earned but risks tipping into assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: barrenness kindled, silence singing, time reversed for hope. The ending offers a non-literal answer—ashes become seeds not through force but resonance—repricing loss as latent potential. No moralizing; subtext lives in image (clock hands moving backward, trees of light). The divergent archive isn’t explained but embodied as possibility made tactile, avoiding abstraction. Ambiguity lingers (Will forests truly return?), but the emotional aftereffect—warmth in a barren soul—is concrete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: the frontier is internal, not external, and “probable miracles” are the rhythm of a self-reinventing world. This is embodied through the gear’s journey—from passive token to heartbeat-synced compass—and the forest’s response to his insight. The ending offers a non-literal answer: awakening isn’t discovery but recognition. Avoids moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (e.g., “mechanical leaves unfurling like birds”). However, near-final line “probable miracles were not rare gifts…” edges close to declarative summary, slightly undercutting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: courage as dormant seed awaiting tide, not heroic act. The map of the inner self reweights prior material non-literally—no moral stated, only shown through pulsing letters and Mira’s step forward.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: safety requires bearing silence, not passive shelter. The bolt’s transformation—from mundane object to “beacon”—reweights prior imagery without moralizing.

    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of ash, snow, and light—brokenness mended not by place but by internal readiness.

The central question (“Can texture become voice across linguistic death?”) receives a non-literal answer: yes, but only as echo, heard by stones, not people. Final image reweights all prior motifs—the bone towers now “whisper” the taught song—without moralizing.

The final image—a glowing orchard tended by former enforcers—offers a non-literal answer to whether wonder can bloom from rust, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (his wordless reply) and objects (the empty shell as beacon). Ambiguity lingers—will the mechanical world truly change?—but the orchard’s collective sigh earns its hope without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)

    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, repair, and listening, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image—Mara’s voice as a “soft tide” sustaining a symphony of stillness—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: absence can be translated into motion.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: stories reside not in books but in hidden geometry and embodied recall, bridging measurable and mythic. The final projection of the fallen star offers a non-literal answer—memory is luminous, communal, and ephemeral—without moralizing.

    Theme emerges organically: silence as active, accumulative force capable of binding grief. Subtext lives in objects—the needle doesn’t cut but gathers; the mask doesn’t hide but houses. The ending offers a non-literal answer: peace isn’t absence of noise but woven hush, “a steady, invisible weight.” No moralizing; resonance arises from the needle’s glow dimming starlight, the net becoming thread.

    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object, action, and setting: letting go as transformation, not surrender. The snow globe’s shattering offers a non-literal answer—potential realized only through dissolution—reweighting every prior mention.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: connection requires tangible anchors (petals, bronze plates) to ground abstract yearning (ghostly algorithms). The final image—travelers pressing blossoms onto the bolt plate—reweights prior solitude into collective stewardship without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silences: the ghost’s “binary sighs” gain humanity through floral imprints, arguing that even code craves organic touch. No thesis statement mars the resonance; wisdom arises solely from concrete ritual.

Subtext thrives in silence: the unspoken names of dead pilots resonate more than any eulogy.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)

Who hears the lullaby?), but resonance is concrete—the sea sings back the pattern, embedding theme in action, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars: redemption as graceless, cyclical labor rather than miracle. The “blueprint” isn’t recovered but enacted through pattern-tracing, suggesting salvation lies in process, not knowledge.

Who erased the blueprint?), but emotional truth in “wound that will never fully heal” resonates beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: separation and reconnection as cyclical, generative forces. The chrysalis shifts from “broken promise” to “relic of redemption” without moralizing.

The box’s evolution—from repository to seed—answers the central question non-literally: wholeness isn’t absence of fear but integration.

The heritage rose thorn and key evolve from relics to active agents of repricing—“calibrated treason” becomes “hymn of hope.” Final image offers non-literal resolution: the thorn’s last glow signifies transformed legacy. Avoids moralizing; instead, the marble humming a “lullaby of reconciled souls” reweights all prior acts as sacred, not sacrilegious.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: voices echo when stories go untold, and remembrance is an act of mercy, not burden. The final image—the whole shell humming beside her—reweights every prior echo as bridge rather than ghost, answering the central question without moralizing.

The ending offers a non-literal answer—the child’s dissolving key—to the central question of salvage, reweighting debris as potential. Subtext thrives in images (gull with glass shard, spinning compass) rather than statements. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the unresolved tension between individual loss and communal hope.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically through image and ritual: unseen labor sustains the world. The fireflies’ fleeting tapestry and dew-laden net evoke quiet perseverance without moralizing. However, the insight—that hidden patterns require deliberate listening—is stated outright (“his philosophy taught him...”) rather than earned solely through action. Final resonance is strong but slightly undercut by near-thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: truth requires patient excavation, not brute force; stillness enables clarity amid chaos. The flawed diamond’s inscription (“Only in stillness does the truth shine brighter than any lie”) risks thematic echo but is offset by its integration into the object and Mira’s nonverbal realization. The final image—trees shimmering with untainted light—resonates without moralizing. However, the theme leans slightly toward abstraction; the emotional aftereffect is intellectual awe rather than human complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: darkness as scaffold, not void—a resonant answer to despair that avoids moralizing. The cobalt portico’s transformation from observation point to beacon reweights “shadows” from memory to power. Final image (“sunrise bloom from darkness”) offers non-literal closure without stating a thesis. Subtext thrives in objects and atmosphere, though near-repetition of “lyrically prophetic” edges toward assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as living transmission, not relic. The music box’s lullaby reframes from abandoned to reclaimed, echoing across generations without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: redemption requires both grace and precise inner recalibration. The clockwork heart reweights the premise—not all broken things are beyond repair, but restoration demands more than goodwill. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the shared ritual of repair. However, the final paragraph edges toward moralizing (“forgiveness was measured… by the steady pulse”), slightly undercutting the earned resonance of the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: the pursuit of meaning that resists verification. The bell no one hears becomes a metaphor for artistic or existential gestures whose value lies in the act, not reception.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of charred letter and wilting vines, avoiding moralizing. The central question—can mismatched destinies compose harmony?—is answered non-literally through the soil absorbing ash, suggesting love’s endurance as nourishment. Subtext thrives in gesture (cradling paper, tendrils curling “like lovers destined for mismatched embraces”). However, the phrase “nurture intersubjective understanding” veers into academic abstraction, briefly breaking immersion. Final image reweights prior material: the sentinel’s heart “matched to the world” reframes solitude as communion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from recurring images—arcs, lavender, rust, feather—without moralizing. The final constellation reweights fragmentation as connection, answering the central question: Can sorrow be reshaped into shared beauty? Yes, through quiet attention. However, the child’s dialogue (“why the feather glowed”) edges toward thematic echo, and “pain never fades without purpose” flirts with assertion over resonance. Still, ambiguity lingers: healing is beginning, not completion.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: language as living pulse, not static code. Subtext thrives in silence, fractured light, and the act of folding a page like prayer. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the pattern pulses anew through human attention—without moralizing. “Weathered innocence” accepts decay and possibility, avoiding binary resolution.

No explicit thesis; resonance arises from particulars, especially the ghost-ship horn rising from warmed stone.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: constancy amid flux is possible only through attunement to fragile signals (falling leaves).

Subtext operates through recurring motifs (leaf sound, luminous ache) that shift from haunting to grateful, embodying the idea that repair requires surrender, not control. Avoids sentimentality by rooting epiphany in concrete action—the cold screw warmed by intention—and resists tidy binaries by embracing both grief and wonder as fused energy.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—wholeness emerging from brokenness—emerges organically through the vinyl motif and Mara’s ritual, avoiding moralizing. The final image (staff keeping shards, hope lingering like perfume) offers a non-literal answer to mortality: transformation, not loss. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: cultural memory as living practice, sustained through attentive listening and song. The final image—children learning to hear vine melodies—offers a non-literal answer to loss: continuity through pedagogy, not preservation.

Final image—walls pulsing with song—reweights the premise non-literally, making “belonging” a shared, tunable condition. Ambiguity lingers (Who tunes next? What if misaligned?), resisting tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of false memory, guilt, and redemption, culminating in the carved phrase that reframes truth as burden and liberation. Subtext operates through objects and silence; the final image of the ticking watch hand offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Avoids moralizing until the last paragraph, where “metronome of redemption” slightly veers toward assertion—but is anchored in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: forgiveness as a bridge built from honesty, not gift. The drawer pull evolves from “tarnished” artifact to “hinge between ruin and redemption,” reweighting prior imagery without moralizing. Final line (“world seemed to inhale a collective sigh”) offers resonant, non-literal resolution. Avoids sentimentality by grounding wisdom in specific error (“failed exchange that cost dozens”) and concrete ritual (circled names).

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of navigation tools and emotional states—regrets as tides, faith as a lantern, alignment as redemption. The final image reweights the premise: regrets become lessons, not shackles, without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (“kayak cut through water like a pen”) and object use. However, the insight borders on lyrical abstraction; the emotional aftereffect is strong, but the thematic answer leans slightly toward stated wisdom rather than purely dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the signed baseball, floating headlines, and tarnished mirror accrue meaning without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—“weave new threads into the tapestry of humanity”—reweighting redemption as active creation, not erasure. Subtext operates through image (ripples carrying story, shadows as map) and avoids prompt-like articulation. However, the mirror’s whisper edges close to thematic echo, slightly diluting earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—love as bridge between mortality and eternity—emerges through concrete particulars: spice paste, antler touch, bark-skin. No moralizing; insight arises from action. The final crumb-offering reweights the premise: rebirth requires humility, not power. Cosmic intimacy replaces grief with coexistence, answering the central question without stating it. Subtext thrives in silence—the wind’s hum, shared breath, stars as witnesses.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of ritual, memory, and time—no moralizing. The recurring crack-to-blossom motif reweights loss as regenerative potential, and the final star-rain offers a non-literal answer: time isn’t linear but retrievable through acts of naming and release. Subtext thrives in silence (shattered saucer), gesture (thumb unfastening), and image (dew on spider silk), avoiding abstraction while embracing ambiguity about whether healing is real or imagined.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: sorrow must be witnessed, not conquered, to birth new beginnings. The crystal’s transformation from vessel of universal grief to seed of luminous life reweights every prior image without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence—the ship’s sigh, the wind’s echo of unborn children—and avoids therapy-speak. The final garden pulses with “memories of worlds that never came to be,” offering a non-literal answer to whether pacifism can heal cosmic rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: transformation as ambient, participatory texture rather than heroic act. The fireflies’ release reweights the premise—captivity vs. communion—without moralizing. Final image (luminous sand, whispering hush carried forward) offers non-literal answer to Mara’s quest. Avoids sentimentality by rooting epiphany in concrete phenomena, though the shaman’s prophecy edges toward symbolic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: revolution as quiet contagion of thought, not force. The cradle of sparks reframes power as shared cognition, and the blackout transforms from void to fertile ground. Final image—“revolution of light without flame”—reweights every prior detail (phosphorescent moss, winking hush) without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence and marginalia, resisting binaries; the fort’s pulse replaces hierarchy with collective resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: order can be forged from chaos through intentional pattern-making. The final image—painted rocks glowing as a “living map”—reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in the tension between determinism (curse) and agency (design). No platitudes; wisdom arises from the ritual’s concrete mechanics and cosmic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: scars mapped as cities, sorrow rarefied into breath, envelopes becoming legend. No moralizing; the final stanza glows in luminous ink, offering a non-literal answer—pain as navigable terrain. Subtext thrives in silence (the empty envelope, humming timer) and implication (travelers leaving letters). The central question—can truth breathe in a censored world?—is answered through poetic ritual, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the duel’s mechanics: fencing as dialectic, objects as epistemic tools. The final riddle—“where does a question go when it is no longer a question but a destination?”—is answered non-literally through alignment of needle and sundial, reweighting all prior imagery. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from concrete action. However, “dignified chaos” borders on thematic label rather than lived paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges through particulars: repaired shelves as bricks, verses as stones, pennies as universes. The ending offers a non-literal answer—rebuilding as rebellion—without moralizing. “Luminous fracture” reweights chaos as fertile, avoiding binaries. Subtext thrives in silence: Rook’s question (“What rebellion hides in a cup?”) implies skepticism turned faith through shared action.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: the tension between scheduled destiny and improvised rebellion, resolved not with moralizing but through the resonant image of compasses becoming stars. The final chord reweights all prior motifs—time, silence, navigation—as acts of quiet defiance. Subtext thrives in gesture (bowing to no one) and object (the ticking clock that stops satisfied). No explicit thesis; ambiguity lingers without confusion, inviting reflection on authorship over one’s fate.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: cultural memory survives only when personal curiosity stitches dream to fact. The final blossom—each petal a forgotten chant—offers a non-literal answer: memory is not preserved but propagated, carried inland by rain. No moralizing; resonance arises from the silvered leaves turning “in a wind of thought.” The story embraces ambiguity—will the monsoon nourish or destroy?—without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of compass, bonsai, and lace instructions—forgiveness as a recurring tide, not a destination. The final insight (“not a pigment but a feeling”) avoids moralizing and reweights every prior image without stating a thesis. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture: the tutor’s slow speech, the needle’s quiver, the shells as lanterns—all resonate beyond plot. Ambiguity lingers (Is forgiveness real or ritual?), enriching rather than confusing.
