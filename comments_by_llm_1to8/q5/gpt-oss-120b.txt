The final whisper to the vines slightly undermines subtlety with direct thematic articulation, though it avoids full sermon territory.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding purpose through loss emerges organically through the parallel between smuggler's survival and artist's rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of transforming trauma into art emerges through concrete imagery rather than statement. However, the resolution feels too neat—"music born from silence" and "chorus of hope" tend toward the sentimental without sufficient complexity or counter-reading to create lasting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges through the lighthouse-as-beacon metaphor, connecting Marlow's undertaker role to guiding the dead. The library as knowledge-tomb resonates. However, the resolution's ease—spirits simply respond to light—lacks complexity. The final line about being "never truly forgotten" reads as assertion rather than earned wisdom from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of community resilience emerges through the bell ritual and anonymous giving, but resolves into explicit statements ("test of solidarity," "chain of care") rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of unused love as a "lattice of glowing potential." The story avoids moralizing, letting the image of love flowing through the viaduct's arches carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of dissolving temporal boundaries emerges through the maze's properties and fading photographs, though it tends toward abstract philosophizing ("time could be felt as a tactile presence"). The final paragraph explicitly states thematic conclusions rather than letting them arise from dramatized cost. Conceptual ambition exceeds concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of resilience emerging from unlikely places develops through concrete imagery (seeds in vault, shoots through dry crust) rather than stated morals. The "wall coming down" metaphor attempts thematic resonance but feels somewhat forced; the story's strength lies in its physical planting imagery rather than abstract metaphors about knowledge-sharing.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through the central metaphor of transforming absence into presence, broken trust into "new resonance." The device that lets others "hear the colors of their own pasts" offers a non-literal answer about memory's reconstructive power. However, the final paragraphs drift toward explicit thematic statement ("memory remains the bridge that stitches them together") rather than letting the image carry full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between stealing and preserving, with moonbeams as metaphor for fleeting human experience. The final image of Lira merging with sunset while the lantern beckons others successfully reweights the opening's theft motif. The story resists moralizing, letting the transformation speak through image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of abandoning control for "fragile equilibrium" emerges organically through the glass-blowing metaphor and the thawing world, avoiding explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of transforming vulnerability into power emerges through concrete actions—using fear-based stunt knowledge to decode life-threatening puzzles.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of charting void and the covenant between listener and night. The recurring "ambered hush" and silence motifs accumulate meaning, though the piece tends toward abstract philosophy ("geometry of night") rather than grounded particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of consciousness emerging from mundane action develops through the ice violin's resonance and the robot's janitorial-to-transcendent transformation. However, the insight that "even the simplest motions could echo through the looped timelines of existence" arrives without earned struggle, reading more as assertion than discovery through dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    The transparency/honesty theme emerges clearly through the lens metaphor and accumulating imagery of light, reflection, and revelation. However, the thematic work remains somewhat abstract, relying on conceptual assertions ("honesty had freed them") rather than dramatized particulars. The final image of ongoing documentation provides some resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme of reciprocal awareness between gardener and garden emerges through action but relies heavily on abstract declarations ("gardens know their gardeners," "blooming withering symphony"). The cracked marbles as "mended deception" carry symbolic weight yet the concept remains opaque. Final paragraph explicitly states the thematic message ("Your wisely pragmatic heart has turned cracked promises into shining pathways"), reducing resonance through directness.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of time's non-linear nature emerges through imagery of sideways movement and the flora's response, avoiding direct statement. However, the thematic exploration lacks complexity or ambiguity—the hypothesis is simply proven correct without examining what this means for the characters or their world.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "spaces in between" - silences between sounds, gaps in marginalia, the liminal space between past and present. The story resists explicit moralizing, allowing the pattern of absence and presence to carry meaning. The final image of lanterns as "steady guardian for the spaces between" resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of truth's measurable weight emerges through concrete actions like smudging ink and adjusting barometers, avoiding direct statement. The final image of aurora as "sorrow can be beautiful when it lights the path to honesty" offers resonance, though the abstract nature of the central metaphor limits emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of "swallowed truth" and industrial secrets emerges through repetition but never develops beyond abstract meditation. The final image of Mara emerging with "the weight of that hidden confession lingering" asserts thematic resonance without earning it through concrete scene work. The piece relies on atmospheric suggestion and metaphorical weight rather than dramatized moral complexity or genuine ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of witnessing without judgment emerges through the keeper's role and culminates in "silence births renewal," but this arrives as assertion rather than earned insight. The regenerative silence concept repeats without deepening through specific experience. The final line feels like prompt-echo moralizing rather than resonance built from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of ordinary magic as generational inheritance emerges organically through the curl keepsake and final tradition, avoiding explicit moralizing. The ending reweights the eclipse from celestial event to community transformation without stating the lesson. However, the lack of earned struggle or visible cost prevents the theme from achieving deeper resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of preservation and transformation after apocalypse emerges through concrete details—the reclaimed silo, half-burnt diaries, the axis as "realignment" rather than fracture. The final image of the library holding "living pulse" resonantly answers the opening's "forgotten texts." However, the piece occasionally states its themes too directly ("his purpose is simple yet profound") and the conceptual cost of humanity's ended dreams could be more viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of hidden knowledge becoming open secrets emerges through repetition but lacks specificity. The fortune cookies as "covert carriers of truth" presents an intriguing paradox, yet the thematic exploration remains surface-level, relying on abstract assertions about fate and destiny rather than earned insight through particular experience.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of revealing "hidden assumptions" and making the "unseen visible" emerges through the indigo color motif and loop pedal echoes. The final image of walking into light offers resonance without explicit moralizing. However, the thematic question never faces genuine counter-pressure or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the nautilus spiral's "mapping" function and the mirrored horizon's promise of "worlds beyond."

The transformation of homesickness from burden to compass effectively reweights the opening longing.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of self-acceptance through embracing fractured identities emerges clearly through accumulated imagery and the final lesson about owning "every timeline." The "darkening brightness" paradox and recursive structure support this theme, though the resolution into explicit moralizing ("to own every timeline...is to master oneself") undermines the subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of transforming silence into feeling emerges organically through the interplay of reversed/forward songs and the "mirrored hush" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of "truth finding a way" and "integrity in solitude" emerges through situation but relies heavily on abstract declarations ("truth would always find a way").

The final paragraph explicitly states the theme rather than allowing it to emerge from concrete action and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the connection between scent and memory, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of Arlen as a "lantern of understanding" resonates with his profession. However, the insight about "grief transformed into understanding" feels somewhat unearned without sufficient dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges through the weaving metaphor—time as rope, memory as thread, patterns that bind past to future. The final image of the rope's luminescence expanding "like ripples that mapped his inner journey" offers resonance without stating a moral. However, phrases like "the most profound discoveries are made by those who dare to untangle" edge toward explicit thematic statement, preventing entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in incompleteness emerges organically through the unfinished stories, burnt rainforest, and the final insight that "beauty lay not in what was completed, but in the perpetual act of seeking." The mendicant's bowl as a vessel for "unfinished stories" creates resonant subtext. However, the thematic resolution arrives too tidily in explicit statements like "the unfinished was a canvas of endless light."

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of manufacturing authentic feeling, with Mara as intermediary between "raw insight and the empathy people think they have lost." The half-truth concept resonates through action. However, the ending doesn't offer a non-literal answer to this central question—it simply continues the cycle without reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "cycles of compassion" theme is explicitly stated multiple times rather than emerging from dramatized events—"cycles of compassion are the most reliable cargo any community can transport" reads as thesis statement. The Compassion Register concept feels forced rather than organic. Theme attempts complexity through multiple perspectives but lacks the specific pressure that would make these ideas resonate beyond platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of communal belonging emerges through consistent imagery (webs, threads, grafting) and the recurring "luminescent ache" motif. However, the story states its thesis explicitly ("fragile, beautiful duty to graft oneself onto one another") and resolves into uncomplicated unity without exploring tension between individual and collective needs.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of time as sculptable material emerges organically through the pendant's loops and the echo metaphor. The concept that "the place where echoes are born was not a location but a moment" offers genuine insight. Yet the resolution into pure harmony ("never again break") simplifies what could have embraced productive tension.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mathematical metaphor for emotion creates thematic coherence, and the transformation of loss into growth resonates. However, the theme statement becomes explicit ("grief plus hope equals a new kind of growth") rather than remaining implicit. The final image of "buried optimism and ever-lasting wonder" provides resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the preservation of "lost fragments" and "forgotten readers," with the final image of Maren as "quiet beacon" offering resonant closure without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of transformation through releasing control emerges organically through the leaf's journey and Marlowe's methodology, avoiding direct moralizing. The final greenhouse expansion and multiple saplings effectively reweight the initial observation as a sustainable practice, though the insight feels somewhat predetermined rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between preserving memory (paintings of grief) and enabling renewal (the convergence). The final image of mist settling "like a varnish" beautifully unites preservation and transformation. The story resists simple moralizing, though the exchange metaphor occasionally feels overstated ("she had given it art to remember the water wars by").

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges through the recurring motif of "bright darkness" and "unseen forces," creating resonance between paradox and possibility. The concept of magnifying everyday magic threads through without becoming preachy.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of fragmented memory becoming collective meaning emerges organically through the valve's evolution and the harbor's collaborative response. "To compile fragments into meaning required not only collection but also the courage to let gaps breathe" offers genuine insight. The ending's communal map-making resonates without moralizing, though the "navigated absences" concept could integrate more deeply into dramatic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of hidden narratives and unspoken truths emerges organically through the physical journey into literal hidden spaces, with the final revelation that truth is "a living archive of humanity's hidden narratives." The recurring motif of arrows/guidance creates coherent subtext about following signs others miss. However, the thematic resolution tends toward the abstract and declarative ("she would map every hidden line, paint every silent song") rather than embodied complexity with genuine ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the integration of "entangled memories" and the transformation of doubt into bridge. The final image of the tile as "lighthouse for wandering thoughts" resonates without moralizing, offering reflection on memory as migration that "repeats yet never exactly mirrors."

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of an immortal confronting finality, with goodbye reframed as transformation rather than ending. The twin's wisdom that worlds "fold into another plane" resonates without moralizing. The final image of stepping toward "a horizon stitched together by magnetic intrigue" perfectly encapsulates earned understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transforming deception into honesty through "mathematics of a fair trade" emerges organically from the concrete action. However, the resolution feels too neat—the bureaucrats' walls simply dissolve without exploring the complexity of power or showing genuine resistance to change.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "invented histories" as bridges across time, avoiding direct moralizing. The concept of "incandescent restraint" manifests in prose texture, and the final image of the stationer walking deeper resonates without stating meaning, though it stops short of offering a transformative answer.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of erasure and memory emerges organically through concrete details without explicit moralizing. The label as filter/key creates resonant metaphor for how perspective shapes reality.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of myth-busting and myth-preservation, culminating in the insight that "myths survive when retold through art, sound, and stubborn optimism."

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through the tension between chaos and order, community and privatization, without explicit moralizing. The phoenix graffiti symbol effectively crystallizes rebirth and protection themes. The foundation stone chip evolves from fragment to community anchor, earning its symbolic weight through plot function. The ending's "perpetual carnival, afloat on hope" resonates without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of preserving memory against inevitable loss emerges through the sand grain holding "the memory of every midnight" and the photograph outlasting "the fleeting glow." The final transformation of the grain from relic to "captured breath of time" offers resonance. However, the explicit moralizing in the whispered speech ("May the grain's story travel farther...") and the abstract "melancholy of sunrise" undercut subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding precision through unconventional perception emerges organically from Mara's blind repair methods. The water refraction technique embodies this concretely rather than stating it. However, the final paragraphs drift toward explicit thematic statements ("a bridge between broken things and new horizons," "blind sight could craft luminous futures") that diminish the subtlety earned through the scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of origins and convergence emerges organically through concrete images - frozen water becoming rivers, maps requiring revision, silence birthing sound. "Kaltwasser" crystallizes the paradox without stating it. The final image of ice singing while the world listens resonates without moralizing. Subtext operates through the phrasebook's "secret script" and the lake's "mirror-like hush."

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of balance between "stone and spirit" emerges through the restoration process and resonates in the final image of children playing over cobblestones. The concept of rhythm as a creative/restorative force offers some depth. However, the theme tends toward abstraction ("shared balance") without exploring complexity or counter-arguments to the tuner's vision.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of sharing transcendent experience emerges through action as Mara transforms from seeking personal gain to communal gift-giving. The recurring "gathered hush" and "lonesome splendor" create textural resonance. However, the ending veers toward explicit moralizing with "the quiet courage that chose to unsnarl fear," stating rather than embodying the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of redemption through truth-telling emerges through the lattice prayers and the transformation from false alarms to "guiding light," with the recurring copperlight/hush creating resonance. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the moral—"the boy's legend transformed into a guiding light"—rather than letting the image carry the weight, and "every warning is a thread, not a wall" reads as inserted wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of cyclical debt and redemption emerges through the orchard's transformation and recurring awakening motif. The carved stone bead effectively accumulates meaning as it brightens with each leaf unfurled. However, the "lovingly venomous" paradox gets explained rather than dramatized, and the ending's explicit message about debts being "repaid through resonance" edges toward moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of renewal through artistic persistence emerges through the extended weaving metaphor and accumulating imagery. The final image of "sewing the world's wounds with gentle, orchid-soft hands" resonates poetically. However, the theme tends toward abstraction without grounding in specific dramatic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the integration of diaspora return, ancestral connection, and faith restoration. The sundial marking "the hour when the dead could speak to the living" provides resonant specificity. However, the final paragraph veers toward explicit moralizing about "patient rebuilding and hopeful wandering."

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding meaning in margins emerges through concrete imagery (chalk on pavement, edges as portals) rather than declaration. The final image of the drone "humming a lullaby of pixelated seas" offers a non-literal answer about bridging analog and digital worlds, though the piece edges toward explicit thematic statement with "the margins held the most luminous stories."

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of hidden truths emerging through patient observation resonates through the flame-reading and galaxy-chart metaphor. However, the ending's assertion that "History would remember the fire's glow, not the blade" tells rather than dramatizes the thematic payoff, and "truth could be sewn" reads as explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme relies on abstract concepts (apologies, unsent letters, fierce tenderness) without concrete dramatization. The final paragraph explicitly states the moral ("the heart heals in moonlight and sunrise alike"). The recurring motifs feel forced rather than organic to the character's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.1)
    The coral-as-resilience metaphor and the concept of grafting meaning onto wounds emerge through particulars rather than assertion. The final image of "shared anxieties into quiet strength" offers a non-literal answer to trauma's persistence. However, the theme tends toward the therapeutic without sufficient complexity or counter-reading—healing proceeds too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme emerges through repetitive abstractions about light versus shadow, joy versus sorrow, but lacks concrete dramatization. The final paragraph explicitly states the moral ("how a mural artist who paints with light can revive a world") rather than letting it emerge from events. Multiple instances of thematic echo appear, particularly "pensive mirth" used as a prompt-like label.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of curiosity versus certainty emerges through accumulated images and Lena's final choice, avoiding explicit moralizing.

The final image of walking toward possibility resonates but lacks surprising depth.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of resistance against thought control emerges through the garden's coded language system, avoiding direct moralizing. The metaphor of seeds as "seedlings of dissent" connects to the central concept.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of transforming suffering into art emerges through the central metaphor of photosynthesis and the "blossom armistice" between light and shadow. The final image of an eternal chain of poets offers resonance. However, the theme tends toward abstraction ("pain into beauty") without the specific, embodied struggle that would ground it, and the resolution's lack of cost undermines thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete work of preservation—memory surviving void through systematic care. The final exchange with the traveler offers resonant payoff: "ancestors he never met" crystallizes the theme of cultural memory transmission.

The interconnected promises method reinforces the thematic concern with relationships and continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of "encrypted compassion" emerges through the chain's hidden cipher and the amphitheater's encoded memories, culminating in water flow as "conversation" rather than conquest. The concept integrates well with the technical solution, though the resolution toward unity feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of layering old with new emerges organically through the dust-mapping metaphor and achieves resonance in "reinvention does not erase, but layers the old with the new, like moss blooming over stone."

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of thresholds as "places where distance becomes meaning" emerges through concrete exploration and resonates at closure. However, the final moral about "the space between wonder and understanding" reads as explicit statement rather than earned through scene pressure. The maze-as-life metaphor carries weight but tends toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of belonging emerges through the mirror between sky maps and underwater constellations, suggesting connection between disparate realms. The insight that belonging is "not a static beat but a flowing sequence" arises from concrete experience, though the final paragraph veers toward explicit thematic statement with "the soft engine that powered the cosmos of belonging."

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of memory, recollection, and emotional resonance emerges through the crater glass translations and path restoration, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the thematic question resolves too neatly—the answer that paths need "emotional resonance" feels abstract rather than earned through specific dramatized cost. The "cheerful gloom" oxymoron aims for complexity but reads as conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of "ordering randomness" emerges through repeated imagery but stays at surface level without complexity or counter-reading. The phrase "serenade monotony with creativity" appears verbatim twice, creating thematic echo penalty. Final whisper restates the thesis rather than offering resonant non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of chosen exile versus imposed banishment emerges through Lira's transformation, and the "nostalgia ban" context adds resonance to artistic creation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding extraordinary value in ordinary things emerges clearly through the recurring imagery of light refraction and the transformation of mundane objects (nets becoming "jeweled crowns"). However, the theme develops through assertion and observation rather than dramatized struggle—Mira simply sees what she hoped to see without earning the insight through conflict or paying any price for the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme attempts complexity through "translating pain into universal language" but relies on abstract assertions rather than dramatized particulars. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("the true bargain had never been about buying innocence, but about gifting it back") replaces scene pressure with thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of measuring hope like altitude, avoiding explicit moralizing. The integration of mathematics with belief, art with measurement creates genuine complexity. The final image of the coast as "living textbook of optimism" resonates without stating thesis. Slight elevation for avoiding predictable resolution of faith versus logic binary.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of collective memory and shared history emerges through concrete discovery—walls store "hopes, regrets, and the scent of rain." The transformation from individual burden to communion offers non-literal answer to whether isolation or connection defines legacy. The recurring image of walls as living histories gains weight, though the explicit statement about "collective imagination" in the final line edges toward thesis articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges through the recurring "borrowed heartbeat" and coded lullabies that promise "worlds beyond garden walls." The final image of children chasing doors while mirrors hum with possibilities resonates without stating a moral. The concept of hidden potential in familiar songs carries through effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme of redemption through collective willingness emerges through the ritual but relies heavily on abstract statements ("price of redemption," "anchor ideals in practice") rather than earned particulars. The ebony/marble contrast and sword-laying gesture carry symbolic weight but the transformation feels unearned. Final sunrise image attempts resonance but lacks the cost that would deepen meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme emerges through the paradox of preservation through destruction, with the salt flat keeping "a fragment of grace forged from cruelty." The final image of the man returning to listen to "the lingering chorus" while allowing himself "a tear that tasted of sand and redemption" offers a non-literal answer to whether amoral acts can yield grace.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of individual expression versus conformity emerges through the harvest of echoes metaphor, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of "rebellion, once a hush, now a hymn" resonantly reweights the opening's "lullaby of conformity." However, the piece lacks complexity—conformity is purely negative, rebellion purely positive, without exploring necessary social contracts.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of "ethical storytelling" and reversing narrative hierarchies emerges through repeated assertion rather than dramatized struggle. The final image of Selene walking toward seedy bars with "questions" and "ethical wonder" states the theme explicitly without earning it through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of honoring the overlooked emerges organically through imagery and action rather than statement. The moth wing and butterfly migration create resonant parallels, and the temporary nature of the structures mirrors the fleeting subjects being honored. However, the thematic question lacks complexity - no counter-force challenges whether these histories deserve monuments.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete image of names being "transcribed" from silence into light, avoiding abstract statements about memory. The final image of the sanctum as "living library" offers a non-literal answer about how memory persists through active preservation. The rope's transformation from holding "memory of every prayer" to becoming "a map of luminous pathways" deepens the theme through specific objects rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of paths as both routes and agents—they "listen, decide, and reward." The wafer seal's transformation from binding "broken promises" to recording "newly chosen routes" creates thematic resonance without explicit moralizing. The ending's "precisely playful tune" and readiness for "the next dream-guided traveler" suggests cyclical renewal without forcing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of humble measurement yielding cosmic connection emerges through concrete imagery—the frugal astronomer's grain-counting parallels his star-charting. The "empirically ironic" notion that small calculations unlock vast promises resonates. But the thematic resolution feels too tidy; the markets thrumming with prosperity reads as unearned wish-fulfillment rather than complex earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete action of touching the music box and feeling cellular memory rewrite emotional pathways. The concept that "the most potent weapons were the subtle shifts of grace" resonates without preaching. The wanderer's epilogue reinforces the theme of releasing resentment through tactile memory, though it risks feeling repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of erasing boundaries emerges through concrete action as Arlen weaves "separate songs" and discovers boundaries are "shadows of fear." The final image of the orchard "breathing as one living being" resonates without explicit moralizing, though the insight that "erasing boundaries was not the removal of lines" arrives somewhat easily without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.2)
    The deciduous vows metaphor connects renewal to mending but remains surface-level without complexity or counter-reading. Theme emerges through repetition rather than dramatized struggle—wisdom about persistence is stated rather than earned through specific experience. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("every fracture holds a seed of renewal") replaces scene pressure with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of nonlinear inheritance emerges organically through the orchard's temporal paradoxes and crystallizes in "knowledge is a garden that grows in loops." The pistachio shell as empty vessel awaiting thought works as concrete metaphor. However, the final paragraph's explicit statement "knowledge is a garden that grows in loops" edges toward thesis declaration, and some philosophical abstractions ("simply complicated") lack grounding in specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "unheard symphony" motif effectively accumulates meaning from bookstore hum to discovered chords to final swelling, while the theme of "unlearned lessons" resonates through concrete action rather than statement. The ending reweights knowledge itself as something that must be actively discovered rather than passively received.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of "trapped freedom" emerges organically through paradoxical imagery like "rusted chains of light" and the ship that must be navigated to achieve liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "fables of absence" concept elegantly structures the thematic exploration of presence through void. The final insight that "absence can be harnessed" emerges naturally from the rope-weaving action, avoiding explicit moralizing while maintaining conceptual coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of balance between "echo and silence" emerges organically through the mapkeeper's actions and the stone's function. The story resists simple binaries by suggesting quiet isn't absence but balance. The final image of travelers finding unexpected calm provides resonance, though the thematic exploration could probe deeper into why this balance matters beyond comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of finding pattern in chaos emerges through the beacon-rekindling and recurring "thistle-blown hope," creating modest resonance. However, the story explicitly states its thesis multiple times ("coincidences have meaning," "pattern and purpose walk hand in hand"), undermining subtextual development.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of collective memory emerges through the crystal's whispers and shadow measurements, avoiding direct moralizing. The connection between physical monuments and shared remembrance offers conceptual interest. However, the theme develops through assertion rather than dramatized conflict, and the ending provides no resonant answer beyond continuing the archival work.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of art filtering despair emerges through the recurring mosaic motif and the designer's craft, avoiding direct moralizing. The concept of "serious playfulness" as paradoxical resolve has potential but doesn't develop through concrete dramatic pressure. The final image of fire as "a note in mosaic for any soul daring to watch" gestures toward resonance but lacks the specificity to truly reweight prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges through the tidal metaphor and transition periods concept, avoiding direct moralizing. The jade cicada and water imagery create coherent symbolism about cycles and change. However, the theme doesn't arise from dramatized struggle - it's contemplated rather than tested through action with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of finding vastness within confinement emerges organically through Lio's journey from "cramped space could hold the vastness of a sky." The paradox of "intangibly tangible" silence collection avoids easy resolution. The final image of the bunker's new rhythm resonates thematically. Yet the piece tends toward explicit articulation ("finally understand") rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the accumulated imagery of silence as teacher, transit as transition, and the storm glass as emotional barometer. The final image of passengers carrying "vaulting hush within them" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The piece achieves genuine atmospheric depth through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.6)
    The fusion of analog (ancient codices, mossy bark) with digital (holographic dew, pixelated rain) creates a coherent "futuristic nostalgia" theme about bridging memory and possibility. However, the final lines explicitly state this theme ("a bridge between memory and possibility"), converting subtext into text and diminishing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of transformation through isolation emerges organically through the keeper's paradoxical mission and the sanctuary's evolution from emptiness to connection. The recurring breath metaphor and luminescent scars create resonance, though the thematic resolution—"the sanctuary...now pulsed with the promise of connection"—arrives without sufficient complexity or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the pressure-to-brilliance metaphor, avoiding explicit moralizing while exploring how past trauma can become transformative wisdom. The "quantum promise" concept effectively bridges abstract and concrete, though the final covenant statement edges toward over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "eloquently silent" and the transformation of "dynasty ender" from destroyer to bridge-builder. The confession that "the empire fell not from war but from the silent betrayal of a council that chose ignorance over curiosity" adds complexity. The final image of transformation ("ending a line was not about destruction") resonates without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges beautifully through the tension between solitary quests and collective performance, with the marionette theater serving as metaphor for scripted versus chosen allegiance. The final insight that "loyalty was not a chain but a song" resonates without stating a moral. The transformation of "endless night" into "a canvas awaiting the first brushstroke of sunrise" offers genuine complexity about isolation versus connection.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of forgotten histories finding voice emerges through the dust/button discovery system, though execution tends toward explicit statement ("quiet testament to histories that refuse to die"). The recurring button and dust patterns create coherent imagery. However, thematic resolution relies on assertion rather than dramatized revelation, particularly in direct statements about "magnifying small kindnesses."

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the water-as-memory conceit and the transformation of discarded objects into resistance tools. The ending's image of the lagoon as "living chart, shimmering with possibilities" resonantly answers questions about how memory and persistence combat indifference. The piece avoids explicit moralizing while building meaning through accumulated particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of silence as power and music as erasure rather than announcement.

The piece achieves thematic coherence through accumulated particulars rather than stated meanings.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the compass rose metaphor and Mara's craft, avoiding explicit moralizing until the inscription appears. The final image of "erratic unison" resonantly answers the central question about uncertainty versus planning. "When coincidence becomes pattern" crystallizes into lived experience rather than abstract philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the kintsugi metaphor—broken things gaining value through repair—without explicit moralizing. The "weight of names" concept develops from childhood memory through present action to final understanding. The ending reweights earlier material as "luminous regret" transforms to "quiet gratitude" through earned experience. Slight deduction for one instance of abstract philosophizing about "continuous negotiation with limits."

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of grief into hope via laughter, avoiding explicit moralizing. The "luminous ache" motif effectively bridges sorrow and healing, and the final image of the humming gorge offers resonant closure without stating its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of calculating mercy through remembered suffering emerges through the forest's synesthetic mathematics, avoiding direct moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of preserving overlooked histories emerges organically through the lighthouse memory translation, with the narrator becoming the beacon they sought to honor. The recursive structure (child with coin, mother's whisper, father's tale) creates resonance, though the final moral about carrying stories feels slightly overstated rather than purely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of acknowledgment emerges through concrete discovery of the performers' ledger and the ghosts' grateful response. However, the thematic resolution feels somewhat predetermined, lacking the complexity or ambiguity that would elevate beyond serviceable metaphor about hidden histories.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of transformation through destabilization emerges through concrete imagery (bottled whisper as catalyst, perfect systems breaking to reveal wonder). The ending reweights the opening's static perfection into dynamic possibility. However, thematic resolution feels too neat—"even perfect systems can be broken to reveal true wonder" approaches explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of transformation through art emerges from the mirror ceremony and recurring "burnished sorrow," but the final paragraph explicitly states the thesis: "the true revolution was no longer a battle of arms but a symphony of mirrors." This direct moralizing undercuts the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of truth versus decay emerges organically through the covenant's relationship to dishonesty and the restoration process. The final image of lanterns powered by renewed resonance offers a non-literal answer about communal harmony, though it edges toward explicit moralizing ("as long as honest hands tended the rust").

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of seeking explanations for their failure, with the "resonant hush" motif accumulating meaning from factory silence to lagoon's song. The final realization that surrender replaces pursuit offers a non-literal answer without moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("hinges of reality shifting").

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme emerges primarily through repetitive abstract statements about "timewoven alliances" and "layered meanings" rather than dramatized particulars. The concept of bridging past and present through art remains surface-level, lacking the complexity or ambiguity that would invite deeper reflection. The ending's assertion about "endless tide of learning" substitutes declaration for earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of hidden beauty and patient revelation emerges through concrete images—night flowers, etched glass, postcards as memory bridges. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("even the coldest winter yields to a softer, brighter bloom") rather than trusting the accumulated imagery, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between official record and suppressed truth. The obsidian lagoon as repository of silenced testimony creates resonant subtext. The final image of the zeppelin's brass panels glowing violet effectively reweights earlier material without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of memory as creative force emerges through accumulated imagery—lanterns as thoughts, stones as story fragments, light replacing water.

The final image of the sanctuary as "a quiet rebellion against the ever-growing clamor of the world" offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the "retired hymn" metaphor and the visitors' silent response, though the ending edges slightly toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of "flourishing stillness" emerges through concrete actions—tracing stars, holding memories, the tremor-response—rather than assertion. The final image of cracks reflecting brave stars effectively reweights earlier material. However, the resolution toward "quiet fire" and gratitude feels slightly neat, lacking the complexity that would elevate thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of silence as preservation emerges organically through the covenant's nature and the recluse's "mute eloquence." The final amber tear sealing the covenant offers a resonant, non-literal answer about the weight of unspoken words. However, passages like "He believed the weight of unspoken words could shatter the world" edge toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of time as texture—"minutes stretching like thin silk," memories as grains of sand, the silo as temporal antenna. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: time can be "mended by shared recollection." The garage sale listings embedding coordinates suggest how ordinary objects carry hidden significance, though this could be more fully developed through the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in incompleteness emerges organically through the feather, ripples, and "woven dawns" imagery. The story resists explicit moralizing until late passages that edge toward abstraction ("true art was never a finished picture but a perpetual negotiation"). The final image of dawns "forever woven from fragments" resonates without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of interspecies dialogue emerges concretely through copper conducting "bio-energies" and stone pillars responding to tree pulses, avoiding abstract moralizing until the somewhat heavy-handed final declaration about "willingness of all beings to bind together." The recurring image of breathing—from chlorophyll clouds to the island as "one organism"—creates resonance. The council's decision to lift all time limits offers a non-literal answer to mortality through collective harmony, though it edges toward tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of homecoming as dialogue rather than destination emerges through accumulated particulars (amber preservation, alien pulse, bronze quiet). The final image of the tower's "faint inner light" resonates without stating a moral, though some passages ("home was not a place but a pattern of returning") edge toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.9)
    The battlefield-to-garden transformation emerges through concrete imagery, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the theme of renewal remains surface-level without complexity—the piece presents healing as purely positive without exploring what might be lost in transformation or why the reef's death enables this particular rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "distance into closeness"—the leaf literally bridges separation between souls. The copper veins, violet/emerald light, and amber preservation create resonant imagery, though "wild hush" feels forced as a refrain.

    Theme emerges organically through the chess metaphor—missing pawns representing overlooked acts of courage—without explicit moralizing. The final image of Mira as historian with the penumbra following offers resonant closure. The piece successfully resists tidy resolution, though the "heal" sequence feels slightly forced compared to the stronger "remember what fell" pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the stone's "maps of feeling" reframe language as emotional geography, while the mountain's breathing architecture suggests home as living relationship rather than static place. The final image—home as "melody she could hear even in the silence of daylight"—offers resonant answer without stating moral. Subtext operates through the feather's "texture light as a sigh" and the book's skin-like vellum pulsing with life.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.9)
    The chess metaphor effectively unifies theme and action, with forgiveness emerging as "not a single move but a series of openings." The woven/frayed imagery creates resonance, though the final paragraph edges toward explicit moralizing with "the woven hush of the world seemed to sing his redemption."

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.6)

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kintsugi philosophy emerges organically through action—broken things becoming beautiful through golden repair—rather than stated thesis. The final image of the story traveling "on the currents, stitching distant hearts together" resonantly answers the central question of finding meaning at oblivion's edge. Theme develops through concrete particulars: pockmarks as memories, golden seams as intention, the workshop as fragile vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of preserving moments against time's passage emerges through the painted shells containing sunset fragments and the final canvas that "seemed to pulse." The concept of intimate aloofness as necessary for artistic preservation adds complexity. However, the ending's assertion that "moments can stretch beyond their ordinary span when tended with care" edges toward explicit moralizing, and the thematic resolution feels somewhat neat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of gentle intention surpassing forceful action emerges through the garden scent and vibration imagery. The final image of the lighthouse as "a heart beating in rhythm with the world" offers resonance, though the piece tends toward explicit thematic statements ("whispers truly travel farther than shouts").

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the glass eye's reflective power becoming a metaphor for communal truth-seeing after the empathy virus.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of memory and isolation emerges through the dried flower's persistence and tide patterns, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the lighthouse beam as promise resonates thematically, though the "borrowed memory" concept relies on assertion ("he realized the gaps...were the stranger's borrowed memories") rather than earned revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of promises as compasses rather than burdens emerges organically through action, with the final transformation of the shop offering a non-literal answer about how past obligations can illuminate future paths. The recurring motifs (ants, glimmers, maps) accumulate meaning effectively, though the resolution edges toward being too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.6)
    The bleeding starlight motif effectively accumulates meaning from dream-haunting to physical manifestation to internalized power, creating thematic coherence around burdens of leadership. However, the ending's promise to "watch over the ridge" reads as stated moral rather than earned wisdom. The recurring dreams' actual content remains vague, weakening their thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of preserving fleeting moments emerges through the central metaphor of transforming presence into light, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of creative transformation emerges through concrete images (birch bark becoming "winged messenger," grave becoming story marker) rather than abstract statements.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding meaning in "forgotten fragments" emerges organically through the birthing clamp's transformation from medical tool to emotional conduit.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.3)
    The broken mirror metaphor and the concept of "imperfect miracles" resonate through concrete images like the perfume bottle and torn sheet music.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The spiral arbitration motif effectively structures the piece, creating recursive meaning through "journeying inward while walking out." The ending achieves thematic resonance with history as cyclical rather than terminal, though it edges toward abstraction without grounding in specific human cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of measurement versus experience emerges through concrete particulars—the "razor edges" of gears respecting shorelines, the key's responsiveness to tides. The final insight avoids explicit moralizing, though "every lock opens only when the heart is ready" edges toward statement rather than pure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of connection through "familiar strangers" and "letting go" emerges through repetition but lacks earned resonance. The physics metaphor about permeable barriers allowing energy flow rather than building pressure offers conceptual interest but doesn't arise from dramatized struggle. The ending's thematic statement feels imposed rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "lucid contradictions" theme emerges through the probability/gambling duality and the ledger bridging both worlds.

The mother's death hovers without charging specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete accumulation of voices on the disc, transforming endings into beginnings without stating this explicitly until earned through Lena's fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of memory preservation emerges through repetition but lacks complexity or earned insight. The covenant concept attempts resonance but never moves beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the reciprocity network and shared isolation without explicit moralizing. The final image of the station "humming with quiet laughter" while "the world outside seemed a little less isolated" offers resonant closure. The cure being "not a potion but the act of catalyzing connections" avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of blind navigation revealing inner landscapes - "navigating uncharted emotional depths required more than sight." The final realization that mapping requires "a compass forged from empathy" resonates without moralizing, and the image of Lira as "cartographer of inner realms" reweights the opening's physical mapmaking beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.4)

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in absence emerges organically through the harbor ritual, with "joyful sorrow" and "mapping silence" avoiding direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    The phoenix-as-redemption theme emerges organically through the tapestry fragment and final murals, avoiding explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.6)
    The whispers/shouts theme emerges through concrete action and pays off in the final image of the container door slamming shut.

The piece states its thesis explicitly in the discovered parchment rather than letting complexity emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.2)
    The light/darkness metaphor coheres throughout but remains surface-level without earning deeper resonance through specific dramatized struggle. The theme of "silent empathy" teaching through patience is present but feels imposed rather than emerging from actual conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme overwhelms scene work with abstract statements like "forests of second thoughts" and "the quiet has spoken."

    Theme emerges through the dissolution of boundaries between "thought and feeling," "ice meets sky," achieving resonance when "boundaries are meant to be explored." The final image of frost on glass provides non-literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the phoenix metaphor ("beauty often blooms from ruin") and crystallizes in the discovery that "imperfection was the truest melody." The glassblower's final wisdom about glass celebrating "the story each fissure tells" resonates without moralizing. The bartered awakenings concept serves as both plot mechanism and thematic vehicle for transformation through exchange rather than perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of transforming light into "audible color" and questioning sensory boundaries. The final image of "texture of connection" settling "like dust on ancient parchment" offers resonance without stating a moral, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of renewal through intention emerges through the pattern of withered things blooming, though it tends toward the abstract. The "genuinely artificial" paradox and "curtains of intention" metaphor create conceptual resonance, but the ending's explicit description of transformation ("proof that a genuinely artificial glow could seed real life") explains rather than embodies the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of mapping patterns after collapse emerges through consistent imagery, but resolves into explicit moralizing: "to map cultural patterns and guide a world reborn from digital ash." The concept of "reverse engineering" economic collapse through mystical means offers intrigue but lacks concrete dramatization of what this actually means or costs.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of abandoning certainty for truth emerges organically through the pattern-breaking method and crystallizes in "true purification comes not from erasing the past, but from embracing its fragmented atoms." The final image of the historian becoming "one more atom of nostalgia" resonantly reweights the entire journey without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of preserving hope across time emerges through the recurring stone and shadow imagery, avoiding explicit moralizing. The parallel between children reaching for kites across decades creates resonance. However, the theme remains abstract—"hope" and "shadow unbound" never gain specific meaning through dramatized action, leaving the central metaphor vague.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.2)
    The reconstruction/shedding metaphor pervades but doesn't deepen beyond its initial presentation. The final line about balance as "a river that must be tended" attempts resonance but arrives as stated wisdom rather than earned insight. Theme emerges through repetition rather than transformation of the central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of scars as stories and wounds as potential miracles. The final understanding that "time itself was a wound we could read" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The coffee rings as scar maps create layered meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "unused love" and "goodbye letters that the world had never mailed." The final image of the gazer "carrying the stored unused love like a lantern" offers a non-literal answer about transformation rather than storage, avoiding explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of liberating creativity through cosmic connection emerges through consistent imagery rather than direct statement. The "remembered stardust" and "unspoken verses" create thematic texture. However, the resolution into "freedom" feels unearned without demonstrating what imprisonment meant or what liberation costs. The final image of the archway as permanent testament lacks resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete transformation of ash to seed, avoiding explicit moralizing. The "fractured lullaby" motif accumulates meaning as it shifts from broken to harmonized, and the final image of the dreamless guard finding purpose in tending light offers resonant commentary on sacrifice and renewal without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of consciousness expansion emerges organically through the mechanical-organic fusion metaphor. The story resists simple moralizing, and the final image of carrying "the hum of insight like a lantern" resonates without stating its meaning. However, phrases like "probable miracles" and "wild frontier of his mind" occasionally feel like thematic placeholders rather than earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "unused courage" as a seed awaiting discovery. The indirect routes embody the non-linear path to bravery, and the final image of Mira setting foot on the ridgeway again resonates without moralizing. The map metaphor occasionally strains but mostly lands.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme of silence's cost and safety's price remains abstract, articulated through direct statements ("safety demanded a price") rather than emerging from concrete events. The final image attempts resonance with "hope can remain" but lacks the specific earned weight to recharge earlier material. The story tells us about "unpardonable silence" repeatedly without showing its actual cost through action.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the concrete struggle between legitimate sovereignty and "borrowed" power, with the rune of drift serving as both literal tool and thematic anchor. The ending's "power taken by deceit would always crumble under the weight of truth" resonates without heavy-handed moralizing. The graceful collapse motif effectively links physical and thematic dissolution, though some passages edge toward explicit theme statements.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of lost connections between human charts and natural systems emerges through concrete particulars (bleached coral losing chemical gradients, ancient trade routes). The final image of the station as "both anchored and adrift" resonates metaphorically. However, the revelation feels neat rather than complex—no counter-reading challenges the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of "thunderous serenity" and cycles of dormancy/rebirth without explicit moralizing. The final image of seeing "the universe reflected not in distant stars but in reclaimed hearts" reweights the opening's cosmic yearning toward human connection. Pattern and rhythm trump fixed meaning effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the tension between tradition and evolution without explicit moralizing until near the end. The embryo as "living bridge between old and new" resonates, though "collective growth" edges toward thematic echo in paragraph 4.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of anchoring "optimism in realism" emerges through the garden's resilience metaphor and the protagonist's somatic practice. The pearl of stillness concept provides a non-literal answer to surviving trauma. However, the thematic resolution feels overly neat, with explicit statements like "I will remember the laughter, I will honor the loss" that approach therapeutic prescription rather than earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of wholeness versus fragmentation emerges through concrete images (broken tarot box, torn cards, fractured ribs) rather than assertion. The phoenix card provides earned symbolism, and the final portrait as "luminous ache captured" offers resonance, though the resolution tends toward convenient synthesis rather than genuine complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme about time slowing in crisis emerges through direct philosophical statement rather than dramatized events. The story tells us about "the world's collective pause" and "deliberate deferral" without showing these concepts through concrete action or image that would make them resonate beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of breaking silence emerges through concrete imagery (frozen vellum to melting ice) rather than declaration, with the library's transformation from tomb to lighthouse resonating beyond plot. The "unspoken conversation" motif accumulates effectively, though the universal awakening lacks complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of finding peace amid ruin emerges through accumulated imagery and action. The "engraved quiet" and repeated "tranquil blaze" create resonance, though the ending veers toward explicit thematic statement ("weaving continuity through the chaos that lingered"). Subtext operates better in the physical gestures than in the somewhat overwrought prose.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of capturing divine essence through patient attention to natural patterns emerges organically through the garden's sound waves and the fisher's methodical approach. The ending offers resonance without explicit moralizing: freedom through release rather than possession.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.9)
    The "orbits of regret" concept provides coherent thematic throughline about cyclical corruption, though it tends toward abstraction. The proof by contradiction method offers intellectual resonance but lacks embodied struggle. The ending's promise of accountability emerges from events rather than being stated, though the journalist's arrival feels thematically convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of transforming sorrow into comfort emerges through the amber/beetle/lullaby constellation, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of the laboratory as "sanctuary where time folds in on itself yet never repeats the pain" offers resonance. However, the piece relies heavily on abstract concepts ("tethering cries," "haunted firmware") without grounding them in lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme emerges through the sand patterns and silence-as-language concept, avoiding direct moralizing until the final line's unfortunate "testament that meaning can arise from mess." The unlearning concept develops organically but lacks specificity about what exactly is being unlearned.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges powerfully through the paradox of "arms of steel" cradling empathy—mercy must be engineered, not simply felt. The final image of children's laughter as "tender rebellion" and strangers bringing chipped stones hoping to "rename their sorrow into strength" offers a non-literal answer about compassion requiring structure to survive catastrophe.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of hope persisting beyond endings emerges through the ghost's encore and the orchard's promise that "every closed business could bloom anew." The tarot symbols shifting from Tower to sunrise provides non-literal resonance. However, the final lines explicitly state the theme ("miracles still echo"), and the shopkeeper's role feels mechanically inserted to voice hope rather than emerging from dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of skepticism yielding to wonder emerges through the "willowglass" metaphor (transparent yet resilient), but relies on explicit statements like "even the most skeptical heart could learn to trust." The final image of shared secrets through "curiosity meets compassion" tells rather than dramatizes the thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the transitional object bridging "forest above with the abyss below." The final insight about amplifying existing silence rather than imposing voice resonates without moralizing. The elm leaf's journey from fossil to "living conduit" to "solitary star" creates layered meaning about preservation and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of "shared wisdom" and collective memory without explicit moralizing. The final image of winds carrying the echo "across the sea of time" resonates without stating a lesson. The story explores how individual actions connect to collective possibility. Strong subtext in the buttons as "testimonies of hidden lives."

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of redemption through "fixing what's broken" emerges through the snow codes and pillbox imagery, with the "silver hush" creating resonance. However, the final paragraph's explicit statement that "the world could heal when its people acted prudently daring" veers into moralizing, and "unused courage" as metaphor feels abstract rather than earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.4)
    The palimpsest metaphor of layered memory resonates through river/fog imagery but resolves into abstract "simple truth" without specificity. Theme emerges through accumulation rather than earned insight, though the layering motif creates some coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of resilience through fragmentation emerges organically through the oasis's fractured timelines and dormant hives, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the lantern as beacon effectively reweights the concept of resistance from damage to protection. However, the thematic insight arrives too smoothly without earned complexity or counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of planting luminous vines as metaphor for nurturing hope in darkness. The ending offers a non-literal answer: "to reflect light into dark corners was the truest form of care." However, the theme lacks complexity—no counter-reading emerges, and Mara's devotion faces no challenge to its premise.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.0)
    The coexistence theme emerges through concrete imagery (whale bones, library consciousness, shared resonance) rather than statement. The final image of stepping forward "ready to write the next chapter" offers resonance but lacks the non-literal complexity that would deepen meaning. The transformation from isolation to independence feels asserted rather than earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of connection through secret stories emerges through the installation's function as "conduit" for love letters across time. The recurring "thread" motif and "prismatic quiet" create coherence. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("each secret weaving into the next"), violating the show-don't-tell principle at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of interference-as-bridge and individual frequencies harmonizing collectively. The final image of the valley as chorus effectively reweights earlier isolation. However, the piece occasionally veers toward explicit thematic statements ("power plays could be outmaneuvered when every listener tuned their own inner frequency").

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.4)
    The spatial mutiny metaphor resonates through the architecture's rebellion, but the thematic leap to "forgetting of stories that bind humanity" arrives without preparation. The final garden of knowledge-bearing fungi suggests theme through image, yet the connection between spatial rebellion and narrative memory remains intellectualized rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of "unifying opposites" (blindness/sight, silence/sound) emerges through Mara's method and resonates with her condition. However, the story states its themes explicitly ("by unifying opposites—silence and sound, darkness and fleeting light") rather than letting them emerge from concrete action. The ending's promise of awakened empathy guiding future work gestures toward meaning but lacks earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of overlooked bravery needing recognition emerges through Mara's quest and culminates in the red line on maps marking courage across time. The "reversible exile" metaphor of spirits returning to honor works conceptually. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("the world still needed librarians who could map bravery"), violating the show-don't-tell principle and reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of forgiveness/redemption emerges through the amnesty concept and imagery of transformation, but relies heavily on abstract assertions ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'"). The final paragraph contains explicit moralizing about hope and grace rather than earning resonance through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of circles as "the universe's method of testing whether travelers remember the roads they once left" emerges organically from the mapping metaphor and Arlen's heritage. The foreign currency collection bridges his father's territorial past with digital boundaries. However, the final realization arrives through explicit internal monologue rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of shared burdens emerges through repetition and the telegram's message, but remains conceptually thin without dramatized complexity. The story gestures toward healing through words and communal knowledge-bearing without exploring what this costs or why it matters. The ending's assertion that "burdens would always be shared" lacks earned resonance from specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of hidden truths beneath surfaces emerges through the mirror metaphor and frozen confession, but resolves into tidy symbolism. The final image of water "that finally reflects not just the sky, but the truths beneath" states rather than embodies the thematic conclusion. The piece doesn't complicate its central question about revelation versus concealment.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of binding "dream to duty" emerges through the covenant's purpose and the visionary's acceptance of her role as bridge. The recurring scar motif ("linking through scars") suggests healing through acknowledgment of wounds. However, the resolution slides toward explicit statement ("purpose thrives on curiosity's fire") and the thematic question resolves too neatly without complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of stitching/mending applied to souls, destinies, and memory, culminating in the insight that "bartered destinies were not merely trades, but stitches that bound both giver and receiver." The recurring imagery of roots as needles and amber threads creates resonance without stating a moral. However, some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("turning voids into conduits of memory") rather than staying grounded in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges through the "after the applause" motif and valley echoes, but resolution arrives through explicit declaration ("the true stage is not lit by spotlights but by the quiet conviction") rather than dramatized discovery. The final paragraph's moralizing ("every piece I saved was a step toward rewriting my own encore") replaces earned resonance with stated meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges through the central metaphor linking translation, germination, and spiritual transition. The analogical thinking concept effectively bridges past (tablets) and present (seed). However, the resolution tends toward explicit statement ("every translation was a seed") rather than letting the image carry full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of accepting paradox emerges through concrete images—fire that doesn't burn, water that doesn't drown, migrating identities. The final image of empty scrolls awaiting visitor contributions offers a non-literal answer to preserving wonder through participation. Avoids moralizing while achieving resonance through the creel-as-beacon transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transforming isolated sorrow into shared hope emerges through the pearl's function and the cave's transformation from "silent vault" to beacon. The recurring motif of walls/barriers pays off when hearts touch "across stone." However, the final paragraph's explicit statements about "dissolving walls between countless beating hearts" edges toward thematic declaration rather than letting the image carry full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of river-as-truth and graffiti-as-wisdom without explicit moralizing. The concept that forgiveness requires "daringly methodical" repetition rather than single transformation resonates through concrete imagery, particularly the accordion's "raw solace that settled in my chest."

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of hidden knowledge and unspoken words emerges through concrete images (floating glyphs, luminous petals) rather than assertion. The final garden offers a resonant answer about preservation of the unspoken. However, the theme lacks complexity—no counter-force questions whether these words should remain unspoken.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the weighing of dreams against empires, with the ice violin's "perforated destiny" offering multiple possible futures. The final image of the violin's "frost-laden chord" propagating change resonates without stating a moral, though some symbolic elements feel overly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the act of finding patterns in apparent chaos, suggesting meaning persists even in dissolution. The emerald chip as "beacon" for wanderers creates resonance beyond individual salvation. The covenant metaphor and "tapestry of existence" risk abstraction but remain grounded in the specific ritual. Final image of spark illuminating darkness effectively reweights the opening's "radiant hush."

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the cycle metaphor connecting vines, forgiveness, and rebirth without explicit moralizing until the final paragraphs. The hairpin's spiral effectively embodies cyclical renewal, and the wine that "sang of rebirth" pays off the pattern. Loses points for over-articulation: "forgiveness and steadfast care are the true sources of lasting contentment."

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of certainty versus nuance, with the wind chimes and hollow mirror providing resonant vehicles for exploring truth's multiplicity. The concept of "protected vulnerability" threads through effectively. However, the final paragraph veers toward explicit moralizing ("every truth she carried needed a place to rest") that undermines the otherwise subtle thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of "teaching vanishing to appear" emerges organically through the ripple patterns, delayed revelation, and final mirror scene without explicit moralizing. The ending reweights the opening quest as Mira realizes she already possessed what she sought, creating genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete tension between movement and stillness, with the final image of "slipping into silence" offering a non-literal answer about alternative forms of progress. The pulse motif accumulates meaning without becoming heavy-handed. Subtext operates well through the canyon-as-teacher metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of quiet brilliance versus mechanized spectacle emerges through consistent imagery and the final transformation. The "lingering luminance" motif effectively contrasts automated fireworks with softer magic. However, the resolution tilts toward assertion ("the sacred was not a distant relic but the simple act of letting go") rather than earned insight through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.5)
    The synesthetic concept of sound-as-color emerges through concrete imagery ("ribbon of sound that curled into a spiral of violet and amber"), avoiding direct statement. However, the theme lacks complexity—Eli's quest succeeds without examining why this knowledge matters or what discovering it costs humanity or himself.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the backwards prophecy concept—looking backward to move forward, finding purpose in alignment rather than destination. The final realization that purpose is "a frequency" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the coins' "whispers" and static's "memory of all that was ever spoken."

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of sacrifice-as-bridge emerges organically through the naming ritual, where giving voice to fears enables their dissolution. The "echo of sacrifice" transforms from burden to connection without explicit moralizing. The final image of the observatory as sanctuary where "distant intimacy lingered" resonates with earned complexity, though some passages like "linking grief to gratitude" edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the integration of patience, precise observation, and cosmic harmony. The final image of refracted light creating "a thousand tiny suns" resonates without explicit moralizing, though the "earnest effort" reflection edges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of collective memory versus individual truth emerges organically through the investigation, with the sapphire label linking past and present. The final image of the reservoir as "an ancient eye, watching the town breathe anew" offers resonant closure without explicit moralizing. The story effectively explores how shared narratives can heal or harm communities.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete imagery of fire/water balance, the starlings' algorithmic dance, and the final synthesis of "alchemical symbols to the intuition of birdsong." The story resists explicit moralizing, allowing the transformation to speak through action and image. The final paragraph's "true alchemy begins where logic yields to awe" borders on thesis statement but remains grounded in the specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.5)
    Theme of duty and remembrance emerges through the buckle and repair ritual but resolves into simple affirmation. The "soundless echo" motif creates atmosphere without deepening meaning. The ending's "ready to watch, ready to bear" states rather than transforms the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of reconciling opposites emerges through the blade concept and clone/original partnership, but relies on direct statements ("complementary opposites," "partners not prisoners"). The ending's shift to Mara teaching dilutes rather than deepens the thematic resonance established through Kael's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of nurturing innovation through unconventional pathways emerges through the seed/puzzle parallel, but the story explicitly states its thesis multiple times ("safeguarding space for innovation"). The corpse flower's bloom as "a map of constellations drawn in vapor" offers poetic resonance but doesn't reweight prior material with complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of grief-as-melody emerges through the accumulation of sound metaphors and the transformation of mourning into restoration. The concept of "tending to the unspoken" resonates throughout, though the resolution—complete restoration of joy—sidesteps complexity for tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "making friends with uncertainty" - the guardian must risk the known order to find connection. The recurring boundaries (light, mist, dimensional planes) accumulate meaning without explicit statement. The final image of visitors leaving with "fragments of uncertainty to cradle" resonates thematically, though the "lattice of interiorized exteriors" veers toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of creative destruction emerges organically through the alchemist's methodology and crystallizes in "sculpting anew through measured ruin." The paradoxical "frozen bloom of flame" and the crozier as "half relic, half phoenix" effectively embody the theme without explicit moralizing, creating genuine resonance between action and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding beginnings in endings emerges through concrete action and the recurring "serenely electric" motif. The final broadcast creating village rebirth offers a non-literal answer, though the transformation feels somewhat mechanical rather than emotionally resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the central paradox of "permanent transient"—how fleeting moments can be anchored through intention and pattern. The empty hourglass that fills backward becomes a potent symbol of reclaimed time, while the final image of Lio sailing onward suggests ongoing navigation between ephemeral and eternal.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of connection between thought and feeling emerges through accumulated imagery rather than statement, with the sinew thread literalizing invisible bonds. The final image of passersby carrying "their own sinew thread of possibility" offers resonance, though the piece occasionally veers toward abstraction ("texture of connection") rather than embodied particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of bridging depths and sky emerges through the anchor chain link's symbolism and repeated horizon imagery. The balance between tradition (anchor) and progress (chain) resonates conceptually. However, the theme remains abstract without dramatized conflict to test these ideas—no character must choose between competing values with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete pursuit of preserving memory and voice beyond death. The concept of "incidental heroism" arising from "persistently curious" investigation avoids explicit moralizing. The final image of the restored photograph as "beacon for vulnerable voices" resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of remembering the forgotten emerges through concrete imagery, particularly the scientists' names "etched in sea-foam." However, the final burial action muddles rather than crystallizes the thematic question, and "standing by the unremembered" reads as prompt-echo rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of identity persistence despite bureaucratic erasure emerges organically through the ghost-as-mirror revelation. The porcelain shard accumulates meaning from broken teacup to data conduit to destiny-rewriter. However, the final paragraph's explicit statement about "ensuring no death certificate would ever again be signed by a glitch" veers toward moralizing, diminishing the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of preservation through transformation emerges organically from the concrete actions of translating texture to sound. The final image of bone towers "whispering the same song" resonantly answers the opening question without stating a moral. However, the piece occasionally veers toward abstract philosophizing ("a secret for no living tongue") rather than letting the imagery carry full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "bitterness into a cosmic joke," with the universe itself "waiting for someone to laugh at its own darkness." The recurring harmony motif and frost-as-hope metaphor build resonance without explicit moralizing, though some phrasing edges toward abstraction ("fragment of forgotten song").

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of organic beauty versus mechanical oppression emerges through concrete images like the glowing orchard and rust-clad towers. The recurring motif of "resonantly soft" music as revolutionary force accumulates meaning effectively. The final image of the violinist departing to spread seeds of resonance offers a non-literal answer to the central question, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the central metaphor of "linking absences" and healing broken promises through acknowledgment of voids. The storm-in-a-bottle serves as a concrete vehicle for abstract peace-making. The final image of crossing drone paths crystallizes the theme without stating it, though some phrasing ("We honor the voids") edges toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the central metaphor of "interpreting silence as possibility" without explicit moralizing. The recurring imagery of the halo fragment and wind bells creates resonance. However, the thematic work occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("endless possibility that silence, when interpreted, becomes a road paved with light") rather than staying grounded in specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of memory preservation emerges through the central metaphor but remains surface-level. The story states its thesis explicitly ("stories lived in a hidden geometry") rather than earning it through dramatized struggle. The ending's "birth of countless tales" reads as unearned sentiment without complexity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of shared longing emerges through repetition but relies heavily on abstract philosophizing: "cipher of longing was not a puzzle to be solved but a bridge." The final paragraph explicitly states the moral rather than letting imagery carry meaning. The pearl metaphor has potential but dissolves into conceptual vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges as explicit abstraction ("a living bridge between fear and courage") rather than through concrete particulars. The final paragraphs abandon scene work entirely for thematic summary: "every tangled thought can be untied with patience and a ribbon of intention" reads as prompt-echo moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of memory, loss, and recovery without explicit moralizing. The recurring motifs of broken constellations and fairy rings accumulate meaning, culminating in "When habits break, the mind learns to stitch new habits from the fragments of old." However, the thematic resolution feels slightly neat—the memories return completely restored as songs without exploring what might be irretrievably lost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of resilience-through-gentleness emerges organically through "combative tenderness" and "battling neglect required the gentlest of touches." The final image of walls healing themselves while the library's "heart beating anew" offers resonant answer without stating moral. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction like "resilience, once mentored quietly, would now roar back."

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of preserving wonder emerges through concrete images like luminous spores becoming "fireflies across the garden" and the orchard hearing "distant songs of other worlds." The final offering of a sprig to restore the traveler's homeland extends the theme effectively, though the piece veers toward explicit moralizing with phrases like "wonder never truly fades."

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of transforming grief through patient craft emerges organically through the mask restoration metaphor and accumulated silence. The final image of "silence, when tended, can become a sanctuary itself" resonates without moralizing. However, the piece lacks complexity or counter-readings that would deepen thematic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of reading "silence like a language" and bridging temporal divides. The map tear as "portal" rather than flaw offers genuine thematic resonance without explicit moralizing. Final image of "dialogue across generations" reweights all prior material, though it edges toward abstraction in the last lines.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the physics metaphor: "tension to release that powered the ship's very pulse." The snow globe serves as effective microcosm without heavy-handed symbolism. The ending reweights prior material through dissolution imagery, though passages like "tension minus attachment equals the luminous path of release" veer toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges through the tension between digital consciousness and physical touch, with flowers bridging code and sensation. The final image of travelers adding their own verses creates resonance about collective memory and connection across boundaries. Subtext operates well in the ghost's plea for "a petal to ground my wandering," though the piece occasionally states its themes too directly ("a plea for connection, for touch, for belonging").

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of finding joy beneath anguish emerges through the spire's transformation from "furnace of laughter" to ice, paid off when crystal jars release warmth over cold walls. The "affectionate detachment" concept provides thematic coherence, though the resolution feels neat rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of memory persisting in emptiness emerges through the cloud-emotion taxonomy and recurring "spooled wholeness" motif. The concept avoids direct moralizing and builds through accumulation. However, the thematic question never faces genuine counter-pressure—memory simply does persist, without exploring what it costs to believe this or what happens if it doesn't.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of discovering limits as "thresholds she could cross" emerges through Lira's face blindness shaping her art, but remains abstract rather than dramatized through specific struggle. The secret book safe and ancient pigments suggest hidden knowledge, yet these elements don't cohere into earned wisdom. The final image attempts resonance but lacks the cost that would give it weight.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of hidden patterns yielding navigation emerges through concrete action as Lira decodes linguistic fragments to manifest light. The final synchronization between ship, luminance, and starling murmurations offers resonance without explicit moralizing, though the insight feels earned rather than profound.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of repair as metaphor for temporal healing, with the final image of the locksmith vanishing among clouds as "a keeper of keys and quiet hopes" offering resonant closure. The story resists explicit moralizing, letting the repair itself speak to cycles of brokenness and mending.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of community transformation from "strangers" to "family" emerges through accumulated action and the bell's resonance. The final commitment to seasonal repetition offers a non-literal answer about sustained collective effort. However, the resolution tends toward the saccharine with "brambled hope" lacking genuine complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges beautifully through the central image of being "beautifully flawed" - the broken puppet's "jagged crescent" mirrors the lighthouse's wounds, and Elara's "own cracks mending in the reflection." The lullaby as "pattern of ticking and silence" offers a non-literal answer to time's tyranny. The final transformation of the lighthouse from warning to peace-keeper resonates without stating a moral, though some passages edge toward the abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of cyclical sacrifice emerges through the ritual's repetition and "graceless beauty" of helping others while remaining trapped. The blueprint motif effectively bridges forgotten knowledge and present action. Final image of the wound that "will never fully heal" resonates without stating a moral. Slight abstract tendency in phrasing ("jagged elegance," "graceless ballet") prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of "translating separation into connection" emerges organically through the polymer bridge metaphor and extends to healing fractures across the region. The empty chrysalis transforms from failure symbol to "relic of redemption." However, the final Lio moment introduces new thematic material rather than deepening the established pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of "quantifying absence" and creation from void, avoiding direct statement. The recurring moonlight motif and the concept of measuring silence to create story resonates without moralizing. However, the thematic question resolves too cleanly—"the place where stories begin is not a location but a moment"—without embracing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central metaphor of memory as something that can be tasted, seasoned, and balanced emerges organically through Lir's gift and actions. The tidal pool formations mirror how "memory collected and receded," with fresh water clinging to salt "just as hope clings to despair." The final transformation from bitter remorse to "sweet promise" offers thematic resolution without stating a moral, though it edges toward neat resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of bridging divides through shared language and song emerges organically from the concrete actions, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of silos as "singing bridges of hope" resonantly answers the central question about healing industrial scars through art, though some metaphors (bridges/connection) lean toward the obvious.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of preserving abandoned dreams emerges through concrete imagery - the unfinished poem, unsung song, lovers parting. The mirror-as-bridge metaphor effectively links geological and neural networks. However, the resolution tends toward the sentimental with Aria simply succeeding in her cataloging mission without confronting what abandonment means.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of vigilance as cultivated practice rather than static knowledge emerges organically through the transformation of seeds into living lamps. The final promise to "guard the balance of knowledge as fiercely as gravity itself" resonates without moralizing, though the lack of dramatized struggle prevents deeper thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of empathy as tangible force emerges through concrete action—translating wood's pain into melody. The porcelain as "bridge" between materials creates resonance without heavy-handed symbolism. However, the phrase "empathy in motion" appears too explicitly five times, approaching thematic echo territory. The final image of the grove as "living archive" offers a non-literal answer to whether feeling can be made audible.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.2)
    The chess-as-existence metaphor and the theme of finding beauty in difficulty emerge through consistent imagery, though they tend toward abstraction ("each piece was a fragment of the covenant"). The ending's attempt at resonance—the covenant as canvas—feels unearned without concrete dramatization of what this transformation means.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of cataloging silences—"the hush of sunrise over a battlefield, the quiet gasp of a child's first breath"—and the final image of apprentices learning the "Symphony of Stillness." However, the piece veers toward explicit moralizing with "the path to empathy was not a road paved with grand gestures but a lattice of quiet recognitions."

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of cultivating "serenity within motion" emerges through the growing process and patience metaphor. However, the story explicitly states its thesis multiple times ("serenity could indeed be cultivated within motion") rather than letting it emerge through dramatized struggle. The corpse flower's symbolism feels predetermined rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of cyclical resilience emerges organically through the planetary inversions and the arrow tip's dissolution into renewal. The "gathering of echoes" as cultural memory resonates well. However, the final paragraph's explicit statement about "resilience was a rhythm" edges toward over-articulation, diminishing subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of "foresight in action" explicitly stated in italics and repeated verbatim reads as thesis announcement rather than emergent meaning. The flight engineer's patch functions as convenient symbol without constraining choice. Final image of containers "stretching like hopeful fingers" attempts resonance but lacks the particularity to reweight prior material with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    The synesthetic conceit of colors-as-notes creates thematic coherence around beauty and perception, and the recurring aurora imagery provides textural unity. However, the theme remains stated rather than dramatized ("certifying wonder as essential"), and the final image adds no resonant answer or reweighting beyond repetition of the opening assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges through the concrete image of the silent flute and the concept of learning from failure. The line "even noise can be avalanchingly quiet when it serves purpose" offers resonance. However, the insight that "old keepers had clung to one path" arrives as direct statement rather than earned revelation through dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of letterpress printing as emotional transposition. The final image of Mara collecting shards as "micro-verses of empathy" offers a non-literal answer to whether emotion can be mathematically encoded. The mathematics/feeling duality avoids simple resolution, embracing complexity through the "lucid turbulence" that pervades.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the pendant's ability to "germinate" wonder in routine lives, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of pilgrims seeking sympathetic vibration with their hopes offers resonant answer to how brief encounters become lasting myth. Subtext operates through the absent mentor's teachings and the pendant's selective response to different people.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of hidden emotional residue in objects emerges through concrete imagery like the frost patterns and prism's glow. The "truthful lie" paradox and the final "every step forward is both a loss and a gain" offer resonance. However, the ending's explicit statement that "objects do absorb emotions" over-articulates what the imagery already conveyed.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The loom/weaving metaphor elegantly unifies the piece, with silence as "a loom of absence" and sacrifice becoming "the very warp that would bind two worlds together." The theme of connection through sacrifice emerges organically from the journey. The ending reweights the opening's "wistful" characterization into purposeful loss.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "bartered awakenings" theme emerges through action—trading memory for silk, forging for rebuilding—though it occasionally surfaces as explicit statement ("giving up a fragment of fear to gain a slice of future strength"). The azure motif accumulates effectively. The final image of continued forging "beneath the arches" provides resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through the weight of withheld truth and its liberation, with the final image of scattered glass becoming stars offering resonance without stated moral. The commander's choice between elite evacuation and mass stasis creates genuine moral complexity that resists tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of preserving hope/safety through symbolic acts emerges through imagery rather than assertion, but remains surface-level. The "anonymous letter chain" concept introduces complexity but never develops beyond metaphor. The final image attempts resonance but lacks earned weight since we haven't seen the cost of maintaining or losing this "chain."

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of using "ancient shadows to paint the morning with hope," with the lighthouse beam's inward turn literalizing inner transformation. The "Shadowed elation" concept resonates in the ending's "strange, joyous melancholy," though the wisdom feels asserted ("the world would not end, but would be reborn") rather than earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of beauty bearing warning ("iridescent caution") emerges organically through the morpho wing and Lira's dual role as observer and participant. The final image of the loom as beacon resonates without explicit moralizing, though the insight about story magnetism could cut deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of transforming grief into peace through patient, mundane work emerges organically through the accumulation of healing imagery and the sextant's restoration. The concept of "quantified sorrow" becoming "measurable peace" offers genuine resonance. The final image of trees whispering approval and dawn arriving effectively reweights the opening's storm and sorrow without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of community renewal through shared memory emerges through the woven dawns metaphor and gathering spirits, avoiding direct moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's explicit "true alchemy" statement. The recurring light/dawn imagery accumulates meaning, but the final insight about "weaving hearts" arrives as declaration rather than earned revelation through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    The nested paradoxes concept resonates through the library's structure and the "staying while leaving" metaphor, with the mirror-as-blank-book offering a non-literal answer about self-acceptance. However, the wisdom arrives too easily through abstract exposition ("every mistake held a lesson") rather than earned struggle, and the theme of compassion never faces genuine complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of reclaiming sacred meaning from abandonment emerges through concrete images (guerrilla garden, preserved bread, secret tea house) rather than statement. The bread becomes "a quiet altar" and empty chair accepts offering, creating resonance through particulars. However, the thematic resolution feels predetermined without complexity—no counter-force challenges the protagonist's quest for meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the concrete act of measuring intangible promises, binding "vapor into testimony." The final vow that "memory, measured gently, could outlast oblivion" resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the parallel between cataloguing books and preserving memory, though some passages veer toward abstract philosophizing ("map guiding her through the abyss of silence").

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of "comforting unease" and cycles of "false starts" - peace as temporary reprieve rather than resolution. The watch fob's ticking becomes "a metronome for the night to count down," and Lila's wish to capture "the sound of trust breaking" resonates with her father's broken promises. The final image of walking toward new "false starts and fresh chances" offers a non-literal answer about accepting imperfect peace.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of emergent systems and planetary attunement develops through consistent imagery but resolves into explicit realization ("he realized they carried weather because...") rather than earned resonance. The final image attempts lyric closure but lacks the cost that would make the thematic weight undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of locked creativity, fractured inspiration, and artistic breakthrough, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of Lena's "charcoal fingers now warm" carrying stories "etched in crystal" resonantly reweights the opening's trembling uncertainty without stating lessons.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the zinc plate's physical reactions and the concrete discovery that "lost conversations" await truthful speakers. The concept that "candor in small moments could restore whole worlds" avoids abstraction by grounding it in physical mechanics (the vent, the bottles). The final image of the calligrapher documenting truth resonates without stating a moral, though some passages edge toward thematic declaration ("truth, once pieced together, never wilts").

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of preserving beauty/wonder against loss emerges through the central image of the ice sculpture but lacks complexity or counter-pressure. The piece tells its theme explicitly ("symphonies of truth," "color of wonder") rather than letting it emerge from dramatized conflict. Final paragraph moralizes directly rather than earning resonance through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    The organic/machine harmony theme emerges through concrete images—the breathing wooden box among metal systems, roses as compasses, the box becoming "seed" beneath vines. The final image of intertwining bark and plant effectively answers the thematic question without stating it, though "fragmented wholeness" edges toward abstract philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of healing through listening emerges through the locket's revelations and community response, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the phrase "listening truly healed" and similar declarations edge toward thesis statements rather than earned resonance through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of transforming vulnerability into encoded strength emerges organically through Selene's dance-cipher method and crystallizes in the final image of "encoded whispers, turning fear into a shared cipher." The spider web metaphor for time/patience recurs meaningfully, and the concept of "calm defiance" gains resonance through quiet actions rather than declaration. The ending's vision of future seekers learning to "encode their own frailties" offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of memory persistence emerges organically through the whale's beaching, the crystal chamber's formation, and Mara's quest. The final image of gravity holding memories offers resonance, though the piece tends toward explicit statement ("deleted memories were not lost, merely compressed") rather than trusting the imagery alone.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "mapping silence"—finding power in quietude rather than force. The final image of stars honoring her vow resonantly reweights the opening's solitary figure, creating meaning through accumulation rather than statement. The smoothed hush becomes both method and philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "agreed upon lies" as "stepping stones toward truth," with the antique seal's sigil representing "a protective charm for those who dare to converse with stone." The final image of learning to hear "a window latch as if it were a word" offers resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. However, some thematic articulation feels overly explicit, particularly "to learn the language of old buildings not merely to decode inscriptions, but to hear the heartbeats of forgotten walls."

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme emerges through repetitive abstract concepts ("resonance structures," "quarantined memory," "ghostly resolve") that feel more like prompt-language than organic emergence from scene. The final paragraph explicitly states the thematic transformation ("memory she had once quarantined would now bloom, eternally resonant, forever independent"), violating the show-don't-tell principle at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of forgiveness and artistic rebellion emerges through recurring motifs (rose thorn, unfinished scrolls, calibrated treason). The final paragraph's "forever cherish the unfinished and the forged alike" articulates rather than embodies the theme. Subtext operates weakly; most meaning sits on the surface through direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of echoes as "unfinished promises" and "living memories seeking release." The final insight—that people echo when stories remain untold—resonates without moralizing. The shell's transformation from half to whole effectively embodies completion, though the resolution tends toward neat satisfaction rather than lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the central metaphor of fragmented wholeness - the melted globe's shards living in collective dreams. The ending reweights "salvage" from extraction to collaborative reassembly. Yet the piece occasionally states its wisdom directly ("truth, carefully woven, could expose hidden beauty") rather than letting images carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of appreciating hidden effort emerges through repeated imagery of nets, patterns, and unseen hands, though it tends toward abstract philosophizing rather than embodied discovery. The story explicitly states its theme multiple times ("appreciation of hidden effort," "quiet perseverance of all who work unseen") rather than letting it arise from concrete particulars. The final image attempts resonance but lacks the specificity to avoid feeling generic.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of truth versus comfortable lies emerges through concrete action (reconstructing shredded documents, debunking the curse) but resolves too neatly into a moral about stillness and clarity. The final transformation of the orchard from decay to sanctuary lacks earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of transforming darkness/ancient shadows into light/hope emerges organically through the sustained metaphor system and reaches resonant closure in the lighthouse image. Selene's prophecy and the variant allegiance concept deepen the thematic question about loyalty to unconventional sources of power. The piece achieves complexity without stating its moral, though some passages edge toward abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of capturing ephemeral sounds in glass, avoiding abstract philosophizing about memory and heritage. The music box's transformation from "abandoned" to acknowledged participant creates resonance without stating a moral. The final image of the child as "a link, a translator of the dunes' ancient chorus" reweights all prior collecting as purposeful rather than eccentric.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of "sonic absolution" resonates through concrete details like the 432 hertz frequency and the crystal's healing potential versus weaponization. The ending achieves thematic coherence with the lighthouse beam merging with the crystal's hum, though the opposition between healing and harm could be more dramatically embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme overwhelms story through explicit statements like "unyoke the rush, honor the still" and "a patient revolution could reshape even the most rigid stone." The final paragraph commits thematic echo, restating the prompt's language directly. Subtext is absent; everything is declared rather than implied through action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of breaking free from bureaucratic neglect through empirical action emerges through the underground railroad parallels but relies on explicit statements ("controlling influence," "fortified vulnerability") rather than dramatized complexity. The lantern symbolism connecting past resistance to present investigation provides some resonance. The ending's "collective gratitude" and liberation from "shadow" feel unearned without showing specific systemic change.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    The redemption-through-repair metaphor emerges organically from concrete actions rather than assertion. The clockwork heart effectively embodies the theme without requiring explicit statement. The final image of the chaplain carrying the music box back to the prison resonates well, though the "second opinion" concept could integrate more deeply beyond surface mentions.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of "irreverent awe" toward mystery emerges through Mara's actions and the workshop's responsive personality, avoiding explicit statement. The bell that "no one hears yet" suggests engaging with the unknowable, but this remains surface-level without exploring cost or contradiction. The ending's pivot to the prism undermines thematic resolution by introducing a new quest rather than deepening the current one.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of memory persistence versus deletion emerges organically through the archive's hidden layers and resurrection of "deleted" files. The final message "stored in the silence you felt as absence" reweights the entire search without explicit moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges through the crystal's restoration bringing warmth and renewal. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the thematic message ("the true power lay not in the stone but in the willingness to listen"), violating the show-don't-tell principle at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the recurring "fold in patience" and "sound of endings" without explicit moralizing until the final line. The lace parasol tip accumulates meaning from heirloom to "fragile compass" to final gratitude object. Final paragraph edges toward theme statement but the earned resonance mostly compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.2)
    The parallel between burnt love and scarred vines develops the theme of "mismatched destinies" finding harmony, but relies heavily on abstract declarations. The final image of the sentinel "finally felt whole" tells rather than shows thematic resolution. The piece gestures toward complexity but doesn't dramatize it through specific events.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of wisdom transmission through "peripheral awareness" rather than direct teaching emerges organically from the desert imagery and the Keeper's liminal position. The final image of constellations echoing the day's teachings and new paths forming in the dunes offers resonant answers without stating morals. However, the theme would benefit from more friction - some cost to preserving wisdom or tension in the transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the arc metaphor and collective memory reconstruction. The feather symbol and "transmute pain into a masterpiece" line approach explicit moralizing (-0.4). However, the final image of the field as "timeless canvas" offers resonant closure without stating the moral directly.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of language evolution emerges organically through the crystal's revelations and connects to larger questions about cultural memory. The final image of Mara leaving her own "testimony" resonates thematically. However, the piece lacks complexity - no counter-readings emerge, and the wisdom feels somewhat abstract rather than earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete metaphor of recording ephemeral sounds, avoiding direct moralizing. The final insight about letting aging "ripple outward like a tide that carries shells to new shores" resonates without stating its meaning, though some passages edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of finding constancy within chaos emerges through the interplay of spinning/stillness and ephemeral/eternal motifs. However, the resolution feels predetermined rather than discovered, with the sage's wisdom arriving fully formed rather than earned through the specific struggle of this repair.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in endings emerges through the broken vinyl metaphor and "wholeness from brokenness," but resolution arrives through direct statement ("endings are not loss but transformation"). The "scent of hope" functions more as abstract assertion than earned resonance. The final whisper to the sky that lives "would forever hum" reads as sentimental rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of hidden migrations and cyclical patterns emerges through the shadow revelation and loop-closing methodology. The final image of shadows disappearing into the luminous chamber offers resonance, though the piece tends toward explicit explanation ("the shadows' noon destination was the very heart of the isle") rather than trusting the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of redemption through transforming "mistakes into constellations" emerges through imagery and repetition but relies heavily on abstract metaphors. The final image of Mara drawing star maps connects thematically but doesn't offer a resonant answer earned through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of creating light without burning. The final line "the softest glow...can illuminate the darkest paths without ever burning" resonates without moralizing, though the wisdom feels somewhat unearned by concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of transforming pain into "gentle knowledge" emerges through the moss garden metaphor and digital-organic fusion, though it tends toward abstraction with repeated phrases like "honeyed hush" that don't accumulate new meaning. The final image of the garden as "living archive" offers resonance but the transformation feels asserted rather than earned through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through the accumulation of "shapes of different hopes" and swimming "against the current of conventional narratives," avoiding direct statement. The final image of the novelist stepping back into the mist "carrying the spiral seashell fragment like a compass toward unseen stories" offers a non-literal answer about artistic persistence without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the restoration of forgotten traditions via "memory sung through forgotten songs." The final image of children learning to listen for whispered melodies offers a non-literal answer about cultural transmission. The remedy lying "not in steel or fire, but in memory" resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of patience as physical practice emerges through the ritual's slow movements and seasonal return promise. However, thematic statements proliferate explicitly ("translating heartbeats into maps was not a task but a covenant"). The final image of "luminous maps for all who might wander" gestures toward resonance but lacks earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of preserving wonder emerges through the echo-harvest metaphor and the cellar/library distinction. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the thematic lesson ("a lesson in listening to the periphery of existence"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The concept of "reverse-engineering secrets" offers resonance but lacks complexity or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of burden transformation emerges through concrete imagery—weights becoming a "feather of balance," calcified water forming singing statues. The final promise that burdens can become "constellations to be admired" offers resonance without explicit moralizing, though the transformation feels too neat without examining what makes this alchemy possible or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of transformation through craft emerges organically from the carving process, with the paradox of "here and gone" earning resonance through concrete action. The final image of the lantern as beacon effectively reweights prior material without stating a moral. The story achieves complexity through Mara's acceptance that "loss can be a tool, not a trap," though occasionally the thematic work becomes explicit rather than fully embedded in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of carrying forward despite erosion emerges through concrete particulars—the carousel memory, collected story fragments, the ghost as younger self. The final image of walking toward the horizon with "fresh roots in the lagoon's depth" offers resonant non-literal answer about persistence through loss, though some thematic statements edge toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of engineering hope from abandonment emerges through concrete action and the recurring "maze of intentions" motif effectively links builders' past promises to the intern's present work. The final spiral image resonates, though the explicit statement about "engineering and hope" edges toward moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of making peace with abandoned dreams emerges through the clock metaphor, though the resolution tends toward the sentimental. The memory-counting clock concept offers originality, but the piece states its meaning too directly: "he finally made peace with the dream that had once haunted him like a bear in winter."

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.6)
    The sundial-as-truth-revealer motif recurs meaningfully, and "salvage" resonates across mechanical and metaphorical registers. However, the theme articulates too directly through phrases like "training instincts was his compass" rather than emerging from dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the weaving metaphor—knowledge braided into rope, patterns hidden in knots—without explicit moralizing. The ending's spiral constellation offers a non-literal answer about patience and preservation, though some passages edge toward abstraction ("the world seemed to hold its breath in reverence").

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of healing through acknowledgment of absence emerges organically from the traveler's actions of writing "obituaries for the living." The final image of following "the map his own words had drawn" offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, phrases like "geography of healing" and "lonesome splendor" edge toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of bridging mechanical precision with organic life emerges clearly through the phoenix's integration with the palace's gears. The "bitterly sweet" paradox resonates, though the resolution feels too neat—beauty triumphs without exploring the genuine tension between industrial progress and natural wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of transformation through compassionate tending emerges organically from the ritual action and fire/water imagery. The final image of clouds carrying "the song of healed scars" offers a non-literal answer to whether destruction can become creation. Some thematic statements edge toward the explicit ("compassion is a tide that never truly recedes"), but the overall resonance feels earned through accumulated particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the concrete transformation of forgotten to remembered, with the stained glass box serving as a vessel for collective memory. The final image of Mara as "keeper of light" who will "scatter them like seeds" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The story explores how skepticism can coexist with belief through patient action rather than abstract philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast of fire/light, past cruelty/present gentleness, and mathematical infinity/organic growth. The final image of the gear seeding new light effectively synthesizes these oppositions. The story resists explicit moralizing, letting imagery carry meaning. However, some thematic statements edge toward the abstract ("bridge the unseen," "love across epochs").

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the physical mapping of grief via ribbons, butterflies, and stones rather than stated philosophy. The final image of water gliding over the ribbon-etched heart while "the stone sang with the soft hum of butterflies" offers a non-literal answer about how collective grief flows rather than scars. The family poetry tradition adds texture without becoming heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of incremental repair emerges through repeated imagery of stitching, mending, and small acts accumulating. However, it's stated too directly ("incremental absolution—small, deliberate acts") rather than emerging from dramatized struggle. The ending's assertion that "countless souls who dared to mend the world" feels unearned without showing the cost of such daring.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the tapestry's revelation that intentions can be misread, culminating in the seed metaphor that reframes memory work as generative rather than archaeological. The circular shape of intentions binding "past and future together" offers genuine complexity without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transforming ignorance into possibility emerges organically through the cartographer's practice and the kingdom's adaptation. The "groundedly imaginative" approach bridges empirical and mythic effectively, though the final realization about "embracing what one does not know" edges toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of dust from forgotten particles to story-carriers, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of dust as storyteller resonates without stating its meaning. The recurring luminous/glow motif accumulates purposefully, though "thistled calm" feels less integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of preserving ephemeral memory emerges through the ash-scattering ritual and "the mirage of safety shattered, revealing that true safety lives inside the brave act of feeling." However, the final paragraph veers into explicit moralizing that undermines the earned resonance of the crystallized emotion image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between singular truth and "chorus of truths," with the cog serving as a concrete metaphor for time's multiple measures. The final image of water carrying ideas upward creates resonance without stating a moral. The piece earns its wisdom about competing narratives coexisting through specific archaeological work rather than abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of art healing division emerges through the enacted transformation, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final lines approach thesis territory. The rosette pattern symbolizing lost melodies and later glowing with reconciliation provides coherent imagery. However, the transformation's ease undermines thematic complexity—hatred dissolves without exploring what sustained it.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the pruning metaphor and the transformation of ruins into renewal without heavy-handed moralizing until the final line. The concept of "gentle rebellion" as quiet pruning rather than violent overthrow offers genuine complexity, and the memory-as-ingredient conceit adds thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    The echo concept elegantly answers why mechanical precision failed—the city needed to hear its own voice return. Theme emerges through concrete images: dead drones becoming memory in bell chimes, citizens gathering in "quiet ceremony." The final image of Mara sealing the riddle "knowing its secret would bloom when needed again" resonates without moralizing, though some passages edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of noticing subtle transformations emerges through the spreading hush and the narrator's role as catalyst. The perfumer's shard as "inadvertently profound" silence that shapes unintended thoughts provides thematic texture. The ending offers a non-literal answer about houses feeling alive through shared listening, though the insight tends toward the abstract ("creeping normality that hides under every sunrise") rather than arising from concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of nuance versus certainty emerges through the garden's transformation and the statue's telepathic influence. The foxglove ampoule and recurring cascade imagery build resonance. However, the resolution feels predetermined—nuance wins without examining what certainty protected or why it existed, reducing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of imperfection enabling rather than hindering perpetual motion emerges organically through the chipped die's behavior and Aric's mathematical proofs. The paradox that "deliberate imbalance...stabilized the motion" offers genuine complexity. However, phrases like "boundless confinement" and "cage and key" feel overly articulated, and the final paragraph tends toward explicit thematic summary rather than letting the image carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete image system of lost languages becoming visible through art and kindness. The final image of the greenhouse as "sanctuary where lost languages found voice" resonates without stating a moral, though the connection between language and kindness occasionally feels asserted rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of art preserving displaced identity emerges through concrete actions—bread initials, lens magnification, calligrapher's strokes—rather than assertion. Final image of "emerald-tinted lens...that guides future guides" offers non-literal answer about cultural memory. "Rosewater dread" effectively layers hope with loss throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of reversing fate through ingenuity emerges from the counter-clockwise motif and mechanical mastery, with the yoyo-as-cipher adding conceptual depth. However, the ending states rather than dramatizes the theme ("forging a future unbound by time"), and the sailor's observation feels tacked on rather than resonant. The hunger stone's "latent radiance" works better as recurring image than thematic driver.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of confronting fear through paradox emerges through the dream dictionary notes and mirror imagery, though execution tends toward the literal. The final bargain offers complexity - becoming a beacon for others' dread - but arrives without sufficient groundwork. "Fear is a candle; snuff it with its own flame" provides the story's thematic anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete transformation of obstacles into instruments without explicit moralizing. The recurring musical-botanical fusion creates resonant meaning about harmony arising from constraint. The final image of the prophet setting out to other orchards effectively reweights the opening's isolation into purposeful mission.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the pattern-language concept—communication beyond words, connection through geometry and resonance. The reed whistle becomes a thematic bridge between human and non-human understanding. The ending's revelation that "the true lost expedition was...the city's own willingness to listen" offers resonant repricing without explicit moralizing. Slight deduction for the final "forever" which edges toward sentiment over earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The noble lies theme emerges organically through the kingdom's fabricated heroic death paralleling the station's abandoned purpose. The final transformation of noble lie into "transparent honesty" offers resonance, though it arrives through assertion ("Arlen felt") rather than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of memory versus oblivion emerges through concrete action (placing notes, using the inkwell) rather than abstract statement. However, the ending's promise to return doesn't offer a resonant answer to the central question—it simply extends the status quo without reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of hidden knowledge and sacrificial preservation emerges through plot events rather than explicit statement, with the antique stamp becoming a symbol of continuity. However, the thematic resonance remains surface-level—the story doesn't interrogate what makes knowledge worth drowning a city for or what Mara sacrifices to preserve truth.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of transforming grief through craft emerges organically through the glass basilica as dream recorder and origami cranes as vessels for pain. The paradox of "ascending while descending" offers conceptual richness, though the ending doesn't fully reweight prior material with a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the transformation of "unused potential" from external treasure to internal state, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of "constellation of hopes he could finally grasp" resonantly reweights the opening loss without stating meaning, and the complexity of grief-becoming-possibility resists simple resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.3)
    The belonging theme emerges through accumulated imagery (scattered pieces, shared song, collaborative pulse) but resolves into tidy abstraction. The pilgrim's assertion that "frequency of belonging was the pulse of every living star" reads as theme statement rather than earned insight. The concept lacks the complexity and ambiguity that would invite deeper reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through repetition of abstract concepts (truth, weight, memory, guilt) but lacks grounding in specific dramatized events. The carved phrase "the weight of a withheld truth is heavier than any crown" reads as explicit moralizing rather than earned wisdom. The story gestures toward exploring fabricated versus authentic memory but never develops this tension through concrete choices or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of transforming mistakes into wisdom emerges through action and the recurring motif of "untethering." However, the story explicitly states its thesis multiple times ("forgiveness is not a gift but a bridge built from honesty"), and the final paragraphs lean heavily on abstract moralizing rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges through water/navigation imagery and the journey from brokenness to renewal, avoiding direct moralizing until the final promises. However, the resolution tends toward abstraction ("carry the memory of his regrets as lessons rather than shackles") without concrete particulars. The ending offers resonance but lacks the specific cost or reconfiguration that would elevate thematic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of empathy as transformative seed emerges organically through the mirror's whisper and the lake's brightening response to compassion, avoiding direct moralizing. The final realization that "dirty past could serve as compass rather than chain" offers resonant answer to the redemption question, with the baseball-as-time-capsule and mirror-as-promise creating layered meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of transcending death through transformation emerges through concrete ritual and imagery rather than statement, particularly in the moon-spice paste that "opens the veil." However, the thematic resolution feels predetermined—the fortune cookie's prophecy fulfills itself without ambiguity or counter-reading, and "Forever" as the final word provides tidy closure rather than resonant complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme emerges through the paradox of "mourning a future not yet lived" and time's accumulation, but resolution reduces to mystical healing without earned wisdom. The image of "reclaimed seconds" falling as stars offers resonance but lacks the specificity to reweight prior material. The ending's "whisper among winds" retreats into abstraction rather than crystallizing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of transforming sorrow into hope emerges through concrete imagery (Kwan Yin's tear mingling with newborn light) rather than statement. The final transformation from locked grief to open healing resonates, and "no force, only compassion" provides thematic coherence, though some passages drift toward abstract philosophizing ("the sorrow of the universe").

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.4)
    The transformation theme emerges through concrete images—fireflies as "captive constellations," their release creating "luminous tapestry"—but resolution tilts toward explicit thesis statements: "transformation was not a single event but a texture woven through every breath." The prophecy framework feels imposed rather than organically discovered through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of "revolution without violence" emerges through the cradle's invisible currents and whispered changes, avoiding direct statement. However, the transformation lacks complexity—no counter-position is dramatized, no soldier resists, making the theme feel one-sided. The "winking hush" motif recurs but doesn't accumulate meaning or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of pattern and chaos emerges through Fibonacci sequences imposing order on collapsed star dust, with the curse-to-compass transformation suggesting predetermined futures can be "coaxed by intentional design." The final image of painted rocks as "living map for eternity" resonates, though the piece occasionally states its themes too directly ("order could be forged from chaos").

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the cartography metaphor, with scars becoming cities and rivers in a navigable landscape. The transformation from censorship to collective healing resonates, though the final paragraphs edge toward explicit moralizing about "shared wonder" and "compassion."

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through heavy-handed metaphor rather than dramatized action. "Where does a question go when it is no longer a question but a destination?" arrives as philosophical assertion without earned resonance. The needle card's transformation into "map" feels imposed rather than arising from scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of beauty-from-chaos emerges through consistent imagery (fractures, light, rebuilding). However, it remains surface-level without complexity or counter-pressure. The penny token and false-bottom tin carry symbolic weight but don't deepen beyond their initial metaphorical value.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges through the tension between predetermined time (broken clock) and artistic agency (unplanned encore). The final image of the satisfied clock that "ticked once, then stopped" offers resonant resolution without explicit moralizing, though the abstraction ("pact with destiny itself") dilutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between empirical documentation and collective dreaming, avoiding explicit moralizing.

The integration of personal curiosity with communal recollection adds complexity without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of forgiveness and unspoken apologies emerges through the compass ritual and recurring cerulean imagery. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("a color only those who listen can truly see") rather than letting it resonate through image alone. The piece reaches for profundity but lands in abstraction.

    Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of cosmic and microscopic change, avoiding moralizing.

    Theme emerges organically from the central action of forging beauty from anarchy. The final image of the library as a "garden in stone" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this premise. The concept is fully integrated, resisting moralizing in favor of a complex, earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without a stated moral. Theme emerges organically from events and images (clock, compasses, encore). Subtext operates powerfully in implication, avoiding sermonizing. The final image is a profound conceptual repricing of time and art.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the convergence of empirical precision and shared dreams, resisting moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the seed’s awakening embodies the balance between "empirical whims" and "shared dreams." Subtext operates powerfully in images like the "silvered pages turning in a wind of thought," which reweights prior material without statement.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of unspoken apology and forgiveness emerges organically through potent, recurring images (compass, lace, cerulean) and is resolved in a resonant, non-literal final image that reweights everything prior without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of humility, process over spectacle, and reframing decay as data emerge organically through image. However, lines like “The universe preprocesses reality…” and “We are all dust, rearranged…” verge on explicit thesis, slightly dulling subtext. The final image still resonates by reweighting the world through small causes. The piece invites reflection without forced binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motifs (scorch, frost, song, ledger) braid toward a resonant answer, but the sentence “purpose lived not in grand gestures but in the quiet pauses” states the thesis outright, dulling subtext. The best thematic work is in images—the singing glass and frost‑taught light—rather than declarations. Emotional aftereffect is genuine, if a touch sentimental. Complexity is present but comfortingly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of survival, redemption, and transforming silence into song emerge through recurring objects and actions, with a strong final image. Subtext carries in the heat/sound interplay and the exhalation motif. A few explicit tells (“She realized that…”, “reminder that even when noise becomes impossible…”) edge toward moralizing and soften ambiguity. Overall resonance lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distress signals as a metaphor for grief and rest integrate through action (beacon pulses) rather than lecture, and the ending reweights “permanent address” with the library itself. The story resists moralizing and lets image carry meaning; “chased stillness” crystallizes into sanctuary. A few direct theme articulations (“to give rest a permanent address”) brush the edge of stating the thesis but remain supported by scene. The final merge reframes duty versus peace with lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Solidarity, mutual aid, and intergenerational continuity emerge from particulars (anonymous sacks, children learning knots, promise to pass the bell). The bell’s recurrence gathers thematic charge and the final image reweights quiet as communal lifeline rather than void. Some lines verge on thesis (“the purpose… was to build intergenerational support”), slightly thinning subtext at peak. Still, the emotional aftereffect is earned and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.7)
    Compassion, attention as healing, and the rechanneling of unused love accrue through concrete images (lattice, filament, arches). The ending image resonates, but one sentence (“to heal, one must first listen...”) and the final moral‑like phrasing (“healing was not a single act...”) edge toward articulation over implication. Still, the thematic throughline largely rises from action and image. Emotional aftereffect is warm and earned, if slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Time’s texture, loss/renewal, and perception’s mutability emerge through recurring particulars (fading photographs dissolving into threads; Möbius-like loops; the final glow). A few explicit statements (“the maze’s purpose was not a puzzle…”) slightly over-articulate the thesis. The last image reweights prior material without a moral, leaving a resonant aftertaste. Subtext hums in the exchange between loss (vanishing photos) and creation (new arch).

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Renewal versus silence is resonant, with strong final images (constellated light, jasmine, first shoot). However, the text explicitly explains its metaphor (“the ‘wall’ was a metaphor”), blunting subtext. The theme arises from particulars but occasionally steps into stated thesis. The closing repricing still works despite minor didactic notes.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres around memory as presence in absence, trust’s rupture, and art as transmutation; the recurring images (aurora, forge, color‑sound) evolve by the close. The final chord blends amber and teal, reframing broken trust as a reparative resonance without neat moralizing. Occasional abstract declarations (“memory itself is a forge”) edge toward telling but remain supported by concrete acts. The emotional aftereffect is elegiac and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres around preserving “illuminated moments” versus theft, with a strong closing image of a lantern‑haven. Subtext mostly rides image systems (moonbeams, lilies, mirrors), but the line “the thief’s true calling: not to steal...” states the thesis too directly, thinning ambiguity. Resonance lingers, though it edges toward sentimental certainty. Complexity is present but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs of thawing heart, glass, and patience interweave coherently, culminating in a reweighted final image that suggests care over command. Some statements verge on telling (“she must first abandon the illusion of control”), but they’re largely supported by enacted craft. The theme resists a neat moral by lodging meaning in labor and attention. Emotional aftereffect is gentle yet resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of identity, betrayal-as-transformation, and vulnerability-as-power emerge organically through the shell, lever, and the name spelled backward. The seashell’s voice and the vial concretize abstract ideas. However, explicit moralizing lines (“a promise that my next stunt would be performed not for applause but for honesty”) slightly flatten subtext. The final image still resonates by reweighting prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of silence as geometry, covenant with void, and mapping the unchartable emerge organically through repeated actions and objects, not thesis statements. The final repricing—map becoming air—reweights the premise with poignant inevitability. Recurring images (star, hush, booklet) shift meaning at the end without moralizing. A faint risk of over-declared leitmotifs prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: synthesis of mind and matter, cleaning as ritual, second chances as iterative loops. The violin’s arc reweights the premise at the end without moralizing; “each sweep released a faint chime” is a resonant, non‑literal answer. Subtext (creation vs. maintenance, memory cost) lives in image and action. A touch more ambiguity around what’s lost could deepen the ache.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of transparency vs. rumor coheres through concrete motifs (light/shadow, lens, reflections) and culminates in a communal, wordless confession. Some lines tip toward thesis statement (“honesty had freed them”) rather than letting subtext carry it. Still, the final image reweights prior material without didacticism dominating. Resonance lingers in the image of truth projected onto stone.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Reciprocity, humility, and repair (“mended deception”) emerge through the ritual, with the marbles reweighted at the end. However, the piece voices its thesis too directly (“not by trickery but by honest labor”; the garden’s final compliment), which flattens subtext. The strongest themes are carried by images—the cracked marbles turned “tiny suns,” the fountain naming—that already suffice. The ending resonates, but the moralizing lines blunt its ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Recurring motifs—icy warmth, hush of wings, sideways time—culminate in a resonant image that reweights the premise without moralizing. The thematic throughline links biology and time’s texture effectively. One direct tell (“The experiment proved…”) slightly blunts subtext. Still, the final charged poise invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of “in‑between spaces” and silence as meaning arises organically through water, gaps in marginalia, and the sustained note reweighting sound vs. quiet. The ending answers the thematic question without moralizing: the house “breathing again,” lanterns steady, and pages dry. Subtext holds—wordless exchange with the ghost—avoiding platitudes. Slight tidiness in the ghost’s satisfaction softens complexity but not fatally.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: truth as measurable only when “smudging the lines” between seen and felt, and “occupying margins” as both method and ethic. Recurring images (swaying certainties, aurora, margins) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant non-literal answer (carry the weight outward) that retrofits prior motifs. Slight overemphasis in repeated phrases keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through action: skepticism versus haunting, the ethics of unearthing versus leaving, and the quantification of guilt. The final image (“a quiet prayer he never intended to utter”) reprices the premise without moralizing. Recurring motifs (hum, beads, hush) shift meaning at closure. A slight tendency to state concepts directly (“weight measured…in emotional tonnage”) keeps it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Images—river hymn, origami compass, obsidian refuge—carry the theme of renewal through silence with a strong final reweighting (acceptance of witness). However, the explicit thesis “silence births renewal” states what the images already earned, flattening resonance. Subtext otherwise operates well through tactile ritual and return. The piece invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ordinary magic emerges in recurring images (locket curl, breath‑matched melody) and the final communal repricing (villagers’ tradition). At times, the theme edges toward stated moral (“magic does not need grand gestures, only attentive hearts”). Still, the ending image reweights earlier details without blatant sermonizing. Resonance lingers as gentle, not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres around memory, resonance, and re-alignment; the final re-valuation (“not a fracture but a realignment”) reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext of post-dream humanity and walls as witnesses accrues through image. The quiet ending is earned and contemplative. Slightly limited by low on-page conflict, but resonance persists.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of “open secrets,” stewardship of truth, and transposing life into code emerge clearly through recurring images. Some lines verge on thesis (“quiet revolution,” “rewire destinies”), reducing subtext in key spots. The final gull image usefully reframes the pattern without overt moralizing. Resonance lingers but could deepen with a more tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of making the unseen visible is enacted through image and tactic (indigo line, paradox, lifted veil) rather than a stated moral; the city’s beliefs are reweighted in the final cascade. Subtext via silence and echo does work, though a few lines verge on thesis‑speak (“exposing the hidden assumptions”). The closing reprices the premise with renewal without collapsing into platitude. Resonance lingers more conceptually than emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonance builds through motifs (mirrored horizon, nautilus, hush) toward self‑becoming via memory. Yet the explicit final fortune (“Your heart is the baton; the world is your score”) reads as a thematic statement, edging into moralizing and dulling subtext. The revaluation of homesickness as compass is strong but tidy. The piece invites reflection but could trust its images more at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thematic throughline—self-integration across fractured timelines—emerges via images (tablet, rain, upward fall) and culminates in acceptance. However, the concluding moral (“the world recognized…to own every timeline…is to master oneself”) states the thesis and blunts subtext. Earlier imagery does strong work, but the final statement tips into sermonizing. Emotional aftereffect is present but partially manufactured by abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Symbols (needle, filament, mirrored hush) evolve meaningfully, and the ending reweights the premise through a charged image. However, a couple of declarative moral lines (“proved that… the heart can still compose a symphony of feeling”) edge toward stated theme and soften subtext. Most resonance arises from particulars rather than sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on silence as medium rather than void.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of integrity, truth under siege, and lateral problem‑solving arise organically from events and images (tube, shaft, dusk sanctuary). Some lines edge into overt statement (“honesty could survive,” “truth would always find a way”), dulling subtext. The final recognition (meticulousness as compass) resonates without becoming pat. The piece invites reflection, though it skirts sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars (perfume molecules as “hidden layers of memory”) and resolves in a quiet, resonant answer: grief as a lantern of understanding. The lantern/perfume/greenhouse braid generates subtext without heavy allegory. A few sentences edge toward abstract statement (“the impact of memories was not a passive archive”), slightly dulling the felt resonance. Still, the final image meaningfully reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Time as rope/thread is thematically integrated via recurring actions (weaving, tracing patterns) and the final knotting choice. The closing image reweights the premise without a stated moral, though one reflective line edges toward telling (“He reflected that every impossible choice…”). Subtext operates through image and texture rather than debate. The aftertaste is resonant and non‑didactic despite a slight explanatory sheen.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece coheres around unfinishedness and the transformation of silence into a held hum. Strong images carry theme (seed‑note in ash; hull echoes), but explicit thesis lines (“beauty lay not in what was completed”) edge into moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without a new counter‑pressure. Emotional afterglow is earned yet a touch stated.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of empathy as commodity and “half truths” as transactional bridges accrue naturally through image and action. Final beats (amber glow sealed; promise to transform grief) resonate without moralizing. Subtextual tension—care as technique versus care as feeling—lingers. Depth is strong despite the absence of a hard dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of community care and honoring the “silent contributors” are coherent and recur through concrete actions (register, ceremony, fishermen’s gifts). However, the piece occasionally spells out its thesis (“cycles of compassion are the most reliable cargo”), tipping into sentimentality. Subtext is present in the locket’s journey and the keeper’s vocation, but the moral arrives stated as well as shown. The final image resonates more for tenderness than for complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around belonging as an enacted practice—search together, vow, weave reeds, accept ongoing care. The “living symbol” reveal reweights earlier images (interlocking circles → expanding lattice) without overt moralizing. Some lines skate near sentimentality, but the recurring images do most of the thematic work. The final “steady glow” modulates the ache into sustained responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: time as sculptable cadence, becoming the echo, and sacrifice to restore communal rhythm. Recurring images (infinity loops, borrowed time) reweight at the end without moralizing. The final image reconfigures the premise with felt conceptual cost. Depth over breadth, with a clean aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme coheres—ambiguous loss reweighted as transformation—with strong image chains (eyes, cracks, numbers, petals). However, explicit thesis lines (“grief plus hope equals…”) edge into saying the moral rather than letting the images carry it. The closing image still resonates, aided by the dawn and petal‑return. Subtext exists, but some overt statement reduces mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of visibility as acknowledgment of communal grief emerges through concrete acts (caching, conduit touch, blue glow). Subtext largely rides images; however, lines like “visibility was not merely being seen” verge on thesis‑speak and flatten mystery. The final invitation at the threshold offers earned emotional aftereffect. A bit less telling would heighten the ache.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coheres around transformation through relinquishment, with recurring images (coil, trellis, storm) accruing meaning. Some lines state the thesis outright (“the most sustainable change was always sustained by releasing control”), edging toward didactic. The final promise reweights earlier moments without moralizing too heavily. Subtext lives in the mediated intervention via fungal networks, which nicely embodies the idea.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    Art as sacrifice and renewal is integrated through action rather than lecture; the rain trails reweight as memory conduits at the climax. The final image (brooch above the easel, mist preserving colors) resonates. A few lines edge toward theme-telling (“the island had given her meaning”), trimming complexity. Nonetheless, the emergent meaning feels earned and durable.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of embracing uncertainty and magnifying humble grace emerge organically via the pearl’s tear, the pilgrim’s prayer, and the child’s arrival. “Bright darkness” recurs as a motif that reweights the ending. A few near‑platitudinous lines brush sentimentality, but the imagery largely carries the resonance. The final invitation feels earned rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—memory as tidal, silence as part of meaning, solitary work turning communal—emerges organically through repeated images (echoes, pauses, gaps) and reweights at the end with collective mapping and a new quest. No moralizing; the “absence” motif matures into an ethic of listening. Resonance lingers. Slight softness in cost keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of translation, secrecy, and the union of art and analysis recur through concrete motifs (maps/constellations, the ledger). The ending provides a resonant reframing—truths as a living archive—with an earned promise to serve. Some lines verge on statement (“She realized…was not a place of stone”), slightly dulling subtext. Still, the imagery-driven answer lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of doubt entwined with wonder and memory as migration emerge organically from concrete tasks (transcription, prime paths, sanctuary). The “unheard symphony” reframes at the end from sound to inhabitable feeling, providing a resonant answer without a spelled‑out moral. One line (“turned skepticism into a bridge”) veers close to thesis‑speak, slightly thinning subtext. Overall, image‑driven resonance outweighs any explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—what lies after goodbye—emerges through image and action, culminating in a reframed understanding of parting as transition. The twin’s line risks on‑the‑nose statement yet is saved by the imagistic payoff (amulet dust, charged tunnel, final step). Subtext hums in the choice to remain silent at “Will you stay?”. The ending’s resonance is earned, though the aphoristic sentence slightly blunts subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Reciprocity, fairness-as-math, and asylum as covenant are thematically coherent, with the ink’s alchemy recontextualizing institutional rigidity. The final repricing (“asylum transformed… a living covenant”) resonates. Some lines tip into direct statement (“fairness… could not be imposed by law alone”), dulling subtext. Still, images—the glowing equations, dissolving bureaucratic walls—carry meaning effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Recurring motifs (refraction, hum, bonsai growth) evolve toward the bridge metaphor, giving a resonant answer about truth and invention. Subtext lives in the craft rituals and quiet defiance against silence. The explicit phrasing “not lies but bridges” slightly overstates what the images already earned. Still, the final cadence lingers with conceptual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of erasure, identity, and memory’s texture emerge organically through objects and action. The final image (keeper of layered stories, label pocketed) reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext around bureaucracy’s violence and the self as conduit is persuasive and understated. Slight risk of over-articulation in repeated “layers/filters,” but the resonance remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of why myths endure and epistemic humility emerge organically from objects and sound. The final recognition coheres with prior particulars (art/sound/retelling). Yet the line “The answer unfolded: ... myths survive when retold through art” states the thesis too directly, dulling subtext. Resonance persists but would rise with less explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Art as covert civic infrastructure, communal resistance, and the ethics of dual allegiance resonate through the chip, graffiti, and phoenix image. The ending reweights prior images (chip → living map; phoenix as promise) without sermonizing. Some lines edge toward thematic declaration (“the fight had only begun”), softening subtext. Still, the integration is coherent and leaves a reflective aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of preservation versus inevitability accrues through concrete acts (timed exposure, sealing the canister) and returns in the final “soft click.” Subtext of archiving hush/time avoids sermonizing, with the final gaze toward Earth reweighting meaning. One or two lines verge on explicit thesis, but the closing image earns the reflection. The lighthouse/grain metaphor effectively reframes the mission as elegy.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of craft as care, “blind sight,” environment as collaborator, and repair as promise accumulate convincingly through images. The closing reprise (“promise… bridge between broken things and new horizons”) resonates, though it edges toward stated theme. Subtext mostly rides objects and process rather than dialogue. A touch less explicitness would heighten afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of origins/singular convergence accrues through repeated, active particulars (condensation veins, phrasebook, rivers merging) and culminates in the “charged poise” of the first trickle. The “Kaltwasser” reveal risks over‑articulation with the explicit aphorism (“every river is born from ice, and ice is born from silence”). Still, imagery carries the resonance more than statement. The ending invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres around communal balance, craft as covenant, and the conversion of silence into shared rhythm. Recurring images (fork, footsteps, archway light) reweight meaning by the end without moralizing. The last image—his step as a “silent bell” and the town breathing—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: restoration requires sacrifice and ongoing stewardship. The ambiguity is purposeful and earned, if tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—transmuting fear into purpose and bottling the ephemeral for communal grace—emerges organically from the vial’s function and the renunciation. The final release onshore offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. That said, explicit declarations (“realized her true motivation”) tip toward telling. The piece invites reflection but leaves limited counter-pressure or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonances align (warning as thread vs. wall; hush as redemption), and the mother/son motif grounds theme in particulars. However, the explicit thesis line (“every warning is a thread, not a wall”) and “beacon of truth” proximity flatten subtext at the end. The images themselves carry weight; the statements dilute it. Still, the final hush image reweights the legend meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Redemption through resonance, debt as love/venom, and memory transmuting matter are woven through concrete images rather than thesis. The final image (orchard lit, bead pulsing, bride gone) reprices the opening’s night and promise. Ambiguity lingers without confusion—both mourning and elation coexist credibly. No moralizing intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of renewal vs. rule and reverent attention to place emerge organically through recurring images (orchids, tide, sewn light). The ending reweights silence as song, offering a credible, nonliteral answer. A line like “the true art lay not in rule but in renewal” edges into thesis‑speak, softening subtext. Still, the motif work lingers with quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of diaspora, continuity, and mending fractured faith surface through recurring images (roots, bones, sundial) and the “interrupted journeys” motif. The final image of a communal return and sunrise resonates without overt moralizing. Some lines state purpose plainly (“to restore lost faith”), softening subtext. Still, the symbolism accrues coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of margin/meaning, analog/digital, and identity as post are coherent and resonate with the closing image. However, the line “revealed a truth: the margins held the most luminous stories” veers into stated thesis, dulling subtext. The ending reweights prior images but skirts sentimentality. Insight feels earned by pattern more than by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of truth in silence and wisdom disguised as folly emerge through the loom, the flame, and the courier ruse, with a strong final repricing (“History would remember the fire’s glow, not the blade”). Recurring images reweight meaning at the end without needing expository explanation. Slight overstatement in the final third edges toward moralizing. Still, the closing image reframes power and story with genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of apology, release, and truth-through-gesture accrue through recurring images and resolve in a resonant reweighting (the apology lives beyond words). The explicit line “she understood the apology had never needed words” edges into telling, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the spirits-root weave and fireflies offer strong, earned images. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resilience and communal transmutation (“shared anxieties”) arise through concrete acts (matching phrases to coral strands) rather than abstract sermon. The final image reweights prior motifs without bow‑tying the trauma. Occasionally the piece edges toward explanatory phrasing (“promising that the graft…”), slightly thinning subtext. Overall, resonance outlasts the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of art as shared illumination and communal healing resonate, culminating in the orchard’s “rebirth.” However, several sentences state the theme outright (“true power... to illuminate hearts”), edging toward moralizing and reducing subtext. The final image carries warmth and memory, but ambiguity and counter-pressures are limited. Emotional aftereffect is sincere yet a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres around listening and the exchange of certainty for curiosity, made tactile by echoed sound and murals. Several lines state the thesis outright (“to exchange certainty for curiosity...”), which trims subtlety. Nonetheless, the final image reweights prior material without a didactic moral, and the coin-as-conduit grounds the abstraction. The resonance lingers, if a touch on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of dissent, language as resistance, and community encoded through nature resonate across recurring images (seed, spiral patterns, chant). Some lines state the thesis too directly (“after thoughts become taxable… mind’s free verse is auctioned”), slightly blunting subtext. The final promise of “the next warp” offers a non‑literal answer that reweights prior material. Complexity is present without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres through particulars: pain photosynthesized, postcard as seed, shell as library—culminating in a non-literal answer about art as negotiated peace. Subtext breathes through images (wounds as stars; scars as petals). It resists a tidy moral while still offering earned hope. A shade of declarative phrasing peeks in (“heal the world”), but imagery does the heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: memory’s preservation as a counter‑desert, loss to purpose, and the cyclical nature of tending. Recurring images (orchid, chime, candle, echo) return charged in the ending; no moral is stated. The traveler’s embodied response (dew of names on his tongue) supplies concrete, non‑platitudinous meaning. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of covenant, promise, and the ethics of restoration emerge organically via recurring sonic/image motifs. The final pledge reweights prior images without overt moralizing, though some lines state theme directly (“restore trust,” “pact of memory”). Subtext resides in the musicality and the living archive’s response. Resonance is strong, if slightly declarative at moments.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of empathy-as-architecture and technology as conduit for human unity emerge organically from particulars (chain pulses governing water). Some lines veer into thesis (“operated on a principle of shared empathy, a living algorithm”) which blunts subtext. The final image reweights earlier motifs, but edges toward sentimentality. Still, the encrypted-compassion conceit is fresh and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of renewal layered over loss emerges organically via dust/paper/flight motifs and the communal hum returning from the streets. The final image reweights prior material: fading chip, glowing map—memory and reinvention coexisting. A single explicit line (“reinvention does not erase…”) edges toward stating theme, but surrounding images earn it. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of threshold, lineage, and “necessary distances” accrue organically through recurring images and choices. However, the final explicit thesis (“the true distance one must travel is the space between wonder and understanding”) states the moral, blunting resonance. Subtext is otherwise strong in the hush/echo motifs and the mother’s coded legacy. A lighter touch in the last lines would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of communion between star-maps and tides, land and sea, are earned through mirrored constellations and instrument resonance. Some lines verge on thesis (“soft engine that powered the cosmos of belonging”), edging toward tell. The final image—emerging with the feather and new maps—offers a quiet, resonant answer. Ambiguity exists but is comfortable, not challenging.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    “Missing pieces” and emotional resonance braid into a coherent theme: memory as tide, repair via tuned feeling rather than force. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing—paths reappear when affect aligns, leaving a resonant acceptance of “hopeful sorrow.” Recurring images (seeds, hues, bridge) shift meaning across the arc. Sentimentality is avoided through concrete, felt particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The order/chaos paradox accrues through image and action, but the explicit thesis (“I aim to serenade monotony with creativity”) and its reprise in the final paragraph undercut subtext. The best resonance is visual—the bishops, ink X, and tide erasure—inviting reflection on transience. Because the moral is stated outright at the end, thematic subtlety blunts. The piece still lands a gentle afterimage, but not a reweighting with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres around exile, art’s return after suppression, and transformation through attention to liminal gaps. The ending reweights the premise: solitude becomes conduit, the verse leaves the private garden to touch others. No sermonizing; resonance arises from image (dust to bloom to stanza). The ambiguity remains purposeful and invites reflection without vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of worth, attention, and ritual as valuation arise organically from the image system (ripples, prisms, nets). However, explicit thesis lines (“the purpose of this ritual was to illuminate value in the mundane,” “value lives in every ripple”) overstate what the images already earn. The ending resonates, if a touch tidy. Subtext exists in the glazier’s reading of light as scripture, but ambiguity is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coheres around translating pain and gifting innocence back via reflection, with strong imagistic threads (cracks, light, ash). However, explicit moralizing (“She realized that the true bargain had never been about buying innocence…”) dulls subtext in the final movement. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but tends toward stated wisdom over earned implication. The best moments let the images do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of art/mathematics interdependence and collective belief are woven through recurring spirals, decorative patterns, and the gauge’s redefinition. The final reweighting—hope as measurable resonance—lands, though the line declaring the gauge “not a broken relic but a mirror” edges toward overt thesis. The resonance lingers, but complexity is cushioned by near‑ideal outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, stewardship, and communal imagination emerge organically from particulars and the recurring object. The final repricing (“the true map… collective imagination”) coheres, but the line flirts with moral summary, dulling subtext. Earlier images (palms, rain‑scent, stone lullaby) carry stronger implicit resonance. The piece invites reflection yet edges toward explicitness at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of possibility, art as portal, and communal imagination (children’s coded songs) cohere. The final paragraphs edge into stated moral (“reminding all…”) rather than letting image alone carry resonance. Subtext exists in the “borrowed heartbeat” but isn’t repriced with cost at the end. Emotional afterglow is gentle but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Redemption through listening and shared ritual emerges coherently, with the clipboard and swords reframed by the final light. However, a few lines state the moral outright (“She understood that redemption’s price…”) edging toward sermonizing. Subtext exists in the choreography of stars vs. fire and armor softening, but it’s sometimes explained rather than let to resonate. The ending image lands but is slightly overexplicated.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece coherently interrogates cruelty transmuted into “fractured grace,” letting the act and aftermath imply its stance. Recurring images (map of cracks, echo, brine) shift meaning at the end, avoiding a moral lecture. A few phrasings edge toward overt thesis (“fragment of grace forged from cruelty”), but the scene does most of the thematic work. The final cadence invites reflection without closing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (art as defiance against conformity) emerges organically through the echo‑harvest and the city’s re‑voicing. The final image reweights the premise without stating a moral, though some sentences edge toward declarative thesis (“The city’s lullaby shattered, replaced by a chorus…”). Subtext operates in the “alarming serenity” and “between sigh and smile” motifs. The resonance is genuine if not profoundly ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of agency, consent, and ethical storytelling arise organically from concrete images (strings, reversed dishes) and culminate in a resonant reweighting. However, the piece occasionally states its thesis (“less about dictating truth...”) rather than letting subtext alone carry it. The final carry-out image is strong and consistent with prior motifs. Complexity is present but sometimes leans declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—ephemeral memorials versus stone permanence; honoring the unnoticed—emerges through actions and recurring images (knots, wing, glow) rather than exposition. The ending reweights prior material: dissolution becomes testament, not failure. One sentence leans toward overt statement (“Thus the overlooked histories found a voice”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall the resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of memory as living conduit, thaw/redemption, and communal continuity emerge through concrete images (rope singing back, parchment transcription). A few telling lines (“not merely archival”) flatten subtext, but the final image reweights the premise convincingly. The sanctum’s transformation into a “living library” resonates without feeling didactic. Complexity is modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of agency, reciprocity, and selection (“paths choose their walkers”) emerge through recurring images (trail, spores, seal) and reweight at the end. The final pact reframes the directive without sermonizing. Occasional direct statements (“She understood…”) trim some subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of measurement, devotion, and reciprocity between the earthly ledger and the celestial are integrated and resonant. Recurring images (tile, dusk, ledger) accrue meaning and reweight the final image. However, the text occasionally states its thesis (“testament that even the most empirically ironic calculations…”) instead of letting the images carry it. Ambiguity remains tasteful but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of non‑violent change and memory‑borne compassion emerge through concrete beats (vibration aligning nervous pathways) and a charged final image. Some lines verge on thesis statements (“let it rewrite the bitterness”), flattening subtext. The ending resonates as a quiet moral repricing rather than a neat lecture. It lingers, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme—boundaries dissolving into a “weaving of separate songs”—emerges organically from the method and final stance. One explicit line (“boundaries are merely shadows of fear”) flirts with telling, but the closing reweights prior images without moralizing. The resonance of hope as craft and breath is earned and lingers. Complexity is modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Renewal and intergenerational transmission emerge organically via vows, repair craft, and teaching moments with Mira. The “deciduous vows” motif evolves from ambient whisper to operational ethic during the mend, then returns to seal the pact. A few lines verge on explicit moralizing, but most resonance rides image and action. The final repricing avoids sermonizing enough to linger.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme integrates cleanly: knowledge as looping inheritance enacted by the bathroom epiphanies and cameo’s reweighted void. Subtext accrues through images (cracked tile-mosaic, pollen, future seeds), though the final aphoristic line edges toward on‑the‑nose moralizing. The orchard’s gardeners-as-absence underscores inquiry’s partiality. Resonance lingers via “brightened disquiet,” avoiding neat comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of listening to silence, knowledge’s negative space, and rescuing what’s unlived emerge organically from particulars (gaps, dormant names, blank scrolls). The final image reweights the premise without moralizing, and the diary’s use reframes learning as negotiation. Slight neatness in the “pilgrimage site” glimpse edges toward tidiness but doesn’t undercut resonance. Subtext (cost of filling gaps versus using them) is present, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, naming, and liberation through story accrue organically via objects and actions. However, the explicit statement “the true recapture was not of objects, but of stories” reduces subtext in the final third. Still, the garden’s response and ship’s rekindled lights provide resonant, image-led closure. Complexity is present but partially flattened by that direct articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    The motif of “fables of absence” evolves from whisper to working principle, culminating in a repricing of absence as bridge rather than void. The seal’s glow and the stilled clock reweight earlier images with conceptual consequence. Some theme statements are explicit (“clarity thrives when the unknown is acknowledged”), edging toward moralizing. Even so, resonance lingers via the charged final harmony of objects.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of balance vs. absence of sound are coherent, with images (ice fractures smoothing, dimmed beings) reinforcing the idea. The explicit statement “quiet…not the absence of sound” edges toward telling, though it aligns with the enacted outcome. Resonance lingers in the guardianship vow and softened maps. Modulation is tasteful but not daring.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of meaning within coincidence recurs through stars, hush, and “thistle-blown hope,” with a resonant image at the end. However, explicit theses (“prove that coincidences have meaning”) edge toward moralizing. Subtext arises mostly from imagery rather than conflict. The final expansion from individual to collective purpose is earned but tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme (identity as collage from collective memory) emerges organically through the crystal’s song, shadows, and the archivist’s measurements, culminating in a reweighted final stance. Subtext is carried in images (shadows lengthening, hush turning companion) rather than moralizing, despite a few declarative lines. The ending’s insight feels earned by particulars. It lingers with coherent ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres: art as a filter that transmutes despair into communal light; images return reweighted (mosaic note, rag knot spiral, fortress “breathing”). The final image offers a non‑literal answer—hope as a mosaic any watcher can see—even as the vow sidesteps tidy finality. A line like “to filter despair through art” edges toward telling but is supported by scene work. Subtext hums via the fortress’s responsive “pulse” and “smile.”

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around liminal time and intention; recurrence of tides, ripples, and cicada song gathers resonance and shifts meaning at the end. Subtext in physical phenomena (breeze softening water mirroring anger melting) is deft. A slight tell (“She realized that the true foretelling…”) trims mystery, but it doesn’t collapse the lyric web. The final sea‑time image offers durable afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: constraint as a path to vastness, the paradox of “intangibly tangible,” lineage of craft from mother to son. The ending reframes the bunker as capable of holding sky, a resonant answer earned by particulars (limited breaths, dissolving filaments). No sermonizing; imagery does the work (bunker humming like the trellis). The ambiguity is purposeful and invites reflection without blur.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of silence as a taught comfort accrues through recurring images and culminates in the shared breath and the empty vial. A few explicit statements (“Lira’s motivation was clear…”) slightly blunt subtext, but the ending image reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. The train-echo frame and “in transit” deepen the thematic afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Memory vs possibility and analog/digital unity emerge through recurring images and culminate in the “bridge” insight. However, theme is partially told (“She understood that the stairway... was a bridge”) rather than earned purely by action. The final visuals resonate but avoid moral complexity or cost. Still, the motif net (ruby, code, waterfall) coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of isolation, connection, and scars-as-conduits develop organically through action and image, not moralizing. The final repricing (“threshold as bridge forged from his own scars”) reweights earlier motifs convincingly. Subtext—teaching darkness to breathe—lands as a lived method rather than a thesis. Slight on-the-nose phrasing in the last lines tempers peak resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme coheres around transforming oppressive pressure into creative brilliance and re‑valuing honesty over greed. Subtext works best in the bolt’s history and the mushrooms’ responsive ecology. The final paragraph tips into overt moralizing (“the world would reward...”), blunting the earned resonance. Still, the idea that diamonds endure only while “pressure” remains tangible supplies a neat, concept‑bound ethical edge.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.5)
    Curiosity vs. ignorance and “listening as practice” emerge organically through the gramophone method and the confession. The ending reweights silence as eloquence, offering a resonant conceptual answer. Some lines lapse into explicit thematic statement (“teach them to listen eloquently silent”), slightly blunting subtext. Still, the final image coheres with earlier motifs in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around allegiance, art as animate ritual, and possibility as a chosen binding. Recurring images (program, glyphs, vapor, moss) reweight at the end. The explicit line “loyalty was not a chain but a song” edges toward thesis, but the final act/image earns the insight. Resonance lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars—dust as unvoiced history, a button as a conduit, bureaucracy softened by human attention. The ending reweights the premise: the archive is readable if tended, with hope costing endurance. A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“as a reminder that even forgotten lives could be seen”) yet the images carry most of the resonance. Thematic aftertaste is strong and invites reflection without didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Coded freedom” and “revised histories” cohere through action—the broadcast alters the public record and reanimates solidarity. Recurring images (water, reflections, key) deepen the thematic argument without heavy authorial comment. A few lines verge on thesis (“freedom was not a shout but a coded ripple”), slightly flattening subtext. The final promise of future “reappear” lands as a resonant, earned motif.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silence as salvation and music as unmaking coheres through images (negative space, dissolving code, dewdrop impermanence) and pays off in the charged quiet of the ending. No moralizing intrudes; resonance arises from particulars and the final hush reweights the world’s safety. Thematic complexity is present but not wrenching; ambiguity or counter-pressure is light. Still, the afterimage is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    Memory, stewardship, and renewal accrue through concrete rituals rather than explicit moralizing, culminating in a pact that reweights human/forest relations. Recurring images (seeds as letters, monuments, moonstone dust) gather meaning and return at the end. The resonance is genuine but tidy, with little complicating ambiguity or counterpressure. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t risk a harder ethical edge.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.7)
    Resonance is present via recurring images (compass, leaves, waterfall), but the theme is stated outright: the inscription and “lesson of uncertainty” undercut subtext. The piece invites reflection on improvisation vs. certainty, yet moralizing in the last third replaces implication with declaration. Emotional aftereffect lingers, but complexity narrows at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of redemption as ongoing negotiation emerges through actions (kintsugi seam, ledger, naming) rather than summary, with a final reweighting toward gratitude. The motif set (names, balance, ledger, seam) coheres and shifts meaning at the end. One line edges toward telling (“redemption was not a single transaction”), slightly flattening the subtext. Overall resonance lingers without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of grief transmuted by laughter and broken music mending souls emerge organically through recurring objects and sound. The final image reweights prior motifs (tooth as beacon; sunrise hum) without sermonizing, though “She understood her purpose” edges toward explicitness. Ambiguity remains where it should—why laughter works feels mystical rather than explained. The piece elicits a gentle afterglow rather than a hard moral.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of transmuting harm into mercy and reweighting symbols (the strap) arise from concrete ordeal and recurrence. Some explicitness (“mercy equals…”; “mercy could be taught”) drifts toward thesis, trimming ambiguity. Subtext still breathes in the light’s penance and the strap’s transformation. The final image reconfigures meaning without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory as shared light, translation as caretaking, and the seen/unseen accrue through images and the final promise to unseen sailors. A few statements tilt toward bald articulation (“my translation has become that beacon,” “intuition is anchored not in certainty”), softening subtext. Still, the lighthouse fragment’s dissolution reweights the premise with credible emotional aftertaste. The ending resonates more as benediction than moral.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of seeing through façades and granting the forgotten their due emerge organically via dust routes, mirrors, and the ledger. The line “cracks…were not flaws but frames” lands a touch on‑the‑nose, slightly reducing the lingering ambiguity. The final cadence (stars pulsing with the ticking heart) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about purpose and attention. Subtext remains mostly in image rather than dictum, to good effect.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme—breaking “perfect” systems to access living wonder and temporality’s compression—is integrated through recurring objects and the final reweighting of order into lattice. The closing image offers a non‑literal answer without a spelled‑out moral, though occasional lines edge toward thesis statement. Subtext operates in material metaphors (frost maps, bottled whisper as catalyst) more than dialogue. Resonance is strong but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    A rich theme of transforming violence into story and re-inscribing cultural memory emerges organically through mirrors, storms, and the shard. The final images reweight prior motifs without didacticism, though one line (“the true revolution…”) edges close to thesis. Subtext operates through the charged sorrow that both mourns and enables creation. The resonance lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Repair, truth, and memory-of-decay braid into a coherent theme, with the covenant of rust reweighted by the ending’s vow. Subtext arises through the act of “mending what isn’t torn,” an ethic of restoration over replacement. However, the closing moral (“as long as honest hands… the light would never again be stolen”) states the thesis too plainly, softening resonance. The aftereffect is warm and hopeful rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of thresholds, surrender, and listening to the earth are integrated through concrete images (hinges, fossils pulsing, water staircase) and culminate in a resonant shift. However, the line that articulates the thesis (“the place where explanations fail… a state of quiet surrender”) states what the images already show, slightly flattening subtext. The final walk toward the storm restores image‑led resonance. The museum’s absence and factory’s hush add subtle social cost to her devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of learning, craft as bridge, and communal histories arise organically from the lantern projections and the driftwood compass. The reprise of child-self and the final quiet “lantern waits” image offers resonance without a spelled-out moral. A few overt statements (“learning never ends”) blunt subtlety slightly. Overall, subtext comes through image and process effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around darkness/light dialogue and promise in liminal time; recurring images (amber, hush, lenses, night‑flowers) deepen resonance. The final image reweights earlier motifs with tenderness. Slight overstatement (“the dawning hush was not silence but a promise”) tips toward telling. Nonetheless, the insight grows from particulars rather than assertion alone.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of erasure, recovery, and communal memory emerge organically through the sand‑carvers’ hums and the broadcast that cracks the desert’s silence. Recurring objects (brass, violet light, the lagoon’s crystal) accrue meaning and reweight the final image. A few phrases verge on overt moralizing (“echo of justice”), but the imagery largely carries the resonance. Insight arises from particulars rather than thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Memory as ethical method versus comfort is woven through objects and action, culminating in the lantern‑oath. However, the piece occasionally states its thesis (“the past could be a tool, not a chain”) rather than letting image and action carry it. The final image resonates and reweights prior motifs. Subtext exists but shares space with overt commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Memory, language, and preservation braid into a resonant thesis without moralizing; the ending reweights the premise as promise rather than warning. Concrete particulars (Akkadian, Sumerian, children’s hands in soil, the wax shaving) carry the thematic load. The orchard’s exhale and the sealed vellum offer a non‑literal answer that lingers. Complexity is maintained through the archival loop and the city “breathing easier” in ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of stewardship and time’s texture arises through concrete actions and recurring images (acorn cap, mist, “borrowed time”). The final planting reframes time as tactile and cultivable, a resonant answer without moralizing. A few direct invocations (“Teach me the feel of borrowed time”) flirt with statement, but the scene earns them. The phoenix’s temporal “gears” rain adds a memorable thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of listening over noise emerges through particulars (microclimate thresholds, the toned bell, the rope’s retirement) rather than only assertion. A few lines verge on thesis (“quiet rebellion,” “favoring listening over noise”), but the final hush earns resonance. The ending reframes the sanctuary’s purpose credibly. Subtext is present in the trade between control and surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: flourishing stillness as fertile ground where vulnerability becomes strength, reweighted by the vow and the ribbon binding sky and stone. Recurrences (lantern, traced paths) accrue meaning and the final chord deepens the premise. A few direct statements (“Understanding blossomed…”) flirt with telling, but resonance survives. The ending offers a non‑literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of silence as active guardianship emerges organically through bees/honey memory, ghost attention, and the covenant of shared silence. The final image—a tear of molten amber sealing the covenant—reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext operates through the refracted light and humming box rather than statement. Complexity lives in the acceptance of cost (mute eloquence) rather than a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Time as memory and communal repair emerges organically through the garage-sale lattice and the reconfigured clocks. The final images (silver sand constellations; notes forming a story lattice) resonate without overt moralizing, though one line (“time… could be mended by shared recollection”) edges toward thesis statement. The insight is earned via specific actions and objects rather than abstract commentary. Ambiguity lingers productively about cost and future consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Recurrences (feather, ripples, woven dawns, hush) build a coherent meditation on honoring incompleteness. The final image reweights the premise effectively. However, a few explicit theme declarations (“true art was never a finished picture,” “gentle rebellion against the demand for flawless endings”) edge into moralizing, thinning subtext. When the text trusts image, it resonates more.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Images consistently braid a theme of reciprocity and binding (wire to wood, root to rock), culminating in social repricing of time limits. However, the line “the secret of the pillars… was the willingness of all beings to bind together” states the thesis a bit on‑the‑nose, dimming subtext. The resonance survives via the charged final tableau, but subtlety would raise the score.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—homecoming as reciprocal chemistry rather than worship—emerges organically through image (glow to dim ember, rain prisms) and the final charged poise. Some lines state the thesis too baldly (“home was not a place but a pattern of returning”), slightly flattening resonance in the closing stretch. Overall, the imagery carries the idea effectively, with quiet, lingering aftertaste. Complexity is present but largely harmonious rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Renewal through translation and concord emerges organically from concrete acts rather than thesis statements. Recurring images (reef/battlefield → garden; language/birdsong → seed) reweight by the ending, which resists pat moralizing by acknowledging an unhealed wound. The “narrow vastness” motif meaningfully refracts the paradox of scope and intimacy. A hint of sentiment creeps in, but it’s largely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, war residue, and connection are embodied through images (tinted grooves, waxed leaf, rust/sky seam) rather than stated morals. “Translate distance into closeness” reappears as an earned act, not a slogan, culminating in a reweighted final tableau. The piece resists binaries and lets mythic tech operate as emotional grammar. Slight risk of mantra repetition, but it holds because the final act recontextualizes it.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: grief metabolized into orientation; “true north” transforms from external bearing to inward compass. Recurring images (applique, sketches, deck) accrue meaning and reprice the premise at the close. There’s minimal moralizing; the promise and “pilgrimage” land as image-led answers. A touch of declarative phrasing (“turn confusion into exploration”) slightly reduces ambiguity but doesn’t flatten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonance emerges through the reweighted sundial and the idea of “amending” as playful responsibility; motifs return with new meaning in the village scene. Some lines state theme too directly (“not merely theft…a bridge”; “wonder never sleeps”), which blunts subtext. The afterimage is gentle and credible rather than revelatory. Ambiguity is present but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Memory vs. oblivion and the ethics of attention are embodied in missing pawns and the nomadic penumbra. The ending reweights the motif of absence into a guiding principle without overt moralizing. A few sentences edge toward expository theme (“she realized that by chronicling…”), slightly reducing subtlety. Still, the closing image resonates and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—home as resonance rather than locale—is developed through concrete motifs (feather texture, scent of pine/rain, hidden thunder) and reweighted at the end. Insights feel earned by contact with object and place rather than authorial statement, even though a few lines tread close to telling. The final cadence reconfigures prior images without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively in the cost of letting go of the fixed courtyard image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    Chess and textile motifs braid into a coherent meditation on regret and self-forgiveness, culminating in the pawn’s dissolution. The “forgiveness is not a single move” line flirts with moralizing, slightly flattening subtext into statement. Still, the final image (time resuming; banner of peace) reweights earlier particulars with honest emotion. Resonant without grandstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of forgiveness as communal, memory‑bound work emerges through refracted art and shared voice, not just assertion. Some lines verge on thesis (“Let the price be known…,” “the price: acceptance of loss”), but the closing charged image (“We are the echo”) reweights prior motifs. Subtext in the forged hush and bone‑kept memory adds depth. It resists neat moralizing while offering a resonant answer.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    The kintsugi motif integrates well and the final image reframes brokenness as beauty through luminous seams. However, theme is sometimes told outright (“the philosophy that brokenness could become beautiful”), and the closing declarations verge on thesis statements. Resonance arises more from repeated imagery than subtextual contradiction or complexity. Effective, but a touch sermonizing dulls the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of art as vessel for memory and holding “temporary eternity” arise from concrete acts (glowing shells with sunset fragments; painting guided by their light). Subtext—solitude as the price of stewardship—sits under the “intimate aloofness” motif without sermonizing, though the scroll’s epigraph flirts with overt statement. The closing canvas image reweights prior material. Resonance lingers, if a shade tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres (gentleness outperforms force; bridges of whisper) through images of scent, vibration, and light. The reprise in the final paragraph reweights the premise, but explicit statements (“proof that whispers truly travel farther than shouts”) tilt toward telling. Subtext lives in the fisherman’s inexplicable pull and the lighthouse “heart,” which work well. A touch less overt thesising would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of grief cartography and homeward return arise from particulars (midnight calls, reverse migration etched into coils) rather than thesis alone. One line overstates the theme (“reverse migration was not a folly of longing...”), slightly blunting subtext. The censer foot’s evolving meaning (tool, conduit, reliquary) provides an earned non‑literal answer. The ending’s sanctuary image lingers with quiet, credible hope.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mirror/occlusion motif supports a theme about shared grief and psychological safety with resonant images (eye as “frozen tear,” moss cap as false bloom). Yet the piece slips into overt thesis statements (“truth was not weaponized...”; “we learned that psychological safety grows...”), dulling subtext. The ending reframes the premise but edges toward moralizing rather than letting image carry it. Thematically coherent, less so artfully restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Memory, witness, and transformed solitude emerge through recurring images (Edelweiss, tide gaps, lamp) rather than stated morals. The final image reweights the theme: isolation becomes service, the dock a promise against oblivion. Subtext is steady and avoids preachiness, though a few lines approach lyrical reiteration. The resonance lingers credibly beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: promises as compass; maps as choices; small patterns (ants) guiding monumental doors. The final repricing (“the true map was… the act of choosing”) grows from specific experience, and the shop’s transformed practice concretizes the idea. A brief explanatory note to villagers edges toward telling, but the images have already earned the resonance. Ambiguity remains purposeful rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of vow, burden, and dream-as-map cohere through recurring images (“bleeding starlight,” the crown as key). The ending reweights prior material by reframing the dream from curse to guide. Some tidiness (“pledging to bind the bleeding starlight to the realm”) edges toward statement, but resonance survives via the emptied grotto and solitary descent. Ambiguity remains in the cost of binding, inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonance is strong around “heat is memory,” “revalue,” and the nautilus curl as a pattern of presence. However, the line “the true alchemy lies in the willingness to see light where others see only ash” edges into overt moralizing, softening subtext. The ending reweights profit vs presence in a tangible way. The themes are coherent and consistent with the images.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: envy as method, time as “cruel editor,” and feral nostalgia complicate the urge to narrativize chaos. The grave’s redefinition offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Recurring images (scroll, wind, fox) accrue meaning and reweight the end. A few direct statements of intent skim the edge of telliness but don’t blunt subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ordinary miracles, occlusion/interpretation, and conduits of care are woven through recurring images (fog, threads, water). The final image reweights earlier particulars (the mother passing as external echo), producing quiet resonance. Some explicit thematizing (“She understood that…”) and the line “You are more than metal” edge toward stated thesis, slightly flattening subtext. Despite mild moralizing, the piece invites reflection without schematic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: ancestral ritual and craft turn pain into communal narrative, resisting erasure in favor of reframing. Recurring images (breath, feather, mist, quill) shift meaning by the end, charging the final glow of scars. A slight explicitness (“to transform scars into stories...”) trims mystery, but the closing image earns resonance. The piece elicits a contemplative afterglow rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of forgiveness, guilt, and “imperfect miracles” emerge through concrete acts (spiral of shards/pages, broken chord metaphor becoming tactic). Subtext in the environment and objects does the heavy lifting. A few sentences brush the edge of thesis‑speak (“apologies, like music, can linger beyond the silence”), slightly reducing ambiguity. Overall, resonance is earned by image rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of unity vs. illusion and endings as thresholds emerge through recurring images (spiral, hush, dictionary) and reweight at the close. However, the line “the end of history was not a finality but a doorway” states the thesis outright, undercutting subtext in the final paragraph. The piece earns resonance through image, but occasional didactic clarity blunts mystery. Strong coherence, reduced subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Recurring machine/nature images integrate with the theme of time as lived intervals; the final image reweights meaning with a credible, resonant calm. However, the line “he realized that clocks measured not time but the intervals between breaths of the world” states the thesis directly, dulling subtext. Even so, the ending’s charged poise (horizon turns to steady light; key returned) preserves aftereffect. The piece invites reflection without collapsing into mere allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of permeability and “letting go” are coherent and threaded through images, but they are often asserted outright (“Letting go—was not surrender...”) rather than earned via subtext. The “familiar strangers” idea resonates but does not transform a choice. The final paragraph tilts toward moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of paradox embraced responsibly arise from concrete acts (the sum, ratios, and the lantern ritual) rather than pure assertion, culminating in the theorem and lantern bequeathal. However, explicit statements (“to widen perspectives responsibly,” “true lucid contradiction”) edge toward telling. The final image reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. Resonance lingers, if softly.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of beginnings within endings and connection through misdirection are integrated through the loop and the recording of grief. The closing realization reprices the premise effectively, though lines like “not a trap but a teaching tool” edge toward thesis-stating. Resonance lingers via the charged image of the disc and the concrete “Thank you.”

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory as covenant, small lights steering darkness, and renewal through subtle links emerge organically through image chains (locket → lighthouse → tide). Subtext coheres: ritual as a form of ethical attention. A few direct statements (“His purpose…to preserve the weight of small moments”) edge toward telling, trimming the afterglow. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of reciprocity/connection emerges naturally through rumor chains, polite summons, and the passing onward of the lantern. However, the line “the cure for loneliness was not a potion but the act of catalyzing connections” states the thesis outright, dulling resonance. The final image still carries warmth and conceptual charge via the humming station and shared jokes. Greater reliance on image over declaration would deepen subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres—mapping interiority via non‑visual senses and empathy—and the final image reweights prior motifs. However, the explicit thesising (“She understood that navigating uncharted emotional depths required…”) blunts subtext. The resonance of languages dissolving into one chord works, but a touch more implication and less stating would elevate. Emotional complexity skews serene over ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coheres—editing history as listening, identity preserved through revision—but it tips into direct statement (“editing history was less about control and more about listening”). Recurring images (seeds, garden, gravity, unbending) meaningfully reweight the final moment. The insight grows from the specific error and revised method rather than abstract sermonizing. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, reflective, and earned if not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silence, memory, and the ethics of being forgotten emerge through concrete images (empty camera, camera imprint, wind‑translated signs). The final vow reframes absence as renewable creation without sermonizing, though the last sentence edges toward explicit thesis. Subtext operates in how bodies and environment “hear” without sound. Resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Fire as destruction/illumination, memory as heat, and the phoenix motif interweave to answer the central question through image rather than mere assertion. The scroll’s promise and the final mural reweight earlier material with resonance. Occasional direct statements (“he understood that his flames… could now be turned”) edge toward moralizing but don’t overwhelm the imagery. The afterimage is sincere and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of collective healing and rebellion-as-care are woven through recurring images (aurora, lagoon, orbs) that reweight sorrow into hope. Subtext largely rides image rather than statement; however, lines like “sorrow can birth light” verge on explicit moralizing. The final image reaffirms an earned communal chord rather than closing with a thesis. Resonance lingers, though a hair less told summation would strengthen it.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motifs (zodiac, map, coin, steel “veins”) accrue toward a resonant whisper-versus‑shout contrast at the end. However, the parchment’s explicit line—“Whispers are the true currents of this city”—states the thesis and blunts subtext. The final image of the shout’s echo falling short regains nuance, but some moralizing remains. Thematic coherence is strong; complexity is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—silent empathy as a pedagogy that reveals inherent light—emerges through the act of weaving constellations. Subtext operates in images (shutters, cathedral flashes, stitched stars) that reweight darkness, though purpose is occasionally stated outright. The ending image rephrases the central question without moralizing. A bit more resistance or counter‑pressure would deepen the thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of “quiet as revolutionary attention” emerges organically through chess, synchronized light, and communal listening. Recurring images (mist → breath; pawn → queen; saplings → forests of second thoughts) reweight at the end without overt moralizing. A few lines skirt declarative thesis (“the quiet would not be broken”) but remain supported by scene. The final whisper functions as a conceptual repricing of power.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme coheres: detachment from violence as a path to authentic freedom, rendered through the whale-song ritual and the object’s release. Recurring images (song as blade, guarded hearts, the island as crucible) reprise meaningfully at the end. Occasional telling (“She realized the crystal was the island’s heart…”) dilutes subtext, but the final image of earned calm carries resonance. The moral isn’t stated outright, and the piece invites reflection via image rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from concrete acts (whittling as ritual, bouquet as memorial) rather than mere assertion, and the final image reweights “hush” as chosen rather than imposed. Subtext of art under soft authoritarianism resonates, though several lines articulate thesis overtly (“not rebellion but a quiet cultivation”), dulling some afterglow. The turbines’ hymn and the pact between objects carry clean thematic charge. Ambiguity around moral cost lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: art as boundary‑dissolving force, freedom versus sanctity, world reconfigured by lyric agency. Recurring images (tremor/pulse, dissolving boundary, lantern‑moth hush) deepen and reweight at the end without moralizing. The resonance is genuine though the ethical cost of undoing “sacred” walls is only implied. The piece invites reflection through image rather than thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (beauty from ruin; imperfection as truest melody) emerges organically through plant‑reed exchanges and culminates in the glass garden. However, the glassblower’s line (“true glass… never seeks perfection”) states the thesis outright, dulling subtext at the end. The final image still resonates, but explicit moralizing trims complexity. Earlier beats carry stronger implicit meaning through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of sensing across modalities and engineered empathy emerges organically from image and action; the final dimming answers “What if sound can be seen?” by dissolving boundaries. Recurring motifs (golden shadows, texture of connection) accrue meaning and culminate in a resonant quiet. A touch of overt moralizing (“propelled humanity toward deeper empathy”) slightly blunts the subtext. Overall, the piece invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rebirth through intentional craft integrates with “genuinely artificial” art seeding real life; the final crane aimed at a sunrise reframes grief without moralizing. Recurring motifs (curtains of intention, illumination, coordinates) accrue meaning and culminate in a quiet vow. At times the concept is explained a shade too explicitly (“not literal drapes”), nudging toward statement over subtext. Nonetheless, the resonance lingers through concrete images rather than slogans.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of inherited mystery, pattern-mapping, and community hope rise organically from the ritual actions. Some lines verge on thesis statements (“not merely profit, but a blueprint of hope”) which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the final droplet-on-tape reprise reweights prior motifs with a resonant, forward-looking answer. The piece invites reflection on belief systems and markets without pedantry.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres—purification through embracing fragmentation—and the final image reweights prior motifs. However, the line “true purification comes not from erasing the past...” reads as explicit moralizing, dulling subtext at the end. Earlier images (irregular steps, liquid memory) do strong thematic work without telling. Emotional aftereffect is earned but slightly over‑explained in the last movement.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of transforming loss into legacy emerges through particulars (stone, footage, mirrored children, shareable dreams). Subtext rides images (warming stone, brightening footage) rather than thesis statements, though a few lines tread near explicit moral (“his mission complete”). The final act (recording his own ritual) offers a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of trust, repair, and the balance of compassion/self‑respect emerge organically through object work and ritual. The final image elegantly reframes balance as tidal, yet the explicit moral line (“balance is not a static point…”) tips into authorial statement. Subtext otherwise works in image—the tail’s glow, the mist’s absorption—giving the piece a lingering aftertaste. The overt closing statement trims resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of time as wound, scars as language, and hope within injury cohere through concrete motifs (coffee rings, meteor hush, hourglass). The final sunrise/clearing glass reweights prior images persuasively. A few lines verge on explicit moralizing (“wounds can hold hope,” “time itself was a wound we could read”), which trims subtlety. Still, resonance lingers and feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of release, curation of sorrow, and the alchemy of art into love emerge organically through the particulars (letters as birds, film as river of memory). The final image reweights the premise: liberation comes by gathering and transforming, not locating a single vault. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in what “carrying the stored unused love” will cost her. Symbolic threads recur without shouting, especially the hush/thunder motif resolving in the audience of shadows.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of rest as renewal, art as liberation, and listening to the unspoken accrue through image and act, culminating in “freedom” and the charged relic left behind. Subtext rides the archway’s ongoing chorus for travelers—art made public from private labor. A touch of explicit statement (“rest was not an end but a cycle”) slightly over‑articulates. Overall resonance is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Renewal from ruin, memory as fire, and time’s repricing are integrated through recurring images (clock, ash, lullaby) that shift meaning at the end. The piece avoids explicit moralizing, letting the final chorus‑image carry resonance. Subtext suggests stewardship without sleep/dream as the price of hope, which lingers. Slight sentimentality creeps in with the seamless success of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres: probable miracles arise when attention aligns with the world’s deeper rhythm; the frontier is inward. The engine beat reweights prior motifs, and the final walk outward carries a charged inward turn. However, lines like “He realized his motivation…” tilt into tell, reducing subtext. Still, the image system (hum/wind/gear) bears thematic load effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of courageous passage through oblique paths accrues via recurring images (stars, lullaby, ridgeway, map). A few lines edge toward telling (“courage, unused, lay dormant like a seed”), but most meaning comes through enacted ritual and image. The final recommitment reframes the vigil as a vow to self—clean resonance without moralizing. Subtext ties patience, loss, and risk under a coherent metaphor field.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme coheres around safety’s price, silence, and hope; the bolt and discoloration accrue meaning and reprice the premise at the end. Subtext largely works through image and ritual, though a few lines state the thesis too plainly (“safety demanded a price,” “willingness to bear silence”). The final image avoids moralizing by returning to snow/bolt signals, sustaining resonance. Complexity persists in the tension between endurance and the dream of a thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    Truth dissolving deceit and the idea that legitimacy endures while imposture collapses recur through image and action; the “graceful collapse” motif lands. The explicit lineage pronouncement edges toward thesis, slightly flattening ambiguity. Yet the final hymn of renewal earns a resonant, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    Recurring motifs (tapping, torn atlas, “drifting moored,” “periodically eternal”) deepen into a humane thesis about listening, memory, and ecological guidance without overt sermonizing. One paragraph edges into tell (“When coral bleaches, they lose the chemical gradients…”) but ties back to present stakes. The final charged poise—lights flicker with taps—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Complexity holds without tidy moral closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    Recurring motifs (hum, lenses, rhythm) earn a thematic answer: meaning as alignment and attentive action. The closing image has resonance, but explicit statements (“meaning was not a fixed destination”) edge toward moralizing. Subtext largely rides image and sound rather than argument, which works; complexity is present but gentle. A touch less declaration would heighten afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Tradition vs evolution and destiny-as-invitation resonate through concrete acts (telepathy, decoding, sacrifice, communal cradle). The final communal image reweights earlier reverence with intent. A line like “not a command, but an invitation for collective growth” edges into stated moral. Overall, images do most of the work, with a small dose of telling.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of endurance, memory, and disciplined hope emerge through particular images (photo, sapling, wind chimes) rather than thesis alone. The “pearl of stillness” motif reweights at the end, offering a non‑literal answer: quiet resolve as a beacon. One line (“Her purpose, she realized, was to anchor optimism in realism”) drifts toward direct statement, but the ending resists a tidy moral. Subtext—survival as embodied practice, not transcendence—lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: brokenness as luminescent, fragmentation as method rather than flaw, and descent as the price of authentic art. Recurring images (threads, spiral, luminescence, breath) shift meaning by the end from ache to pulse. The phoenix card provides a non‑literal answer without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively—he rises with a “mosaic of reclaimed pieces,” not a neat cure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece finds resonant meaning in the idea of a universal “pause” as a granted grace, with the disappearing ink reweighted as history’s peril of erasure. The final vow converts insight into purpose, reconfiguring earlier images. Occasional explicit statements (“not a flaw but a deliberate deferral”) tip toward didactic, slightly thinning subtext. Overall, thematic weave feels earned through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of censorship, institutional memory, and quiet courage arise through particulars (conduit, sigil, archivists unlocking vaults). Subtext lives in the transformation of “quiet” from suppression to charged poise, but several lines tip into moralizing (“true change required the quiet courage of those willing to listen”). The lighthouse and shoots work, though they verge on overt symbolism. Resonance is present, if somewhat stated.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Recurring motifs (“engraved quiet,” “burden as bridge,” “tranquil blaze”) cohere and reweight the final dawn image. Some lines state theme outright (“silence can hold strength,” “burden can become a bridge”), shading toward didactic. Subtext exists in acts of care, ritualizing salvage into meaning. Resonance lingers, if somewhat pre‑articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: longing translated into sound, creation as listening and release rather than capture. The final repricing—“to catch… is not to trap, but to set it free”—reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Recurring images (lullaby, patterns breaking, threads/lines) accrue meaning and shift at the end. Ambiguity lingers productively around the cost of carrying the echo.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Truth versus official narrative is woven through objects and method (pen nib lineage, contradiction as ethic), and “orbits of regret” offers a resonant conceptual frame. Some lines verge on thesis (“any writer… must first prove the false premise cannot hold”), slightly flattening subtext. The final image reweights the motif without heavy moralizing. Thematic coherence is strong, if a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Compassion rewriting code and “tethering a cry to honor a memory” recur through concrete images (amber, letters, firmware) and culminate in a community‑soothing sanctuary. However, the thematic line “haunted firmware could be healed when compassion rewrote the code” borders on stated moral. Resonance is genuine yet slightly tidy, with less friction or counter‑current. The ending lingers but edges toward explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of unlearning and silence-as-language emerge organically through the tile/mandala dialogue and the final hush. However, the explicit thesis line (“Unlearning… was not erasing knowledge…”) undercuts subtext. The last images resonate and invite reflection without moralizing beyond that slip. Recurring motifs reweight meaning at the end effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres through recurring particulars (chips, steel/warmth, aberrant mercy) that shift meaning at the end toward communal stewardship. The piece resists sermonizing, though lines like “compassion could be engineered” brush the edge of statement. The final image reweights prior motifs without a tidy moral. Resonance lingers via the paradox of “warm coldness.”

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of art’s afterlife, renewal, and communal hope emerge organically through objects and echoes rather than direct exposition. The sunrise coin and apples-as-applause reweight prior images with tenderness. A faint moralizing chord (“every closed business could bloom anew”) trims complexity in the final paragraph. Overall resonance lingers, driven by image more than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres around skepticism yielding to earned, transparent “willowglass” hope through disciplined method. Recurring images (fractals, somatic markers, geode) meaningfully reappear and reweight the ending. Occasional overt statements (“hope…was not naive”) verge on telling and dampen subtext. Still, the final glow and naming of “Willowglass Pathways” deliver a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of translation, stewardship, and listening accrue through recurring images (veins/filaments, echoes, lantern‑droplets) and culminate in a resonant final tableau. However, the explicit thesis—“to become the voice of the unknown was not to speak for others…”—states the moral in the final movement, dulling subtext. Emotional aftereffect is elegiac and sincere. Greater reliance on implication would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Shared wisdom” emerges through the interplay of grains, buttons, and echo, with a resonant reconfiguration that the wisdom is a living conversation. Some lines lean toward explicit moralizing (“not a static lesson but a living conversation”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the final image—stepping onto a fragile time-bridge while the world rewrites—offers earned, lingering resonance. The motifs cohere without feeling gimmicky.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of repair, courage, and humility recur via images (codes, melt, spring) and culminate in a reweighted understanding. However, explicit moralizing (“fixing what's broken required both the courage… and the humility…”) states the thesis rather than letting images carry it. Subtext exists in the spy’s guilt and the season’s thaw, but complexity is softened by neat resolution. Resonance remains, if somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme integrates through recurring images (palimpsest, stitch, mirror-water) that reweight at the end: honoring layers rather than erasing. The final realization avoids moralizing, letting the refigured surface carry meaning. Some motifs are reiterated overtly (“palimpsest promise” appears more than once), slightly reducing subtlety. Still, the piece invites reflection on memory and release through image rather than thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres (kindness as force that bends timelines without erasure; memory as lattice), with recurring images reweighted at the end (lantern becomes “its own sun”). Some lines tip into overt moralizing (“kindness… can bend even the hardest timeline”), softening subtext. The closing image still resonates as a conceptual repricing of change vs. constancy. More implication and less declaration would heighten aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of care as illumination and pragmatic hope accrue through recurring images (oars’ rhythm, hush, moon ribbons) and reweight at the end. Occasional explicitness (“truest form of care”) edges toward stating the thesis. Subtext of tending as resistance lands via the glowing vines and seasonal vow. The resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of coexistence, agency, and reframing isolation accrue through recurring images (sundial, hum, whale, brittle awakenings) and reweight at the end. Some lines edge toward explicit thesis (“brittle awakenings… delicate beginnings”), but most resonance comes via image. The final cadence offers a non‑literal answer: independence forged through relation, not withdrawal. Complexity is present though largely harmonious rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of secrecy, connection, and time-traveling love accrue through recurring images (thread, mosaic of confessions, ink constellations). A few lines tilt toward explicit statement (“She understood that the act of rejoin…”), slightly dulling subtext. Still, the final image resonates and invites reflection on relational stewardship. The motif network reweights earlier particulars effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of balancing power plays through delicate, communal interference is coherent and seeded early. Recurring sonic imagery accrues meaning and pays off in the dawn shimmer and “lighthouse” reprise. Some lines verge on sermonizing (“tuned their own inner frequency,” “not as a weapon but as a conduit of balance”). The resonance lingers, but the moral clarity feels a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (compass, organ, space rebellion) cohere into a theme about remapping limits and resisting cultural forgetting. The final garden image extends meaning with a gentle after‑resonance. Some thematic lines state the thesis outright (“not against stone, but against the forgetting of stories”), lowering subtext. The piece invites reflection, but a touch more implication over declaration would lift it.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs of absence/presence and unifying opposites thread coherently to propose that feeling, not seeing, restores the forgotten. The ribbon’s evolution (talisman → named edge → tear‑catcher) offers a strong thematic throughline. However, overt thesis statements (“method of unifying opposites,” “awaken dormant empathy”) recur, tipping toward didactic. The resonance is real but slightly over‑explained.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Memory, redemption, and a “moral compass” emerge via actions and images (the nail’s placement, the compass’s spin, coded stanzas resurfacing). The ending’s conceptual repricing—the map now tracing courage—resonates without over-closure. A few lines verge on thesis-stating (“key to a moral compass”), trimming subtlety. Overall, the motifs accrue and reweight meaning credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of forgiveness, memory, and re‑writing absence arise organically through song, image, and landscape. Some statements verge on thesis (“He realized that to sculpt possibility…”) which flattens subtext. Nevertheless, the closing vow and glowing plate deliver a resonant non‑literal answer. The analog/digital synthesis grounds the moral imagination without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Recurring images (loops, markers, currency) integrate with legacy and choice to deliver a resonant stance on boundaries as guides, not cages. The final realization is evocative but edges toward explicit statement (“circles are not failures”), slightly reducing subtext. Still, the charged reprise of the notes and dawn walk provides an earned, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of “shared burdens/words heal” is coherent and threaded through telegram, witnessing, and the final ritual, with the last image reweighting earlier motifs. However, explicit thesis statements (“heal with words,” “healed the world with words”) veer toward moralizing and dampen subtext. The piece invites reflection through recurring images (stars, perfume, hum) but rarely courts complicating countercurrents. Resonance is real but risks sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mirrors/hidden truth and warlike serenity recur and evolve, culminating in a lake that “reflects … the truths beneath.” One line states theme overtly (“mirrors never show…”), but most resonance arises from action and image. The final binding of confession to a “living heart” reframes truth as something guarded, not displayed. Thematic aftertaste is coherent and avoids didactic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—binding dream to duty; healing historical “scars”—emerges through repeated images and the closing reconfiguration. A few lines state the thesis outright (“not a contract of power, but a promise...”), muting subtext. Still, the hedge scars fading and the beacon tied to heartbeat offer resonant images. The ending invites reflection without moralizing, though ambiguity is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of exchange, repair, and mutual binding accrue through repeated images (roots stitching, sigils as promises, amber thread) and reweight at the end. The realization that bartered destinies “stitch” both sides is resonant but somewhat explained rather than purely enacted. Ambiguity remains about the moral cost, which keeps it alive past the page. Largely avoids sermonizing despite a few declarative lines.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (echo, cloth, dust, applause) braid into a coherent meditation on purpose after loss. The ending answers the theme non‑literally by reweighting the “stage” toward private conviction. However, the explicit assertion “the true stage is not lit by spotlights...” edges into moralizing and blunts subtext. Despite that, resonance lingers through the final, charged handling of the object.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of ambition reoriented toward compassion is coherent and emerges through image systems (seed, translations, harmonics). However, the piece occasionally states its moral directly (“ambition, once haunted, could be guided toward compassion”), dulling subtext. The final “every translation was a seed” line lands, but edges into thesis. Resonance persists, though it leans declarative over implicative.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of identity as tidal/contradictory emerges through concrete acts (smelting by accepting contradictions; blank books that write with the moon). The ending reweights the premise quietly, avoiding moralizing while offering a resonant answer. Recurrences (moon phases, creel, tide) accrue meaning instead of being decorative. The insight is earned, though the ambiguity carries little friction.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of communal healing and confession emerge from concrete acts (glyphs dissolving, halo crowning) rather than thesis statements. A touch of sermonizing arrives in the vow to “spread the method,” edging toward didactic. Subtext operates through image (abandoned hopes woven around the pearl), and the final beacon reweights the premise. The resonance is strong but slightly airbrushed.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of forgiveness as process emerges organically through maps, crossings, and returns; the final vow reweights prior images. The overt graffiti line (“Forgiveness is not a destination…”) tips into thematic echo, reducing subtlety. Still, the ending’s image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer (ongoing crossing), avoiding sentimentality. Subtext rides objects and place with coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of language, time, and the ethics of voice surface organically via cipher mechanics and unspoken words. The explicit statement “the library itself was a cipher” edges toward telling. The garden of luminous petals offers a resonant image, though the emotional cost is muted. Subtext (silence needing readers) lingers without heavy sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece thematizes autonomy vs assimilation through concrete particulars (vines’ whispers vs iron towers, coffee rings as choice‑veins, perforations of destiny). The final image reweights earlier motifs—plants and coffee—as agents of change without moralizing. Complexity lingers in the shared “mulberry ache,” acknowledging loss inside victory. A hint of neatness in the envoy’s conversion keeps it short of exceptional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Recurring images (static patterns, threshold, hush) cohere into a theme about stewarding fleeting light. The final covenant language risks mild moralizing and flattens subtext where the images already carried it. Still, the ending’s beacon and brief aurora reignition provide a resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    Rebirth/forgiveness/contentment cohere through recurring images (vines shedding, hairpin spiral, seasonal wine) and culminate in a charged final image. At times the theme is stated a bit directly (“contentment was not a hidden treasure”), edging toward moralizing. Subtext emerges through ritual and caretaking rather than dialogue. The resonance lingers but lacks a thorn or counter‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through recurring particulars (mirror shard, wind‑chimes, cloak of doubt) rather than exposition. The ending’s concept—truth as multi‑faceted reflection and vulnerability as strength—lands in image. One line (“truth is never a single reflection”) edges toward on‑the‑nose. Overall, resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs (rings, magnetism, hush) accrue toward a theme of disciplined attention enabling revelation. The ending reframes “appearing as one vanishes” without a didactic moral, though one line leans close (“I will not rush the answer…”). Subtext operates through pattern and patience rather than argument. Resonance lingers, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stillness versus motion, listening to history, and continuity through reverence emerge organically from action and image. The final quiet image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the flock’s “living compass” and the bone towers’ approval lands cleanly. Slightly contained ambiguity keeps it resonant without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—simple sacredness vs. mechanized spectacle—emerges through concrete images (cords, mist, keystone, automation below) and culminates in a reweighted final image. Subtext works through “brilliant dimness” rather than debate, with a credible refusal of fireworks. A few lines flirt with thesis-stating, slightly flattening ambiguity. Still, the resonance lingers and the answer is shown, not lectured.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs (lanterns, truth, vows, meteor hush, teal chord) recur and reweight at the end, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer: truth made into a language of color. The piece avoids didactic moralizing, letting image and act do the thematic work. Slight sentimentality in the final cascade of lanterns softens the edge. Still, the closing image meaningfully reframes the quest as a beacon for others.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of purpose under entropy and listening backward emerge from particulars (coins, static memory, reversed prophecy) rather than thesis. The ending reweights the premise—purpose as frequency—without sermonizing, and the echoing universe offers a resonant answer. Subtext (risk of chaos, doubt as signal) deepens the aftertaste. Minor abstraction creep appears but is anchored by concrete beats.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of sacrifice, naming, and grief‑to‑gratitude emerges from concrete acts rather than authorial summary. Recurring images (light, crystals, breath of stones) are reweighted by the final constellation‑name. One line edges toward declarative (“transformed from a burden into a bridge”) but is earned by prior particulars. Subtext of ancestral debt and honesty under fear resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through particulars: fragile devotion plus measured attention can restore balance; plausible impossibility arises from patience and pattern. The recurring bell/drip pattern reweights meaning at the end (cosmos shifts), inviting reflection beyond plot. A few lines lean toward moralizing (“even lukewarm magic can mend the universe”), slightly reducing subtlety. Still, resonance persists through image rather than thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant motifs (water, lantern, chime, label) braid into a theme of truth built through collective memory. A direct thesis line (“the true power…lay not in destruction…”) edges into telling, reducing subtext. Still, the final reconfiguration (reservoir as an “ancient eye”) offers a non‑literal answer that lingers. The story resists cynicism without flattening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres—true alchemy as the yielding of logic to wonder—through recurring images (scale of fire/water, blue-to-amber flame, starlings’ algorithm made organic). However, the explicit thesis line (“true alchemy begins where logic yields to awe”) edges into moralizing and undercuts subtext. Most resonance arises from particulars (shard in the lips, oak’s pulse), not generic claims. A less declarative final statement would heighten aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Recurrences (buckle, silence/static, revision) braid into a theme of trust maintained through careful, iterative labor under pressure. The final stance—a quiet recommitment—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. “Silence as dialogue” and the fallen skyfarer infuse subtext. Slight neatness in the closing gratitude softens complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of vivifying the self through complementary opposites resonates via the paradox blade and the twin pulse. The final image reweights the initial premise (coexistence vs. theft) and ties to Kael’s interior aim. However, a few lines state the thesis outright (“The method was simple yet profound...”), muting subtext. Complexity around clone ethics is gestured at rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thematic throughlines—innovation needing permeability, stories as water, orthogonal paths—are coherent and reprise in the final reflection. However, the explicit moralizing (“She understood that safeguarding space…”) blunts subtext and trades resonance for statement. The final image is lovely but lightly earned in terms of thematic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—tending to the unspoken, grief coaxed into song—is integrated through action and recurring images. Some lines verge on direct statement (“He had learned… silence could be coaxed into song”), slightly reducing subtext. The ending’s coexistence of sorrow and mirth resonates without a tidy moral. The photograph’s giggle provides an earned, specific pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of uncertainty as companion, guardianship vs. curation, and patience as purpose emerge through image and action. The final wing of mist‑woven verses offers a resonant answer without a tidy moral. A few explicit thematic phrases (“make friends with uncertainty”) skim the edge of telling. Subtext largely works via charged objects and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of creative destruction accrues through particulars (ash ground into tincture; “measured ruin”) and culminates in the paradox of cold flame. However, lines like “He realized that creative destruction was not merely breaking” tip toward thesis‑telling. The final image reweights the initial hopelessness convincingly. Subtext exists, but the text sometimes states what the images already imply.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    The beginning/ending dialectic is woven through image (chord echoing first vibration) and action (re‑tuning ruins), offering a quiet, resonant answer. However, the theme is stated outright late (“endings are merely signals awaiting reinterpretation,” “Genesis in Echo”), which blunts subtext. The shard’s reweighting from relic to key is effective and organic. Emotional aftertaste leans contemplative rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motifs—hourglass, sound, mist, sideways clocks—cohere into a theme about intention reweaving time. The final image reweights earlier particulars, but the line “intention can align the cosmos” lapses into overt moralizing. Subtext exists in the interplay of tool and will, yet the ending states what the images already show. The resonance is present but somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—bridging logic and wonder via “rational enchantment”—emerges organically from action and image, with strong recurring motifs (thread, pulse, bridge). Subtext flashes in the translation of echoes into shared filaments and the collective heart. Some lines state insights too directly (e.g., “He realized that imagination can be measured”), slightly flattening resonance. The final image still lingers with thoughtful ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—balance between tradition and progress, depth and sky—emerges through the anchor link and method, with a resonant reprise at the end. Some lines tip into explicit statement (“the link represented the balance of forces”), which blunts subtext. The final promise carries honest feeling without sentimentality, if concept‑forward. Ambiguity is thoughtful, but insights are sometimes told rather than earned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of remembrance and stewardship emerges through objects and action rather than moralizing, though the phrase “incidental heroism” is stated overtly. Subtext lives in the choir’s fading hymn, the restored colors, and the act of pocketing the photo as a beacon. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: duty is a chosen listening. Complexity skews gentle; ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of stewardship/remembering the invisible accrues through repeated images (gold flecks, cables as language) and culminates in burial. The final act reweights power as custody, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. A hint of tidiness and triumphal tone smooths complexity that might have deepened the aftertaste. Still, the piece invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Failure as teacher and “broken piece holds meaning” emerge through action (shard conduit, ghost’s confession) and the final image reweights the premise. A couple of explicit theme lines nudge toward moral (“ensuring no death certificate would ever again be signed by a glitch”), trimming subtlety. Still, the mirror‑ghost and warmed shard create genuine resonance. The ending’s quiet repricing lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of preservation versus loss emerges organically through action and images (sighs of the dead into living song; preservation that requires sealing). The final silence reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“even a single note could ripple across time”), slightly reducing mystery. Overall resonance is substantial.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of redemption, laughter against darkness, and the redefinition of “monster” grow organically from images and beats. Several lines tip into direct thesis (“The joke was that the universe itself had been waiting...”), reducing subtext. Still, the final cadence (absence as promise; frost warming) resonates. The recurring song/harmony motif ties the thematic bow effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of nonviolent transformation, courage, and reclamation through art emerge organically through image, not moralizing. The locust shell’s arc and “resonantly soft” refrain reweight earlier moments at the end. Ambiguity is purposeful (invitation vs. rebellion), though the piece leans idealistic with limited counterpressure. The final empty shell as beacon delivers a clean conceptual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs (voids, cracks, rain) align with the theme of mending absence and honoring limits, and the final crossing image resonates. However, explicit thesis lines—especially “In the end, the mail he delivered was not ink but a promise…”—tip into moralizing and reduce subtext. The earlier sentence about broken promises healing via acknowledged voids telegraphs theme rather than letting images carry it. The piece still lands a reflective afterglow through image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—silence as possibility—is coherent and woven through object/action (song, halo, wind bells). Several explicit statements (“She understood…”) flatten subtext and edge toward summary of meaning. The final image reweights prior motifs into an ongoing symphony, creating a gentle afterglow without a tidy moral. Resonance is strong if somewhat asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: stewardship of memory at the intersection of science and poetry, and the ethical tenderness of reawakening what’s dormant. The final image (ledger entry, scarf humming, quiet vigil) reweights prior motifs without stating a moral. A few conceptual assertions (“hidden geometry,” “bridge between measurable and mythic”) verge on telling, but they’re mostly enacted. Resonance lingers as quiet duty rather than proclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of longing as communal bridge and art as translation emerge organically through image systems (light, wind, jasmine, pearl). The realization that the cipher is a bridge offers a resonant answer. One slightly declarative line (“not a puzzle to be solved but a bridge”) edges toward telling, but prior particulars earn it. The final fragrant hush reweights the opening’s absence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of fear transmuted into courage and communal hope emerge clearly through the unlocking and filament image. However, several overt statements (“a living bridge between fear and courage,” closing legend moral) flatten subtext. The final image resonates but leans toward sermonizing. Ambiguity and counter‑pressure are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Recurring images (broken constellations, fairy ring, sea that takes/returns) braid an argument about memory and ritual. However, the line “When habits break…” reads as thesis‑forward and appears twice, edging into overt moralizing. The final “crisp nostalgia” image lands emotionally. More subtext, fewer stated insights, would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of resilience through tender stewardship emerges from particulars (annotation practice, tea‑geometry, vow to guard stories) and reweights at closure when the library “breathes.” Subtext rides the image system (shadow imprisoned, then released) rather than thesis. One on‑the‑nose declaration (“You will not be exiled again…”) slightly flattens ambiguity. Overall resonance lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—stewardship of wonder, interconnection, and transmutation of sorrow—emerges through concrete images (spores stitching realms, sigils in rain). It veers toward overt declaration (“preserve the color of wonder”) and sentimentality, softening the complexity. The final gesture (gifting the sprig) offers resonance without moralizing, but ambiguity is limited. Subtext is primarily atmospheric rather than conflict-embedded.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Silence as an active, binding medium reframes grief and memory with credible, resonant images. Thematic throughline is coherent (careful restoration tames loud grief), with a satisfying reweighting at the end. A few lines edge toward exposition (“The secret was simple...”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall, resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—empathy reconfiguring boundaries between known/unknown—emerges through recurring images (tear, rain, projection) and the final quiet activation. Some phrasing edges into tell (“Her motivation—to interpret silence with empathy”), softening subtext. The last image reweights the premise without a tidy moral. Resonance is earned via particulars rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thematic through‑line is coherent and largely image‑driven (wires, light pulses, glitter drift), but several explicit statements undercut subtext—especially “tension minus attachment equals the luminous path of release.” The piece often explains what the images already do, tipping toward sermonizing in the final third. When it trusts the particulars (wax sealing, globe shatter), it resonates cleanly. Strong idea, slightly over‑articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of connection beyond parsing—code needing to be felt—emerges organically through blossoms/graffiti/circuitry, reweighted when travelers continue the ritual. Subtextual linkage of art, embodiment, and language is strong without sermonizing. A few explicit statements (“even silent code craves song”) are close to thesis but remain earned by scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.3)
    Recurring images (light, ice, laughter in jars, ascent/descent) cohere around a theme of joy recovered beneath affliction. The final vow and returned goggles provide quiet resonance without overt sermonizing. Some thematic phrasing (“seek out the joy beneath anguish,” “affectionate detachment”) reads told rather than earned. Subtext is present but not pressurized by conflict, keeping complexity moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    Resonance arises from particulars—the broken strings, engraved telescope, cloud‑emotions—and culminates in a quiet revaluation of absence as record. However, the thesis is stated outright multiple times (“to prove that empty spaces remember,” “a quiet testament...”), which blunts subtext. The comet’s “quietly explosive” echo is a strong image‑answer that could have carried more of the thematic load without exposition. Still, the motif web coheres effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of limits as thresholds emerges organically through ritual timing, coin grooves, and face‑blindness reframed as another way of seeing. The final image conceptually reprices “silence” and “sky,” making defiance the true craft. A few statements verge on the didactic but are earned by pattern and cost. Resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Translation, pattern, and “language of light” braid into a coherent meditation on knowledge as communion—between cultures, machines, and birds. The final image (murmurations acknowledging the ship’s glow) reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. However, the lack of felt cost keeps the resonance from deepening into complication. It lingers as wonder more than reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    Repair, reflection, and time’s pulse braid cleanly; the hall’s mirrors literalize self/era multiplicity, then reweight as he assembles and restores. The sunrise and steadying heartbeat offer an earned, non-propositional answer about mending and continuance. Minimal moralizing; resonance arises from image and action. Ambiguity persists productively in the cost of becoming a perpetual mender.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of communal care, ritual, and trust emerge through the bell and chalk ritual, with resonant images. However, the explicit line urging resource reexamination “so that no one ever again went thirsty” edges into moralizing, flattening subtext. The final image of seasonal ringing restores some resonance. Complexity is suggested but largely uncontested.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs (broken puppet, hush, ticking/silence) develop a theme of flawed beauty becoming enabling architecture for grace. The final image reweights the premise—the lighthouse’s warning light becomes an oath of peace—without didactic summary. One explicit thematic line (“beauty lay in being beautifully flawed”) edges toward telling, trimming freshness slightly. Overall resonance is strong and organically earned by particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Redemption as wound, usefulness without cure, and the ethics of duty under curse emerge organically from acts and images. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing: beauty that is “graceless,” a light that helps others while the orchard remains blighted. Motifs (nut/blueprint/reed/birds/frost) accrue meaning rather than being declared. Slightly more friction between saving travelers and sustaining the curse might have deepened the ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The recurring chrysalis/foam/bridge triad evolves meaningfully, reweighting loss as connective design without moralizing. Subtext rides image and action (listening to collapse-pops, laughter when foam tangles her hair) rather than declarative theses. The colleagues’ scene flirts with tell, but the months-later outcomes and the child’s gift restore resonance. The ending invites reflection on cycles and repair beyond the literal plot.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme coheres: creation as the conversion of silence/absence into story, enacted through concrete ritual. The “glimmering parole” motif evolves from intention to choral manifestation, culminating in the library’s single chord. A few lines skate close to overt statement (“a promise that every story starts with a silent breath”), but most resonance arises from image and act. The final image reweights the premise without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of communal guilt, transformation through balance, and the ethics of contagion accrue through images (fresh water clinging to salt; bitterness vs citrus). Insights arise from doing, not sermonizing; the final “brittle resilience” resists tidy moral. A few direct assertions about method slightly reduce ambiguity but do not undercut resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Resonance arises from concrete particulars (multilingual chimes, bridges etched with verses) linking art and labor. The final paragraph edges into moralizing (“announcing a day built on empathy, decisive action…”) which blunts subtext and invites Thematic Echo penalty. Ambiguity is limited; the piece states its thesis rather than letting image alone carry it. The closing image still works, but with diminished subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme integrates technology, memory, and communion with matter; the final repricing (revive vs catalog) resonates with earlier images of entanglement and helix. Subtext hums in the canyon’s responsiveness and the mirrored neural mapping. The explicit line “She realized…” softens subtlety. The closing image of dawn and humming shards lands cleanly without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stewardship and vigilance emerge through concrete images (seedlings becoming living lamps guarding knowledge), and the final promise reweights responsibility. That said, repetition of the terms “vigilance” and “latent blaze” edges toward telling. The most resonant turn is conceptual—knowledge as cultivated light—which lingers without heavy moralizing. Greater ambiguity or a real price would deepen the thematic aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres—empathy transduced through materials—arriving through tactile acts and a reweighted silence at the end. The porcelain’s late “sentinel” glimmer elegantly sustains the thesis. However, lines like “taught that even the deepest silence can be a canvas” veer toward overt moralizing, muting subtext. Ambiguity exists but is partially over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of finding beauty in difficulty and reframing eclipse as pause emerge organically from recurring actions and images (silence→moves, sacrifice motifs, rook at the edge). The final redefinition of “covenant” reweights prior material without sermonizing. A few lines flirt with overt thesis, but the concrete chess‑cosmos choreography carries the meaning. The emotional aftertaste—hopeful melancholy—lingers credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of empathy through attentive listening resonates via concrete acts (naming specific “silences”). However, explicit thesis statements (“the path to empathy… a lattice of quiet recognitions”) edge toward sermonizing, slightly dulling subtext. The final image (fireworks vs. heard stories) lands as a conceptual repricing. Strong resonance with minor didactic leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.9)
    The motifs (seed, scent, doodles, wildflower hush) align around serenity within motion and communal wisdom, and the final image reaffirms it. However, the piece states its thesis outright multiple times (“serenity can be cultivated within motion”), especially near the end, blunting subtext. The realization feels earned but tidily articulated. More implication and fewer thesis statements would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of stewardship, listening, and resilience emerge through particulars (echo resonance, the renunciation). The closing reweights the premise from artifact to practice effectively, though one sentence edges into explicit statement. Subtext mostly lives in image and rhythm (whirling silence, upward water). Resonance lingers but avoids deeper moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Foresight, guidance, and human‑machine/nature alignment emerge through particulars (patch/compass, airflow mapping) rather than sermonizing. The final image reweights the motif—measured breath, guided currents—without a neat moral. Ambiguity is purposeful and invites reflection on stewardship. Slight recurrence literalness (“singular convergence”) keeps it from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of awe-as-essential emerges through recurring images (amber sheet, aurora, hush) and the reweighted silence at the end. However, explicit thesis lines (“certify wonder as essential”) edge into sermonizing and lessen subtext. The final image resonates conceptually but skirts sentimentality by telling the meaning rather than fully embodying it. Still, the motif braid broadly coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme coheres—true guardianship embraces quiet failure—but is occasionally stated rather than earned purely through image (“Her mission, now clear…” and “true guardianship is woven from quiet failures”). Subtext does operate in the hush/flute/seam motif, culminating in a reweighted final image. The moral articulation in the final third blunts lingering ambiguity. The concept resonates, yet it edges toward sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece coherently pursues how empathy can be transposed and encoded, culminating in shards as micro‑verses—an effective non‑literal answer. However, explicit thematic statements (“emotion is not a static variable but a transposed function”) blunt subtext. The final images resonate, but a touch less didactic phrasing would allow the imagery to carry more of the wisdom. The ambiguity generally serves reflection rather than confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—brief encounters stretched into lasting myth—is coherent and threaded through recurring images (pulse, vibration, germination). The pendant’s reweighting in the coda broadens meaning effectively. Some statements verge on didactic (“the world thrives when brief encounters are stretched”), softening subtext. Still, the final pilgrimage image invites reflection without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around memory‑bearing objects, truthful paradox, and the ethics of unveiling hidden ache. The “truth in a lie” motif is dramatized (chant, chorus) and returns at closure with a nuanced charge. Some lines tip into declarative telling (“the truth of her hypothesis crystallized,” “she knew the discovery would ripple”), softening subtext. Still, the ending reweights prior images without collapsing into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Recurring images (loom, silence, bead) accrue into a clear meditation on sacrifice, craft, and connection. The ending reweights these without a didactic thesis, though “sacrifice… the loom of tomorrow” edges toward statement. Emotional aftereffect is tender and melancholic rather than sentimental. The theme emerges from action rather than meta‑commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Resilience from rubble and the price of awakening emerge through concrete images (memory trade; blade knitting stone). Some explicit thematics (“He spoke of bartered awakenings…”) risk mild moralizing, but the final image restores resonance over statement. The silk’s reprise at the end offers a non‑literal answer that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of withheld truth versus shared knowledge and the ethics of survival are coherent and arise from action. Recurring images (maps, lattice, breathing bay) support a conceptual repricing at the end. Some lines verge on explicit statement (“weaving between worlds was not a task but a promise”), trimming subtext. Resonance lingers but avoids profound ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of communal memory, sanctuary, and portable safety emerge organically through the ritual and the sea glass’s evolving charge. The final repricing—lighthouse as a heart of letters rather than light—is resonant. Occasional explicit statements (“he would protect this fragile chain”) slightly over-announce the thesis. Subtext mostly carries the weight through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of renewal through relinquishment (end of print, dawn painted with shadows) resonate through recurring images without heavy exposition. One on‑the‑nose line (“the world would not end, but would be reborn in shadowed brilliance”) slightly flattens subtext. Still, the final vow reframes the opening motifs and sustains a contemplative aftereffect. Complexity is present in the joy/mourning paradox, though not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around beauty-as-warning (“iridescent caution”) and how certain watchers attract stories. The scroll states the thesis explicitly, which flattens subtext, yet the final image—loom-beacon and pledge—reverberates beyond the stated line. Recurring images (wing, mist, light) accrue meaning and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The moral is a touch too articulated to enter higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of stewardship, translation of grief, and the sacred ordinary cohere through recurring images (moonlight, sextant, oak). The closing reweights “quantified sorrow” into “measurable peace,” offering a non‑literal answer to the central question of what caretaking can transform. Occasional explicitness (“a fact he would share,” “mundane miracles”) edges toward told takeaway. Still, resonance lingers in the final breath of the world’s “quiet relief.”

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Recurring images (woven dawns, window, orchard) coherently argue for communal renewal as alchemy. However, the line “the true alchemy was not in transmuting metal, but in weaving together the hearts” tips into explicit moralizing, reducing subtext. The ending image resonates, yet ambiguity and counter‑pressure are minimal. The theme feels sincere but slightly declared.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of paradox, surrendering noise, and mistakes as teachers emerge from images and setting logic (the silent library, the mirrored book). The final insight reweights earlier motifs (staying while leaving becomes carrying grief into the world), and the closing tranquility resonates. Some lines tilt toward overt statement (“every mistake held a lesson”), softening subtext. Still, the core idea integrates cleanly with action and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—sacredness in the mundane; absolution through communal gesture even in solitude—emerges organically from repeated particulars (loaf, tea, vines, empty chair). The final image reweights earlier material without sermonizing. However, with low on‑page pressure, resonance tops out at contemplative rather than shattering, and occasional direct statements (“hidden sanctity”) brush the edge of telling. The emotional aftereffect is tender but not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory vs. oblivion, promises bound to light, and measurement as devotion cohere and culminate in the corridor-of-meaning image. However, the line “that memory, measured gently, could outlast oblivion” states the thesis outright, blunting subtext in the final paragraph. Subtle echoes elsewhere show the piece can trust its images. Resonant but partially explained.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Trust, time, and hush interweave through recurring objects and sound (lock crack, ticking fob), reweighted at the end. The wish “may the sound of trust never shatter again” edges toward statement, but the piece mostly earns its resonance through concrete actions and images. The final hush at sunrise and the warm fob pulse deliver a quiet, reflective answer without moralizing. Ambiguity about tomorrow’s “false starts” leaves a lingering, active question.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—technology harmonizing with ancient natural logics; knowledge as attunement—emerges through particular actions (tasting, mineral memory, spores) and resolves in a reweighted understanding (“they carry weather because they are attuned”). The final image bridges rites and circuitry without sermonizing. Ambiguity remains purposeful, inviting reflection beyond a tidy moral. Strong subtext in the vote/spore humidity micro‑politics enriching agency and responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of inescapable calling and transmuted sorrow develop organically through recurring images (light, lock, ink, aurora). The final vow reframes “auroral sorrow” as a sustaining charge rather than grief, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. Occasional on‑the‑nose phrasing (“testament to resolved callings”) edges toward thesis, slightly thinning subtext. Overall, the imagery carries the thematic weight without preachiness.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme is strongly woven through repeating particulars (plate’s glow, unheard bottles, vent tied to truth), culminating in a resonant conceptual answer. However, several lines state the moral outright (“candor in small moments could restore whole worlds”), reducing subtext. The best moments let image carry meaning (bottles of unheard speech vibrating). The closing insight is apt but edges toward sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—silence as instrument, motion translating truth, art preserving wonder—emerges organically from images. However, phrases like “symphonies of truth” and “Thus hope glistens” edge toward overt statement, softening subtext. The last image reweights the ritual (heartbeat that refuses darkness) effectively. Resonance lingers, though the moral contour is tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of transforming fear into a stabilizing, organic/machine harmony is enacted through the box’s reweighting from repository to seed. Recurring images (breathing wood, molten sky, compass‑petaled blooms) accrue and reprice meaning in the final placement under the vine. The piece avoids moralizing, opting for a non‑literal answer via image. Slight neatness keeps it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of attention, community memory, and healing emerge through the locket/mailbox ritual and the public exhibit. However, explicit statements (“listening truly healed”) veer toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The ending’s sea-echo is resonant, offering a non-literal answer, but complexity remains modest. More ambiguity or friction would deepen the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of “vulnerability as encoded strength” accrues through recurring objects (dice, crystal, journal) and culminates in a quiet, resonant repricing. Occasional direct restatements (“The act of liberate was not a loud explosion...”) risk over‑telling. Still, the ocean‑as‑web solidarity image gives a lingering, non‑didactic answer. Strong but bounded by modest on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thematic weave—grief, retrieval, and the material weight of memory—is organically carried by recurring objects (lantern, wildflowers, salt). The final repricing (“not lost, merely compressed”) resonates with the whale’s song and the chamber’s stabilization. One line states the thesis directly, slightly flattening subtext, but the imagery largely bears the meaning. The quiet ending earns its hush without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of enforced quiet, secrecy versus revelation, and binding earth to sky accrue through concrete motifs (origami wing, mapping silence, river of stars). The ending reweights earlier images without sermonizing: hush as earned stasis and living flame. Ambiguity lingers about the moral cost of keeping knowledge sealed, which enriches resonance. Slight neatness keeps it shy of higher tiers.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: negotiated fictions as protection, translation as intimacy, and listening over decoding. The seal’s “pact of agreed upon lies” is a potent thematic key, and the final reweighting—learning to hear heartbeats of walls—lingers. One sentence states the epiphany a touch directly, trimming mystery. Still, images do most of the work and subtext hums between trust and concealment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme integrates through recurring objects and timed images; isolation’s repricing into self-reliance is earned by the on-page ritual. Some lines verge on thesis statement (“translate isolation into independence”), softening subtext. The final image reweights prior motifs without outright moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of forgiveness, legacy, and the ethics of forgery accrue through actions (calibrated verses, refusal to weaponize) rather than lecture. The final image reweights “calibrated treason” into a hymn, which resonates. A small ding for the overt statement “I will forever unlink the shackles of expectation,” which edges toward thematic declaration. Overall, subtext rides image and object well.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.3)
    The piece’s images earn a resonant idea—echoes as living memories—embodied by her lament and the reconfigured shell. However, the text states the thesis explicitly (“people echo when their stories remain untold”), which trims the afterglow and edges toward moralizing. Subtext otherwise operates through the lattice and quartz light, with a charged final promise. Greater ambiguity or image‑led inference would heighten thematic sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of grief transmuted into collective hope and truth as careful weaving emerge organically through image chains (pine/salt scent, gull’s glass shard, compass spin). The ending reweights earlier motifs without stating a moral, offering a quiet answer: purity is reconstructed via shared fragments. Slight sentimentality (“illuminate countless other shattered dreams”) nudges toward neatness but doesn’t collapse complexity. Subtext runs through objects rather than declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coheres—labor unseen, attention as reverence—and the final image reaffirms rather than reweights. Some explicit statements (“He understood then…”) border on telling, trimming subtlety. The recurring objects do carry subtext, but the piece leans into a thesis more than an emergent argument. Resonance lingers, yet without a counter‑pressure or price the insight feels cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme coheres (stillness vs. comforting lies; perception over myth) and the orchard’s transformation supports it. The inscription states the thesis outright, reducing subtext at the climax. The final stewardship note hints at complexity but avoids a thornier moral calculus. Resonant but somewhat didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of repurposing darkness into hope and communal allegiance accrue through recurring images (shadows, mirrors, coils) rather than moralizing. The final sunrise forged from darkness conceptually reweights prior material. Some lines verge on stated thesis (“ancient shadows would be wielded as lanterns”), trimming subtlety. Still, the resonance is coherent and earned by motif.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of intergenerational transmission and redemption arises organically via objects and actions (bottled sounds, teaching the child). Some lines verge on on-the-nose thesis (“He knew that to sweeten the cold emptiness…”), slightly diluting subtext. The final image (“shared hymn,” jars singing) reweights earlier motifs with earned tenderness. Resonance lingers without requiring a spelled-out moral.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Science and spirit reconcile in action, not commentary: numbers and heartbeat align to remake grief as sound, culminating in a quiet absolution. Thematic throughline—protection vs. power, adaptation for mercy—emerges from particulars (copper threads transmitting only to ready listeners). A few phrases flirt with sentimentality (“last chance at redemption”), but the final image earns its lift. Ambiguity remains about wider consequences, in a good way.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coheres—waiting as revolution—and recurs through objects and images (moon paths, viaduct pulse). However, occasional thesis-forward lines (“the patient revolution was not a battle…”) verge on telling. The final mantra is evocative but slightly didactic. Subtext still blooms in the closing image of ice releasing and breath untying.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    Past–present entanglement, resistance, and institutional neglect cohere through the lantern, symbols, and the redirection of water. Subtext in objects and environment mostly carries the theme, though terms like “controlling influence” and “fortified vulnerability” verge on thesis-stating. The final image reweights prior motifs, offering a quiet, resonant answer without moralizing. Complexity is present but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of redemption and actioned contrition emerge organically from specific choices and objects, with the final beating heart reweighting earlier motifs. However, lines like “every heart… deserved a chance to restart” verge on explicit moralization, softening subtext. The “second opinion” motif neatly bridges ethics and mechanics. Resonance is earned but a shade didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of irreverent awe, transforming chaos into pattern, and pranking fate emerge organically from concrete acts (transliteration, inaudible bell, algorithm’s satisfaction). The ending offers a conceptual repricing—success is real even if unheard—and reframes longing as renewable propulsion. Subtext runs through object choices and tonal juxtapositions rather than moralizing. The resonance is strong but not searing due to the soft cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Memory, erasure, and presence-in-absence accrue organically through the numbers, patch, and sonic motif, culminating in “We are still here.” The lie as conduit for truth adds a worthwhile moral complexity. A few lines verge on tidy affirmation (“absence transformed into a quiet presence”), reducing ambiguity. Still, the final conceptual reframing resonates and reweights the earlier imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of empathy translated into action and shared breath emerge coherently from the process and final image. However, lines like “the true power lay not in the stone but in the willingness to listen” verge on moral statement, reducing subtext. The mirrored futures and ice‑spirit council provide rich, suggestive subtext. Emotional aftereffect lingers more from image than from a hard moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of acceptance, mortality, and communal solace arise organically from particulars (broken hulls, buoy ritual, the heirloom). However, the final moralizing line (“solace is not the absence of endings…”) states thesis outright, dulling subtext. Earlier images (pages turning, ice’s breath) do strong thematic work without explanation. The closing would benefit from trusting image over statement.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of destined mismatches transformed by patient attention is threaded through recurring images (tendrils, ash, ember, soil). Subtext works in the vines’ responses and the glowing edge, though phrases like “intersubjective understanding” verge on explicit statement. The final act reweights the material: love becomes nourishment, aligning his heart with the vineyard’s song. Resonance lingers without a didactic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of attention, consecration, and listening as sanctuary are coherent and seeded through concrete images (peripheral awareness, the clearing). However, explicit statements (“the true sanctuary lived not in stone or sand”) slide toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The final star‑pattern image resonates but does not fully reweight prior material with a new tension. Ambiguity exists, but complexity is cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of transmuting pain into beauty and memory as communal cartography emerge organically from the method and setting. Some lines verge on overt thesis (“We will transmute pain into a masterpiece”; the feather explanation) but remain grounded in scene. The final images (sunset on the smokestack, reflective map case) reweight the premise with a quiet, earned hope. Subtext sits in villagers’ tactile tracing of arcs and the feather’s ritualized use.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—language as living growth versus bound lexicon—emerges from particulars (glints as rings, crystal’s chorus) and culminates in the offering. A few near‑thesis lines (“not merely lexical but a living pulse of humanity”) edge toward tell, slightly flattening subtext. The final bridge/promise image resonates without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on memory, stewardship, and surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: echoes, aging as sound, memory as fog, and the shift from trapping to releasing. The closing insight (“not to trap it, but to let it ripple outward”) edges toward explicitness but is earned by preceding actions (recording, chalk line, slab inscription). Subtext operates in the way objects are treated as memory vessels. The resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs (escape velocity, leaf, luminous ache, constancy) resonate and reweight at the end, creating an elegy for discipline channeling chaos. The piece edges into explicit thesis in the final paragraph (“to harness the ephemeral, one must listen...”), muting subtext. Still, the closing repricing—ache to steady pulse—lands emotionally through image. Ambiguity remains in a productive way without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of transformation and wholeness‑from‑brokenness arise organically through the vinyl motif and the ritual’s cadence. However, explicit assertions like “endings are not loss but transformation” tip into stated moralizing, blunting subtext. The final image (shared fragments) resonates and reweights prior material. Emotional aftereffect is earned but slightly sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Loops, observation vs. revelation, and shadows as travelers cohere into a resonant answer image. Some explicit telling (“She realized…were not merely absence of light”) blunts subtext. The final cadence reweights prior motifs without moralizing, though complexity is modest. The theme lands, if a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs (constellations, cleft, tooth) braid into a coherent meditation on error, redemption, and belief. The final images reweight earlier material; the sky literally takes on her revised constellations. However, “Mistakes are not failures; they are the dark matter…” states the thesis directly, dulling subtext in the final third. The piece otherwise resists simplistic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme coheres around quiet stewardship, nonviolent illumination, and transformation of longing into communal calm. The motifs (sea glass, pearl, spiral) earn resonance at the end. However, the line “Thus she taught the world…” states the thesis overtly, tipping into moralizing and reducing subtext. The piece would be stronger if it trusted the final image without explanatory gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—grafting new meaning onto old wounds—emerges from particulars: stones in fissures, amber warming, code becoming lullabies. “Honeyed hush” evolves from breath to scent to tonal ethic, culminating in communal reverberation online. No sermonizing; resonance comes through image and action. A hint of sentimentality rounds edges, but the final image reweights the premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of art as ethical stewardship and defiance of convention emerges through particulars (cameos, current, ritual, shell guiding ink). The final image reweights prior motifs into a bridge of hopes and a return‑oriented poise, avoiding moralizing. Some lines verge on statement, yet the imagery carries the burden of meaning. The resonance is genuine, if more serene than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of memory-as-remedy and communal continuity emerges through ritual particulars and the reanimation of songs. The closing sections risk mild moralizing (“the remedy for loss lay not in steel or fire...”), which blunts subtext. Even so, the final vow and charged hush provide a resonant answer without overexplaining. Strong coherence, slightly didactic edges.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of patience, care-as-covenant, and mapping love/loss emerge through process and image (light veining the debris as routes). The final covenant realization coheres with prior particulars, but a line like “not a task but a covenant” edges toward stated thesis. Emotional aftereffect is tender and reflective without mawkishness. Greater reliance on implication over explicit naming would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme arises from concrete acts—craft, reflection, and collection—rather than sermonizing, and the final “library vs. prison” revalues the premise with felt gentleness. The piece invites reflection on preservation versus confinement, and on attention to the periphery as a way of knowing. A slight tendency to state insights risks over-clarity, but it remains character-grounded. The last image of starlight and recorded observation softly amplifies the theme without closing it down.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of transmuting burden into art/balance emerge organically from particulars (calcification into singing statues; feather of balance). The final promise risks mild moralizing (“orienting properly their own heart”) but it grows from the story’s method. The closing image reweights prior motifs into release and admiring constellations. Resonance is real, if slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thematic throughline—utility coexisting with reverence; grief as here‑and‑gone—emerges through image systems (steam, glass, amber). The final images resonate, but the explicit aphorism “loss can be a tool, not a trap” edges into moralizing, slightly flattening subtext. Otherwise, insight feels earned by the concrete making. The lantern as reweighted object effectively answers the story’s question without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of regret repurposed into responsibility and the revaluation of eroded ambition emerge from particulars (mist fragments, spiral, wheel, stilling lagoon). The final image conceptually reprices the premise: ambition becomes custodianship of stories, not spectacle. One line edges toward thesis (“I will carry these stories forward”) but is earned by the exchange and doesn’t flatten complexity. Subtext in the ghost’s brightening eyes and the lagoon’s applause sustains resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—engineering as ethical re‑navigation of abandoned systems—emerges through concrete acts (redirected flows) and charged objects (sextant) and culminates in the beacon. Some lines verge on direct statement (“to resurrect hope she must puzzle out new equations”), diluting subtext. Still, the spiral/curve at the end reweights prior motifs without moralizing. The transformation of carnival’s ephemera into infrastructure resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of time, memory, and reconciliation emerge organically from particulars (crystal numerals as memories; clock that counts love’s breaths). Recurring motifs reweight at the end (hush lifting, the sanctuary’s sigh), creating a resonant answer without a tidy moral. A few near‑platitudinous phrases (“a promise that time could heal”) slightly flatten the subtlety. Overall coherence and image‑led meaning remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Time, truth, and “architecture of lies” interweave through images (sundial, dawn, reflections) to produce a coherent theme. Several lines verge on thesis‑telling (“hindsight clarity was not merely a recollection, but a tool…”), softening subtext. The final image reweights prior motifs with quiet resonance. Greater ambiguity or consequence would deepen aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of preservation through patience and listening arises organically from knots/rope/fulgurite rituals and the quiet vow. A line like “He understood that preserving the ancient methods required not only memory but the willingness to listen eternally” edges toward telling, but it is supported by concrete acts. The fishermen’s offerings deepen communal resonance without sermonizing. The final readiness sign (master weaver’s spiral) reweights the earlier images with renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—healing through witness and naming absences—emerges organically from action and motifs (thread, statues, rose). The final commitment reframes obituary as waypoint rather than end, avoiding moralizing. Subtext works in the charged intimacy of projection and the “world holding its breath.” Slight sentiment creep is held in check by concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of reconciling invention with life arises from particulars (egg, gears, drip, phoenix) and culminates in a reweighted world. Some lines verge on moralizing (“the kingdom learned that beauty could be forged as surely as steel”), slightly flattening ambiguity. The final image still resonates and invites reflection. Subtextual echo between flawed genesis and personal flaw tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres—scars can sing when given a vessel that listens—and recurs through coin/music, thread/binding, and sand/fire. The dawn reprise offers a resonant answer without didactic explanation, though the phrase “scars can sing” approaches explicit thesis. Subtext of legacy, culpability, and communal revaluation is present in the villagers’ response. The piece earns its hope largely through image rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Belief tempered by patient defiance emerges organically through ritual action and the geese‑pause as temporal key. The final image of liberated lights forming constellations reweights earlier motifs with hope. A line like “even a skeptic can become a keeper of light” edges toward thematic articulation rather than leaving it fully in image. Overall resonance is strong, if slightly declared.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of inheritance, non‑destructive illumination, and memory/math as love cohere through recurring images. The final act (planting the gear; a new horizon rising) reweights the premise elegantly. However, the line “she understood that light could travel without fire” states the thesis outright, dulling subtext. The piece otherwise lets images carry meaning without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: grief as flow and communal tapestry rather than wound. Recurring motifs (butterflies, ribbons, water, poems) deepen and reconfigure at the end without explicit moralizing. The spectral mentorship folds tradition and craft into an ethic of care, creating resonance beyond the literal. Ambiguity is purposeful and invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of patient, ethical repair emerges through recurring images (inscriptions, tide, pendulum) and reweights at the end. Occasional moralizing edges in (“chorus of countless souls…”), slightly flattening subtext. The final pact image offers resonance without a neat moral. The idea of shared rhythm between human craft and sea carries real afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres: intention as shape, remembrance over punishment, seed over weapon. Recurring images (circle, case, tapestry threads) converge to reweight the premise at the end. However, several thesis-like declarations (“the shape of intentions was a circle... not a weapon but a seed”) tilt toward on-the-nose. Still, resonance lingers via the final tending image.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—embracing ignorance to innovate—integrates with motif and action, culminating in the “future written” reframing. Some lines edge into overt thesis (“true mastery lay in embracing what one does not know”), softening subtext. Still, the final image reweights earlier particulars with resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of recovery, communal memory, and art as conduit emerge organically from actions and images (dust learning to “speak,” scores as resurrection). The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, offering a quiet, resonant answer to famine with collective song. Subtext of authorship versus transmission (copyist as creator/conduit) operates beneath the surface. Complexity is present, though the piece favors grace over tension.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Recurring images (powder, shards, vanishing point, mirage of safety) accrue meaning and shift at the end, producing resonance. However, the line “true safety lives inside the brave act of feeling” states the theme overtly, dulling subtext at the final turn. The piece otherwise trusts image and act to carry meaning (lattice pulsing, honest light) and avoids sermonizing elsewhere. The aftereffect is bittersweet and coherent with the story’s question.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of plural truths versus dogma emerges through concrete particulars (sediment as archive, the cog bridging narratives) and lands in a reweighted final image. However, explicit thesis statements (“agonizing over a single truth is less fruitful…”) edge into moralizing, reducing subtext. The recurrent water/gear imagery does strong thematic work. Emotional resonance is thoughtful if slightly told-forward.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of reconciliation, communal art, and silence as medium emerge organically through repeated concrete images (rosette, velvet hush, leaves’ dance). Occasional direct statements (“art could survive even as the world tried to erase it”) flirt with telling but do not overwhelm the scene. The final image reweights prior motifs without a moral. Subtext lives in who is invited to voice (broken child, hoarse veteran) rather than declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of renewal via “gentle rebellion” arises organically from pruning, memory, and culinary ritual. Recurring images (broth as conduit; vines shedding; comet light) reweight meaning at the end. A couple of lines state the thesis a touch directly (“not a war of fire”), but they don’t collapse into sermonizing. Emotional aftereffect is quiet, lingering, and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Emergent theme—wonder revived through ritual and technology—ties neatly to “Echo” as the city’s returning voice. Recurring images (honeyed light, bells, drones) reweight at the end. A few explicit statements (“not a loss but a pause”) flatten subtext slightly. Overall resonance is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of attention, communal listening, and sanctification emerge organically through image and action. The “hush” reframes agency as careful noticing, culminating in a resonant final cadence. Occasional overt framing (“I realized… my role… was not simply to observe”) edges toward telling but doesn’t flatten the subtext. The emotional aftereffect is delicate and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme (nuance softening certainty) coheres through recurring images (ampoule veins, kelp choreography, animate‑lifeless paradox). However, it edges into telling—phrases like “declared its purpose fulfilled” and explicit moral framing reduce subtext. The final image resonates but leans on thesis statements rather than a fully charged implication. Still, the mosaic of revelations offers a reflective aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres: imperfection as stabilizer, missed chances as texture, confinement as catalyst. The chipped die’s arc reweights prior material without a stated moral, and the final image resonates beyond plot. A few lines verge on abstraction, but the images do the heavy lifting. The reframing from capture to honoring is earned and specific to the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of remembrance, gratitude, and the reclamation of “lost languages” emerge organically through image and action rather than thesis statements. The final bridge—Jiro’s rekindled memory—reweights the motif without moralizing, even though the notes urging smiles skate close. The moon/brush language evolves from craft to communal lexicon. Resonance lingers, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bread initials, lens, and thaw cohere into a theme of communal remembrance and embodied identity. However, the line “the true rescue lay not in preserving objects but in thawing hearts” states the thesis, softening subtext in the final stretch. The closing prism image restores resonance, but the moralizing nudge blunts complexity. Emotional aftereffect remains bittersweet and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of reversing fate through ingenuity and deconstructing the past are organically tied to objects and action (yoyo cipher, reverse‑engineering, latent radiance). The final repricing—light as guidance that “refused to surrender”—resonates without overt moralizing. Some sentences tilt toward thesis (“to initiate change…deconstruct the past”) which slightly reduces subtextual subtlety. Overall resonance lingers, if not with cutting ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of fear consuming its reflections and paradox as antidote recur in object and setting, culminating in the advisor’s final bargain. Resonance arises from images (rose, luminance, ink) rather than moralizing, though one line edges toward thesis (“the only way to unbosom fear…”). The last offer reframes power as curse with lingering cost. Complexity is present but not deeply personalized to Mara beyond the predicament.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme coheres (obstacles → instruments; art as transmutation) and recurs through concrete actions. However, the piece states its thesis outright several times, softening subtext and risking sermonizing. The ending offers a quiet, resonant answer—mission as ongoing practice—without a tidy moral. The emotional aftereffect is lyrical but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of listening versus calcification emerges organically through pattern languages, the rusted gate, and the watchers’ light. The ending reframes the expedition and the city’s flaw without sermonizing; the final vow resonates. Slight tidiness—sunwashed dread dissolving into resolve—reduces ambiguity’s sting. Subtext hums in the ritual whistle and the charged act of closing the mosaic.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme is coherent and threaded—noble lies as shield-turned-cage and the need to preserve hope while telling truth—linked to setting parallels. Subtext exists in the station’s decay mirroring falsified histories, but the piece states its thesis (“compassion could coexist with stark fact”) rather than letting image alone carry it. The final image is resonant but leans didactic. Complexity is acknowledged more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Memory versus oblivion and “interlaced absence” emerge through repeated concrete acts (notes, ink, ruins). The final vow and echoing images reweight the premise without stating a moral. Occasional abstractions flirt with overt symbolism, but the piece largely earns its resonance through particulars. The emotional aftereffect is contemplative and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of truth versus myth, preservation, and illumination are woven through recurrent images (lantern → buoys; stamp as seal and key). “Reclaimed stillness” evolves from mood to civic stance, offering a resonant answer without explicit moralizing. Some phrasing verges on stated thesis, but the final image largely earns its weight. Thematic complexity is present, if not dangerously ambivalent.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Grief’s metamorphosis into art/light is dramatized, not sermonized; the paradox of ascending/descending reframes memory’s cost. Recurring images (lantern, gem, cranes, shadow) return with altered weight at the end, offering an implicit answer: peace is partial, purchased through ongoing ritual. No moralizing intrudes; ambiguity lingers in the “comfort and accusation” aroma. The resonance is strong and coherent with the core concept.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: grief reconfigured into a disciplined openness to latent possibility. Recurring objects (geode, fissure, lattice) evolve in meaning and culminate in shards as “tiny suns.” One line states the thesis directly (“not a place but a state of being”), which trims subtlety. Nonetheless, resonance lingers via the constellation‑like coda.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    The story’s answer—belonging as a tunable frequency—emerges through image and action, but it’s also stated outright by the pilgrim, edging into moralizing. Recurring motifs (star trails, hum, brilliant dimness) build resonance and the final token quietly reweights earlier material. The insight feels gentle and sincere, if a touch tidy and risk‑averse. Subtext is present in the collaborative act but remains largely harmonious rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs (watch hand, terrace, sea, driftwood) converge to argue that authentic lineage/truth outweighs fabricated crowns. However, the explicit line “the weight of a withheld truth is heavier than any crown” tips into stated thesis, reducing subtext. The ending’s promise of honest dealings offers a resonant answer but leans neat over thorny. Still, the imagery carries real thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of atonement, hinge/turning, and earned mercy accumulate via box, names, and “Mistakes remembered, lessons kept.” Subtext surfaces in images (rope, pull-as-hinge) but the explicit moral line—“forgiveness is not a gift but a bridge built from honesty”—tips into sermonizing and flattens resonance. The final reprisal of the pull and cleared mist still lands, just less subtly. Complexity cedes to closure neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of acceptance vs. regret accrue through concrete images (wobbling/steadying compass, stars vs. utility poles) and culminate in a reweighted final image. Occasional explicit moralizing (“carry the memory of his regrets as lessons”) flattens subtext. The best moments let objects speak for the argument. A touch more ambiguity would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of empathy as salvific countercurrent emerges through objects and images (ball, mirror, lake), and the final repricing reframes the past as guidance. However, “Empathy is a seed” and other explicit statements slightly flatten subtext at key moments. The ending’s resonance survives, but the didactic note trims ambiguity. Imagery does much of the heavy lifting effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of rebirth, stewardship, and the cost of intimacy emerge organically from action and image. The final Earned Stasis—nightly offerings as a pact—reweights the premise without moralizing. Phoenix, moon, and spice motifs accrue rather than announce. Complexity persists: union requires partial self‑erasure (bark skin), resisting sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of mourning the not‑yet‑lived, repentance as atmospheric, and time’s recoverability are earned through concrete images (crack as sorrow-map; droplet as sunrise promise). The family hand-tracing custom deepens continuity and non‑literal “stitching.” The ending reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. A faint sentimentality glow remains, though it stays just shy of telling.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Compassion versus force, grief transformed into beginnings, and the ethics of pacifist action are integrated through repeated concrete acts (stitching as shadow work, joy altering gravity). The final image (crystal placed, door no longer required) offers a resonant answer without sermonizing. A few lines approach statement (“no force, only compassion”) but are dramatized enough to avoid moralizing drag. Thematic complexity lingers through the cost of leaving ghosts for a new garden.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Transformation vs. fate/coincidence emerges through concrete images (sparks carving patterns; the freed fireflies stitching sky). Some lines lean toward telling (“She understood that transformation…”) which slightly blunts subtext. Nonetheless, the final image reweights prior motifs without a didactic moral. Thematically coherent and emotionally honest.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    Light-without-flame and whisper-as-force motifs accrue into a theme of intellectual insurgency and communal awakening. The bronze quill’s shift from tool to ornament and the fort’s “pulse” reweight the premise without moralizing. Resonance is earned through image rather than thesis, though complexity is softened by the frictionless win. The afterimage lingers, if a bit comforted by elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: intentional design can coax rather than defy cosmic patterns; fate reframed as navigable rhythm. The curse‑to‑compass shift reweights prior images (borrowed dawn, promise) without moralizing. The final charged image—the rocks singing, a map for others—offers a resonant answer. A touch more ambiguity or consequence could deepen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres through objects and images (timer, storm, map/scars) culminating in a communal ritual of truth‑bearing. The final reframing—scars as terrain—is resonant and arises from prior particulars. A few lines verge on overt thesis (“not a wound to be healed...”) that slightly blunts subtext. Overall, the piece invites reflection without collapsing into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around transforming inquiry into path, with recurring motifs (overture, angles, needles) reweighted at the end. The closing mapping beats function as a non‑literal answer to the central question. Some lines verge on thesis‑statement repetition (“turn questions into destinations”), slightly diluting subtext. Still, the conceptual reframing resonates and avoids tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of rebuilding as resistance coheres through recurring objects (tin, seeds, shelves) and images (luminous fracture). Subtext in arranging books “by theme rather than code” quietly reframes power and order. Occasional declaratives (“promised to rebuild the shattered world”) approach moralizing but are outweighed by image‑led resonance. The ending reweights prior images without spelling a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of art versus time/fate cohere through particulars (clock, compasses, film splicing as composition). The ending reweights everything: the encore “rewrites” fate, compasses stabilize as stars, and the clock concedes a last tick, avoiding moralizing. Subtext of agency as craft—splicing reels like composing—threads cleanly into the pact with destiny. Resonance lingers without neat platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of testing myth against fact and the communal/individual braid are realized through the concrete act of translating dream symbols to “factual anchors.” The final image reweights prior material: luminous doubt becomes the engine of stewardship, not its negation. Occasional articulation (“She understood that…”) edges toward telling but doesn’t flatten resonance. The ending invites reflection without moral summation.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of remembrance, apology, and forgiveness emerge through concrete particulars (compass hue, tide‑like loops). The final repricing—“not a pigment but a feeling”—lands, though it flirts with stating the thesis. Recurring images (lace, tide, cerulean) accrue meaning and modulate at the end. Sentiment is kept in check by tactile ritual detail.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of gradual change and humility emerges organically from the central contrast between cosmology and biology. However, the story falters at the end by over-stating its thesis. The line, “The universe preprocesses reality through countless tiny disturbances, and here, a speck of wing dust joins the chorus,” acts as a thematic summary, a flaw penalized here for replacing resonance with explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding purpose in ruin is potent but is undermined by direct, on-the-nose statements. The story repeatedly tells the reader its theme, as in "...purpose lived not in grand gestures but in the quiet pauses where light lingered." This "thematic echo" in the final section replaces resonant imagery with a stated moral, significantly reducing the subtextual power that the strong setup had promised.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transforming trauma into art is potent and emerges organically from the central conceit. However, the story undermines its own subtext with thematic statements that feel like authorial summary. The line "her survival was more than staying afloat; it was about keeping the marvels of the world unshaken within her" is a direct thematic echo in the final third, which lessens the impact of the otherwise resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transforming grief and death into a sanctuary of memory is powerfully and consistently explored. The central metaphor of the distress signal is well-integrated, and the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the piece occasionally veers close to thematic summary, with lines like "revitalize the very concept of rest" slightly undermining the otherwise excellent use of subtext and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    The themes of solidarity and quiet resistance emerge organically from the story's setup, but the narrative voice undermines the subtext with explicit summary. The line "Each soft clang reminded the listeners that even under the harshest sanctions, a community could create its own lifeline" is a Thematic Echo that explains the story's moral, reducing the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of healing through compassion and conscious action emerges powerfully from the story's imagery and central conceit. The final image of glowing blossoms provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the piece is marred by an explicit thematic statement in the final third: "Milo understood that healing was not a single act but a continual revealing through breathing changes." This moment of telling undermines the otherwise potent subtext, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of time's fluid, tactile nature is explored with remarkable cohesion through image and event, not pronouncement. The central concepts—fading photographs, living architecture, non-Euclidean space—all serve this exploration without feeling like a checklist. The final image of the maze as a "reverie that quaked with the promise of endless discovery" is a potent, non-literal answer to the story's core inquiry, resisting a simple moral and leaving a lasting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of planting hope and breaking down barriers is coherent and well-supported by the central seed-planting metaphor. However, its delivery is heavy-handed, particularly when Mara explicitly decodes the 'wall' inscription, turning subtext into text. The final paragraph summarizes the theme directly ("sowing resilience where only dust had lived"), which preempts the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of memory and healing is potent but undermined by direct, summary statements in the final third. Lines like "memory itself is a forge" and "memory remains the bridge" function as thematic echo, explaining the story's meaning to the reader and violating the principle of earned resonance that the story otherwise builds so well.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of preserving fleeting moments is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The story culminates in a direct statement of its moral ("Lira realized the thief’s true calling..."), a "Thematic Echo" that replaces earned resonance with overt explanation. This significantly undermines the subtextual power of the otherwise evocative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of nurturing hope and purpose in the face of overwhelming crisis is woven skillfully through the central metaphor of glassblowing. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the repeated explicit use of phrases like "the thawing heart" and especially "weighty lightness" acts as a thematic label, slightly undermining the subtext by stating what the imagery already beautifully implies.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of vulnerability as power is coherent but lacks subtlety. It is repeatedly stated in thesis-like declarations, which undermines the power of the story's imagery. The final paragraph devolves into a summary of its own meaning ("every betrayal can be turned into a beacon"), a clear instance of a "Thematic Echo" that flattens resonance. While the final image of the reversed name in the stars is strong, it is weakened by the surrounding over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of knowing the unknowable is beautifully integrated, emerging organically from the central action. The final image of the map dissolving provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s core question without resorting to moralizing. The only minor weakness is the extremely high frequency of thematic keywords like "hush," which occasionally feels more like an incantation than subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of consciousness emerging from the mundane is woven seamlessly into the narrative. The final image of the janitor sweeping ice flecks that "might hide a lingering thought" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. A minor deduction is for the line, "It realized that to find where thoughts come from, it must amalgamate...", which functions as a slightly too-explicit thematic statement, briefly telling what the rest of the story shows.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of honesty and transparency is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of "show, don't tell." The story repeatedly states its own moral with phrases like "to thaw mistrust with transparency" and "honesty had freed them." The final paragraph provides a thematic summary, which reads like an authorial intrusion explaining the point rather than letting it resonate through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story beautifully explores themes of perseverance, decay, and recognition. The final image of the fountain is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the theme is occasionally undercut by statements that feel too explicit, bordering on moralizing. Phrases like "mended deception not by trickery but by honest labor" and "letting the garden see the value of humility" explain the theme rather than letting the events and images carry the full weight of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme is elegantly woven through recurring paradoxical imagery, but the story slightly undermines its own subtext with lines that summarize the outcome. The sentence "The experiment proved that..." is an explicit thematic statement that lessens the resonant power of the beautifully rendered preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of finding meaning in silence and listening to the past is potent and well-integrated. The final image provides a resonant conclusion, but the thematic core is slightly undercut by its explicit articulation. The line "the code was not a cipher of letters but a pattern of silences" is a direct statement that borders on a Thematic Echo, reducing the subtextual power that the images had already built so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme exploring the intersection of objective data and subjective feeling is masterfully woven into the central action of smudging a precise illustration to reveal a deeper truth. The story avoids moralizing, allowing the final image to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question. The theme is slightly over-articulated in the line "certainty is a brittle leaf," but this is a minor flaw in an otherwise subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of historical trauma and the burden of truth emerges organically from the story's unique premise, and the final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the resonance is slightly undercut by a sentence that borders on thematic statement: "He realized the beaded valve wheel was engineered to balance exactly that hidden mass..." This moment of telling over showing verges on explaining the central metaphor directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of renewal through silent witness is resonant, but its power is severely undercut by the story’s final thematic statement. The line "silence births renewal," written in the journal, functions as a direct authorial moral, violating the principle of emergent theme. This explicit declaration replaces the more powerful resonance that the final images would have otherwise provided on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of "ordinary magic" is handled with excessive directness, undermining potential for resonant subtext. The narrative explicitly defines the theme in the opening and reiterates it as a moral in the closing paragraphs ("reminding them that ordinary magic is always within reach"). This thematic moralizing replaces earned, emergent meaning with a simple, sentimental message, significantly reducing the story's literary sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of memory, loss, and realignment emerges organically from the story’s central investigation. It skillfully avoids didacticism, allowing the final image of the humming library to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The shift from "fracture" to "gentle turning" is a sophisticated thematic resolution that reweights the entire premise from one of apocalypse to one of quiet transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of "open secrets" and hidden truths is woven skillfully through the story’s central metaphors. The final image of distant strangers being "subtly rewired" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, a few phrases like "deliberately steering the flow of fate" verge on thematic summary, slightly undermining the subtext by stating the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of illuminating the unseen is integrated through the central metaphor of the single indigo hue. The final image, where this color exposes the "hidden assumptions" shackling a city, offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. While a few phrases like "to illuminate hidden assumptions" verge on direct statement, the thematic work is predominantly carried by powerful, earned imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of transforming painful memory into creative power emerges organically from every element. The final image of the lake offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final line of the last fortune cookie, "Your heart is the baton; the world is your score," is a thematic echo that explicitly states the story's thesis, undercutting the subtext and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the theme of radical self-acceptance is coherent, the story defeats its own potential for resonance by stating its thesis directly. The final sentence, "...to own every timeline, even the fractured ones, is to master oneself," is a sermonizing moral that replaces an earned, resonant image. This thematic echo in the final paragraph fatally undermines any subtext built through the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding feeling through unconventional means is developed powerfully through the central metaphor of the "mirrored hush." The final image is resonant, but the story's last few paragraphs slip into direct thematic summary. Lines like "the deaf music teacher proved that..." and the mention of her story inspiring others explicitly state the moral, undermining the subtext so carefully built earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of maintaining integrity in isolation is evident, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story repeatedly articulates its own themes in abstract statements like "honesty could survive even when the world shut its doors" and "her meticulous nature was not a cage but a compass." This direct moralizing, a form of "Thematic Echo," undermines the subtext and replaces earned resonance with overt summary, a significant flaw in a literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme is powerfully woven through the story’s central imagery of light, scent, and extinct life. The final image of the lantern gaining new meaning is a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story twice slips into direct thematic statements, such as "...knowing that grief could be transformed into a lantern of understanding," which slightly blunt the subtext by stating the moral overtly in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme is potent and well-integrated into the story’s imagery, particularly the rope. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the piece is weakened by thematic echo, especially in the final paragraphs which explicitly summarize the story's meaning ("every impossible choice he faced had been a thread in a larger tapestry..."), undermining the subtext built earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is woven through potent, recurring imagery. The final image powerfully reweights the concept of silence. However, the closing lines—"the unfinished was a canvas of endless light" and the explanation of the hush as "a space waiting to be filled"—verge on thematic summary, slightly undermining the subtext by stating the conclusion too explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of commodified emotion is potent and well-integrated into the premise. However, the story undermines its own subtext by resorting to direct thematic statements in the final third. Lines like "every half truth she sells is a bridge between raw insight and the empathy people think they have lost" function as an explicit moral, replacing the resonant ambiguity of the final image with an unnecessary explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "cycles of compassion" is present but delivered with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The final third of the story repeatedly states its own moral, such as "proving that cycles of compassion are the most reliable cargo any community can transport." This thematic moralizing replaces the resonance of the closing images with an explanation, significantly weakening its literary impact per the rubric's "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thematic development is the story's greatest strength, exploring belonging not as a destination but as a continuous, creative act. The central motifs—the woven tapestry, the expanding tag, the webs of kinship—all cohere beautifully. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. The only minor flaw is the final sentence, which slightly over-articulates the theme ("rewrite the language of belonging"), bordering on a thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    A coherent and resonant theme about the nature of time and creation emerges organically from the central images—the infinity symbol, the interrupted cadence, the final vortex. While a few lines verge on stating the theme directly ("She realized..."), the final image of the sketchbook filled with the "sound of time" provides a powerful, non-literal conclusion that recharges the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story thoughtfully explores its theme of transforming grief into growth. The final image of the luminous petals provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the theme's delivery is undermined by moments of over-explicitness, such as when the conjurer "realized that the ambiguous loss was not an absence but a transformation." This direct thematic statement partially deflates the subtextual power built by the imagery, verging on a moral summary just before the climactic action.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the theme of acknowledging forgotten stories is coherent, its delivery lacks subtlety. The narrative repeatedly explains its own meaning through direct statements in Maren's interiority, functioning as a thematic echo. The line, "She realized that... she could become a conduit for those silent pleas," is a direct summary of the theme, replacing earned resonance at a key moment with bald assertion, which significantly diminishes the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of sustainable change through releasing control is clear and central, but it is stated too explicitly and repeatedly. The final paragraph, in particular, reads like a moral summary ("sustainable growth thrives on letting nature reconstruct by releasing control"), which undermines the resonant power of the preceding imagery by explaining what should have been left to subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of art as a medium for exchange and memory is powerfully developed through imagery. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements. The sentence "...the true compass was her own wryly earnest pursuit of meaning amid ruin" is a prime example of a "thematic echo," explaining the story's meaning to the reader instead of letting the events and images resonate on their own, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of embracing unpredictability emerges organically at first, but the story undermines its own subtext with heavy-handed, declarative statements in the second half. The final two paragraphs function as an explicit moral, particularly the line "...reminding all who hear that even the darkest tunnels can shine," which flattens the resonance into a simple lesson. This direct summary of the theme is a significant flaw for this literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of collective memory and finding meaning in fragments is beautifully woven through the story's central imagery, particularly the valve's changing purpose. The final image of the archivist setting out on a new quest provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the nature of his work. The piece avoids easy moralizing, suggesting meaning-making is an endless, active pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of discovering and preserving hidden, silent narratives is woven beautifully through the story’s central conceit. The final image of the ledger containing "maps of thoughts never spoken" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central quest. The final paragraph veers slightly toward explicit thematic statement ("she would map every hidden line..."), which slightly tempers the otherwise masterful use of subtext and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of reconciling doubt and wonder emerges powerfully from the story’s core conceit. However, the resonance is slightly flattened by moments of thematic summary, particularly in the final third. The line "she had turned skepticism into a bridge of courage, kindness, and shared memory" explains the theme directly rather than letting the final image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of redefining "goodbye" is central and well-integrated into the plot mechanics. The final image of the immortal stepping forward offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the theme is explicitly stated by the twin ("When we say goodbye, the world does not end..."), a thematic echo that lessens the impact of the otherwise subtle conclusion by replacing discovery with declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of dissolving rigidity to achieve fairness is potent and well-integrated into the central metaphor. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic statement. The sentence beginning “She understood that the fairness she sought…” acts as a direct authorial explanation, a thematic echo that lessens the resonance of the final, more powerful image of the dissolving bureaucratic walls. This directness prevents the theme from emerging purely through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through the story’s central images, culminating in a resonant final paragraph. The idea of stories as "bridges" is powerful, but the on-page declaration "invented histories were not lies but bridges" verges on a direct thematic statement. This moment of telling, rather than showing, slightly diminishes the subtextual power that is otherwise handled with remarkable grace.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    The themes of memory, identity, and the validity of unrecorded histories are woven together with subtlety and power. The central metaphor of layering and filtering reality is sustained throughout, culminating in a final image that offers a complex, non-didactic answer to the story's central questions. The piece achieves a powerful emotional aftereffect by framing the acceptance of a marginal identity as a profound act of preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme is potent but its delivery is undermined by a critical flaw at the climax. The line, "The answer unfolded: the riddle was not a puzzle to solve but a reminder that myths survive when retold..." is an explicit thematic statement that replaces resonance with summary. This moment of telling, rather than showing, significantly blunts the emotional and intellectual aftereffect by removing all ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story's theme of community resistance to corporate gentrification is coherent, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The final two paragraphs devolve into direct thematic statements, explaining the meaning of the stone chip and summarizing Mira's journey ("a reminder that even the smallest piece can anchor an entire community"). This explicit moralizing replaces earned resonance, telling the reader the story's message instead of allowing it to emerge from the preceding images and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of memory, loss, and preservation is potent and well-integrated into the central action. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit statements. The inspector’s whispered speech to the summit ("May the grain’s story travel farther...") and the final paragraph's summary function as Thematic Echoes, stating the story's meaning rather than allowing the final image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of finding vision beyond sight is beautifully developed through character action and imagery for most of the story. However, the final paragraph falters by articulating its theme too directly. The line "...each repaired wing was a promise to the world outside the mist, a bridge between broken things and new horizons" is a thematic echo that summarizes the story's meaning, slightly undermining the resonant power of the final image by stating what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of origins—geographic, mythic, and elemental—emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery. The final image of a single vein of water is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the line "...a reminder that every river is born from ice, and ice is born from silence" borders on an overt thematic statement, slightly undermining the subtext by explaining the metaphor too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of renewal through harmony and intention emerges organically from the story's central magical conceit. The narrative avoids didacticism, allowing the final image of the revived town to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how a broken world is mended. The recurrence of rhythm, balance, and sound is woven effectively throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of sacrificing personal hope for a collective good is present but delivered with a heavy hand. The story resorts to thematic echo, explicitly stating its concepts ("unsnarl fear," "harness the ephemeral") instead of letting them emerge from action. The final paragraph functions as a moral summary, explaining the legend rather than allowing the final image of the ritual to resonate on its own terms.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transforming a flawed legacy into a guiding truth is well-integrated and avoids a simplistic moral. However, a few lines, like "every warning is a thread, not a wall," veer close to explicit thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise resonant subtext. The final image of the lighthouse as a beacon is powerful, if a touch heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The themes of debt, memory, and transformative sacrifice are woven beautifully through imagery, culminating in the complex feeling of "mournful elation." The final image of the blooming orchard is a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The score is tempered by the final two sentences, which veer into direct thematic summary ("her presence a reminder that debts...could be repaid"), slightly undermining the otherwise powerful resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of renewal through art is coherent and integrated into the story’s core action. However, the execution is hampered by overt thematic statements, such as defining the weaver's purpose "to carve a path from ruin to reverence." The final paragraphs in particular shift from resonant imagery to explicit moralizing, which tells the reader the theme directly instead of allowing it to emerge from the preceding action, a significant flaw under the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of mending fractured heritage through patient restoration emerges organically from the central action. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final paragraphs by explicitly stating its conclusions, such as "faith, once fractured, could be mended through patient wandering." This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is handled with a heavy hand, undermining the story's literary potential. Key thematic statements like "to discover meaning in the margins" and "the margins held the most luminous stories" are delivered directly to the reader. This explicit moralizing replaces the resonant ambiguity expected at this level, turning a potentially subtle piece into a thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of unheard truths finding a voice emerges organically from the central metaphor of stitching light. The final image of the "stitched sky" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core inquiry. However, the final paragraph dips into overt thematic summary with lines like "unraveling conspiracies required not only sharp eyes but a heart that listened..." and the authorial "History would remember...", which slightly lessens the impact by stating what was already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of release and the nature of apology emerges well from the imagery. However, the story twice slips into direct thematic statement, bordering on Thematic Echo. The line, "she understood the apology had never needed words, only the act of evoking truth," replaces resonant implication with an explicit moral, slightly undermining the power of the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of grafting new meaning onto trauma is developed with sophisticated imagery, particularly the recurring brain coral motif. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The score is slightly tempered by moments where the theme is stated too directly, such as the explicit declaration of the translator's motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of art conquering sorrow is handled with extreme didacticism. Key thematic statements are repeated throughout, culminating in a final, moralizing whisper. This heavy-handed approach replaces subtext and earned insight with direct summary, as seen in "She realized the true power of her craft was not merely to illuminate walls, but to illuminate hearts," which severely undermines the story's literary potential.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of choosing curiosity over certainty is coherent but executed with a heavy hand. The narrative repeatedly states its theme directly (e.g., "to exchange certainty for curiosity meant letting the familiar murals dissolve"), a thematic echo that undermines subtlety. This direct moralizing, especially in the latter half, replaces earned resonance with overt explanation, significantly weakening the piece's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of intellectual freedom versus systemic control emerges powerfully through the story's central conceits of guerrilla gardening and secret languages. The final image of the greenhouse as a "living archive" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without resorting to moralizing. Subtext is rich, particularly in the contrast between sterile bureaucracy and chaotic, organic life.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of art's power to transfigure suffering emerges organically from the central conceit. The final image of the shell as a library and the song living on is resonant, avoiding a simple moral. However, the theme is occasionally stated too explicitly (e.g., "His singular mission was to photosynthesize pain into beauty"), and the final sentence summarizing the legacy feels slightly less potent than the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of memory, purpose, and the nature of sorrow is handled with subtlety and depth. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the central ritual and the final interaction. The closing image of the caretaker resuming her work offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, affirming that meaning is found not in finality but in devoted, cyclical practice.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of renewing a "pact of memory" after silence is beautifully integrated into the story's core actions and imagery. However, the story occasionally veers into direct thematic statement, notably with the line, "Elara recognized that the covenant was the promise... a broken trust." This moment of telling slightly undermines the otherwise powerful subtext, functioning as a thematic echo that lessens the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is overly articulated through repeated, abstract labels like "encrypted compassion" and "shared empathy." Instead of emerging organically, the core ideas are stated directly, culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the moral. This explicit "thematic echo," especially the line about the "ongoing encrypted compassion," replaces resonant imagery with didactic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory and reinvention emerges organically from the story's unique imagery. However, the final paragraphs drift toward thematic summary with lines like "reinvention does not erase, but layers" and "a testament that balance and memory can coexist." This direct explanation slightly dilutes the resonance of the otherwise powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of thresholds and "necessary distances" is beautifully and subtly woven throughout the narrative using powerful imagery. However, the final paragraph lapses into direct thematic statement, explicitly telling the reader the moral: “the true distance one must travel is the space between wonder and understanding.” This thematic summary undermines the resonant, image-driven work that preceded it, weakening an otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of belonging is woven effectively through imagery connecting the sea and stars, until the final paragraph. The line "the luminous respite... was the soft engine that powered the cosmos of belonging" is a critical flaw, a thematic summary that explains the magic rather than letting it resonate. This direct statement severely undermines the otherwise subtle and emergent thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory's connection to emotional resonance is masterfully woven into every element, from the crater glass's function to the final realization. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question through the final image of the restored bridge. The concept that paths aren't lost but await the right feeling is a sophisticated thematic payoff that elevates the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story's greatest weakness is its tendency to state its theme directly, undermining the power of its own imagery. The line "I aim to serenade monotony with creativity," repeated near the end, is a critical flaw ("Thematic Echo") that feels like authorial explanation. This robs the otherwise resonant actions of their subtextual power, telling the reader what to think instead of allowing them to feel it.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of solitude transforming into universal connection is developed with grace through powerful imagery. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with an overly explicit thematic statement near the end: "She understood now that the gaps she observed were not empty, but filled with possibilities." This moment of direct summary slightly diminishes the power of the resonant final image by stating what was already beautifully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of finding value in the mundane is the story's entire focus, but it is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The narrative explicitly states its purpose multiple times, as when Mira "reminded herself that the purpose of this ritual was to illuminate value in the mundane." This thematic moralizing, especially in the closing paragraphs, replaces subtext with summary and prevents the theme from resonating organically from the story's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transforming pain into communal healing is powerfully integrated through the central metaphor of the box. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final act. The line, "the true bargain had never been about buying innocence, but about gifting it back through honest reflection," is a thematic echo that explicitly states the moral, reducing the resonant ambiguity to a neat summary.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme exploring the intersection of logic, art, and collective belief is powerful and well-integrated for most of the story. The central metaphor of the gauge as a mirror for hope is earned. However, the final paragraph lapses into overt thematic statement ("the mathematics of hope were etched into the world itself"), a form of moralizing that replaces the resonant ambiguity of the preceding images with a less compelling, definitive answer.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of shared memory emerges organically from the story's central conceit and imagery, particularly the film negative. The piece achieves a resonant emotional aftereffect. However, the final line—"...the true map was not of corridors, but of the collective imagination"—borders on a "thematic echo," explicitly stating the story's moral rather than allowing the final image to convey it entirely through subtext, which slightly undermines the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of art creating possibility is potent, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story culminates in a direct thematic statement: "possibilities are merely reflections waiting for a borrowed heartbeat to awaken them." This functions as a "Thematic Echo," a concluding moral that replaces the resonance of the final image with an explicit explanation, significantly undermining its subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is undermined by constant, direct statements that preempt any emergent discovery for the reader. Phrases like "the price of redemption was not a coin but a willingness" and "the true cost was not in the ink but in the willingness" function as thematic moralizing, replacing subtext with a summary. The final paragraph explicitly restates the theme, a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of creating beauty from cruelty ("fractured grace") emerges organically from the story's central conceit. The final image powerfully resonates with this idea. However, the final two paragraphs engage in some thematic summary ("a reminder that even a manufactured drought could not erase the song," "...a reminder that even in a world of engineered scarcity, a single act of release could carve a song from silence"), slightly overstating the theme instead of letting the images do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of art as a catalyst for social awakening emerges organically from the story’s central conceit and imagery. The re-framing of the "harvest of echoes" from a legend into a symphony of individual voices is a masterful thematic turn. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding moralizing entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the theme is potent and well-integrated into the story’s imagery, its delivery is ultimately too explicit. The final paragraph devolves into a direct summary of the story's meaning ("turned her ink into questions, her campfire stick into a lantern of ethical wonder..."), a "Thematic Echo" that undermines the subtext built by the preceding scene. This overt moralizing prevents the theme from resonating with the complexity it otherwise earns.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic development is exceptional. The core idea of honoring transient life through ephemeral acts emerges organically from the contrast between stone monuments and Lira’s glowing, temporary structures. The story’s final image of the knots glowing like constellations is a powerful, non-literal resolution to the central question, achieving a profound resonance without a single word of direct moralizing. This is the story's greatest strength.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of memory as a living, thawing force emerges powerfully from the central conceit. The final image of the living library is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the score is capped by a moment of thematic overstatement in the final third: "Mara understood that preserving the sound of forgotten names was not merely archival—it was a living conduit," which explains the theme directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story develops a coherent theme about the renewing power of curiosity and the living relationship between past, future, and traveler. However, the final paragraph slightly undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its conclusion: "...paths do not merely lead; they listen, they decide...". This thematic summary feels like an unnecessary moral, reducing the resonance of what was otherwise a powerful closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of marrying empirical calculation with mythic devotion is present but delivered with a heavy hand. The final paragraph contains a clear "Thematic Echo" that summarizes the story's point: "...a quiet testament that even the most empirically ironic calculations can uncloak devotion...". This direct statement undermines the resonance built through imagery, turning an emergent theme into a stated moral and significantly weakening the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of non-violent change and releasing resentment is powerfully integrated into the central magical conceit. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its thesis in the final third: "her pacifist philosophy proved that the most potent weapons were the subtle shifts of grace..." This thematic moralizing replaces the resonance of the scene with a summary, significantly weakening the ending's impact by telling the reader what to think.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of erasing boundaries is conceptually strong and well-integrated into the plot's magical logic. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its theme multiple times. The line "Arlen understood that erasing boundaries was not the removal of lines, but the weaving together of separate songs" functions as a summary that lessens the reader's work of discovery and damages the piece’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of renewal from brokenness is skillfully woven through recurring motifs of mending, deciduous cycles, and generational wisdom. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its theme directly, particularly in the dialogue with Mira about leaves nourishing roots and the final sentence. This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the resonance earned through image and action by providing a too-neat summary for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the theme is conceptually rich, its delivery is severely undercut by the final paragraph. The line "knowledge is a garden that grows in loops, and the only way to harvest it is to tend the soil of one’s bewilderment" functions as an explicit moral, a "Thematic Echo" that summarizes the story's point instead of letting it resonate through images. This direct statement replaces the powerful ambiguity of the preceding scenes with a tidy, aphoristic conclusion, flattening the piece's complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of listening to silence and valuing "unlearned lessons" emerges organically from the plot mechanics and recurring imagery. The central motif of the "unheard symphony" is beautifully woven throughout, connecting the store, the fungi, and the final revelation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer by having the scrolls teach how to listen, a conceptual repricing that deepens the premise without ever stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story develops a coherent and resonant theme about the liberating power of stories. Key motifs are used effectively and reweighted at the conclusion. The final image of the ship sailing toward a "horizon stitched with letters" is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question, though its power is slightly diluted by a preceding, near-explicit statement of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of "absence" shaping reality is potent and well-integrated into the plot's core mystery. However, the story undermines its own subtext through over-explanation. Lines like "...the lesson that absence can be harnessed" and the direct whispering of the fables' meaning shift from showing to telling, functioning as thematic summaries that weaken the resonant power of the final image by stating its moral explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central theme exploring quiet as a balance rather than an absence is compelling, and the final images resonate with this idea. However, the story undermines its own subtext with the line, "He understood that the quiet he sought was not the absence of sound, but the balance between echo and silence." This direct thematic statement feels unearned and robs the ending of its potential for more profound, implicit resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers significantly from a lack of subtext, stating its themes directly and repeatedly. Lines like "pattern and purpose walk hand in hand" and "fractured things can become whole when purpose aligns with the heavens" function as thematic summaries, replacing earned resonance with overt moralizing. This heavy-handedness critically undermines the narrative's potential for subtlety and intellectual engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    A complex theme regarding the construction of identity from collective memory emerges powerfully from the central conceits of light, shadow, and resonance. The final image provides a non-literal, resonant answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by a few instances of thematic echo, such as the direct statement of motivation ("to sculpt identity from experience"), which feel less organically emergent than the surrounding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the theme emerges powerfully through the central imagery, the story falters by explicitly stating its meaning in the final third. The line "to filter despair through art, to let hope sparkle in darkness" is a critical misstep, functioning as a thematic label that preempts reader discovery. This overt moralizing significantly flattens the piece's resonant potential, replacing subtext with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of time, transition, and perception emerges organically from the central images of the tide and the cicada. The story builds resonance effectively until the final paragraphs, where it unfortunately spells out its own meaning. Lines like "time is not a line but a sea" and the explicit need "to listen to the quiet pauses" are thematic summaries that undermine the subtext built so carefully throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding vastness within confinement is beautifully integrated through imagery and action. However, the final paragraph contains a significant thematic echo in the mother's thought: "...a cramped space could hold the vastness of a sky, provided one learned to stretch the contracted heart." This direct statement of the story's moral slightly undermines the otherwise powerful subtext, replacing earned resonance with explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of actively cultivating inner peace is resonant, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story repeatedly states its own thesis, such as "Lira’s motivation was clear: to teach silence how to comfort..." This thematic echo replaces subtext with direct summary, undermining the power of the otherwise potent imagery. The final paragraph contains another explicit instruction ("Listen, and let quiet become your guide"), which feels like a moral rather than an earned, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme exploring the integration of past (memory, nature) and future (data, technology) emerges effectively from the story's central imagery. The final image of the roots and data streams is resonant. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final paragraphs by resorting to explicit thematic statements, such as identifying the stairway as "a bridge between memory and possibility." This direct summary violates the "Thematic Echo" rule, reducing the earned resonance of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of renewal through sacrifice and connection through shared wounds emerges organically from the story’s central symbolic actions. The final image of the ring left as a relic for others provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of isolation. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its own themes too directly, as with the motivation "to teach the suffocating darkness to breathe," which verges on a thematic label rather than a dramatized goal.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of transforming pressure into brilliance emerges organically from the story's core conceit and imagery for most of its length. However, the final paragraph succumbs to overt moralizing, explicitly stating the theme multiple times ("the pressure of truth would always spawn brilliance," "...turned the abstract weight of my former debts into a literal sparkle"). This thematic echo severely undermines the resonance of the final image by refusing to trust the reader, a significant flaw for this tier of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transforming silence into eloquence is potent, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the moral: "ending a line was not about destruction, but about transforming silence into a new kind of eloquence." This thematic echo replaces the resonance of the final image with a direct statement, undermining the subtext carefully built through the story's atmosphere and recurring motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of allegiance transforming from a solitary burden to a creative, connective force emerges organically from the plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the knight's quest. However, the score is tempered by the repetitive use of key phrases like "murmured allegiance" and "shape of possibility," which occasionally feel like thematic labels or prompt-echoes rather than purely emergent concepts, slightly undermining the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of honoring small kindnesses and forgotten lives is potent but is undermined by overt statement. The story repeatedly tells the reader its meaning, culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the theme directly ("knowing that her work...could turn a single button into a beacon"). Filing a report under 'Acts of Compassion' is a particularly on-the-nose moment that replaces resonant subtext with a neat label.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thematic handling is sophisticated and evocative, exploring resistance and memory through a powerful central metaphor of water and reflection. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question in the final image of the lagoon as a "living chart." The concept of "revised histories" is fully integrated into the plot's core action.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of silence as an active, creative force that counters destructive sound emerges organically from the central conceit. Motifs like the "vested hush" and "negative space" are consistently developed. The ending avoids a simple moral, offering a resonant image of quiet vigilance that lingers with purposeful ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of communion between humanity and nature through diligent, respectful attention emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the monument beacon is resonant. However, the final paragraphs verge on overstating the theme with phrases like "the prophecy of renewal fulfilled itself" and "forever a bridge between root and sky," slightly weakening the power of the subtext by making it explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty is clear and central, but its delivery is heavy-handed, violating the principle of showing over telling. The inscription, ‘When the tides of certainty wane, let uncertainty guide the heart of invention,’ functions as a direct thesis statement. This thematic moralizing in the climax and the summarizing final paragraph significantly flattens the resonance that the story’s potent imagery otherwise builds.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of redemption through repairing brokenness is powerfully integrated into the central kintsugi metaphor. However, the story undermines its own subtext by resorting to explicit thematic statements. The final paragraph’s declaration that “even broken things could be redeemed” is a critical flaw, stating the moral directly instead of allowing it to resonate through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of healing through the integration of joy and sorrow is potent and emerges organically from the imagery. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its thesis in the final third: "She understood her purpose: to pursue the broken whispers... and to integrate laughter into their healing." This moment of thematic summary undercuts the otherwise resonant, image-driven conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of mercy born from remembered suffering is potent and well-integrated. However, the story undermines its own resonance by explicitly stating its thesis in the final paragraphs. Lines like "She realized that to calculate mercy she must first remember the pain" and "the true ultraviolet penance was not the forest’s light, but the willingness to brace oneself" function as thematic summaries, diluting the power of the preceding symbolic journey.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of memory as a living beacon is beautifully integrated through the central lighthouse motif. The final image powerfully resonates without stating a moral. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with lines like "I realize that time itself is a series of anchors," which verge on explaining the theme directly to the reader rather than letting the resonant images do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding truth and connection through perceived flaws ("cracks in the façade") is potent and well-integrated, culminating in the protagonist’s personal transformation. The story successfully develops this theme through its central imagery and plot. The final paragraph risks over-stating the theme—"realizing that the cracks... were not flaws but frames"—moving from resonant subtext toward direct summary.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding wonder by breaking flawed perfection emerges organically from the central metaphor. The final image of the reconfigured library offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the resonance is slightly undermined by lines that verge on direct thematic statement, such as "...even perfect systems can be broken to reveal true wonder," which hedges toward telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story achieves a powerful thematic resonance, exploring the transformation of conflict into creation and the reframing of failure. The central image of the shard's light weaving new myths is a potent, non-literal answer to the story's questions. The final lines, balancing "loss and creation," avoid a simplistic moral and leave a lingering, complex emotional aftereffect that feels earned by the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of truth's restorative power versus dishonesty's decay is elegantly woven through the story's core concepts. Unfortunately, the final paragraph abandons resonant imagery in favor of an explicit thematic statement ("as long as honest hands tended the rust and truth was spoken, the light would never again be stolen..."). This "thematic echo" over-explains the point and significantly weakens the otherwise strong conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of surrendering to mystery over explanation emerges organically from the story’s events and imagery. The final image of Mara facing a new storm is a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial quest. However, the line "She understood that the place where explanations fail was not a location but a state of quiet surrender" borders on an explicit thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext and costing it a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story suffers from severe thematic echo, repeatedly stating its core ideas verbatim ("scaffold complexity with simplicity," "through layered meanings," "timewoven alliances"). This heavy-handedness preempts any emergent discovery for the reader, turning the narrative into a demonstration of a thesis. While the final images are resonant, their power is significantly undercut by the constant authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of dialogue between darkness and light emerges organically from the story's imagery, particularly the night flowers and amber light. However, the final paragraphs undermine this subtlety by explicitly stating the theme. Lines like "the world's night bloom is a promise whispered" and "the dawning hush was not silence but a promise" function as thematic moralizing, a critical flaw that replaces earned resonance with direct summary.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story explores its themes of historical truth, memory, and suppression with grace and power. The central concept is beautifully integrated, and the motifs of sand, sky, and light/sound build to a powerful conclusion. The final image of the broadcast cracking the desert's silence is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any overt moralizing and leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of memory as a creative, truthful force is thoughtfully developed. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its morals in the final paragraphs. Lines like "the past could be a tool, not a chain" and "comfort lies in truth" function as authorial summary, replacing the resonance of the final image with a less powerful thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of cyclical history, memory, and preservation emerges organically from the story's particulars without ever being stated. The central idea of an "accidental prophecy" being repurposed into a promise is a sophisticated thematic turn. The final image of the "loop of prophecy and preservation" offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion that beautifully recharges every element that came before it.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The themes of cyclical time, inheritance, and the union of opposites (frost/flame) emerge organically from the story's imagery. The final image is resonant, but the final paragraph veers close to summarizing the theme. The line "...taught her that borrowed time could be felt, cultivated, and returned" is a thematic statement that slightly diminishes the power of the preceding scene work by explaining what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of "favoring listening over noise" is powerfully integrated into the core action. The resolution provides a resonant answer to the central thematic question. However, the story leans into direct thematic statements in the final paragraph, such as "a quiet rebellion against the ever-growing clamor of the world," which slightly undermines the subtlety established earlier and veers close to summarizing its own moral.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story's theme is potent but lacks subtlety, which is its most significant flaw. Phrases like "vulnerability could sprout into quiet strength" and the final "feeling vulnerability turn to a quiet fire within" function as direct thematic statements rather than emergent truths. While the imagery is resonant, these moments of telling undercut the subtext, verging on providing a moral to the story instead of allowing the final image to carry the weight of meaning alone.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is the story's core strength, emerging organically from a potent constellation of images: the silent ghosts, the sealed box, and the memory of bees. The final image of the amber tear provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about promises and silence. It masterfully avoids didacticism in favor of complex, lingering feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of time and memory being a shared, mendable construct emerges organically from the story's central images—the urn fragment, the silo, and the final lattice of villager notes. The ending resists a simple moral, offering a resonant image of communal storytelling. The final sentence, however, veers close to summarizing the theme ("...a tapestry she could walk through... forever") rather than letting the powerful preceding images carry the full weight of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The narrative repeatedly states its thesis, culminating in summative lines like "true art was never a finished picture" and "discovering beauty in the incomplete was a gentle rebellion." This thematic moralizing, especially in the final third, replaces resonant imagery with overt explanation, triggering a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of interspecies harmony is clear and integrated into the story's imagery. However, the ending shifts from showing to telling. Mara's whispered summary of the "secret" and the final paragraph's moralizing statement ("the island breathed as one organism") replace resonant imagery with direct explanation, a classic thematic echo that lessens the piece's subtlety and power.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of inquiry versus awe is integrated well into the plot, and the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the story verges on over-articulating its own theme in the final third. Lines like "home was not a place but a pattern of returning" function as a thematic summary, slightly reducing the power of the subtext by stating what the images had already implied.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of renewal is beautifully developed through layered imagery, culminating in the resonant motif of "narrow vastness." However, the final third of the story slightly undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its themes. Lines like "...the garden’s reclamation proved that life could rise even from the deepest silence" function as thematic summaries, a minor but noticeable flaw that lessens the impact of an otherwise masterful thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    A powerful theme of memory and connection emerges organically from the central premise. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The score is held back by the explicit and repeated thematic statement, "to translate distance into closeness," which verges on telling the reader the theme directly rather than trusting the subtext and imagery to carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of navigating by memory and hope in the wake of collapse is potent and well-integrated through the central motifs of the compass and star-sketching. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic summary. The line "I turned my pariah status into a blessed pilgrimage... because I had learned that every stretched moment held a compass awaiting its own revelation" is a critical instance of Thematic Echo in the final third, replacing earned resonance with a stated moral and weakening an otherwise strong ending.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    An intriguing theme of amending the past emerges organically from the central action, but the final paragraphs undermine this by resorting to direct statement. Lines like "he understood that his role was not merely... a bridge" and "wonder never sleeps" function as explicit moralizing. This "Thematic Echo" flattens the earned resonance of the preceding imagery, replacing subtext with a tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.4)
    This is the story's most outstanding feature. The theme of valuing small, unrecorded histories emerges organically from the central metaphor of the missing pawns. The narrative avoids any moralizing, instead offering a final resonant image of the scroll as a "quiet compass for any ruler." The story's subtextual richness and refusal of a simplistic resolution are hallmarks of exceptional thematic craft.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of home as an internal, resonant state emerges organically from the story's central images—the stone, the feather, the breathing mountain. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Lira's quest without resorting to a stated moral. The concept of language being "maps of feeling" is a powerful subtext that enriches the climax, transforming her understanding rather than simply providing a solution.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of forgiveness as a complex process is powerfully integrated through the chess and labyrinth metaphors. However, the story falters slightly at the end by over-articulating its own meaning. The line "He knew forgiveness was not a single move but a series of openings, each requiring patience and courage" is a thematic summary that diminishes the resonance of the preceding imagistic climax, receiving a penalty for thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme is coherent and central, its delivery lacks subtlety. The story repeatedly states its core ideas directly, such as when the mural's glow "seemed to whisper the price: acceptance of loss." This tendency towards thematic summary, especially in key moments, undermines the power of the imagery and prevents the theme from emerging organically through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story suffers significantly from a lack of subtext. The theme of kintsugi, or finding beauty in brokenness, is explicitly stated multiple times, effectively becoming a thesis statement. Lines like "'the philosophy that brokenness could become beautiful'" and the final declaration "'for each crack holds the promise of a golden line'" replace earned resonance with direct moralizing. This heavy-handedness undermines the power of the story's imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of preserving moments through art emerges organically from the central images, particularly the painted seashells. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the theme is slightly over-articulated, both in the scroll's direct statement (‘eternity will linger within a breath’) and the repetitive use of the word "promise," which verges on thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of subtle power ("whispers travel farther than shouts") is central and consistently developed through imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating this theme multiple times, most notably in the final paragraph. This thematic moralizing ("proof that whispers truly travel farther than shouts") flattens the resonance, replacing earned implication with a less sophisticated summary statement.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of finding a way home through the landscape of grief is developed with poetic subtlety and powerful imagery. The concept of "reverse migration" is a brilliant, non-literal exploration of this theme. However, the story occasionally relies on repeating its own key phrases—"geography of loss," "raw solace"—which feel like thematic labels that slightly undercut the otherwise masterful "show, don't tell" approach. The final image powerfully avoids this, providing a resonant, unstated answer.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story's theme is prominent but handled with a heavy hand, sacrificing subtext for direct statement. The final sentence—"psychological safety grows not from the absence of pain, but from the courage to reflect it together"—functions as an explicit moral, summarizing the theme rather than allowing it to resonate through image and action. This thematic echo in the final paragraph significantly flattens the piece's literary potential.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thematic exploration of memory, connection, and purposeful solitude is handled with subtlety and grace. The theme emerges organically from the central images of the Edelweiss, the tide, and the light, culminating in a powerful final image that answers the story's central question without resorting to moralizing. The connection between the alpine flower and the sea provides a consistent, resonant tension.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.5)
    A coherent theme about the nature of choice and purpose emerges, but the execution is marred by heavy-handedness. The story explicitly states its theme multiple times in the closing paragraphs, such as "the true map was not on paper but in the act of choosing itself." This direct moralizing undermines the subtext and imagery, replacing earned resonance with a tidy summary, a significant flaw for this literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic development from disenchantment and broken vows to renewed purpose is handled with subtlety, emerging organically from the story's imagery rather than direct statement. The final image of the queen descending, "tempered by starlight," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening problem. The theme is coherent and integrated well into the narrative's symbolic structure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.1)
    While the theme is coherent, it is delivered too explicitly, undermining potential resonance. The story repeatedly states its own meaning through phrases like "revalue the conventional alchemical hierarchy" and "a visible proof that their scientifically romantic quest could revalue the old belief." The final whispered secret functions as a direct moral statement, a thematic echo that tells the reader the point rather than allowing the final image to convey it through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thematic exploration of memory, art, and mortality is coherent, and the ending avoids a simplistic moral. However, the story leans heavily on direct thematic statements ("time is a cruel editor," "distill chaos into narrative"). The frequent use of the prompt's own keywords as labels ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") feels less like emergent theme and more like conceptual signposting, which slightly undermines the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding resilience and beauty in forgotten fragments is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The line, "She whispered, 'You are more than metal; you are a conduit for love's first sigh,'" functions as a Thematic Echo, stating the story's thesis directly and slightly diminishing the power of the resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of transforming pain into purpose emerges organically from the central conceit. The final image of writing new runes in the air provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, a few lines verge on thematic summary ("Her purpose was simple yet fierce: to transform scars into stories..."), slightly preempting what the scene itself demonstrates so powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of fragmented memory and imperfect redemption emerges organically from the story's central conceits and culminates in a resonant final image. However, the story occasionally veers into stating its themes directly (e.g., "imperfect miracles," "forgiveness was a broken chord"), which slightly diminishes the power of its subtext and holds it back from the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's central imagery of fragmentation and unification. The final image of the waiting temple and the cyclical nature of the "arbitration" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about truth and finality. It avoids a simplistic moral, instead offering a complex and lingering reflection on the nature of existence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of measurement versus experience is woven beautifully through the story's imagery, particularly the gears and the tide. However, the final paragraph contains a "Thematic Echo" where the core theme is stated almost as a thesis ("clocks measured not time but the intervals between breaths of the world"). This directness slightly undermines the subtext built so carefully elsewhere, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers significantly from Thematic Echo. Core themes like "letting go" and "quiet wildfire" are not allowed to emerge from subtext but are explicitly defined and moralized multiple times. The line, "...the act of letting go - of fear, of doubt - was the true catalyst for the quiet wildfire of progress," is a direct thematic statement that replaces the resonance of an image with the mechanics of an essay, severely weakening the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of "lucid contradictions" is repeatedly stated in didactic terms, preventing it from emerging organically from the narrative. The final paragraph functions as a summary of the story's thesis ("she wrote a new theorem that embraced both certainty and chance"). This heavy-handed thematic statement, a form of echo, replaces the resonance that should be carried by the final image, significantly weakening the story's subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the theme of connection emerging from isolation is powerful and well-integrated, the story suffers from several instances of "Thematic Echo." Phrases like "She had come to understand that the loop was not a trap but a teaching tool" and the final paragraph’s summary of the story's design state the theme too directly. This over-articulation lessens the resonant power of the final image, replacing earned subtext with explicit commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of preserving memory and the significance of small moments is clear and central. The imagery of the tide, ink, and locket effectively supports this. However, the story leans towards direct statement, verging on thematic echo, with lines like "His purpose, to preserve the weight of small moments." The final image is resonant, but its power is slightly diluted by the story's tendency to explain its own meaning rather than letting it emerge purely from the action and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of connection through reciprocity is woven into the story’s fabric from premise to conclusion. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any hint of moralizing. The final image of the fragment traveling onward in a lantern beautifully encapsulates the earned epiphany that connection is a process, not a possession.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of inner cartography and empathetic understanding emerges organically from the premise. Unfortunately, the ending collapses into overt moralizing with the line, "She understood that navigating uncharted emotional depths required more than sight; it demanded a map drawn in feeling..." This thematic echo explicitly states the story's meaning, undermining the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of redemption and reinterpretation emerges organically from the plot, but the story falters at the end by stating its conclusions directly. The line "editing history was less about control and more about listening" is a classic Thematic Echo, summarizing the moral rather than letting the final image carry the resonance. This authorial intrusion significantly undermines the subtext built earlier. (-0.8 Thematic Echo penalty).

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    A potent theme of creating beauty from absence is developed with subtlety for most of the story. However, it is severely undermined by the final sentence, a textbook thematic echo that states the story's meaning directly, sacrificing earned resonance for didactic explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of redemption through transforming a destructive impulse into a creative one is powerfully integrated, particularly with the phoenix motif. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. A minor deduction is for the line, "He understood that his flames...could now be turned to illuminate," which verges on an explicit thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of hope emerging from shared sorrow is powerfully rendered through resonant imagery, particularly the auroral lagoon. The story avoids direct moralizing for most of its length, allowing the theme to emerge organically. However, the final two paragraphs slip into summary, explicitly stating what has already been shown ("a reminder that sorrow can birth light," "...became a living chord"), which slightly diminishes the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of whispers being more powerful than shouts is woven through the plot effectively. However, the story falters at its climax by stating the theme directly on the parchment: “Whispers are the true currents of this city.” This thematic echo undermines the subtext built through action and imagery, replacing earned resonance with a tidy, declarative moral.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central theme of finding light in darkness is rendered through a powerful and original central metaphor. The final image of the night holding stars "like secret fireflies" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the piece undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its core concepts ("Its core concept was silent empathy," "The guardian's purpose was...") instead of allowing them to emerge solely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic development is the story’s greatest strength, emerging organically from the interwoven motifs of chess, light, and quiet growth. The ending avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image—the citizens as "gardeners of thoughts"—that powerfully encapsulates the story's core ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of achieving freedom by detaching from past conflicts emerges organically from the story’s symbolism. However, the final paragraph resorts to a direct thematic statement: “for she had finally found freedom in embracing her true nature.” This thematic echo undermines the subtext built through the powerful imagery, explaining the moral instead of letting the resonant images do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding redemption through art is potent and integrated into the story's core imagery. However, the piece undermines its own subtext with moments of thematic declaration. The line "...her whittle, her narration, and the dried flowers were not rebellion but a quiet cultivation of lightness in grief" is a direct summary that replaces the resonance of the final image with an explicit moral.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the story’s central action, exploring the power of art to redefine reality. The final image of the lake reflecting a new sky is a powerful, non-literal resolution. The only minor weakness is the line "a promise that boundaries are meant to be explored," which verges on stating the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is woven through the narrative with precision, from the phoenix's rebirth from ruin to the glassblower's final wisdom. The final image serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by moments where the theme is articulated a bit too directly in the narration, bordering on thematic statement rather than emergent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of connection and the unity of perception is thoughtfully integrated into the story's imagery and central action. However, the narrative frequently undermines its own subtext by resorting to direct thematic statements. The final paragraphs, particularly the line about propelling "humanity toward deeper empathy," feel like an unnecessary moral summary that flattens the earned resonance of the preceding scene. The story explains its meaning when the images had already made it felt.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of renewal through intention is deeply and artfully woven through the story's central images. The final image of the crane and the unseen sunrise provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial despair. The score is slightly tempered by moments where the theme is articulated a bit too directly, as when she realizes "her mourning was not a final curtain but a thin veil she could lift," which verges on thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic development is strong, weaving together ideas of history, technology, and intuition. However, the final paragraph lapses into summary, explicitly stating the theme ("In the inherited mystery, she had found her purpose: to map cultural patterns..."). This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the resonance of the preceding imagery, telling the reader what was already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of finding wisdom in fragmentation and unpredictability emerges organically from the plot's central mechanic. However, the final paragraph weakens the story's resonance by explicitly stating the theme ("true purification comes not from erasing the past, but from embracing its fragmented atoms..."). This thematic echo feels unnecessary and undercuts the powerful imagery that had already conveyed the idea with more subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, exploring memory, legacy, and hope with nuance and resonant imagery. The central metaphor of the "shadow unbound" as a repeating pattern of human longing is powerful and avoids didacticism. The final image of the soaring kite provides a non-literal answer to the story's central question, achieving a poignant, lingering effect.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is too explicitly articulated, culminating in a final-line summary ("balance is not a static point but a river...") that functions as an authorial moral, undermining the resonance of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of finding meaning and healing within trauma is developed with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the story's unique imagery rather than from direct statements. The final realization that "time itself was a wound we could read" is a superb, non-literal answer to the central question, re-contextualizing the entire story without resorting to a simplistic moral. The theme resonates through the final image of the cleared hourglass and the inflowing light.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through recurring imagery rather than direct statement. The story explores unexpressed love and memory, culminating in a resonant, non-literal resolution: the gazer becoming a carrier of transformed sorrow, "like a lantern." This final image answers the story's central question with grace and complexity, avoiding any hint of a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of releasing creativity is central and consistently explored through the story's core metaphor. However, it occasionally lapses into over-statement, undermining subtext. The final word being "freedom" is too explicit, and the later reflection that "rest was not an end but a cycle" functions more like an authorial summary than an emergent, resonant insight.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of hope's cultivation in the face of desolation emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery rather than statement. The recurring motif of the "fractured lullaby" transforms from a song of loss into a "chorus of renewal," providing a perfect sonic metaphor for the narrative arc. The final image of light-trunks rising from ash is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, achieving thematic depth without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.5)
    Thematic statements are overly explicit, with key phrases like "reclamation of internal wilderness" functioning as a thesis summary. The story repeatedly states its theme rather than letting it emerge organically from concrete action, which significantly undermines the potential for subtext and resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of courage as a dormant potential is consistently developed through motifs like the star stamp and the seed. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its theme in the final paragraphs. Lines like "courage, unused, lay dormant like a seed awaiting sunrise" function as a thematic summary, a critical flaw that replaces resonant imagery with direct moralizing and significantly weakens the piece's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of safety's price is woven skillfully through subtext and imagery for most of the story. However, the final paragraphs lapse into explicit thematic statements, particularly the line "safety's price was not measured in steel or stone, but in the willingness to bear silence." This thematic echo undermines the resonant power of the preceding images by stating the moral directly, a significant flaw that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is powerfully integrated into the story's central metaphor: the temple held together by deceit collapses under the weight of truth. However, the story undermines this resonance with an explicit authorial statement in the final third: "a reminder that power taken by deceit would always crumble..." This thematic echo converts an earned, emergent idea into a simplistic moral, a significant flaw that damages an otherwise strong thematic structure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of listening to find meaning in loss emerges organically from the central actions of tapping and assembling. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the explicit repetition of thematic labels like "delayed revelation" verges on overstatement, slightly diminishing the subtext's power by making the implicit too explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding meaning through connection and participation emerges organically from the central conceit. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its conclusions in the final third. Lines like "She realized that to reignite the dormant fire of change, she needed only to listen..." and "...she finally understood that meaning was not a fixed destination" function as thematic summaries, a critical flaw that replaces earned resonance with direct moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of evolving tradition is central and coherent. The final image of the "collective heartbeat" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is lowered by moments of thematic over-statement, such as when "Anara explained that the implanted destiny was not a command, but an invitation," which states the moral directly rather than leaving it to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story's greatest weakness is its direct thematic moralizing, which undermines any emergent subtext. The line "Her purpose, she realized, was to anchor optimism in realism" is an explicit thesis statement that feels authorial and didactic. This robs the ending of its resonance by replacing a felt conclusion with a neat, intellectual summary.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding wholeness through embracing fragmentation is powerfully integrated, primarily through the central metaphor of the broken tarot cards. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. A penalty is applied for the moment of thematic echo ("Was it not the purpose of every artist..."), which explicitly states the theme rather than allowing it to emerge solely from action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme—that time's elasticity in crisis is a protective universal mechanism—is compelling and emerges organically from the story's central conceit. The final image of Kael as a messenger is resonant. However, the story leans slightly too far into telling in its final third ("Kael understood that... he saw that..."), explicitly stating the thematic revelation rather than allowing the images to carry the full weight of meaning, which slightly blunts the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of truth's disruptive power emerges powerfully from the central ice-and-thaw metaphor and resonant final images. However, the story falters near the end with an explicit thematic statement: "Thus, the echoing library under snow became a testament that..." This sentence over-explains the story's meaning, undermining the trust in the otherwise strong symbolic work and costing the piece its subtlety at a critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding strength in quiet and turning burden into foundation is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The story repeatedly articulates its own meaning through phrases like "silence can hold strength" and "burden can become a bridge." This direct moralizing, a form of Thematic Echo, undermines the subtext and prevents the theme from emerging organically from the well-crafted imagery, leaving little for the reader to discover.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of connection, creation, and the nature of capturing the divine is developed with nuance. The story's central idea—that to truly possess something sacred is to set it free—is a sophisticated concept. The final image of casting a net for notes provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial quest, avoiding any didactic moralizing and leaving a lingering sense of wonder. The theme emerges organically from the story's unique conceits.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of uncovering truth beneath corrupt narratives is woven throughout with resonant imagery like "orbits of regret" and "dead stories." The final image of the heavens turning pages is powerful. The story is docked for the on-the-nose thematic statement in the final dialogue ("any writer who wishes to intervene..."), which states the moral too explicitly, slightly undermining the subtext built through imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story builds a resonant theme around healing and memory, but severely undermines it with direct authorial statements in the final third. The line, "Lyra understood that to tether a cry was to honor a memory, and that haunted firmware could be healed when compassion rewrote the code in letters inked by love," is a critical flaw. This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral, flattening the story's complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in chaos is potently explored through resonant imagery, particularly the mandala and the tile. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of direct thematic statement. Lines like "...a testament that meaning can arise from mess" state the moral outright, replacing earned resonance with explicit summary, particularly in the story’s final third.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of forging a strong, resilient empathy is stated explicitly and repeatedly, functioning more like a thesis statement than an emergent property of the narrative. Phrases like "cradle empathy in arms of steel" and "compassion could be engineered" are heavy-handed, amounting to thematic moralizing. This direct explanation, particularly in the story's second half, undermines the power of the central image of "Hearthsteel" and leaves little for the reader to interpret. This is a clear case of the Thematic Echo anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of hope's endurance and art's redemptive power emerges beautifully from the central imagery, particularly the tarot coin's transformation and the apples falling like applause. The final image of the shopkeeper is resonant and avoids a simple moral. The score is slightly tempered by late-story lines like "to lure possibility from that brink" and "hope can always be summoned," which verge on stating the theme directly rather than letting the images do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    A coherent theme exploring the intersection of scientific understanding and wonder emerges organically from the plot. The story wisely avoids a simplistic moral, framing the conclusion as a beautiful new avenue of inquiry. The final image provides resonance, but the execution is hampered by overt thematic statements, particularly the repeated, self-conscious "willowglass hope" metaphor, which explains the theme to the reader rather than allowing it to arise solely from image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of translating silence and bridging life with stone is potent and well-supported by the story's imagery. However, the piece falters at the climax by explicitly stating its central insight: "She understood that to become the voice of the unknown was not to speak for others, but to amplify the silence..." This thematic summary is a significant flaw, as it explains the resonance that the preceding images had already beautifully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of collective memory shaping the future emerges organically from the central images. The final image of the sand bridge is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the score is capped by several instances of Thematic Echo, where the theme is stated directly, most notably in the final third: "the shared wisdom was not a static lesson but a living conversation."

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of redemption and the nature of courage emerges organically from the central symbolic quest. However, the story falters near the end by explicitly stating its morals. Lines like "...a promise that the world could heal when its people acted prudently daring" function as authorial pronouncements that flatten the earned resonance of the final images, constituting a significant Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of integrating complexity rather than erasing it emerges organically from the central images of the palimpsest, river, and stitch work. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the resonance is significantly undercut by the penultimate paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("to distill complexity... was not to erase, but to honor"), a "thematic echo" that over-explains the story's point.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of gentle, patient kindness reviving memory emerges organically from the story’s core images and actions. However, the prose occasionally slips into direct thematic summary, undermining its own subtext. Lines like "kindness, when offered patiently, can bend even the hardest timeline" state the moral too plainly, functioning as an authorial explanation rather than allowing the resonant final image to carry the meaning alone.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of small, deliberate acts of care transforming oppressive environments emerges organically from the imagery and action for most of the story. However, the final paragraph becomes too explicit, stating the theme directly: "...a gardener who understood that to reflect light into dark corners was the truest form of care." This thematic echo undermines the subtext built so carefully, replacing earned resonance with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's themes of coexistence and transformation are handled with excessive directness, undermining subtext. Key thematic insights are explicitly stated, as when "Mira understood that brittle awakenings were not failures but delicate beginnings." This tendency toward authorial moralizing, especially in the resolution, replaces earned resonance with a summary of intent, a significant flaw for this literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of connection through shared, secret love is beautifully integrated into the central images of the thread and the spiral. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Mira's quest. However, a few phrases like "every secret is a strand connecting hearts" verge on direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of subtle influence creating unity is powerful and emerges organically from the plot. However, the narrative occasionally lapses into stating its theme directly, bordering on a moral. Lines like "...power plays could be outmaneuvered when every listener tuned their own inner frequency..." and the final sentence about hope rewriting stars feel like authorial summary rather than resonant, subtextual conclusions drawn from the image itself.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of rediscovering lost knowledge and rebelling against stasis emerges organically from the imagery of the shifting map and resonant organ. The final image of the glowing garden is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is significantly limited by the on-the-nose thematic statement near the end: "...the rebellion he had sparked was not against stone, but against the forgetting of stories that bind humanity." This explicit moralizing replaces scene pressure and subtext with a direct summary, weakening an otherwise resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story suffers from explicit thematic statements that undermine its subtlety. Phrases like "She believed that by unifying opposites" and "Her method of unifying opposites...had coaxed the quarry itself to speak" function as authorial explanations of the story's meaning. This direct moralizing, especially the summary in the final paragraph, prevents the theme from emerging organically from the narrative's powerful imagery and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story builds a resonant theme of memory and courage, but it compromises its power with explicit statements. The final sentence, "...the world still needed librarians who could map bravery onto the stormy skies," functions as a heavy-handed moral that replaces the earned, implicit resonance of the preceding images. This thematic echo significantly lessens the story's lingering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The themes of forgiveness, memory, and hope are potent, but their delivery is often heavy-handed. The story violates the "show, don't tell" principle by explicitly stating its central theme multiple times, most notably with the repeated phrase "to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'." This thematic echo, particularly its appearance in the resolution, replaces earned resonance with a direct authorial statement, significantly weakening the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of cycles, boundaries, and failure is masterfully integrated through the central metaphor of loops and territorial markers. The final image and Arlen's realization provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions without resorting to moralizing. It reweights all prior events, achieving a sophisticated and earned thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of shared burdens is central and consistently woven through the narrative, culminating in a resonant final image. However, it is often stated directly and repeatedly ("Share the burden," "silence of shared burdens"), which reduces subtext and verges on Thematic Echo. The story tells its theme more than it allows it to emerge from unstated implication.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of revealing hidden truths versus surface reflections is elegantly woven through the story's core conceit and imagery. The central metaphor of "what mirrors don't show" is introduced and then paid off beautifully in the final image of the lake reflecting the "truths beneath." The transformation of the seed from a devourer to a protector provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about memory and truth.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of binding past wounds to future hope is powerfully woven through recurring imagery like the "scarred hedges" that ultimately heal. The final image of the beacon offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. The piece is slightly weakened by moments of thematic over-articulation, such as when the narrator explains the covenant's purpose directly, which slightly diminishes the otherwise organic emergence of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of renewal through sacrifice emerges organically from the potent central imagery. However, the epiphany feels slightly over-articulated in the line "stitches that bound both giver and receiver in shared renewal." This brief turn toward direct thematic statement slightly diminishes the power of the subtext that was otherwise skillfully woven throughout the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of redefining success is potent and developed organically through the story's central juxtaposition. Unfortunately, the piece falters at the very end by explicitly stating its own moral. The sentence beginning "I wrote a final entry in my ledger, noting the day’s lesson..." is a critical misstep, a thematic echo that replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, a significant flaw in a story aiming for this tier of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of transforming ambition into compassion emerges organically from the central metaphor of the seed. The final image of the sprouting blossom is a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial problem. However, the story undermines its own subtext with explicit thematic statements in the final third, such as "...a reminder that ambition, once haunted, could be guided toward compassion," which incurred a penalty for thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of identity accepting contradiction is expertly woven through recurring imagery—tides, moon phases, the fisherman-scholar. The final image of the blank books is a superb, non-literal resolution. However, the final paragraph contains a thematic echo ("for he had woven wonder into the very fabric of everyday life") that summarizes the story's achievement. This direct statement slightly undermines the otherwise masterful subtext and resonant imagery that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of communion through shared sorrow is potent and emerges organically from the story’s central symbols (pearl, shell, confessions). The final image of the pearl as a "shared lantern" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story occasionally explains its own symbolism too directly, as in "The crown was a ritual, an act of binding...", which slightly undermines the subtext and moves toward thematic statement rather than pure evocation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of forgiveness as a process is well-integrated into the imagery of the river and journey. However, the story leans too heavily on direct statement, particularly with the graffiti quote, which essentially spells out the theme for the reader. This explicit thematic declaration in the story's climax ("Forgiveness is not a destination...") preempts earned resonance, functioning as a "thematic echo" that borders on moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of giving voice to the unspoken emerges organically from the central conceit and powerful final imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final moments. The veiled dreamer’s line, “Each petal holds a promise, a story that once spoken, will never fade,” is a form of thematic moralizing that feels less earned than the preceding visual revelation of the garden.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of weighing an ephemeral dream against concrete power is well-integrated through the central conflict and imagery. The final image of the rekindled promise is resonant. The score is lowered significantly by the final paragraph, which engages in thematic summary ("lightened by the knowledge that a dream could outweigh an empire"), explicitly stating the moral instead of allowing the preceding events to carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of preserving hope against entropy emerges organically from the central action. The final image of the emerald beacon is a resonant, non-literal answer to the threat of oblivion. However, the story falters in the final paragraphs by over-stating its theme explicitly ("a covenant with the universe to honor every fleeting glow," "countless stories...waiting to be stitched"). This thematic echo weakens the ending by replacing earned resonance with direct summary, a significant misstep in an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of rebirth through forgiveness and care is consistently developed through imagery. However, the story suffers from a critical flaw: it explicitly states its theme multiple times. The line "contentment was not a hidden treasure but a return to the simple rhythm of caring" and the final sentence's moralizing undercut any subtext, replacing earned resonance with a direct, summary-like statement that feels like a thematic echo of a prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of certainty versus nuance is explored with depth and sophistication, emerging organically from a tight constellation of metaphors. The story avoids moralizing, instead using the final image of the "hollow mirror shard" as a portal for future doubts to offer a resonant, non-literal answer to its central question. This final moment powerfully reweights the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of patience and withholding perception emerges organically from the story’s central images and actions. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial problem, avoiding a simplistic moral. However, a few moments of direct thematic explanation, such as "She understood that to teach vanishing to appear, she must first withhold her own perception," slightly undermine the subtext by stating it too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of non-physical knowledge and connection emerges organically from the story's unique conceits. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the theme is occasionally over-articulated through phrases that summarize the concept, such as "a reminder that the world still breathed even when she stood still," slightly reducing the power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding value in quiet, authentic creation versus automated spectacle is potent and well-integrated. It emerges organically from the core conflict and recurring motifs like "lingering luminance." However, the final two paragraphs lean toward summarizing this theme directly, which slightly undermines the subtext built so carefully. The final image of fireflies is resonant, but it follows a moment of over-explanation that verges on a thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of seeking a language beyond words is woven beautifully through the imagery of light, vows, and sound. The final image of the sky lanterns provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Eli's quest. The score is tempered by moments of over-explicitness, particularly the final sentence, which functions as a direct thematic statement ("every vow... can light the deepest ocean"), slightly undermining the otherwise emergent resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding purpose through alignment rather than discovery emerges organically from the story's core conceit. The final image provides a resonant answer. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with lines that function as direct thematic summary, such as "Silas understood that the purpose he sought was not a destination but a frequency," which feels too declarative for an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of naming as an act of redemption is powerfully realized through the story’s central conceit and resonant final image. However, a few moments verge on thematic summary, slightly weakening the subtext. The line, “She understood that the reaper’s grief was not just personal sorrow, but the weight of centuries of unfinished farewells,” articulates the theme a bit too directly, pulling back the curtain on an otherwise elegantly implied concept.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.2)
    A potent theme of patient, humble power is developed organically through the central action, only to be flattened by overt thematic statements in the final third. Multiple sentences explicitly state the story's moral ("a reminder that even lukewarm magic can mend the universe," "knowing that even a brittle devotion...could echo through the cosmos"). This thematic moralizing is a critical flaw, replacing resonant imagery with explicit explanation at the story's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of truth, memory, and the power of shared narrative is thoughtfully integrated and culminates in a resonant final image. The story powerfully connects personal memory to collective healing. However, a late-story sentence explicitly states the theme ("She knew the true power of expunging falsehoods..."), which verges on moralizing and slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is developed effectively through resonant imagery, particularly the "algorithmic dance" of the starlings and the fresco of fire and water. Unfortunately, the story surrenders this subtlety at its climax. The final line, "...true alchemy begins where logic yields to awe," is an overt thematic statement that explains the story's meaning to the reader, severely undercutting the resonance that the preceding images worked to build.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of responsibility and maintaining trust under pressure is well-integrated and emerges organically from the character's actions and the central symbol of the buckle. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer about the cyclical nature of this burden. The score is tempered by the tendency to state the theme directly ("To preserve trust under pressure") instead of relying solely on subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "complementary opposites" is undermined by heavy-handed, repetitive statements that function as authorial moralizing. Instead of emerging from events, the theme is explicitly summarized in lines like "He understood that defeating emotional numbness required...action through complementary opposites." This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a direct explanation, significantly weakening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of nurturing innovation through unconventional means emerges organically from the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtlety with an explicit thematic statement in the final third: "She understood that safeguarding space for innovation meant more than protecting walls..." This acts as a Thematic Echo, explaining the story's point to the reader and lessening the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the theme of treating grief as a melody is poignant, the story undermines its own subtext by stating its thesis directly. The line "He restored harmony via half-sung lullabies..." in the final paragraphs functions as an overt moral, replacing earned resonance with explanation. This thematic summary significantly reduces the power of the otherwise effective final image.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme of making friends with uncertainty is potent and well-integrated into the plot, its execution suffers from a lack of subtext. The narrative repeatedly states its theme directly, particularly in the final third ("It understood that to make friends with uncertainty was..."). This over-articulation, a form of Thematic Echo, undermines the power of the final image by explaining what should have been left to resonate, turning earned insight into a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the story is built around a coherent theme, it suffers from over-articulation. Key thematic concepts like "creative destruction" are explicitly stated and summarized for the reader, particularly in the latter half ("He realized that creative destruction was not merely breaking..."). This direct moralizing undermines the powerful subtext of the imagery, replacing earned resonance with a less sophisticated thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of endings containing beginnings is woven consistently through the narrative, from the shard's nature to the city's revival. However, the final paragraphs shift from showing this theme to explicitly stating it. Lines like "endings are merely signals awaiting reinterpretation" and "the practical magic... proved that fantasies could be engineered" function as thematic summaries, a form of telling that diminishes the resonance of the final image by over-explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of intention shaping reality emerges from the events, but the story undermines its own subtext with overt moralizing. The final paragraphs contain multiple instances of "Thematic Echo," such as "intention can align the cosmos," which explicitly states the theme rather than letting the resonant final images do the work. This direct summary significantly weakens the story’s literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of imagination bridging logic and wonder is woven skillfully through the central metaphor. However, the final third veers into summary, explicitly stating the story's thesis: "He realized that the true eruption was not... but the quiet realization that imagination can be measured." This moment of telling undermines the resonant power of the imagery, substituting an intellectual summary for an earned, felt epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of balancing tradition and progress is thoughtfully integrated through the anchor link motif for most of the story. However, the final paragraph falters by explicitly stating the theme. The instructor’s explanation ("the link represented the balance of forces, the anchor of tradition and the chain of progress") is a Thematic Echo that replaces earned resonance with a direct summary, undermining thesubtlety built earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    Thematic potential is high but significantly undercut by direct, on-the-nose statements. Lines like "Incidental heroism is often born from moments like this" and "I felt the weight of incidental heroism settle on my shoulders" function as thematic labels that replace subtext with summary. This authorial intrusion prevents the theme from emerging organically from the story's powerful imagery and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of honoring the forgotten and unseen is woven beautifully through the story's imagery and plot. The final action offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the last paragraph verges on thematic summary ("a promise that the invisible threads...would never be forgotten again"), slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story builds a potentially resonant theme about finding meaning in error, supported by strong central images like the broken shard. However, it completely undermines this by stating its theme directly and repeatedly, a critical flaw. The line "she knew the wisdom she fetched from failure would guide the next generation" is overt moralizing that kills all subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story explores profound themes of language, memory, and preservation with subtlety and grace. The central theme emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a resonant final image that answers the story’s central question without resorting to a moral. The idea of translating "texture into sound" is a sophisticated concept, and the story’s execution delivers an emotionally and intellectually satisfying exploration of what it means for something to survive.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of transmuting darkness into levity is beautifully explored through resonant imagery like "frostbitten hope" and "playful gravity." However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements in the final third. Lines like "My mission...had succeeded" and the summary of it being "a story of redemption" state the moral directly, slightly weakening the powerful ambiguity of the final images. The final paragraph functions more as an epilogue explaining the theme than a final, resonant beat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of art's power to conquer oppression is woven effectively through the story's central imagery. However, the final paragraph veers into overt thematic statement with the line, "...a promise that even the most tarnished wonder could one day bloom fully." This thematic echo slightly undermines the earned resonance of the final image of the empty locust shell, functioning as an unnecessary summary of the story's moral.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from significant thematic overstatement, violating the "show, don't tell" principle for its core ideas. The theme is stated directly multiple times, culminating in a final paragraph that reads like a moral summary: "...the mail he delivered was not ink but a promise that broken promises could heal..." This heavy-handedness erodes the subtext and replaces earned resonance with a declared thesis, a major flaw for publication at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of art giving voice to the void is potent and well-integrated into the story's imagery. The final image of the "tapestry of sound" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is significantly lowered by overt thematic statements, particularly the line "...the silent carousel carpenter’s true craft was not wood but the art of listening to the void," which functions as a Thematic Echo, explaining the story's meaning instead of letting the events carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thematic integration is subtle and powerful. The story explores the intersection of science, art, and memory through evocative imagery rather than direct statements. The final image of Mara logging the event in the ledger provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about where stories reside. The theme emerges organically from the particulars, resisting a simple moral and leaving a lingering sense of wonder and duty.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of shared longing as a form of connection emerges organically from the central imagery of light, sea, and scent. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the piece undermines its own subtext with the explicit thematic statement, "longing, when shared, becomes a light that never truly fades," a moment of telling that feels less powerful than the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of releasing potential is clear, but the story undermines its own resonant imagery with heavy-handed summary in the final two paragraphs. Lines like "...a reminder that every tangled thought can be untied with patience and a ribbon of intention" and the direct call to "seek the unassumingly bold within themselves" function as a stated moral. This thematic echo replaces earned subtext with explicit instruction, significantly weakening the story's literary impact at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of memory and reclamation emerges organically from the imagery, but the story undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements. The repetition of "When habits break..." acts as a too-explicit moral, stating what the final, resonant image of the villagers singing already shows. This thematic echo in the final third prevents the theme from achieving the highest level of subtlety and power, feeling slightly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of resilience mentored through gentle but fierce care is woven skillfully through the story's core actions and imagery. The final image provides a resonant answer to the problem of neglect. However, the story occasionally verges on stating its theme too explicitly, with phrases like "translate despair into instruction" and "battling neglect required the gentlest of touches," which slightly lessen the subtextual power by turning implicit meaning into explicit summary.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of preserving and sharing hope is potent and supported by strong imagery. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The line "a reminder that hope had taken root upon the hush of budding hope" is redundant and verges on moralizing, weakening the final section's resonance by stating what the images have already shown. This tendency to summarize its own meaning holds the piece back.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of patient, quiet restoration taming grief emerges organically from the central action and imagery. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering the "interlaced hush" as a complex, resonant metaphor for a peace that is not empty but full. The final image of the softened starlight as a "muted hymn" provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of empathetic interpretation is central and coherent, but its delivery is too explicit. The final sentence, "empathy could rewrite the borders between what is known and what remains patiently unheard," is a textbook case of a thematic summary that undermines the evocative final image. This direct moralizing, a "Thematic Echo," prevents the theme from emerging organically from the reader's experience of the preceding events and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme is coherently developed through powerful motifs like the snow globe and tangled wires, the story falters by explicitly stating its conclusions. The final paragraphs contain multiple "Thematic Echo" violations ("letting go was not surrender but a transformation," "tension minus attachment equals the luminous path of release") that replace earned resonance with a direct summary. This significantly undermines the subtext and sophistication for a top-tier literary market.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of connection across disparate modes of existence is woven beautifully through the story's central imagery. The final image of the courtyard as a living archive offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. A minor flaw is the line "...he heard the unspoken needs of the world: a plea for connection, for touch, for belonging," which verges on thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thematic development is a core strength, with the central idea emerging organically from resonant images like stored laughter in crystal jars. The final image on the balcony provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's question. A significant penalty is applied for the final sentence—"a testament to the quiet resilience..."—which functions as a thematic summary, undermining the preceding image's elegant implication.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of memory and absence is potent and the imagery is often powerful. Unfortunately, the story significantly undermines its subtext by resorting to direct thematic statements, most notably in the final paragraph, which explains the very meaning the preceding pages worked to create through image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of turning limits into thresholds is potent and well-integrated into the story's core conceit. However, the execution is marred by direct thematic statements in the final third. Lines like "Lira understood that her limits were not walls but thresholds" and "the true craft was not the painting but the moment she chose to defy the silence" function as overt moralizing, undermining the power of the final image by explaining it to the reader. This explicit summary prevents the theme from emerging with full, resonant power.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of deciphering hidden connections between language, pattern, and nature is woven effectively through the story's core elements. The final image of the starlings reacting to the ship's new light provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is slightly limited by the final paragraph's tendency to summarize Lira's achievements, which borders on stating the theme directly rather than letting the resolution rest entirely on the image.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of repair, memory, and cyclical duty emerges organically from the central metaphor and resonant imagery. The story largely avoids overt moralizing, allowing the final image to carry the thematic weight. However, the final paragraph drifts toward thematic summary with lines like "every repair sang its own story," slightly undermining the otherwise potent subtext by stating what was already beautifully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of community is present but delivered with a heavy hand, bordering on didacticism. The child's proclamation, "We are no longer strangers; we are a family," and Liora's final message explicitly state the moral rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. This over-articulation robs the story of the complexity and ambiguity expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of finding beauty and peace in imperfection is woven effectively through the central images of the puppet head and the lighthouse. However, the story falters at the end by explicitly stating its theme: “understanding that beauty lay in being beautifully flawed.” This thematic echo undermines the subtext, replacing earned resonance with a direct moral and incurring a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of costly, imperfect salvation emerges organically from the story's particulars. The central concept of a "graceless beauty" is dramatized throughout and crystallized in the final paragraphs, offering a resonant, non-moralizing answer to the story's central tension. The final image—the travelers' safety glowing brighter than the curse—is a masterful thematic statement achieved through action and image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of translating separation into connection is woven skillfully through the story's core images: the braided ravine, the polymer chains, and the chrysalis. The final image of the child offering a new chrysalis provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The theme's power is slightly diluted by moments of over-statement, such as the direct promise "to keep translating the separations," which nudges the subtext closer to text.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of creation emerging from quantified absence is potent and well-integrated. The final image of the word ‘origin’ provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the story occasionally leans into direct thematic statements, such as "a promise that every story starts with a silent breath," which slightly undermines the subtext by stating what is already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of healing collective trauma is explored with nuance and powerful imagery, avoiding didacticism. The central metaphor of tasting and seasoning memories is sustained with remarkable consistency, culminating in a final image that offers a complex, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The resolution—a "brittle resilience"—is a sophisticated thematic statement that resists a simplistic, happy ending.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of art and empathy healing industrial divides is clear and integrated into the story's central metaphor of building bridges from song. However, its execution is overly direct and sentimental. Lines like "each plank a metaphorical bridge built from shared song" state the theme explicitly, leaving little room for subtext or ambiguity and making the piece feel more like a parable than a complex narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme exploring the preservation and revival of memory is poignant and well-supported by the story's imagery. However, its resonance is significantly undercut by moments of over-explicitness, particularly the line where Aria "realized" her mission must be to revive dreams, not just record them. This thematic statement acts as an authorial intrusion that tells the reader the moral rather than letting it emerge from the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of vigilance is skillfully developed through the "seeds of vigilance" motif, which transforms from a concept into a tangible, living object. This provides strong resonance. However, the final paragraph leans into direct thematic summary ("She understood that vigilance, like seeds, must be tended..."), which slightly undermines the "show, don't tell" principle by stating the moral that was already effectively implied.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story suffers from a heavy-handed delivery of its theme. Instead of allowing "empathy in motion" to emerge from the central action, the phrase is repeated like a mantra. The final paragraphs explicitly state the story's moral ("realizing that empathy in motion was not a hollow ideal," "...the tree-song sculptor taught that..."), which severely undermines the resonant final image by explaining it. This is a clear case of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, replacing earned resonance with a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding beauty in sorrow emerges organically from the imagery and the character's journey. However, the story undermines its own subtlety with repetition. The final sentence, "...a hopeful melancholy that promised the beauty he sought would finally rise from the difficulty," is a thematic summary that explicitly states what the preceding paragraphs had already beautifully implied, incurring a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of empathy achieved through listening is powerfully integrated into the central metaphor and plot. The final image of the crowd feeling heard is resonant. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of direct thematic summary, particularly: "He understood then that the path to empathy was not a road paved with grand gestures but a lattice of quiet recognitions." This thematic echo in the final third explains the moral rather than allowing the image to carry it alone.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is severely undermined by direct, repetitive statements that function as moralizing. Instead of allowing the theme to emerge from events, the story explicitly articulates it multiple times, culminating in the line "motion and stillness are twin roots of serenity." This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern removes all subtext and treats the reader with a lack of trust.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of resilience as a cyclical, shared process rather than a hoarded secret is potent and emerges well from the final action. The image of the tip dissolving into the soil is a strong, resonant answer to the story's central question. However, the theme is slightly undermined by being explicitly stated in the final paragraphs ("She knew the source... was the ancient practice..."), which verges on moralizing and reduces the impact of the symbolic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of cultivating foresight through meticulous observation is woven well through the narrative action. The flight engineer's patch serves as a solid recurring motif. A significant flaw appears in the final paragraph, which states the theme directly: "...a reminder that foresight could be cultivated even in silence." This thematic echo replaces resonant imagery with a tidy moral, reducing the piece's literary power.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is overt and repetitive, violating the principle of emergence. The story explicitly states its central thesis multiple times (e.g., "her purpose was to certify wonder as essential"), which reads like authorial moralizing. This heavy-handedness prevents the theme from resonating through subtext and earned imagery, ultimately undermining the story's potential for nuanced reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of learning from failure is well-developed through action and imagery for most of the story. However, its power is significantly undercut by multiple instances of explicit thematic summary in the final third. Lines like "...true guardianship is woven from quiet failures" function as overt moralizing, violating the principle of subtext and weakening an otherwise resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of empathy as a fluid, transposable function is woven deeply into the story's fabric. The final image of collecting the shards provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. A minor deduction is warranted for the line where Mara formulates her new theorem, "emotion is not a static variable but a transposed function," which verges on an explicit thematic statement, slightly reducing the subtextual power of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme is potent and well-integrated through the central metaphor of the pendant. However, the final two paragraphs over-articulate the theme, verging on moralizing. Lines like "...proof that wonder can be coaxed from even the most routine of paths" state the story's thesis directly, weakening the resonance of the final image. This "Thematic Echo" flaw prevents the theme from emerging purely through subtext and earned imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the story’s central question, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the final paragraphs veer into thematic summary, explicitly stating what has already been shown and slightly diminishing the power of the otherwise earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of sacrifice as a necessary component of connection emerges organically from the central weaving metaphor. However, the story falters at the end by explicitly stating its moral: "sacrifice, however latent, would always be the loom of tomorrow." This thematic echo in the final paragraphs replaces earned resonance with a direct statement, significantly weakening the subtextual power of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of exchanging vulnerability for strength ("bartered awakenings") is elegantly woven into the plot's core mechanic. The final image of the blade knitting broken ground provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the blacksmith's quest. The score is slightly tempered by the direct repetition of the key thematic phrases ("bartered awakenings," "between understanding and confusion"), which borders on thematic summary where the action already speaks for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of shared knowledge triumphing over concealed truths is clear, but its delivery in the final paragraph is too explicit. The line "I felt the universe whisper that weaving between worlds was not a task but a promise" functions as a thematic summary that undermines the resonance of the preceding imagery. This overt moralizing replaces earned subtext with a tidy, declarative statement, weakening an otherwise effective thematic structure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of creating and preserving hope in darkness emerges powerfully from the central ritual. However, the story's resonance is significantly weakened by explicit thematic statements in the final third. Lines like "a simple promise that safety could be bottled and shared" and "reminding him that safety can be bottled and carried" function as overt moralizing, which feels tacked on to an otherwise subtle narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of renewal through the integration of darkness is potent and emerges organically from the central ritual. The final image of "shadowed elation" offers a complex, non-moralizing answer to the story's central question. However, Mira's final vow ("I will guide the dawn...using the ancient shadows to paint the morning with hope") verges on a "Thematic Echo," stating the theme a little too directly, which slightly undermines the subtext built so well elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is delivered explicitly through the text of the ancient scroll, a classic example of telling over showing that prevents any emergent resonance. The line "stories cling to people who carry iridescent caution" functions as a thesis statement, robbing the narrative of subtext and the reader of discovery. While the final image is strong, it's in service of a pre-digested moral.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of healing through patient, empathetic work emerges organically from the central action. However, the story undermines its own subtext by repeatedly stating its theme in phrases like "mundane miracle" and "quantified grief turning into a gentle relief." This thematic echoing, particularly in the final third, replaces earned resonance with overt summary, significantly weakening the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of connection and renewal is clear but lacks subtlety. It is repeatedly stated directly (e.g., "knit communities together") rather than emerging fully from subtext. The story's final thematic insight is articulated in an overt, moralizing sentence—"the true alchemy was... in weaving together the hearts"—which functions as a Thematic Echo, replacing earned resonance with a tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story's primary weakness is its lack of subtext. The theme is repeatedly and explicitly stated, functioning as a moral label. Phrases like "accept the mistake as a teacher rather than a failure" and the mirror whispering that "every mistake held a lesson" replace earned resonance with direct summary. This significantly undermines the story's literary quality by explaining the very paradoxes it seeks to explore.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding sacredness in ordinary, forgotten things is potent and well-supported by specific imagery like the rose on the throne and the warm bread. The final image of crumbs in the tea's glow offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story leans too heavily on explicitly stating its key thematic phrases ("tenuous absolution," "sacred in the ordinary"), which feels like thematic labeling and preempts the reader's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of memory's endurance emerges powerfully through image and action, particularly in the climax where promises become a "constellation." However, the story falters in the final moments. The explicit declaration, "that memory, measured gently, could outlast oblivion," functions as a thematic summary that slightly deflates the resonant ambiguity built before it, violating the principle of showing over telling at a critical juncture.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story successfully develops themes of cyclical conflict and fragile peace through its plot and final resonant image. However, it is significantly weakened by a moment of overt thematic statement posing as motivation ("to capture the sound of trust breaking..."). This line functions as a "thematic echo," explaining the story's subtext to the reader and violating the principle of emergence. It's a notable flaw that feels like an authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of synthesizing technology and nature, logic and intuition, is expertly woven through resonant imagery rather than direct statement. The final image of the compass humming a "lullaby of stars and soil" is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It beautifully encapsulates the bridge between "old forest rites and neon circuitry" mentioned earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of integrating sorrow to unlock creativity is developed effectively through the central metaphor of the lock and the luminous ink. The final image of the aurora offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the theme is occasionally over-stated, particularly in the final paragraph ("the cavern that taught her to rectify her own silence"), which borders on summarizing the moral and slightly diminishes the power of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of candor is central but handled with a heavy hand, violating the principle of emergence. The story explicitly states its moral in both the opening and closing paragraphs ("candor in small moments could stitch the torn fabric..."). The final lines, "She understood now that candor... a testament that... candor can bloom," function as a thematic summary, replacing resonant imagery with a direct lesson, which significantly weakens the piece's literary power.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of preserving hope and truth is central, but its delivery lacks subtlety. Key thematic phrases ("symphonies of truth," "color of wonder") are repeated to the point of becoming overt statements rather than emergent ideas. The final paragraph, especially "Thus hope glistens," functions as a thematic summary, incurring a penalty for replacing resonant subtext with direct assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of transforming chaos into harmony is consistently developed through the central metaphor of the box. However, the final paragraphs resort to direct thematic statements, undermining the story's resonance. The line "a testament that even the strangest organic chaos can be... transformed into hope" is a critical flaw, a textbook thematic echo that replaces the power of the final image with a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "listening heals" is handled with excessive directness, undermining its potential for resonance. The story explicitly states its thesis multiple times (e.g., "Her motivation, to prove that listening heals," and "listening truly healed"), which reads as authorial moralizing. This thematic echo in the final third significantly flattens the subtext and prevents the theme from emerging organically from the narrative's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of encoding vulnerability as strength is central but handled with too much directness, which undermines its power. The story repeatedly states its theme (e.g., "turning weakness into a pattern of strength," "a reminder that vulnerability can be stored like treasure") instead of trusting the resonant imagery to convey it. This thematic echoing, particularly the label-like "pact with herself," prevents the piece from achieving the subtext and complexity required for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory, loss, and reclamation is beautifully woven through concrete imagery like the pressed flowers and the lantern flame. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the piece loses some power to subtext in its final third, with lines like "the memory of the beached whale became a promise that even what is deleted can be found again," which state the theme too directly for a story of this caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding power in stillness emerges organically from the story’s central magical act and resonant imagery. The piece avoids direct moralizing, and the final image of the restored brook provides a non-literal answer to the initial problem. The thematic exploration is coherent and well-integrated, though it remains straightforward without inviting complex counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding truth through paradox ("agreed upon lies") is potent and well-supported by the central symbols. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic declaration. Lines like "...each lie we agreed upon a stepping stone toward truth" function as a thematic summary, a critical flaw that reduces the resonant power of the ending for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is repeatedly stated in thesis-like phrases ("translate isolation into independence," "solitude...harnessed as a tool for self-reliance"), which prevents it from emerging organically from the narrative. The final two paragraphs devolve into summarizing the story's moral, a critical flaw that replaces resonant imagery with overt explanation. This application of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern fundamentally undermines the story's literary potential.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of forging as a noble, restorative act emerges organically from the initial setup. However, the ending succumbs to a "Thematic Echo." Liora's whispered declaration, "I will forever unlink the shackles of expectation and write only what the heart commands," functions as a direct summary of the story's moral, weakening the resonance of the preceding symbolic actions.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of memory, legacy, and the need for stories to be heard is developed with subtlety and grace. It emerges organically from the central images—the echoes, the fractured shell, the constellations. The final image of the completed shell and the "universe's secret hymn" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story's theme of mending fragmented sorrow is powerfully integrated into its central imagery. The final image of the protagonist setting out is resonant. However, the narrative repeatedly states its own themes ("expose the hidden purity," "wreck's sorrow could be mended"), culminating in a final sentence that functions as an explicit moral summary ("she knew the pure thing she salvaged would illuminate countless other shattered dreams"), which slightly undermines the earned subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of appreciating hidden effort is central and well-integrated into the story's imagery. However, it is consistently over-articulated, moving from emergent resonance to explicit statement. Phrases like "hidden patterns are the true scaffolding of existence" function as thematic summaries that dilute the power of the images, a clear instance of "thematic echo" that tells the reader what to conclude rather than letting the scene do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's primary weakness is its heavy-handed thematic statements, which undermine subtext and resonance. The theme of "truth" versus "comfortable lies" is stated explicitly multiple times, culminating in the on-the-nose inscription and a final paragraph that summarizes the moral. This direct moralizing prevents the theme from emerging organically from the story's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of creating light from darkness is developed with nuance and poetic force, emerging organically from the story's central imagery rather than explicit statements. The final sunrise, born from harnessed shadows, offers a resonant and non-literal answer to the story's central question. The theme feels slightly over-articulated by the sheer repetition of its key phrases ("ancient shadows," "new dawn"), which borders on thematic labeling, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of preserving ancestral memory is woven deeply into the central metaphor of the sound jars. However, the story undermines its own subtext by repeatedly stating its theme directly. Lines like "his mission... was to become the translator between generations" and the child understanding he "was now a link" function as thematic labels that reduce the resonant power of the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of reconciling science and soul emerges organically from the plot, which is a strength. However, the execution is hampered by overt thematic statements, particularly in the final paragraph. Phrases like “a perfect symphony of protection, adaptation, and soulful science” function as a concluding thesis statement, replacing the resonance of the final image with a less impactful summary.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the theme is coherent and integrated, the story suffers from overt thematic statements that dilute its power. Lines like "the data whispered of a patient revolution" and the final mantra, "unyoke the rush, honor the still," function as authorial morals. This explicit summarizing preempts the resonance that the otherwise potent imagery could have achieved on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of breaking free from systemic neglect by connecting with a history of resistance is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The story repeatedly uses abstract keywords like "entangled memories" and "controlling influence," which feel like authorial labels. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the thematic takeaway ("...a future where no preventable death would be ignored"), a form of moralizing that undermines the resonance of the preceding action and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of redemption is woven effectively through the central metaphor of the clockwork heart. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's moral ("every heart, mechanical or human, deserved a chance to restart"). This over-articulation replaces earned resonance with a direct statement, reducing the subtlety and impact of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding meaning in absurd, personal quests ("irreverent awe") emerges organically from the story's unique particulars without a single line of overt statement. The final image of the new map appearing in the kaleidoscope offers a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central drive. It suggests that the purpose of solving one mystery is only to reveal the next, a resonant and complex thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of memory versus deletion, absence versus presence, is explored with nuance and precision. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the final resonant image and the crew's message—"We are still here"—to answer the central question non-literally. The concept of a digital afterlife is grounded in specific, concrete details, making the thematic payoff deeply felt and intellectually satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from significant thematic overstatement, which undermines resonance. Phrases like "to map empathy onto action" and the final paragraph's summary of the moral ("the true power lay not in the stone but in the willingness to listen...") state the theme directly rather than letting it emerge from the narrative. This explicit moralizing, especially at the end, replaces earned subtext with a tidy, didactic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of accepting endings emerges organically from the setting and action, which is a significant strength. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements in the final third. The line "solace is not the absence of endings, but the gentle acceptance of their approach" functions as a thematic echo, stating the moral rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is severely undermined by direct, repetitive statements that function as a thematic summary. Phrases like "mismatched destinies could still compose a harmonious harvest" are stated explicitly, replacing resonant imagery with a concluding moral. This "thematic echo" in the final paragraphs removes all subtext and treats the reader as if they cannot grasp the point without it being spelled out.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of wisdom being an active, participatory event is thoughtfully developed through image and action. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt explanation. The line where the Keeper explains that the "true sanctuary lived not in stone or sand, but in the act of listening through peripheral awareness" is a direct thematic statement that feels like a moral, slightly flattening the earned resonance of the preceding scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of transmuting pain into beauty is central and well-supported by the story's imagery. However, the narrative occasionally lapses into telling over showing, explicitly stating its thematic aims. The final dialogue, "Because hope, like light, finds its way through every crack," functions as a thematic summary that slightly undermines the power of the final image by resolving ambiguity with a platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of language as a living, evolving entity emerges organically from the central metaphor of the crystal encoding the library's memory. The story avoids simplistic moralizing, and the final image of Mara leaving her own page as a "delicate prayer" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. While the line about the "living pulse of humanity" verges on being too direct, it feels earned within the climactic epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is the story's great strength, emerging organically from the interplay of character, setting, and action. The central question of how to hold onto memory in the face of inevitable decay is explored through powerful, recurring motifs like tides, echoes, and old media. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer, resolving not the problem of forgetting but the prophet’s relationship to it, avoiding any hint of a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thematic resonance is the story's greatest strength, exploring purpose within chaos through the powerful recurring motif of the "luminous ache." The final image of the observatory as a beacon offers a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question. A minor deduction is applied for the line "constant change is possible when the heart remains changelessly constant," which verges on summarizing its own theme.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of finding wholeness in brokenness is heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. It is stated almost directly ("wholeness can emerge from brokenness," "endings are not loss but transformation"), replacing resonant subtext with overt moralizing. The final image of the staff taking vinyl pieces is a literal, rather than symbolic, enactment of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central theme of closing loops is well-integrated into the plot and final image. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its own symbolism in lines like "The key's purpose, then, was to bridge the loop between observation and revelation..." This thematic echo functions as a form of authorial moralizing, which slightly undermines the earned resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of redeeming mistakes is central and powerfully integrated into the story’s core action. However, the piece undermines its own resonant imagery with an overly explicit thematic statement in the final paragraph: "Mistakes are not failures; they are the dark matter that binds the universe together." This is a classic Thematic Echo, a summary that replaces the earned resonance of the star-mapping image, significantly reducing the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of sharing quiet, gentle light is developed effectively through the central imagery of the polished sea glass. However, the story undermines its own subtext with an overly explicit thematic statement in the final sentence. The line "Thus she taught the world that the softest glow..." functions as a moral, replacing the resonant power of the final image with a direct, authorial explanation that feels unearned and reduces the piece's complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of healing trauma is powerfully conceived but undercut by a lack of subtext. Key thematic concepts ("honeyed hush," "grafting new meaning") are stated repeatedly, functioning more as labels than emergent ideas. The final sentence, "...a future where pain could rest in honeyed hush," acts as a direct summary, a Thematic Echo that reduces the resonance of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    A coherent theme on the nature of artistic creation against convention emerges organically from the story's central metaphor. Most of the development is subtle, woven into image and action. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. A minor weakness is a line like "...a mosaic built against the current of conventional narratives," which borders on stating the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of memory and tradition as a remedy for loss emerges organically from the story’s central magical conceit. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into explicit thematic summary, undermining the evocative imagery that came before. The line "...they learned that the remedy for loss lay not in steel or fire, but in memory sung through forgotten songs" is a clear "thematic echo" that states the moral directly, reducing the resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of creating enduring meaning from discarded fragments is developed with elegance and restraint. Rather than stating a moral, the story's final image of the plate as a "living compass" offers a powerful, non-literal answer to its central questions about patience and art. The closing realization that her work is a "covenant" provides a resonant and complex thematic capstone.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of preserving ephemeral wonder through patient reason is elegantly developed, culminating in the resonant metaphor of the cellar as a library. However, the story occasionally lapses into telling its theme too directly. The final sentence’s phrase, "a lesson in listening to the periphery of existence," feels like an authorial summary that slightly flattens the otherwise subtle and earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transmuting sorrow into art and release emerges organically from the story's imagery and actions. The final promise—that any soul can "let it calcify into art"—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of grief. However, the final line, "burdens were no longer shackles but constellations to be admired," verges on a thematic echo, slightly overstating the moral of the preceding image and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme emerges powerfully through the central metaphor of carving, but the story undermines its own subtext with explicit thematic statements. The final sentence, "loss can be a tool, not a trap," is a critical flaw, a "thematic echo" that replaces resonant imagery with a tidy moral. This direct summary prevents the piece from trusting its reader and achieving true literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    The themes of memory, regret, and the re-forging of purpose are woven seamlessly into the narrative fabric without a single line of overt moralizing. The story's central transaction—trading stories for a memory—is a powerful and concrete metaphor for how we process the past. The final image of Mara walking toward the horizon offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial state of paralysis, fully earning its emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of resurrecting hope through ingenuity is present but is delivered with heavy-handed directness, undermining subtext. Phrases like "functionally creative thinking could resurrect hope" and the final paragraph's summary of the transformation function as thematic statements rather than emergent resonance. The story explicitly states its moral, particularly in the final third, which lessens the impact of the otherwise potent final image.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of reconciling creativity with past failure emerges organically from the central conflict and imagery. The final image of the memory-counting clock offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the theme is slightly undercut by lines that verge on direct statement, such as the clock standing as "a testament to his own excruciatingly gentle resilience," which reads like a thematic label and lessens the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's themes are overt and repeatedly stated rather than emerging from subtext. Lines like "he realized that hindsight clarity was not merely a recollection, but a tool to dismantle the false structures" function as direct thematic explanations. This heavy-handedness, a form of Thematic Echo, leaves little room for reader inference and flattens the potential for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of preserving ancient wisdom is woven beautifully through the central metaphor of knotwork and memory. The final image of sowing knowledge like seeds is resonant. The score is slightly tempered by the line, "He understood that preserving the ancient methods required not only memory but the willingness to listen eternally," which verges on a direct thematic statement, briefly telling what the rest of the story shows so elegantly.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding healing through storytelling and remembrance is seamlessly integrated and developed through the central metaphor of a "geography of healing." The story wisely avoids overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge from its potent imagery. The final image of the traveler following a map of his own words is a resonant and non-literal conclusion that powerfully recharges the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of integrating technology and nature emerges organically and the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the story's final paragraphs suffer from multiple instances of thematic summary, explicitly stating the moral in phrases like "a testament that even a flawed genesis could be redeemed" and "the kingdom learned that beauty could be forged..." This over-explanation dilutes the power of the earned imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of healing scars is powerful but executed with a heavy hand, severely undermining subtext. The story repeatedly states its own moral in declarative sentences, such as "confirming that scars can indeed sing." The final paragraphs devolve into thematic summary, explicitly telling the reader the meaning of the events, which violates the "show, don't tell" principle at the most crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of patient defiance overcoming skepticism is coherent but undermined by heavy-handed thematic statements in the resolution. The final paragraphs shift from showing to telling, explicitly summarizing the story's moral ("even a skeptic can become a keeper of light..."). This "thematic echo" preempts reader interpretation and replaces earned resonance with a less powerful, declarative summary, weakening an otherwise strong thematic foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of creating through memory and love rather than destructive power emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery. The final image of the rising filament of light is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. The score is slightly capped by a moment of over-explicitness near the end: "...she understood that light could travel without fire, carried instead by memory, mathematics, and love," which states the theme directly rather than letting the images do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is the story's great strength, emerging organically from a powerful synthesis of recurring images—butterflies, ribbons, poems, and stone. The final image of the water-collecting gravestone offers a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the shape of grief. It achieves a resonant and complex emotional aftereffect without resorting to direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of small acts of repair having large consequences is repeatedly stated rather than allowed to emerge from the story's particulars. The narrative suffers from heavy thematic moralizing, culminating in the final paragraph's thesis statement: "...the chorus of countless souls who dared to mend the world, one modest carving at a time." This explicit summary undermines the resonance of the preceding imagery, replacing subtext with a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of intention and memory is potent and well-supported by the story's core imagery. However, the final two paragraphs shift from resonant implication to direct thematic statement. The line, "In the end, the shape of intentions was not a weapon but a seed," is a form of thematic moralizing that undermines the power of the preceding scene work, explaining the conclusion instead of letting it resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's theme is intelligent but delivered with a heavy hand, culminating in direct authorial statements that explain the moral. The final paragraph functions as a thesis summary ("true mastery lay in embracing what one does not know..."), a critical flaw that violates the "show, don't tell" principle and replaces resonant subtext with a tidy, explicit moral, which is heavily penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of art's restorative power emerges organically from the central metaphors of light, dust, and sound. Unfortunately, the final line—"And so... the city learned that even dust... could become a storyteller"—is a heavy-handed thematic statement. This moralizing summary undercuts the resonance of the preceding images by explaining what should have been left to inference.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of preserving truth against time is powerfully rendered through resonant imagery. However, the final paragraphs contain a direct thematic statement: "true safety lives inside the brave act of feeling." This explicit moralizing, a "Thematic Echo," slightly undermines the subtextual power of the final image, preventing the theme from emerging solely through the story's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of synthesizing competing truths is potent and emerges organically from the central conflict. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic declaration. The line, "I finally accept that agonizing over a single truth is less fruitful than nurturing a chorus of truths," functions as a direct moral summary, a significant flaw that weakens the resonance of the final paragraphs by explaining what the preceding images had already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of art's restorative power is central and emerges organically from the initial scene. However, the story undermines its subtext with overly explicit statements. The final paragraph, in particular, drifts into thematic summary ("denoting each lesson as a step toward a world where art never vanished"), which reads like a moral and flattens the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of renewal through a "gentle rebellion" is potent and well-supported by the story's central imagery. However, the piece occasionally undermines its own subtext with lines that read like thematic summaries. Phrases like "a gentle rebellion against the stale complacency of the old world" and "a quiet pruning of old ideologies" state the theme directly, diluting the power of the evocative, action-based storytelling and bordering on the Thematic Echo anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of finding wonder in routine is central, but its execution lacks subtlety. The story shifts from showing this theme to explicitly explaining it in the final third. Lines like “the drone beehive failure had not been a loss but a pause, waiting for the echo to be heard” and "The reveal... allowed her to fulfill her motivation" function as thematic summaries, replacing resonant imagery with a direct moral and weakening the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.2)
    While a coherent theme of attentive silence emerges, its delivery is compromised by overt authorial statements. The final third of the story explicitly explains its own meaning, particularly in the line, "I realized that my role...was not simply to observe, but to catalyze..." This thematic summary replaces earned resonance with a direct moral, undermining the subtext built by the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is severely undermined by direct, repetitive statements that function as authorial moralizing. Phrases like "to welcome nuance into a certainty" and "nuance was not a flaw but a bridge" are stated multiple times, destroying subtext and replacing resonant discovery with didactic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding stability and perpetuity through imperfection is explored with nuance and intellectual rigor. The story avoids didacticism, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the central metaphor of the chipped die. The final image of the staircase as "both a cage and a key" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions about failure and success.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of remembered kindness is beautifully integrated through action and imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic statement, most notably, "...proving that strangers indeed remember kindness." This line functions as a "thematic echo," articulating the story's thesis directly to the reader, which detracts from the otherwise resonant, non-literal conclusion. This direct statement prevents the theme from achieving true subtlety and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of cultural preservation through living practice is potent and woven skillfully through the story's core motifs (lens, bread, initials). However, the story falters at the climax by violating the "show, don't tell" principle. Liora's whispered line, "the true rescue lay not in preserving objects but in thawing hearts," is a direct thematic statement that feels like authorial moralizing, undermining the subtlety built throughout the piece and triggering a significant penalty for a Thematic Echo in the final section.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of ingenuity overcoming destiny is present, but its delivery is heavy-handed, culminating in a final paragraph that explicitly states the story's moral. This thematic summary ("ingenuity can reverse even the most stubborn puzzles") replaces earned resonance with direct explanation, a critical flaw that treats the reader as if they missed the point. This direct moralizing, especially at the end, flattens the narrative's potential for lingering ambiguity and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of confronting fear by embracing its paradoxical nature ("snuff it with its own flame") is artfully integrated through recurring imagery of reflections and curses. The story avoids a simple moral, culminating in a resonant final choice that reweights the entire narrative. The central question about the price of mastering one's dread is answered not with a statement, but with a powerful, lingering dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme is potent but its delivery is undermined by overt authorial statements. The line "His motivation was simple yet profound: to turn obstacles into instruments..." explicitly states the theme, functioning as a "Thematic Echo" that preempts reader discovery. While the final image resonates powerfully, the repeated direct explanations of the core concept weaken the subtext and transform a subtle idea into a stated moral, which is a significant flaw in literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The themes of non-verbal communication and interconnectedness emerge organically from the story’s beautiful central images. The final realization is potent, but slightly undermined by an overly explicit thematic statement in the last paragraph. The line "the true lost expedition was...the city’s own willingness to listen" borders on moralizing, slightly reducing the resonance of an otherwise subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of "noble lies" is explored with nuance, presenting them as both a protective shield and a cage. The story successfully integrates this concept into the setting and the central object. However, the ending succumbs to thematic overstatement. The line "his emotionally rational heart acknowledging that compassion could coexist with stark fact" is a direct summary of the theme, a moralizing beat that replaces the resonance of the final image with a less impactful intellectual conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of memory versus decay is seamlessly integrated, emerging organically from the character's actions and the central imagery. The story avoids didacticism, allowing the final image of the inkwell reflecting in the moonlight to provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The motif of ink binding silence into memory is potent and well-developed.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of truth versus myth is present, but it is delivered through explicit statements and repetitive motifs like "reclaimed stillness" and "dappled resolve." These phrases are overused to the point of becoming thematic labels, preventing the theme from emerging organically from the narrative's particulars. The ending states its moral ("truth outshone fear") instead of letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding hope within sorrow is powerfully conveyed through the central paradox of ascending while descending. The final image of the cranes is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's problem of grief. However, the piece occasionally lapses into direct thematic statement, as with "The paradox...mirrors his own heart," slightly undermining the subtext by explaining an emotional state the imagery had already made clear.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story explores a resonant theme of finding meaning after trauma, but its execution lacks subtlety. The piece repeatedly explains its own symbolism, culminating in direct thematic statements like, "He realized the unused potential was not a place but a state of being." This thematic echo in a key moment replaces earned resonance with a tidy, over-articulated moral, weakening the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of belonging is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The narrative repeatedly states its own thesis, culminating in overt moralizing that flattens any potential for resonance. Phrases like "the frequency of belonging was the pulse of every living star" function as thematic summaries, not earned insights. This heavy-handedness, especially in the final third, replaces subtext with a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of memory and truth is central, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The climax hinges on a literal, written-out aphorism: "the weight of a withheld truth is heavier than any crown." This is a severe case of thematic echo, stating the story's moral directly and robbing the final moments of earned resonance that should have been carried by image and subtext alone.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of forgiveness as an earned process is coherent, but its delivery is too explicit, violating the principle of emergence. The note 'Mistakes remembered, lessons kept' and the final thought "forgiveness is not a gift but a bridge built from honesty" function as direct thematic statements. This moralizing in the final third, a form of Thematic Echo, prevents the theme from resonating through subtext and instead presents it as a stated conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of resilience is evident, but the story undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements. The promise whispered to the wind "to carry the memory of his regrets as lessons rather than shackles" is a direct summary of the story's moral, flattening the resonance of the final images. This heavy-handedness prevents the theme from emerging with the complexity and ambiguity required for top-tier work, feeling more like a conclusion than a resonant discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story's theme is potent but its delivery lacks subtlety. Key thematic ideas are stated directly in prompt-like language, such as the mirror's whisper ("Empathy is a seed...") and the narrator's realization ("my journey was not just about erasing the past..."). This heavy-handedness culminates in a final paragraph that summarizes the moral, undercutting the resonance of the final image and earning a significant penalty for Thematic Echo.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of love transcending death is woven beautifully through the story's imagery, particularly the cycle of the phoenix and the permanent moonlight. However, the resonance is significantly weakened by the final paragraph's tendency toward direct statement. The line "Liora understood that the true magic was not the transformation itself but the cosmic intimacy" is a thematic summary that explains the story's point to the reader, a "Thematic Echo" that lessens the power of the preceding evocative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic resonance is strong, emerging organically from the central ritual and culminating in a powerful, non-literal final image. The theme of healing and reclaiming time is handled with sophistication, though a few phrases like "cloudbound repentance" state their purpose a bit too directly, slightly reducing subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of transmuting sorrow into hope through compassionate, non-violent action emerges organically from the story’s central conceit and imagery. The final image of the garden and the repurposing of Kwan Yin's tear serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of universal grief. The story avoids moralizing, allowing its powerful central metaphor of "stitching peace" to carry the thematic weight beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transformation is woven through compelling imagery, but the story undermines its own subtext with over-articulation. The final paragraph explicitly states the story's moral ("...she learned that to understand the texture of transformation she must first listen..."), a thematic echo that replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary. This direct statement significantly flattens the complexity and dilutes the emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of "revolution of light without flame" is potent and skillfully woven through the story's core images: the cradle, the luminous walls, and the sundial. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The piece avoids overt moralizing, but the final sentence comes close to stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the otherwise elegant symbolic work.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of agency versus determinism is powerfully explored through the central ritual. However, the resonance is slightly diminished by moments of thematic overstatement, such as the direct explanation that "the universe’s patterns were not fixed, but could be coaxed by intentional design." This moves from earned insight toward a stated moral, pulling back from flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of re-contextualizing trauma is potent and emerges from the central metaphor, the story undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements. The final paragraphs act as an epilogue that over-explains the meaning, particularly the line "the cartography of scars was not a wound to be healed but a terrain to be traversed." This direct moralizing flattens the resonance that the powerful preceding imagery had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the theme is ambitious and interesting, its execution is marred by heavy-handed repetition and direct statement. The story repeatedly articulates its own thesis, most egregiously in the final paragraphs ("the duel had become a lecture without a lectern, a question turned into a path"). This sermonizing replaces earned resonance with a declarative moral, a significant flaw that undermines the otherwise elegant symbolic framework.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of forging beauty from anarchy is powerfully rendered through the central imagery of the library's reconstruction. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its theme directly, such as the line "reminded them why they rebuilt: to forge beauty from anarchy." This slightly undermines the subtext, though the final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion that avoids a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is developed with superb subtlety, emerging organically from the central symbolic action rather than from statement. The core tension between artistic creation and determinism is resolved in the resonant final image of the serenaded clock and the compasses becoming stars. This offers a non-literal, emotionally potent answer to the story's central question, rewriting the world's rules through a single, perfect performance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of balancing empirical truth with collective memory emerges organically from the plot without a single line of exposition. The final image of the fragile, living shoot under the gathering storm provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It's a complex, beautifully rendered thematic resolution that avoids any simplistic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of memory, regret, and forgiveness is woven deeply into the story's fabric through motifs of tides, lace, and color. However, the final beats verge on over-articulation. The line, "In that moment, the tutor understood that the color of unspoken apologies was not a pigment but a feeling," functions as a thematic statement that slightly undermines the resonant power of the final image, preventing the theme from emerging purely through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of gradual change and humility emerges organically from dust patterns and decay, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing, as in the notebook entry joining the "chorus."

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of finding purpose in pauses emerges organically from frost patterns and glass refracting, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights survival without stated moral, inviting reflection on adaptation. Subtext in images like scorched testament avoids direct statements, earning wisdom through specifics like the singing glass. Some ambiguity lingers meaningfully, but epiphanies border on pseudo-profundity in the ending paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of transforming loss into wonder emerges organically from images like the fork's tone and lighthouse chord, resisting tidy morals with ambiguity in unheard stories; final image offers resonant, non-literal answer to silence without statement.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of revitalizing rest through distress signals emerges organically from Marlow's actions and motifs like the fractured lens, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights death as sanctuary without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications adds complexity, but some ambiguity feels purposeful yet borders on vagueness, avoiding tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of solidarity amid isolation emerges organically from bell echoes and anonymous acts, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights quiet as a lifeline without moralizing. Subtext in silences and implications invites reflection on endurance. No overt symbolism, but recurring bell charges ambiguity meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of compassion's rediscovery emerges organically from breathing rituals and the reservoir's lattice, culminating in a resonant final image of glowing blossoms without stated morals; subtext in unspoken love's echoes invites reflection on healing's continuity. Avoids sentimentality through concrete light surges, though ambiguity borders on vagueness in "symphony of healed hearts."

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of time's fluidity emerges organically from motifs like disintegrating photographs and hyperbolic corridors, culminating in a resonant final image of the glowing garden without stated moral, inviting reflection on loss and renewal. Subtext in vaporous threads stitching past to present enriches complexity, avoiding tidy binaries. Emotional aftereffect lingers through quaking reverie, tied to Mara's arc, though some ambiguity borders confusion in abstract phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of breaking oppressive silence to sow resilience emerges organically from events like decoding the lullaby melody and the vault's inscription, culminating in a resonant final image of the green shoot without stated morals. Subtext operates through images like the strange-fletched arrow scattering light, inviting reflection on freedom from unexpected tools. Emotional aftereffect is concrete via the breeze's jasmine scent, avoiding sentimentality, though complexity is somewhat tidy without strong counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of memory as a forge for mending broken trust emerges organically from images like the teal rose and amber mast, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer via the device's chord without moralizing; subtext in absences and sparks invites reflection on loss and rebirth. Emotional aftereffect arises from particulars like the orchard's breathing, embracing complexity without false equivalence. The core concept integrates through events, but occasional abstract statements slightly dilute resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of preserving fleeting brilliance emerges organically from images like dancing moonbeams and crystal scrolls, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights Lira's premise without moralizing; subtext in silences and implications adds complexity, though some abstractions border on direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of nurturing fragile equilibrium amid thaw emerges organically from glassblowing images and the bookmark motif, resisting tidy morals by embracing ambiguity in control's illusion.

    Theme emerges non-literally through bread initials and lens refracting hope: "true rescue lay not in preserving objects but in thawing hearts" reweights displacement into "art could breathe again" without moralizing. Final image answers central question with earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through yoyo mechanics and stone's conduit role; sailor's "pulsing rhythm" reweights fate without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo but "latent radiance" lacks deeper integration.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the prophet's actions: "harmony from obstacles" crystallizes in the final image of the orchard "humming with restless euphony." Avoids moralizing by showing rather than stating the transformation, with the "sketched resonance" concept reweighting the premise through concrete particulars like fruit swelling with bass.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars—no moralizing—culminating in the resonant final image: "truth... travel onward on unseen rails" reweights the central question by transforming "pit of lies" into forward motion. Avoids thematic echo; the dissolution of noble lies as "transparent honesty" charges closure without abstraction. Emotional complexity (truth's warmth vs. pit's darkness) lingers beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete action (placing notes as "small rebellion") not abstraction; final image ("hush of her blaze grew louder") offers resonant answer to memory's persistence. Avoids moralizing while embracing complexity of "interlaced absence" as both loss and legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through stamped glyphs and tidal buoys, avoiding moralizing. Final image—ink settling on the charter slab—resonates as a non-literal answer to "honest origins," reweighting the sunken city’s rebirth without stated morals or balanced toggles.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: origami cranes as "folded fragments of sorrow turned into hope" avoids moralizing. Final image reweights premise via paradox ("ascend while descending") without stating moral. Near-miss with "luminous torment of memory" in climax—avoids full thematic echo but borders on sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through concrete action: "hunt was not for external treasure" crystallizes the shift from loss to potential. Final image ("shards like constellation of hopes") reweights "unused pools" without moralizing—complexity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars (star trails, chip resonance), avoiding moralizing. Final image ("night sky stitched with fresh star trails") offers non-literal answer to belonging, though "pulse of every living star" risks thematic echo in closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges purely through concrete particulars: the driftwood phrase reweights "truth's weight" without moralizing, and the final watch image offers resonant closure; near-miss for 9.0 due to "tempered regret" bordering on abstraction in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: 'forgiveness is not a gift but a bridge' avoids moralizing by rooting wisdom in the drawer pull’s 'shared turning point,' though 'lessons kept' risks platitudinal undertones in the parchment reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through compass/utility poles as non-literal answer to "align heart and action," avoiding moralizing; "regrets as lessons rather than shackles" earns resonance without stated moral per 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through baseball/mirror objects without moralizing; final line reweights "dirty past" as compass, but "Empathy is a seed" quote risks thematic echo despite diegetic framing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.1)
    Thematic echo dominates final paragraph ("true magic was cosmic intimacy"), violating organic emergence; tidy resolution ("humble tribute to rebirth") replaces earned ambiguity with moralizing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through "crystal blossom" reweighting "lost time" as active redemption, but "cloudbound repentance" remains abstractly stated in closure rather than embodied, failing the non-literal answer requirement for 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    Thematic echo in final paragraph ("learned that to understand the texture...") explicitly states the lesson, replacing earned resonance with moralizing. Firefly release charges closure image, but prophecy fulfillment undermines organic emergence by resolving through external validation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through "light without flame" imagery and final phosphorescent moss, avoiding moralizing. But the cradle's effect is told ("guards began to question orders") not dramatized, weakening the non-literal answer to revolution's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically through rock sequences and dust behavior, but "lingering promise" becomes thematic echo in final paragraph with "beacon for all who seek sacred patterns" moralizing. Avoids sentimentality yet over-tells the core concept.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through "scars as cities/river" metaphor; final image reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids thematic echo despite conceptual abstraction, earning resonance through luminous ink’s "glow against darkroom dim light."

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the needle card's evolution from "constellations" to "waypoints," avoiding moralizing. The resonant final image ("where does a question go when it is no longer a question but a destination?") reweights the duel's purpose without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (“beauty from anarchy”) stated outright in Lira’s final whisper, triggering Thematic Echo penalty. Wildflowers symbolize hope but never face threat, making resonance feel unearned. No non-literal answer to central question—the garden’s song is declared, not revealed through action.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically through "rewriting schedules" vs time's tyranny. Final clock stop reweights time conceptually without moralizing, avoiding thematic echo in the resonant closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "petals a repository of forgotten chants" reweights cultural memory without moralizing; final image of "balance she vowed to keep" offers resonant non-literal answer to preservation dilemma.
