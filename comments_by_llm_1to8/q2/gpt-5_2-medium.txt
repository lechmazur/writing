    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (studio, firebomb survival, ledger strip). The causal lens holds: attempt → retracing → frost-reading → discovery → glass-sealed proof → schoolhouse reveal. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes the bomb was rehearsed at the camp ring, narrowing the threat to a specific conspirator. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (councilman exposed, protagonist's purpose clarified) with visible cost (risk, labor, public confrontation), though the cost to the councilman reads more summary than scene at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (winterglass conservatory, post-silence world, Orren's survivor status). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the tuning-fork calibration sequence, and the closure reweights the empty slot from loss to purpose. One meaningful deepening occurs when Orren's memory-test proves the forks stabilize vibration, narrowing the system's flaw. Cost is present but muted—Orren's trauma is referenced but not viscerally paid at closure; the final image reconfigures meaning without a sharp felt price, landing as Conceptual Repricing with moderate charge.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational undertow. The piece teaches its pattern early—flooded streets, kelp curtains, wax-sealed books—and maintains coherent pressure as Marek descends through impossible spaces toward the brass receiver. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the library "accepts my ledger," distress signals resolve to "a single long tone," and the "chased stillness" stops running. Cost is legible on the page: bleeding ears, seam whispers, hours of bracing the beam, and the permanent burden of "keeping the cracked lens as proof." One meaningful deepening occurs when the catalog card lists Marek himself as "the last volume to be shelved," reweighting his stake from external duty to existential entanglement. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Marek, coast, package, dusk descent).

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening (ridge, arbor, sanctions, Amira) and operates in accumulative mode: repeated touches of bell, donations, midnight runs, and letters build pressure toward the daylight bell-ring as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The officer visit and route-change constitute a meaningful tightening that narrows options and forces tactical adaptation. Cost is visible in the risk of inspection and the need for decoy carts, and the final image reconfigures anonymity from fear into collective resilience. The lens holds; closure lands with conceptual cost (ongoing exposure, endurance under threat). One deduction: the route-change beat summarizes key action ("guided her through alleys") rather than dramatizing the turn, slightly softening closure stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: foggy setting, recurring tear motif, and breath-work pattern converge to charge the final petal-rain image. Orientation anchors (Mara, viaduct, twilight, past-life trigger) land by the first third. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (breath rhythm releases the sternum knot, petals fall, unused love "keeps moving"), and the cost—permission to let go—is felt. One cap: the pilgrim's guidance enables rather than opposes, so escalation reads as deepening rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors POV, bridge-garden setting, and hired task by the second sentence; no delay. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accretes through hyperbolic geometry, fading photos, halo-fragment use, until the final tightening ("maze was smaller, simpler") reweights the dominant stake (time's texture discovered through release, not preservation). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis variant—protagonist renounces clinging to fixed images, the woman disintegrates, and Lio emerges clear-eyed; cost is legible (photos to dust, woman to flecks). One persistent constraint (the bridge "punishes those who stare directly") shapes tactics throughout (indirect viewing via fragment, hyperbolic curves).

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Closure lands as Decisive Change (seeds spill into hands) married to Resonant Reconfiguration (her staggering grace becomes a plan for everyone), with visible cost: the trembling chained wrist, the drag through crowds, the forfeit of safety. Orientation anchors quickly (wall down, carnival center, militia threat). One meaningful tightening when engines arrive forces the false-key trap. The cost is legible in the final image: exhaustion transformed into collective future.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on the page: Mara obtains Rell's confession (Decisive Change) and chooses to melt the remaining brass into new housings, reconfiguring her mission from personal vengeance to systemic design—a visible shift with cost (she lets go of the personal artifact). The causal lens holds: synesthesia → collected absences → prototype design → imprinted silences reveal the click → confession. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (Mara, greenhouse workshop, aurora night). One meaningful tightening occurs when the prototype bleeds in stored gaps and exposes the knife-click, narrowing Rell's options and forcing his admission.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines; the emerald station, golden sunset, and Lio's reputation are established early. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: recurring images (sunset/moonbeams, portraits, destiny's door) are seeded and return in the final beat. Closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (tearing the portrait in half, letting "the sunset side fall back"), but the cost—what Lio forfeits by abandoning his craft—remains abstract ("strange mercy," "luminous disbelief") rather than legible on the page. The moonbeam jar's mechanics (humming near iron or oath, casting "moonbeam script") are introduced but their rules stay decorative; the door "went quiet, as if it respected the bargain" signals convenience rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accumulates through layered images (melting ice, narration habit, glass panels) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Mara's decision to stop narrating and wait is Charged Poise, crystallizing options with undeniable cost (the silence "felt like a door opening instead of a sentence ending"). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2 (Mara, research station, coastal thaw). One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from internal guilt ("the silence afterward was a verdict she carried") to external action (crafting transparent rooms, laying out the bookmark). The ending reconfigures the station from bunker to observatory with felt cost legible in "the quiet felt like a door opening." Closure lands on the page under the accumulative lens with cost visible in her shift from performance to waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change: Mara walks in trembling, exposes Vaughn via shell recording, signs her real name, and steps into a future she authors. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative accents (shell motif, fear-as-compass realization). Orientation anchors (stunt double, props vault, library, soundstage) arrive promptly. One meaningful tightening: the cipher message narrows options to a specific location/time, forcing the confrontation. Cost is visible (Mara's tears, vulnerability on display) but the crew's instant turn on Vaughn deflates stakes slightly—no tactical struggle, no price for recruitment. The shell's "recorded confession he thought erased" introduces a mild convenience (how did old takes stitch into a usable confession?) that isn't fully earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (fort, storm, pebbles, booklet dissolution) toward a final cadence shift where the narrator begins the map "guided by what stayed unspoken." Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the narrator no longer panics when the last star vanishes, crystallizing a new orientation. Orientation anchors arrive early (ridge fort, garrison, chapel). Cost is oblique: the gilded booklet is ruined and the old star-navigation abandoned, but the emotional or tactical price of that loss is asserted rather than dramatized in a beat that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who (J-17), where (academy courtyard), and when (first evening post-procedure) within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens: causal in the discovery-and-loop sequence, accumulative in the stacking of timeline variations ("amalgamate"), resolving through Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when J-17 renounces further use and walks on "composed." The closure lands with felt cost—the violin's hairline crack signals each loop's toll, and J-17's choice to stop forecloses the door to infinite retries. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crack forces the decision, narrowing options from exploration to preservation. The final image ("leaving behind a courtyard that finally belonged to one timeline") charges prior material by reconfiguring the program's meaning: second chance as curation, not erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story uses an accumulative/textural lens: Mara's nightly copying of doodles builds pattern and density, and the lens discovery at midpoint reweights the meaning of the tickets, leading to a resonant reconfiguration at closure when she lays out the evidence and signs her name. Closure is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: honesty reframes suspicion into shared transparency with conceptual cost (her complicity exposed). Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, context by ~100 words). One weakness: the final reveal that Eli's conspiracy was benign (caption system for deaf children) arrives as exposition rather than dramatized discovery, softening the causal charge of the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening. The core closure—Elias confessing to the hedges and the meter detecting alignment—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization) under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building to a Causal confession moment). Cost is present but somewhat abstract: "the physiology of someone finally aligned with his work" tells more than it shows. The ending image of leaving one marble and the line "proof had to be tended like any garden" reprices the stakes, but the meter's green-to-climbing reading feels more like validation than a path foreclosed with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens—causal linkage (nexus activation → rotor vision → repair) braided with accumulative texture (recurring images of warmth, breath, wings). Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (station, Mara, Sen, lab). Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the nexus is reset to neutral, time resumes forward, and the "sideways secrets" line charges the final image with conceptual cost. The cost is felt (Mara's intervention forecloses further experimentation) but remains somewhat oblique; a sharper on-page constraint or visible sacrifice would tighten the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (water-stain images accumulate into a map-following ritual). Orientation is prompt but complete by the opening beat. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (musicians gather to play Varga's hidden arrangement), yet cost remains implied rather than legible—no on-page sentence shows what Lena forfeits or what the collective performance precludes. The linked moves (program → gaps → ledger → musicians) cohere under the lens, but the ending summarizes arrival rather than dramatizing a decisive pressure point or reweighted image.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accretes pressure through layered reflection anchored to present objects (botanical illustration, smudged notebook, aurora) and micro-choices (pointing to a petal, speaking the confession aloud). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator's certainties "sway without breaking" after the confession, an Earned Stasis that forecloses the false-certainty trap with felt relational cost. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One substantive tightening occurs when Mara smudges the field notebook, collapsing the binary of observation/confession and enabling the final truth-telling.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on the page as Decisive Change: the narrator turns the wheel back, sealing the bay, and chooses to call Mara—ending her own complicity with visible relational cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the tunnel-mouth paragraph. The lens reads Causal with clear because/therefore linkage: confession → tunnel → valve → passage → tag → call. One beat (the punch-clock confrontation) leans on external staging rather than protagonist choice, preventing full 9+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric density and a pattern of silence-as-regeneration. Orientation arrives adequately by ~120 words (overgrown library, chronicle keeper role). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the keeper returns to the library and accepts decay as script—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The swan-fold mechanism and the refuge visit function as a meditative loop rather than a causal tightening, leaving the before/after less decisive than the rubric requires for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors efficiently (Ridge, clinic, Mara's silence by ~80 words). The eclipse functions as a pressure point that narrows options and the curl-sharing creates a meaningful turn when Mara hums, then speaks. Closure lands on the page with cost (vulnerability of sharing the keepsake, grief acknowledged aloud). The drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: therapeutic choices link causally while sensory density during totality deepens the stakes. One meaningful tightening is achieved, though the final paragraph's thematic summary ("not about grand miracles") edges toward telling where resonance had already been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates density through nested discoveries (hearth → diaries → tapestry → shadows → understanding) that reweight the opening premise. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Lysa realizes the axis cannot be restored because dreamers are gone, so she pivots to cataloging the shift—a renunciation with visible cost (the impossible plea "Set the axis back" must be refused). Orientation anchors are present early (silo library, Lysa, post-dream world). One meaningful deepening occurs when the tapestry fragment's shadows and diary confessions converge to reveal the library's purpose, narrowing Lysa's options to documentation rather than repair.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lian burns the coded fortunes and writes an uncoded message, foreclosing the spycraft path with visible cost (the destruction of her intelligence-gathering channel). The causal lens holds: her earlier coded cookies reach the wrong hands, triggering the patrol boat, forcing the lens change and courier escape. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening beat (Golden Lotus, Lian, fortune writer, microdot specs). One meaningful tightening occurs when the searchlights arrive and Lian must redirect the beam, narrowing her options and raising the stakes for both herself and the courier.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Selo, Mara), where (Dimensional Anchor), and stakes (possession nearing completion) within the opening lines. The causal lens holds: Selo's looped anaphora disrupts the parasite's straight commands, the chiasmus surfaces Mara's assumption, the memory loosens the grip, and her circle completes the exorcism. Cost is visible in Mara's shivering and the rift's trembling, though the climactic moment—Mara drawing the circle—feels slightly understated given the buildup. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ironic litany forces the parasite's choice, which Mara exploits.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (glass spire, frozen lake, fortune-cookie writer). The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the protagonist stands "in two dawns at once" and receives instructions to keep writing—but the cost remains oblique: "no longer afraid of time" describes relief without showing what was forfeited or altered tactically. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mirrored horizon "slides" and the memory map aligns, creating a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake, sufficient for this length under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric compression; the tablet generates fractured timelines that accumulate until Lysa chooses one strand and the others fold. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first third. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise transitioning to Earned Stasis—where pressing the tablet to her chest and choosing to stay forecloses the drifting pattern with visible cost (heavier, one timeline). The cost is legible and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of silence-as-parasite through layered images (filament of hush, mirrored echo, wrapped drums) and tightens via the backward-phonograph reversal, culminating in the filament's snap and the Listener's retreat. Orientation anchors (Mara, quarry path, cavern) land cleanly by the opening lines. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the filament snaps, the drum "thrum[s] cleanly," and Mara pockets the needle with a new lesson, reweighting prior numbness with tactile forward motion. Cost is felt in the sustained effort and the Listener's "shuddering sigh," though the victory image could carry sharper consequence. One meaningful tightening (the backward-crank sequence) drives the reconfiguration without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. The inciting pigeon message triggers a because/therefore chain: warning → lateral evasion → warehouse infiltration → log copying → pigeon release → escape. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist writes down "the truth I had learned, promising myself that solitude would remain a choice, not a cage"—a crystallized stance with felt cost (permanent exposure risk, reliance on fragile data transmission). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line four. One minor slip: the follower's misdirection at the end feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned by prior tactical setup.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with situational elements: the story teaches a lyric, recursive pattern early (highways hum, energy beings feed on motion, rope as compass) and accumulates pressure through the grotto mapping sequence toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—the slipknot solution and its subsequent use by drivers. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (highways, energy beings, roadside poet). The closure unit (slipknot + drivers' choices + narrator's restraint) lands with conceptual cost: the narrator keeps drifting rather than opening the knot forever, trusting "choices human sized." One meaningful deepening occurs when the beings demand a final exchange and the narrator invents the third option. Cost is legible but oblique—restraint rather than direct forfeiture—which fits the lens but slightly softens the closure's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara unbinds the hush strand by strand, the greenhouse fills with "ordinary noise," and she plans the next bonfire story, accepting magnificence as "simple and still unfinished." The cost is legible—she relinquishes the quest to restore the old world and embraces incompleteness. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory deprivation, the mendicant's bowl's recurring appearances, and the final cadence shift when sound returns. Orientation anchors quickly (Echo Harbor, post-fire, Mara's gift). One meaningful deepening occurs when resistance at the cistern forces her to change pitch and circle the knot.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening line ("amber grotto at dusk…Mira Voss, a counterfeit emotion dealer"). The causal lens holds: Mira's static-electricity appraisal reveals Orin's buried guilt, she chooses bitter courage over absolution, the petal's scent triggers his transformation and genuine tears—each beat narrows options and the closure lands with visible cost (she takes payment, writes the brother's name, commits to offering "something real"). One meaningful tightening is present and the cost is legible on the page. The piece does not attempt multiple reversals; pressure accumulates through the appraisal sequence and pays off in the final image of Orin walking "as if he carried a lantern under his ribs" while Mira feels "the static fade…but the insight stayed, braided with a new tenderness."

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers acts of noticing and reciprocity toward a final image where the "repeating error" crystallizes the theme. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (concert hall, promenade, library). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the mistaken address that "kept the kindness moving" reweights the premise—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page; Mara's "cautious exuberance become steadier joy" tells the shift without dramatizing a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. Thejanitor's letter reaching Mara "by accident" lands as convenient happenstance rather than causally earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates kinship imagery—tags, kin maps, woven reeds—and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid) when Sava extends the kin map with empty spaces and asks to be named as maker. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit lands on the page with conceptual cost (public vulnerability, permanent social claim), though the felt price is oblique. One tightening occurs when the search pivots to the arbor discovery, reweighting the artist's purpose from wayfinding to belonging-craft. The piece teaches its pattern early and holds the lens to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Rin), where (rooftop canals, museum studio), and concept (interrupted cadence, Giant's nap) by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers borrowed-time mechanics, echo theory, and the interrupted-cadence motif toward a final Conceptual Repricing when Rin discovers "echoes are born where endings are refused." Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (she must repay stolen seconds) and the final image—ferrying the freed echo while "already counting"—reconfigures the premise with undeniable forward pressure. The because/therefore linkage is present but light; the piece accumulates pattern and pays it off cleanly at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory pattern (the dripping intervals), ritual alignment (glass eyes on mosaic), and the incremental revelation of Orren's state. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Lysa accepts that "love can continue without resolution," visibly paid by her repaired tile and carried optimism. The axiom she reaches reweights the dominant stake (ambiguous loss) with felt cost—she walks home without her brother but with a theorem that restructures grief. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through sensory recursion and object-gathering toward a final image that reweights Lio's stance. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the first paragraph. The closure—Lio pressing the tape fragment to his cheek and feeling seen—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing his shift from hidden helper to one who accepts visibility. Cost is felt but oblique: the piece does not show what path he forecloses or what he risks by "beginning" to feel seen, keeping the price conceptual rather than on-page tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the leaf triggers a pattern of changing perception, resistance through lists and scrubbing, then a cadence shift to releasing control that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (Mara, nursery, storm season) land cleanly by line three. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara becomes "a better witness," no longer chasing certainty but recording what vines choose, with the leaf pressed in her journal as visible cost of her transformation. One persistent constraint (her changing body) shapes tactics (scrubbing, then yielding to plants' choices) throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis with visible cost: the narrator relinquishes one brooch to Mara and accepts that threshing meaning comes through exchange and shared grief rather than solo revelation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—rain trails, convergence points, and the amber brooches build density through the piece and culminate in the narrator "painting in my mind" with "haggard awe." Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the brooches together unlock memory, narrowing the narrator's path from passive search to active exchange. Cost is legible: the narrator gives up half the convergence device to enable Mara's own summoning.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established by ~120 words (pilgrim arrives, Lan guides, cave setting). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: details layer (crystals, shadows, pearl, force) toward a final reconfiguration where song displaces the inhabitant. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the force exits, the pearl's glow transfers to Sera), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no visible price paid by Lan or Sera for this resolution. The force's exit "without violence" and the instant return to equilibrium undercut the stakes established mid-story, and the causal link between singing and the force's departure is asserted rather than earned through prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the first sentence (who: Mara; where: ivory harbor quay; when: after exile ends). The accumulative lens is signaled early through "navigated absences" and "staggered intervals," and the piece teaches its mosaic pattern across Captain Sorrel's three visits and Mara's interstitial walks. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ilven's restored trumpet sounds not an order but "a tremulous invitation" while Mara writes to compile fragments—the final image reweights silence and sound with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible: the community's anger must cool across three evenings, omissions carry bearings, and the valve's absence shaped survival. The lens holds. Deduction for the summary compression of key beats (Sorrel's confession, the three evenings) that deserved fuller dramatization at this word count.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first 120 words. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the phantom punch, pavement arrows, and stacked truths until the fortress door opens. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Mara steps onto the platform and begins mapping—but the cost (what she forfeits by entering) remains atmospheric rather than legible on the page. The midpoint tightening (descending the stairwell, punching the ticket) narrows options adequately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors quickly (basalt headland, open tower, whale migration). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: each transcription session deepens the entangled-memory pattern until Leena's arrival crystallizes the "deliberate silence" at closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the blank space in the star chart reweights all prior grief with undeniable conceptual cost. One causal seam: the whales' surface intervals matching "the sums along the tile's rows" is asserted late without prior groundwork, creating a convenience link rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure lands on the page: Ilias steps through and his immortality peels away, a Decisive Change with felt cost ("space stops obeying you, and you become part of what remains"). The Causal lens holds—each beat (amulet fragment → magnetic fields → corridor mutiny → prismatic council → threshold crossing) narrows options through because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchors (escondite, solar storm, Ilias + Maris) arrive early. One meaningful tightening: the mutiny forces a leader and Ilias accepts the amulet's rewriting. Cost is unmistakable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: Mara's decision to write the real story in Mercy's ink enables Sami's credible testimony, which softens the agent and forestalls Ivo's con. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the prep room's "quiet labor had already priced the truth"—with visible cost: Ivo's collapse and Mara's ongoing calculation replace certainty. Orientation anchors quickly (prep room, Mara, corpse, Ivo's arrival). One meaningful tightening: agents' arrival forces the proof. The final image ("I keep calculating") leaves Mara in Charged Poise, the ledger open but the breach made.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Haru frames silence "not as loss but as pause waiting to be scored" and writes a history that catalogs sensation rather than prediction, forecloses easy redemption, and carries conceptual cost (the town may stay mute). The lens is Accumulative/Textural throughout—density increases from indoor lamp-hum to layered garden sensory data, and the final image reweights the premise with undeniable pressure. The orientation anchor (town silent, Haru gilded-leaf stationer) lands by ~80 words; no causality breaks. One meaningful deepening (shop to mountaintop, thin to rough grain) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (layering overheard fragments, tidal rhythm as structural pulse) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the protagonist becomes a nameless vessel holding rescued names, a stance crystallized with felt cost ("my own erased history gained a grain"). Causality is elliptical but motivated: the label discovery → week of focused listening → Container 9H → redistribution and whispered recitation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes erasure was systemic, not personal, reweighting the stake from individual restoration to collective witness. Cost is legible in the final image: footprints covered, but layers held internally.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: artifacts accumulate, Eli interacts with each, and the hum-and-retell sequence builds toward a final realization. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—"myths persist because people keep closing the book too quickly"—but the cost remains oblique; no prior option or relationship is visibly foreclosed. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when land early), and the lens holds, but the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesce only after ~180 words of atmospheric preamble, violating the ~120-word anchor test (−0.4). The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texturing; the graffiti-code system and overnight reorganization provide because/therefore linkage. Closure lands on-page—Vell signs the moratorium and Ira paints the stone-heart mural—but the cost is more asserted than shown: we see exhaustion and hope but not a concrete forfeiture or newly impossible path. The Vell confrontation resolves too easily; his reversal lacks prior setup, creating a minor causality gap that weakens the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through density (the crater inspection, the chemical clock beats, Eli's rounds, the approaching dawn) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the final photograph and the grain capture a before/after with felt cost—"the sky as it surrendered." Orientation is anchored early (1969, Mount Valera summit, Mara at the crater). The three-strip chemical clock structure provides clear escalation beats that narrow time and deepen the melancholy. Cost is legible: the dark sky is lost, Eli's role becomes a museum watch, and Mara's covert motive is acknowledged. One meaningful tightening (the wind drop, the hush, the shutter opening at the exact color-bloom moment) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece anchors quickly (depot, Lio, repair shop, morning cheers) and sustains a clean causal chain: broken drone arrives under time pressure → Lio diagnoses through his signature method → repair succeeds → Sera departs with renewed faith. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the Meridian lifts anchor, Sera turns toward the drone's song, "guided by repaired faith"—the final image crystallizes trust and direction with undeniable emotional cost (the risk of navigation by sound in fog). The cost is felt rather than paid on the page, which fits Charged Poise. The lens is Causal throughout, with one meaningful tightening (the repair under deadline) and a legible before/after in Sera's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Riven, outpost, frozen lake, after the falcon's return. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the vellum message deepens mystery, the condensation pattern reweights method, the spring discovery crystallizes convergence. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Riven kneels at the source, speaks the phrasebook question aloud, and chooses to listen before mapping; the cost (delivering lines to "people who think maps are weapons") is felt and the final image reconfigures prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early (Sava, Lumen Gate, before collapse) and follows an accumulative lens: footstep rhythms layer until the decree carrier stops. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the town proves itself alive, decree is folded), and the final image reweights prior material—ghost town becomes home. Cost is legible but light: Sava's bleeding soles are mentioned once and not revisited; the threat of abandonment is resolved by collective sound without genuine trade-off. The lens holds, but the victory arrives without a felt price at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a layered pattern early (lonesome splendor, hush, ephemeral treasure) and pays it off at closure when the mirror sends the distress call as "shared recollection," reweighting the premise with conceptual cost (the temple's silence thins, her memories pour out). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Mara, temple, failing rebreather, distress signal). One meaningful deepening occurs when the relief's mouth opens and stored stillness spills out, narrowing her options and forcing the perfume-drop gambit. Closure lands on the page: the message leaps outward, the hush thins, and she will not surface alone—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost (gauge at last bars, memories shared). The cost is legible in "letting it map her memories onto the temple's" and "poured in the scent of home, the ache of her crew." No causality breaks. Gate met.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who (cry-wolf boy), where (lighthouse prison), and when (before bodies are found) within the opening lines. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (scuffs as map, lattice sustaining impossibilities, keepers folded in light) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the protagonist sets the lattice against glass, whispers his father's warning, and leaves the door ajar, crystallizing his stance with felt cost (accepting he'll be called delusional). The escalation operates through density increase and pattern break rather than causal links. One meaningful deepening occurs when he finds the bodies and chooses documentation over spectacle. Cost is legible: "the hush would belong to them, not me."

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands with a decisive act—Eli returns the bead, matches his heartbeat to the stone's rhythm, and awakens the orchard—paying a visible cost ("knowing she would sleep unchained, and feeling elation mournfully echo through my empty name"). Orientation is swift and evocative, anchoring greenhouse, orchard, and moonlight elixirs by the second paragraph. The causal chain holds: bead pulses → trees respond → bride returns → resonator built → bead returned → orchard awakens. One slip: the bride's second visit introduces the debt backstory through summary flashback rather than dramatized pressure, which momentarily flattens the escalation before the resonator build recovers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Ila, wharf, tide-pool timing) arrive early. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: details layer toward a final reconfiguration where reverence is "sewn back into being." However, the closure effect—children walking awake, orchids replacing torches—feels asserted rather than earned by prior causality; no on-page cost or foreclosed path is legible in the ending lines. The Orientation Test passes, but cost proof at closure remains elusive, capping upward movement.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors (Liora, orchard catacomb, excavation window) appear within the first 150 words. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: pressure builds through wandering → tremor interruption → alcove inscription → tomb opening → notebook discovery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Liora sets the sundial and chooses to stay, reweighting "interrupted journeys" from curse to method. Cost is legible: she abandons further wandering to commit locally, and "faith that was now wide enough to include detours" reconfigures her earlier dependence on arrival. One tightening occurs when the tremor forces her to admit faith's flaw, deepening the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by ~120 words; the Drive Lens reads as Situational with strong Accumulative texture (golden arcade motifs, chalk codes, margin ghost-notes converge). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the trap set via M. Return) with conceptual cost—exposing the thief through the protagonist's craft—but the cost remains oblique; the emotional or social price to the protagonist is asserted rather than shown. The "futuristic nostalgia" payoff in the final line charges the image, though causality from chalk-to-discovery feels compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Liora, observatory, three weeks before coup). The drive lens reads Causal: intercepted manifests → stitched errors → orrery synchronization → beacon match → evidence sealed and sent. Each move narrows options logically. Closure is Decisive Change with cost: she sends the chart, forecloses her safety, and the city "could still choose another story"—yet that final cost is conceptual and distant rather than immediate bodily or relational price paid on the page. One meaningful tightening (boots on stair, lieutenant confrontation) tests her under pressure and she survives via misdirection, but the sequence feels more like a demonstration than an escalation that costs her something irretrievable in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early: Mara, mangrove labyrinth, dusk. The story reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the three-night vigil, spirit messages deepen the ritual frame, and the brother's arrival crystallizes the stakes into an on-page apology with the shard as witness. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the apology spoken, the choice made, condensation fading) with felt cost—Mara forfeits the rehearsed safety of unsent letters. One continuity slip: "heals in moonlight" repairs the shard's edge, yet the shard was already "chipped" when she arrived, and no prior wound to the stone is dramatized on the page; the healing reads more symbolic than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise + micro Conceptual Repricing): Lani's final explanation to Mako reweights the cast and coral from wound-markers to graft-sites, foreclosing revenge with visible social cost (standdown, vigil). One meaningful deepening occurs when translation shifts from literal to affective, tightening the dominant stake. Cost is legible in "lotus hearted ache" and the captain's exhaustion, though slightly oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the daydream structure layers images (fresco, film, prism lamp, light-painting) that converge at the courtyard revelation and the final waking image. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the new image on the film ("her own hand mid-stroke") and her decision to share the method reweight the premise of solitary versus communal art. The cost is conceptual (openness after isolation) but not viscerally felt on the page; the final beat resolves into instruction ("carry this method back") rather than an embodied trade-off. Orientation is present but diffuse; the ruined orchard and marketplace anchor space, though transitions (marketplace → courtyard → waking studio) occasionally compress without clear temporal or spatial seams.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture folding into a situational crystallization) and delivers a Charged Poise closure: Mara's "I do not know yet" reconfigures her stance toward certainty with the room staying "bright with possibilities." The cost is conceptual—foregoing the safety of a fixed answer—and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first third. The nested awakenings create meaningful layering but risk opacity: the second "woke again" loop ("holding a brush already wet") does not clearly narrow options on the page, reading more as atmospheric recursion than causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive by ~100 words (entomologist, greenhouse, Bureau taxing thoughts). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through pattern-building (butterflies-as-code, garden plots) and culminates in a defensive scatter with auditors foiled by moth dust and humidity—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the refuge holds and "garden messages outside took root, guarding our sparks." Cost is conceptual and social (ongoing evasion, collective risk), legible in the final image. One tightening occurs when the Bureau notices and raids. The ending reconfigures the greenhouse from passive haven to active node in a distributed resistance network, reweighting the opening premise with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors promptly: Nacre, the shell, Mara's role. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered myth (Sea-Knife War, Iren's vanishing, the original armistice) toward the Heart-Cistern climax where the postcard's sacrifice and the lullaby's echo trigger the lilies' renewal—a Resonant Reconfiguration (the blossoms open, anger softens, the cycle renews) with visible cost (the postcard torn and sunk, Iren's message consumed). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Cost is legible in the image of the postcard sinking and Mara's sleepless vigil continuing "into another century."

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the museum crossing, the chime's grief is revealed, and the closure—names rising, regret softening into gratitude—reconfigures the opening stake with felt cost (loneliness acknowledged, future visitors imagined but absent). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes the chime "had been grieving, and the crack was the place where an unsaid goodbye had lodged," which reweights the repair from mechanical task to emotional closure. The cost is quiet but legible: solitude persists, and the caretaker accepts an indefinite wait.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal lens holds: Mara's secrecy → team fracture → ritual restoration attempt. The closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (trust re-stitched via shared pledges) with felt relational cost (Ilyon's admission poisons as it heals). Orientation anchors early (archive, night, team scatter looming). One meaningful tightening occurs when the vow ink darkens and the snarled script resolves, narrowing the emotional stakes and foreclosing the path of solitary heroism. The cost is visible in Ilyon's wince and the "new, tentative melody" that replaces verdict.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph (amphitheater, Mara, toolbox, mandate). Escalation operates causally: blank note → adhesive analysis → chain decoding → pulse-gate proposal → Rolen's confession → signed accord. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the shared measurement offers a "third language" that reconfigures the binary conflict, and Mara's trembling easing into "steady hands ready to build" signals visible cost (anxiety transformed into commitment). One meaningful tightening occurs when the decoded settings redefine the problem from sacred-vs-safe to hydraulic engineering with embedded kindness.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (Causal pressure from Oren's arrival and Merek's confession, Accumulative texture through dust-motes and music motifs) that coheres at closure when Mara sends the birds. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (attic, pigeons, meteorite chip by ~10% mark). One meaningful tightening occurs when Oren's meteorite chip and the ledger receipt narrow Mara's options, forcing her midnight decision. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final act reweights her reinvention as "withering" and accepts relational risk with visible cost—trusting both men and exposing the rooftop network. Cost is felt but could be more concrete; "feeling a small bloom" is slightly abstract where a sharper image would anchor the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Mira, drifting prism terrace, post-butterfly-effect city) arrive early. The causal chain—logbook → weather code → brass plate → timed corridor → doorframe message—holds together under a causal lens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira builds her own maze of measured doors, accepting that she may never find Oren but can maintain the sacred threshold he opened. Cost is conceptual (the path continues without him) but felt in "she did not know if she would ever find him." One meaningful tightening (the seven-minute window) narrows options. The piece sustains coherence but the final image's charge is more thematic echo than visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: algae-zodiac, fireflies, and the burnt feather accrue symbolic density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Mira and Jonah walk together, reweighting "belonging" from solitary wandering to shared witnessing. The cost is felt—Jonah's fear of sunrise, Mira's invitation that forecloses her prior isolation—and the feather-as-oath lands cleanly in the final image. Orientation anchors early (Mira, underwater facility, nightlong window); the single scene with purposeful flashback holds the lens to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: images and sensory particulars gather density until the final spiral of Mira's apology and the ridge's reappearance reweight the dominant stake. Closure lands on the page with a visible change (the trail shimmers into being), and the cost—Mira's spoken confession—is dramatized. Orientation anchors (narrator, geode, coast) arrive cleanly within the first third, and the causal chain from seeds to doorway to pool to resolution holds without breaks. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crater glass reveals the emotional gap, narrowing options and forcing Mira's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: Milo's vow to "serenade monotony" transforms from abstract performance philosophy into life-saving praxis, with visible cost (altered routine, abandoned comic act). The causal spine is tight—weighted board leads to booth choice, footprints shift the plan, bishop becomes tool—under a Causal lens that holds through closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The single meaningful tightening occurs when discovery of the trapped boy forces Milo's orchestrated system to meet genuine emergency, and the final image recharges the opening frame with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story anchors who/where/when within the opening and builds pressure through layered images (moonstone dust → anchoring → garden keeper → tattooing) that reweight the dominant stake (preserving nostalgia against censorship). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira rises, understands her next action as "fledge," and commits to a network of inscribed verses. The cost is visible—exile deepens, body becomes text, future tactics narrow—and the final image of her dancing while the garden keeps time behind her recharges prior material. One micro-tension: the keeper's bargain is dramatized but resolved swiftly, limiting the felt friction at that pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: pond-ripple imagery seeds at night, returns at dawn with the inspector, and charges the final image of the repaired pane holding the horizon. Orientation anchors (Pearl Bay, dawn, atrium, inspector notice) arrive early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the inspector tears the demolition notice, reconfigures the bay's future) with visible cost (the marina plan is rejected, the atrium spared). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ripple-pattern explanation reweights the efficiency vs. care question. The inspector's conversion feels insufficiently pressured—Ilya's gentle speech and water-pattern demonstration lack the friction that would earn such a reversal—but the on-page cost (torn notice, new request) is legible and the lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The piece reads under a Hybrid lens (reflective accumulation into a causal decision to confess), but the closure—Mara's stated intent to confess and Jonah's promise—lands as declaration rather than dramatized cost; we see no on-page consequence or foreclosed path, only a vow. The cost is conceptually legible (sleep debt, Eli's lost lesson) but remains in summary, not a visible beat that alters present options. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara shares the bargain, shifting Jonah's stance, but the final image ("carrying the lesson like a lantern") abstracts rather than grounds the change.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes clear orientation (grotto, Mina, collapsing town, night experiment) by the opening paragraph. Causal linkage holds: balloons → gauge readings → chalk marks → ensemble realization → refined formula → updraft → communal lift. The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the basket ride aligns timelines and demonstrates that "hope, like lift, could be computed and shared," with the conceptual cost that she cannot know "which world would be saved." One meaningful tightening (gauge measuring sideways units, then stabilizing with collaborative input) sufficiently escalates under a Causal lens. The parallel-timeline mechanism arrives slightly late (~30% mark) but is earned by prior gauge behavior and drives all subsequent beats.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines; the drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texturing (discoveries narrow options and reweight the stake). The closure—submitting a false report and playing one final chord—lands on the page as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: Liora forecloses public restoration and accepts the burden of selective silence, a visible renunciation with felt cost. The diary → film strip → hidden chamber → voice archive sequence is tightly causal, and the final act definitively alters her relationship to the legacy, though the drones' arrival and her decision to deceive could have been sharpened with one more beat of hesitation or tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page: the protagonist returns the borrowed heartbeat, forecloses one path (keeping it/saving sister longer), and accepts the cost (boy lives, surgeons guided by "steadier hands" in a possibility-vision). The lens reads Situational-leaning-Hybrid: the painter's mirror and coded lullaby create pressure that forces stance crystallization; the final choice reweights the premise with felt cost. Orientation anchors arrive early (terrace, canal, spring, pre-bells timeframe). One meaningful tightening occurs when the mirror reveals the two rooms and the lullaby "asks consent," narrowing options to a binary with legible stakes. The metaphysical mechanics (mirage painter, borrowed heartbeat, possibility-mirrors) are taught but the surgeons being "guided" in the chosen room introduces a convenience that blurs whether the choice truly costs the sister or simply shifts the method of saving her, slightly weakening the closure's price.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis / Conceptual Repricing: Sera understands peace is "not forgiveness, only the daily labor she had finally chosen to pay for"—a renunciation of absolution with visible cost (her map burns, the memory of the corridor remains). Orientation anchors promptly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). Drive lens is Situational-Accumulative Hybrid: ritual pressure and vows force stance crystallization; the bowl, oath, and celestial framing cohere to reweight the premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maro and Odran each surrender cherished orders, narrowing their options and forcing the vows. Cost is legible on the page in the burned objects and Sera's final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the egg's shattering is a Resonant Reconfiguration (bordering on Decisive Change) that forecloses redemption and crystallizes her stance with visible cost—the wafer cracked, the recording lost, the shell fragments scattered. The accumulative lens holds throughout (manufactured drought → convergent cracks → failed playback → deliberate release). Causality is tight: she ordered the drought to sharpen the map, followed it to the stake, attempted playback, and when the device failed she chose to release the shell. One meaningful tightening (the hiss of failure) deepens into the final act of letting go, and the cost is undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on-page: Maris scatters the stored echoes, guests hear their buried doubts, and the governor's phrases come out hollow—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where conformity's lullaby breaks and the city meets itself with visible social cost. Drive lens is Causal-Situational Hybrid (her bodily breath unlocks the seal, her invitation releases echoes, guests pause and the orchestra falters). Orientation anchors early (House Lyr courtyard, winter gala, Maris waiting). One meaningful tightening: her untangling threads while the governor forms his wish narrows options and the release reweights the courtyard's power structure. Cost is legible in the governor's stripped authority and the city's fracture into "many melodies."

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (causal agency braided with accumulative imagery) that holds through closure. Orientation anchors quickly (Ilya, gallery exit, radar dome journey). The reversal structure—from serene detachment to ethical accountability—narrows options through the puppet performance, Mara's appearance, and the napkin contract, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he forecloses unfettered appropriation). Cost is visible in the contract's terms and the final shared-authority performance. One substantive tightening occurs when Mara's veto demand crystallizes the line he "kept smudging," foreclosing his former practice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors immediately (grotto, dawn climbs, monarch migration). The accumulative lens is inferred and held: Arin builds structures, discovers the moth wing, learns the technicians' history, and the final image (marigold cloth as memorial flag) reweights all prior material with visible cost (dismantling frames, leaving the wing pressed). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the grotto will be empty again, yet the migration succeeded because he provided steadier rhythm than the old beacon. Cost is legible: transience honored, ephemeral structures removed, names spoken into air.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist learns to mend what was broken by aligning knot to gap, and the final image of playing the bronze strip in the village square reconfigures the stakes with visible cost (the entire journey, the technical labor, the public reckoning). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through craft detail, pattern emerges (punched holes → rope braids → bronze strip), and the final line reweights the opening sentence with cadence shift. Cost is legible in the commitment to public performance and the deliberate choice to honor forgotten names alongside the two erased. One minor slip: the Archivist's invitation and the sanctum's mechanics are introduced quickly without much friction, slightly softening the because/therefore linkage in the first third.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The closure reads as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist steps into the forest as the path "takes my weight like a handshake," crystallizing a shift from seeker to chosen walker. Cost is felt (leaving completes the bunker's purpose, foreclosing return) and the directive's decay pattern pays off. One meaningful deepening occurs when the blood-print unlocks the final map. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (rewilded forest, bunker, storm). The lens holds and closure lands with conceptual cost, though the "transcend" moment relies heavily on dream logic rather than concrete choice pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (astronomer, palace, between regimes), and the drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: omens, tile, schematic mapping, and star-alignments layer pressure toward the chamber reveal and covenant seal. The tile's vow guides three on-page choices (acceptance, mapping, arranging tablets) with clear because/therefore links, and the climax—snapping the stylus—forecloses his most conserved certainty with felt cost. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): new constellations on his palms and "empirically ironic peace" reweight the premise without stating a moral. One persistent constraint (Mars crossing the Lion) shapes tactics. The piece exceeds minimal escalation standards but remains mid-7s because the cost at closure is conceptual and oblique rather than viscerally dramatized in dialogue or physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands on-page with Mara's knife drop and the pin's reappearance, a valid Resonant Reconfiguration under a Hybrid lens tilting Accumulative at the end. Cost is present but thin: Mara "chose to lead her people without threats," yet we see no concrete forfeiture or tactical trade-off in the final image. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), and the dominant stake (teaching resentment to release) coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when the glass walls flicker and Mara panics, narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: fog, breathing, mirrors, and sextant accumulate toward the final Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant). The closure crystallizes—mirror stops trembling, district restored within the glass, warmth spreads—with felt cost (he carries the window but the ruin remains unchanged). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (twilight frost, orchard district, mirror maker, roofless kiosk). One tightening: the star "slid sideways" forces Lio to shift from measurement to invitation, narrowing his approach and delivering closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift: who (Mira), where (cathedral), when (post-firing) anchor by the third sentence. Drive lens reads Situational/Hybrid: the encounter forces Mira to act despite her voided license, and the sister's ribbon-return reweights the premise. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—"deciduous vows" returns with new cost as Mira pledges to repair "contract or not"—though the cost (professional risk, social standing) is implied rather than shown in a concrete price paid on the page. One reversal (boy demands help despite her refusal) narrows options; the ribbon payoff shifts meaning but feels slightly orchestrated rather than causally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—nonlinear events and reordered logbook pages layer toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation is present (curator, asteroid, orchard) by the opening lines, so no penalty applies. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing: Mara writes an accession note to her younger self and accepts her role as ancestor-archivist. However, the cost is told rather than shown—"accepting" is a declaration, and the specific trade-off (what path is foreclosed, what she loses by becoming the ancestor) remains implicit. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful reweighting is sufficient, but the final image does not charge prior material with undeniable pressure; the cameo's return and the logbook loop feel illustrative rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (mountain bookstore, Lysa, Orren's warning) and the narrative follows a clear causal thread: warning → descent → trapped readers → negotiation → vault → escape. The closure—freed readers departing with unfinished stories and Orren gaining "future-tense grammar"—qualifies as Decisive Change with a conceptual cost (the mountain rearranges, lessons now learnable). Yet the escalation is primarily spatial (deeper into the store) rather than driven by protagonist agency narrowing options; Lysa's renegotiations succeed without meaningful friction, and the curator's transformation ("the dust-cloak thinned as if remembering breath") arrives through recitation rather than a hard-won trade-off. Lens: Causal with Accumulative overtones (the "unheard symphony" motif); closure holds under Causal but the path lacks a tightening that genuinely forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: silver filaments, shifting portraits, and layered fabric stitches build density toward the greenhouse reveal. Orientation anchors who/where by the opening lines; causality is mostly stable (swatch card → filament hum → gallery → mannequin → memory revision → garden). The closure—Mara pins the fabric, speaks the line, memories settle, ship chooses direction—lands as Charged Poise: options crystallize and the drifting state reconfigures. Cost is gestured ("free only within its fog") but the line "needing a story to spark him whole" presents the solution without showing what Mara surrenders or loses to achieve it, leaving cost felt but not concretely legible.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a single POV and follows one continuous scene in the tower mechanism room. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are clear by the opening paragraph. The causal chain—seal found, rope braided, door opens, text forms, Mara files publicly—is legible and motivated. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final act of filing under merged categories and scheduling a public reading reweights the university's erasure with visible cost (institutional accountability). The drive lens reads as causal with accumulative texture; the ending holds that lens cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early and builds pressure through layered sensory accumulation (metallic cave ringing, ice fractures, crystal cavities). Closure arrives on-page as Sava establishes a pact with the energy beings and updates her living map, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize. The cost is felt in the ongoing obligation ("whenever the storms rose") and the transformation of the caves into a shared sanctuary. One tightening suffices at this length, though the escalation reads more as competent execution than agonized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens is Situational with Accumulative texture: coincidences complicate (meteor shower, shard arrival, star alignment) while the protagonist's deliberate tracking and assembly work crystallize stance. Closure is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—"some accidents are invitations" reprices the obsession without neat resolution, and the caravan's arrival validates the beacon's promise with felt cost (weeks of solitary vigil, risk of failure). Orientation anchors immediately (beacon-tower, salt flats, post-collapse) and the seven-night structure tightens pressure legibly under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: pressure builds through density of sensory detail and intensifying stakes as the storm threatens the Archive. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the archivist's act of writing personal memory stabilizes the fog and the final image reweights nostalgia from loss to compass. The orientation is delayed but functional (who/where/when cohere by ~150 words), and the causal chain from fog-solidification to Archive-threat to memory-offering holds. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archivist shifts from retrieval to contribution, with visible stakes (potential erasure of self vs. collective survival).

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece operates under a Causal lens: Jorin finds the note → decodes the map → redirects fireworks → gate opens. Closure (the camps enter peacefully, Jorin hands the rag to a boy) reads as Decisive Change with felt cost (the fortress's proud isolation ends, hope is performed into being), and the because/therefore chain holds. However, the climactic gate-opening happens off-page ("Mirel ordered workers to clear the collapse") and the cost—what Jorin or the fortress forfeits by opening—remains abstract rather than viscerally legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, the cicada's recurring use, and the thematic weight of "transition periods" until the final image—waves erasing footprints yet leaving the beach unchanged—reconfigures the opening question with felt cost. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's agreement with Iven to move north forecloses her solitary defiance while the hidden jars remain unspoken, a visible omission that charges trust's future cost. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph; causality under the accumulative lens is coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara foresees the harbor and Iven's shame, then chooses a shared path over solitary refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the exposure method and culminates in the final jar-opening as Resonant Reconfiguration (the room "felt wide enough to live in" after the gilded hush is released—a clear before/after with felt cost, the child's prior constriction now opened). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (ridge, father, age thirteen, bunkers). One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist chooses to cross the rope web for the gilded hush despite panic, and the cost—expanded lungs, relinquished compression—lands on the page in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (Elias, prism terrace, train yards). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Mara steps out "steady" having learned to "look for pauses the way you look for lanterns," and the vaulting hush now comforts rather than threatens—visible stance shift with felt cost (grief held, not erased). One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias slows the car against the storm glass warning and teaches counting, reweighting silence from threat to corridor. Cost is legible in Mara's swallowed pulse-fear and Elias's vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear spatial progression: Archive → perimeter → waterfall → orchard → chamber. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Ione refuses the throne and instead installs the community record, foreclosing personal power. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The cost, however, is conceptual rather than viscerally felt—she "carries no crown" but we don't see what she's given up or what returning to the city without power will mean. The linked discoveries (log → waterfall → mural → gate → chamber) create meaningful accumulation, but the final reversal (descent not ascent, circle not monarch) lands more as thematic cleverness than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (chapel), and when (after cutting contact, then "coldest night") by the second paragraph, meeting the test. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through metaphoric layering (darkness folded like cloth, grief as wet ash, threshold as seam) and lands closure through a cadence shift—the final dawn image reweights the opening isolation with "no longer poison" and "waited for the next ring." Cost is legible: Mara rebuilds one bridge while accepting ongoing solitude, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise meets Earned Stasis). One meaningful deepening occurs when Lio's choking shadow forces her to extend her scarring method outward. Minor slip: the mechanics of "shadow shaped like Lio" crossing without crossing could be clearer—slightly relies on metaphor to carry causality.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Mara, mushroom farm, concept-physics season) arrive by ~80 words. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through spore-glow descriptions, glitchy texts, and the drum ritual, culminating in the diamond-bolt image. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final quantum promise spoken aloud reconfigures prior material with conceptual cost (uncertainty about which future solidifies), though the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt. One causal gap: Old Sen's bank demand and Mara's decision to use the drum are linked by coincidence (a convenient text arrival) rather than because/therefore agency.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture: intuition → hidden gramophone → Queen Nara's confession → abdication forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: Leander abdicates, redirects the treasury, and marks the site for the next builder. Orientation anchors quickly (Leander, reading room, evening, search for proof). One meaningful tightening occurs when the standing-wave pattern points to the hollowed book, narrowing his path and raising the stakes of what he'll find.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern-driven escalation through ciphered loops, unsnapping clasps, shifting reality). Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Calven promises to "escort this compass beyond the greenhouse" and "let possibility take flesh without puppetry," crystallizing a stance. However, the cost remains oblique—his allegiance to the silent order is mentioned but never dramatized as a tangible forfeiture on the page. The Orientation Test is narrowly satisfied (knight, greenhouse, midnight bell by ~100 words), but the accumulative pressure diffuses across decorative transformations (mother distilling moonlight, squire with leaves) that do not narrow options or escalate the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure lands cleanly: Mara and Josie leave the button on the table "like a pebble that could start a ripple," a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes options and reweights Mara's grief-lens with visible social and emotional cost. The inferred lens is Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the dust pattern → Cabinet H → bundle → letter sequence drives discovery (causal), while the button and Lottie's name accumulate meaning across the arc. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara finds the bundle and realizes "the dust map and the button had refused the erasure." Orientation is clear by the opening sentence. The ending cost is felt but not decisive action, holding the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who, where, and when within the opening third and escalates through Mara's discovery of the Ministry's mobile press, culminating in a plate-swap that seeds tomorrow's resistance. Closure reads as Charged Poise: the pages float into the city as "coded freedom that the next revision would have to chase," reconfiguring the immediate stakes with a felt cost (exposure, ongoing pursuit). The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative textures; linkage holds through most beats, though the lagoon-as-constellation navigation compresses cause without full mechanical grounding. One meaningful tightening (booth → ledger → press) is present and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lio forecloses the prophecy at visible cost—erasing his mother's voice—and the town wakes ordinary while he sits in loss. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the grotto's drip-song, dewdrops forming, and whispered negations build density until the final breath "as pure blankness" reweights the opening fog/song imagery. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening: the vest's hush catches the prophecy in his ribcage, narrowing options to self-sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lio's public reading and monument trail shift Veyroot from theft-based levitation to shared memory, and the leaf spelling "LIFT" reweights the arbor's fate with conceptual and social cost (the elders' secret exposed, old history reintegrated). The causal chain—leaf → dust → decoded message → vault → book → public reading—holds under a Hybrid lens (causal linkage with accumulative/textural closure). However, the vault opening and the arbor's "steadying" occur without visible opposition or friction on the page, reducing the felt price of the final act and making the resolution feel slightly convenient despite its thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece infers a Situational lens: pressure accumulates through serial discoveries (feathers, clocks, trapdoor, compass rose, Corin's confession) that force Mara to crystallize a stance. Orientation anchors arrive by ~80 words (Sile, harbor fire, Mara's shop). The closure—building a probability clock instead of returning the compass rose outright—reconfigures the admiral's certainty into communal doubt with conceptual cost (the town must "begin again without pretending it knew the route"). One minor causal stretch: Corin's motive for diverting the compass rose (to "map hidden currents") feels retrofitted rather than seeded, weakening the hinge between discovery and bargain.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture (inferred as Hybrid, judged under Causal dominant at closure). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The coin's transformation via Mara's name-sacrifice causally reveals Ellis, who then leads to Orin's body—a clear because/therefore chain. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara places the mended coin on the anvil, her name now lighter, accepting responsibility in place of resurrection. Cost is visible: she surrendered borrowed names and childhood, and tomorrow she returns Orin with his true name intact. One meaningful tightening occurs when the inlay resolves to ELLIS. The mosaic structure (foundry search → Ellis confrontation → culvert → return) coheres under a single POV and contiguous night.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph ("Echo Gorge… Mara walked… today she pursued Elowen"). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the distorted harp notes and gorge echoes multiply confession into choir, then Mara's laughter cracks the calcified grief, resolving via Charged Poise when the invisible bundle dissolves and Elowen's shoulders loosen. Cost is visible—the bundle vanishes, forgiveness embodied—and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: the forest as archive, body as tuned instrument, and the mathematics of mercy accumulate through layered images toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure—mercy "computed not to absolve the torturers but to release the tortured." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure lands with conceptual cost ("carrying their weights, including me"), reweighting the penance premise, though the cost remains abstract rather than a visible forfeiture on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes the forest "only opens to bodies that have been tuned by cruelty."

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the joined lens allows the narrator to hear and speak the rejected names, anchoring the seam with felt cost (the loss of the mother, the darkening shard, the risk of unfastening light). The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (market, paintings, drowned city, bolted hatch) that converge at the lens-joining moment. Orientation is clear by the first third (narrator, market, translator's role). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator descends and fits the fragments, reweighting prior material. Cost is legible: the shard had begun to darken, and the act of joining requires descent and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (abandoned circus, elevator repair work order, night). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns → ghost appearance → ceiling discovery → mainspring → modern cabinet → release/repair mark → departure, each beat layering density until the final image reweights the opening promise ("to discover what ceilings hide"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: the protagonist seals the facade crack, quiets the shaft, and carries the barrel out as "a name tag for the time he had guarded," crystallizing the tension between repair work and spectral custodianship with visible cost (the object taken, the plaster marked). The causal chain is clean: crack in facade → thieves → hidden mechanism → modern cover → release → repair recommendation. Cost is legible in the final paragraph: the ghosts depart, the barrel remains, and the narrator's fatigue is named.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The frost spiral signals the destabilization, Mara's whisper articulates the new contract, and the press-rupture reorders reality. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lio freezes Mara's return in the mirror, compressing eternity into one irreversible instant. Orientation is swift (glass orchard, letterpress operator, negotiable reality by line three). Cost is legible in "cannot be renegotiated" and the library's shudder, though the mirror-image closure feels slightly oblique—undeniable pressure, but the exact forfeit (his own future negotiation? the catalog's function?) could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors are present early (Len on Palimpsest, visible time, museum quarter). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered description, the storm triggers mirror visions, and the final exhibition reweights the archaeological dispute by staging the map through visible time strata. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the exhibition projects the map with blurred borders, Len reads his poem naming factions as necessary fragments, and people leave "arguing differently"—a crystallization of new terms with conceptual cost (neither side wins). The cost is legible in the phrase "the vase becomes more honest when broken," which reconfigures the shard's meaning. One deduction: the transition from alcove discovery to devising the exhibition is compressed and slightly elided; the reader must infer the planning rather than see a moment where Len and Yara negotiate the risk.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening sentences; no penalty applied. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the Thief is realigned, light returns, and Ivo honors the Covenant), and cost is legible: rust flecks the joints as approval, the chip is used, and the oathfern remains un-wilted, signaling honest work. Under an Accumulative lens (tinkering pressure + covenant constraints + final wonder-song), the ending reweights the opening premise with visible consequence. However, the causal chain from confrontation to resolution compresses quickly, and the Thief's capitulation arrives without a second complication, limiting the tightening effect and capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara reaches the lagoon, reads the warning embedded in the compass and satchel, and chooses to leave the compass behind—accepting that "some directions exist only while you doubt." The cost is legible in her pouring out the petrichor and forgoing ownership of the hush. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 60 words. The accumulative lens holds: each beat deepens her understanding of the hinge metaphor until the lagoon synthesizes it. One meaningful tightening occurs when the compass needle points straight down and she finds the satchel, narrowing her question to a choice between claiming and releasing.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of layered-time images early and sustains it through the spiral-making sequence. Orientation anchors (lost sculptor, archway, storm) land within the first 120 words. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the town arrives, the sandbags lock, and Mara pockets the slide with alliance potential reweighted—pressure crystallizes and options reconfigure even though the next act is not yet paid. Cost is conceptual (commitment to this mode of bridging) rather than a visible forfeiture, which holds but doesn't electrify.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens that holds through closure: Lina's journey gathers postcards, observations, and finally the layered window discovery into a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her mother's journeys as deliberate acts of shelter-building. Orientation anchors (Lina, autumn pavilion, then cathedral across winter) arrive cleanly. The closure unit—discovering the palimpsest, reading her mother's name and confession, then painting the new panel—lands on the page with conceptual and emotional cost: Lina must reckon with her mother's absence and the engineered tenderness she missed. One meaningful deepening (the window revelation) is sufficient at this length, and the final image (the mural panel showing the cathedral window) recharges prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers archive discovery → retrocognitive vision → beach excavation → parley → diary retrieval in a pattern of deepening sensory immersion and textural density. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the water rises, the diary surfaces, and the trapped July releases—cost is legible in the release itself and the archivist's promise to redact until consent. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (zeppelin library, coast, 1963). One pressure slip: the parley feels ordained rather than fought-for, slightly softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through iterative craft acts (soap, dyes, fish paste) and a pattern of rejection/teaching that reweights the premise by the ending image. Orientation anchors who and where early, though "when" remains vague beyond "after the last wish." The closure—setting the sealed bottle on the council table and declaring "their revival was the only opening it ever needed"—is a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the bottle's meaning, but the cost is asserted rather than felt: no on-page moment shows what Sen or the town forfeited by choosing labor over miracles, and the council's formation occurs off-page in summary. The line "he felt the bottle pulse once, as if approving" introduces a near-mystical validation that undercuts the story's rejection of miracles and muddies the accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Erem stores the ribbon, "hearing in the quiet not triumph but the soft unease of saved lives," a reconfiguration that forecloses the passive archive path with felt cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when he hears the prophecy and realizes listening may bind the city; his broadcast choice narrows options with on-page consequence. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening ~120 words. Cost is visible: unease replaces triumph, and the city will demand proof he cannot offer.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Lio), where (icebound atrium), and when (after egg hatches) within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through grandmother's notebooks, the sorting ritual, the corridor vision, and the final restoration loop, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Lio "understood his inheritance was to keep reopening order until time itself could breathe." Cost is conceptual—eternal custodianship—and legible in that final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vortex inheritance shifts from mystery to obligation. The lens holds cleanly, though the corridor sequence adds information more than it narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph (Maris, sanctuary, winter solstice, siren inspection task). The story operates under a Causal lens: Maris tracks microclimate → builds sensor array → rewires control box → makes the zero-hour choice, each step narrowing options. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: she defies the dispatcher's demand, risking professional consequences, and her choice reconfigures the warning paradigm from "shrieking rotor" to "quiet vane." The bell-rope splice's drying provides a concrete timeline constraint that tightens the final beat. One small slip: the dispatcher's lawsuit fear and Maris's microclimate defense feel slightly expository rather than fully dramatized, but the core causal chain holds and the ending reweights prior stakes with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through repeated tracing acts, the logbook discovery, and the communal ritual. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final meteor fragments are marked and laughed at softly, reweighting vulnerability as nourishment rather than failure. Orientation anchors (Lio, station, first clear night) arrive within opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the converging meteor paths lead to the tunnel and the director's parallel grief. Cost is felt in the shift from solitary janitor to communal guide, and the station's "inhale" reconfigures stillness as active holding rather than neglect.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (the oasis "could be tended again") with felt cost: the narrator relinquishes hoarded words and Mara's presence, forecloses the covenant's tangled form, and enables the ghosts' departure. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through contextual clues, the box's meanings layer, and the final act reweights the premise. Escalation proceeds through one meaningful deepening (understanding Mara's gesture, opening the box, releasing each slip) that narrows the narrator's stance from preservation to release. One persistent constraint (the ghosts' silence, the tangled covenant) shapes tactics and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (numbers fail, clocks ornament, riddles replace dates) and transitions cleanly through garage-sale stalls into the silo chamber. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Eli writes the new tag, a duty begins, and "the mystery of texture to deepen" crystallizes his shift from countdown to cycle. Cost is visible—his borrowed year "slips off"—but the final image of waiting dilutes immediacy slightly. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first 120 words, no penalty. One meaningful deepening (capsule exchange) narrows options and the lens holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: objects (string, feather, net, kite) gather meaning through repetition and reweighting at closure when the drake returns and Rian offers both care and apology. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the final act of returning the feather and tending the injured drake crystallizes his aesthetic practice with visible cost—he relinquishes the found object that sparked his sequence. The connective tissue between beats (lagoon → shed → shallows → lagoon) relies on spatial proximity rather than causal necessity, and the brothers' conflict resolves too smoothly without friction that might test Rian's method. One meaningful deepening occurs when the child's worry forces Rian to demonstrate repair as pedagogy, narrowing his practice from solitary collection to communal teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when efficiently and maintains accumulative/textural coherence throughout. The closure offers a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mara's death becomes meaningful because the orchard continues translating its script—with conceptual cost legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the seed pods, reweighting the temple's purpose from human worship to interspecies nursery. However, the monks' resistance folds without causal friction, weakening the tightening that should narrow her options before the end.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern intensifies via signal→crystals→pedestal→shard, deepening the homecoming chemistry premise). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with visible cost: the narrator steals the shard and rewrites the pilgrimage script, reweighting homecoming as measurable chemistry rather than nostalgia. One meaningful deepening (signal becomes catalyst, footprints become microcrystals, amber warms, door opens) is present, and the cost (theft from the script, defiance of council management) is legible in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first two paragraphs (gloom-hill coachman, Lorn Harbor, post-reef death). The piece accumulates density through layered ritual acts—kneeling, naming regiments and fish, cracking seed pods, spreading silt—building to the final image where the jetty blooms and the gulls cry "Keep it." The Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) crystallizes at closure: the garden takes root "without hatred," holding the submerged concord in soil, reweighting war and silence with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the water answers with "soft clacking...like stones tapped together in assent," narrowing options and confirming the pact. Cost is conceptual and felt—the narrator imagines roots threading through bullet fragments, accepting the fragility of this oath—though the emotional price remains oblique rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors POV, wasteland settlement, and post-war timeframe by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Causal: riddle → cylinder decryption → relay station → broadcast, with each beat narrowing options. Closure is a Decisive Change (secrets into signal; camps answering) paired with visible cost (guards running, Morrow stepping between). The cylinder's content revelation motivates the relay-station journey without hand-waving. One minor linkage slip: Sera "hidden herself... until I solved her riddle" compresses her agency and timing in a way that feels slightly convenient, though it doesn't break causality outright.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist achieves alignment through the star-sketch compass, opens the hatch, and walks toward earned direction with visible cost (accepting solitude, leaving the station). The cost is felt in "alone and yet connected" and the station becoming "just another dark landmark." Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (station, deck, post-shutdown). One meaningful deepening occurs when the double-sky reveals directional drift, transforming confusion into navigation. The accumulative pressure—grief anniversary, temporal stretching, calibration through sketching—coheres and tightens to the final walk.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece attempts a causal-accumulative hybrid: the narrator infiltrates, swaps chess pieces, climbs to Serren, and enacts the pocket-sundial riddle. Orientation anchors (spire gate, chapel, top platform) arrive clearly, and the chess-cipher mechanic pays off once. Yet the closure—stepping into "the map's first corridor"—remains abstract; the conceptual cost (choosing cautious abandon again) is declared but not dramatized with visible consequence on the page. The final image reweights the pocket sundial's warmth but does not show what the protagonist forfeits or loses in that step.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator sets the pawnless board on the ledge and begins writing "not of rulers but of fingertips," crystallizing the shift from staged actor to public historian with the cost of imprisonment and the risk undeniably felt. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered gestures (tapping finger, tugged sleeve, heel clicks) and the unbinding action reweights all prior observation into published testimony. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (palace, interregnum, whispering gallery, crisis actor role). One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist descends, rips cords, and the guards close in. Cost is visible: imprisonment, the satchel handed off, and the public turn from bloodlust to lawful succession.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear causal chain: remembering becomes painful → seek the stone → trade a memory to access it → reclaim the naming talent → escape the nightly shuffle. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The closure—stepping through with the stone while the bookstore quiets—delivers a Decisive Change (reclaiming agency and the path home) with visible cost (the raw memory seeded, the refusal of kinder lies). The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture (the hidden thunder motif, the substitution mechanic); it holds through the ending without contradiction. One meaningful tightening occurs when the nightly shuffle begins and the naming pins corridors in place, narrowing options with immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with Mara's renunciation ("offer a draw to the past") that forecloses heroic acclaim and accepts quiet self-forgiveness; the cost is legible in her bowed exit and refusal of credit. The causal lens holds: tapestry decode → labyrinth navigation → gate confrontation → release. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woven hush "pressed on her ears" after she speaks the sequence, raising cost and foreclosing retreat. The platinum labyrinth functions as both constraint and mirror, shaping her tactical choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows a causal lens with clear escalation: Mara plants the truth through poetry, the crowd amplifies it, the killer is exposed, and she pays a price. However, orientation arrives late—who Mara is and what she witnessed emerges gradually through backstory rather than anchored early. The closure (loss of color vision) lands on the page with cost, but the speed from killer's lunge to judgment to Mara's blinding compresses three major beats into summary, weakening the felt impact of each turn. The cost-proof test is satisfied ("unable to see colors"), but the moment lacks sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through layered memory-quilting and recursive physical actions (dive, match, surface, repair) that tighten around the dominant stake of salvaging meaning before the workshop sinks. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise verging on Earned Stasis): the workshop steadies, the protagonist achieves equilibrium through gold-laced repairs and spoken forgiveness, and the final image reweights the key ring charm and statue as anchors of ongoing fragility. Cost is felt in the repeated breath-holds, the brother's loss acknowledged, and the acceptance that "repaired things still carry their cracks." Orientation is clear by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening (the pivot from potion-making to honest pattern recognition) suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, after what inciting event). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the cave discovery deepens and reweights the opening promise through layered sensory detail and the shell's evolving meaning. Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration—Lio places the shell and accepts imperfect connection, crystallizing a stance with visible cost (abandoning the safe distance). The tightening is legible: mirror crack → cave → spoken admission → shell placement, each beat densifying the promise's stakes. Cost is felt in the admission and the shell's semi-permanence, though the transformation could have been compressed for sharper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors within the first paragraph (assistant keeper, cobalt lighthouse, after heat wave). The piece accumulates pressure through the cork ritual, garden-scent preparation, tower vibration, and Jonas's arrival, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Jonas abandons volume for trembling whisper with felt cost to his foghorn method. The closure image—"tended the morning beam...as a promise sent gently"—reweights the volume-versus-whisper stake with undeniable conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening through the vibration experiment narrows options and charges the final stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (the armillary transforms from navigational tool to relational promise) with visible cost: the protagonist shifts from technical guide to emotional anchor, and the midnight caller is revealed as the boy seeking return. The causal lens holds: hydraulics fail → manual instrument building → cryptic calls → armillary guidance → reunion at the aqueduct. Orientation anchors arrive by ~80 words (station, salt flats, hydraulics dead). One meaningful tightening occurs when the censer foot's lunar fluctuation validates the caller's numbers, narrowing the navigator's method and raising the stakes of trust. The boy's agency (sending calls, repairing radio) creates the reunion rather than chance, satisfying causal requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara chooses secrecy by burying the eye, foreclosing transparent safety in favor of protective deception—visible cost paid on the page. Causal lens holds cleanly: glass eye discovery → testing → Ministry threat → planted decoy → burial, each because/therefore linkage narrows options. Orientation anchors (Mara, hanging orchard, post-virus) arrive by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening when the Ministry arrives forces the trade-off that the entire arc has prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered particulars (boutonniere, missing rope scars, alpine knot, letter) that converge at closure when Eamon pins the flower to the packet and places it in the logbook. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Eamon accepts his role as keeper of "other people's missing parts" with visible cost—his isolation is not solitude but a witnessing burden. The inferred lens holds; the final image reweights all prior mentions of gaps and borrowed memories.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal-Situational hybrid; the coordinates→cavern→fork sequence narrows options cleanly, and the rising creek compounds pressure. Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change (wet passage chosen, trail erased) with visible cost (inheritance refused, isolation accepted). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Mara, shop, morning). Ellis's expository turn ("every choice is typeset") slows momentum slightly, but the final climb reweights the premise with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece operates under a Hybrid lens with Causal scaffolding (dream → climb → ritual → choice) deepening into Accumulative pressure as motifs (lace, blood, ember) converge at closure. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maelin cauterizes the star's wound, refusing the voice's bargain; the "plainness" of the ordinary sky frightens her more than omens, reweighting the premise with felt cost. Orientation anchors (queen, council chamber, warning) land early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ember fissure mirrors the dream's cut star, narrowing options to descent or complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (Lio, ember nexus, twilight, pocket-sun alchemist) arrive within the first ~100 words. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: releasing the suns through the shell's spiral transforms them from commodities into a protest ("They cannot patent what you give back"), reweighting the premise of ownership with visible cost (forgoing sale, defying the Academy). The tightening is legible: Toma's warning → Lio's decision to "return differently" → the colored suns as ground-level constellation. One meaningful deepening is present, and the final image charges prior material. Cost is felt in the shared refusal and the phrase "marking the cost of taking light."

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Causal threads (Hybrid, dominant accumulative at closure). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph (grave → cabin → ranger's table). Closure lands as Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing: "I chose to keep writing until the dates behaved" forecloses the loop-driven panic with visible cost (accepting narrative discipline over passive spiraling), and the final birch-bark line reweights the premise (grave as calendar-puncture, not death prediction) with conceptual clarity. One meaningful deepening occurs at the ridge swap, where jealousy-of-past-selves crystallizes into method and the older/younger roles invert, narrowing options. Cost is legible: the protagonist trades chaotic time-sliding for the labor of continuous recording. Minor slip: the second lucid dream (threads-of-light map, thanking the younger self) adds texture but does not escalate pressure as sharply as the first; the turn feels lateral rather than tightening, though it does break the loop and earn the calm.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal chain: Iris reads distress in Aster's note, delivers the repaired screw, reads the room through occlusion, offers validation, and repositions the father's view, allowing reconciliation. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis or light Charged Poise): Iris confirms her method works without smell, reweighting her opening loss. However, the final image is told rather than shown ("understood that even without smell she could still unveil ordinary miracles"), reducing the felt weight of the realization. One meaningful tightening occurs when Iris intervenes, but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors within 120 words (platform, Ila, rune scholar, storm ceremony). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—scars become "readable," superstition translates to craft, childhood circles gain their fourth gate. The cost is visible: she revisits trauma, holds breath under storm pressure, and sheds shame on the page. One meaningful deepening through the held-breath rune writing tightens the dominant stake (transform scars into stories). Deduction: the master's whispered cue ("old fears are also runes") feels convenient rather than earned through prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture: Marin's setup of the copper-wire apparatus because-therefore enables June's arrival, memory floods judgment, apology triggers the fuse-pop micro-turn, then the decision to publish the correction. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid): Marin commits to the correction knowing it won't save every tree but will preserve meaning—felt cost in the cracked bottle and the chainsaws rehearsing. Orientation anchors early (archive, Marin, pre-orchard demolition). One meaningful tightening through the induced-current séance that narrows options to this singular act of restitution.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation anchors who and where by ~120 words (witness, temple library), so no penalty applies. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator stabilizes the dictionary definitions and climbs back through the well with a sense of duty replacing escape, crystallizing a new stance. Cost is conceptual (duty vs. escape, honesty vs. illusion) but felt rather than visceral. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates density through spiraling reflection and resolves through cadence shift and image reconfiguration at the end. The lens holds, though causality is impressionistic rather than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: ice narrows the flow → hydraulic clock lags → Ivar melts the channel → clock recovers but the sighting is late → inspector arrives angry → Ivar explains the razor-edge margins → they reset together and leave the mantle clock wrong. The closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the deliberate wrongness becomes a chosen meaning-marker, and the inspector's softening plus joint action forecloses correction with conceptual cost (abandoning precision as the only virtue). One minor slip: the inspector's conversion is compressed, but the closure image—"left the mantle clock deliberately wrong, a reminder that meaning is chosen, not merely ticked"—lands with clear cost and reconfigures the station's ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the exhibit and the shared lantern conversation reconfigure her grief and his gambling into a teaching moment with visible cost (she must carry his confession forward, he must stop). The causal chain from note to subway scavenger hunt to library volumes to hospital-line seat is legible, and the final image reweights the clover symbol with undeniable pressure. Minor: the grad-student overpass detail feels planted for the envelope reveal rather than arising organically.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through repeated wrong-number connections that teach Mara the paradox of her arrangement, then breaks the pattern when she makes the outbound call. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "Lena did not hang up" crystallizes the threshold moment, and Mara's "real name return" reweights all prior estrangement with conceptual cost—she has now exposed herself in the system she built for hiding. Cost is legible: she violates operator protocol and risks rejection. The ~120-word orientation anchor (booth location, job, callers, disc) is clean and purposeful. One meaningful deepening (the woman's confession triggers Mara's recognition) tightens options and drives the ending turn.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (jetty, locket, walnut ink, the rewritten oath) that converge at the public ceremony where Mara reads the confession aloud. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the town accepts accountability, the mayor's hand shakes, Jun's mother drops the locket, and Mara tears out the lie—each gesture forecloses the old covenant with visible social and personal cost. Orientation anchors appear promptly (jetty at twilight, Mara as archivist). One friction: the transition from jetty to archives to mayor's rehearsal to the final ceremony compresses four narrative shards in ~800 words; while the pattern holds and the lens remains coherent, the second and third beats (archives, mayor confrontation) feel slightly telescoped, risking a list-like quality. Cost is undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator's silence moves from isolating to "shared," and the moon rock is passed on with visible cost (the warmth fades, the narrator relinquishes ownership). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through escalating exchanges (cigarette, coat, lost child) until the platform fills with "mutual debts and cheerful thefts." The "story changes" moment is marked mid-text but could have been cued more subtly. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator realizes Mara herself needs the cure, reweighting all prior logistics.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—sensory immersion, skin-reading, dowsing—and accumulates pressure through layers of language and sensation until the pool scene crystallizes the stillpoint. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sentence "you can miss him and still live" reweights all prior seeking) with felt cost (she carries "steadier grief" forward). Orientation anchors who and what by the second paragraph, though "when" remains impressionistic until the constellation pause. One meaningful deepening occurs when the observatory stone delivers her brother's heartbeat, narrowing her emotional options and forcing her onward.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly: Mara, anomaly station, post-garden mistake. The causal lens holds: chirp → search database → edit ledger → nib bends → trace courier moment → insert tea scene → ledger clicks → nib unbends → stars shift. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara files the record with a blank signature, crystallizing that "the work of editing history was never finished, only passed along." Cost is conceptual but legible—she relinquishes authorship and accepts contingency. One meaningful tightening (the new cadence that pulls up the garden mistake) narrows options and forces the unbending.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes silence-mapping gestures and culminates in the musician's performance, which reweights the protagonist's stake of invisibility with visible social recognition. Orientation anchors (who, luminous harbor, the hour of forgetting) arrive promptly. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tune "stitches brief recognitions" and the protagonist names their motivation explicitly, crystallizing the attempt without full decisive change but with undeniable pressure and the camera-offering as felt cost. One clear tightening occurs at the foghorn failure, which narrows the window and accelerates the sign-work.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Sera follows a trail of artistic clues that deepen her understanding of Miko's message, culminating in a choice to broadcast rather than burn. Orientation is clear early (ash flats, ridge, archive). The closure unit—carrying evidence to the broadcast tower—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("her love for him felt like a volcano turned outward") rather than felt through forfeited options or visible sacrifice. The trail structure coheres, yet the final turn lacks causal pressure: nothing on the page shows why she chooses broadcast over destruction except Miko's instruction, which functions as external direction rather than protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density and the shared trance deepens via the drug's effects. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise)—both characters choose to "hold the dream steady" despite alarms, then the narrator returns alone to sustain the shared memory, foreclosing solitary grief with visible cost. The orientation anchor (institute, garden, lagoon, two characters) lands early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator's drumming reveals his brother and Sato admits her motive, tightening stakes from treatment to mutual resurrection attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative accent. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: Len signs the reroute, Mara refoldsher maps, and the maze "listen[s] to her softer world"—a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes her whisper-system as validated with felt professional and social consequence. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crane brake slips, forcing coordinated whisper-commands that prove the system under real emergency pressure. Cost is legible: the challenge stakes her job, and the ending image shows the professional acceptance she sought.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the girl's confession to the patrol is earned by the mirror revelation and the guardian's woven light-net, crystallizing her moral reckoning with visible cost (blood, sob, naming complicity). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the shutter patterns and star-lattice deepen the stakes via charged imagery that reweights her silence into speech. Cost is legible: she moves from evasion to full disclosure under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through synchronized display and the final canopy image. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (library, Harbor Street, Eli, chess club). The closure is a Decisive Change (council votes to keep the grove), but the cost is externalized to the mayor's memory rather than Eli's sacrifice, and the because/therefore chain from grotto magnetism to window timing to vote outcome relies on summarized causality ("passersby began to walk the pattern"). The final paragraph compresses the vote and outcome in two beats of tell, diluting on-page presence of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist steps into "truest shape," Rusk releases his daughter with visible cost). The piece operates under a Hybrid lens—causal through the scrimshaw's unlocking effect and Rusk's chain-work, accumulative through the whale-call pattern and sublittoral-fringe motif. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (dock worker, sublittoral checks, Disappearing Island). One meaningful tightening: the protagonist moves from checking pilings to actively detaching chains, and the final step into the sea forecloses the dock life with felt cost (the apron left as flag).

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece signals its pattern early (the turbines' "remade hush," Orin's narrative reframing of chores) and deepens through repeated ritual beats until the bouquet release. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the petals scattering "with no surge of comfort, only the remade hush settling in my chest" reconfigures the premise with felt cost—grief permitted to move rather than cured. Orientation is clear by the opening lines. One meaningful deepening (the morning goat-milking that produces proto-laughter) tightens pressure and narrows the narrator's stance from frozen to willing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens early and maintains it: each paraphrase dissolves boundaries incrementally until Lira crosses. The ban-lifting timeframe and colonnade are anchored by the second paragraph, satisfying orientation. The closure—Lira walking forward with the shadow until "both are simply air"—registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (a form of Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid), reweighting the sacred boundary with conceptual cost. The cost, however, is more implied than dramatized on the page; we infer self-dissolution rather than witness a specific forfeiture or price paid in her final thought or action.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors early (phoenix aftermath, courtyard, Mara sketching). The closure unit—Mara taking the reed tongue after the shared-awakening trade—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("both more awake") rather than shown through a visible foreclosed option or altered stance. The spiral-arrangement sequence functions as a reversal (Joren "wakes" to non-transactional attention), yet the mechanics of "awakenings" remain abstract, weakening the because/therefore linkage when the final trade depends on them. Orientation Test penalty waived; lens holds, but cost clarity at closure is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the dominant stake—whether artificial pilgrimage can carry real connection—deepens through the lens experiments and culminates in the press-walk reversal where raw voices replace polished curation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the city continues walking the loop for months, learning connection requires care), and conceptual cost is legible: officials must answer aloud, the program shifts from spectacle to conversation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara proposes raw archive over polish. However, the reversal itself is told in compressed summary rather than dramatized scene pressure, and the final paragraph's "the grid kept humming, but the city walked the loop for months" relies on distant retrospective summary rather than an on-page moment with immediate felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara moves from craving oblivion to meeting strangers "with subdued ardor," teaching intention-setting "not their past"—a visible stance shift with felt cost (husband's ashes carried, imagined beside her asking to "keep the light from spilling into harm"). Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: paper birds seed across beats, density increases as strangers arrive, cadence shifts to "bloom was a craft." Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Mara, observatory, after rock bottom). One meaningful deepening: from her first bird/Lysa to the line of strangers, reweighting survival as craft. The husband's imagined constraint ("use it instead like solder") charges the final image. Causality is loose but accumulative pressure coheres under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the narrator inherits measuring tape, receives Aurel's confession, decodes notebooks, and takes measurements into the streets, building toward a conceptual repricing where the "listening hush" becomes "a language." Closure lands cleanly—the map reveals "a cultural heartbeat" rather than market cycles, reweighting the inheritance. Orientation anchors arrive early (grandmother's loft, post-crash city, brass tape). One meaningful deepening occurs when street work validates the reconstruction method. Cost is conceptual (responsibility to share) rather than viscerally felt, keeping this shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where early; time is signaled ("twilight," "dawn") but the window remains vague. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (prism, light corridors, council scenes) and the closure reweights nostalgia itself via the teaching choice. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pagoda reveals the council's trap, narrowing the historian's understanding. Cost is felt in the tears and the veil "as if it were a confession," though the teaching resolution lacks a visible forfeiture that makes before/after stakes sharply legible.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery and petal-screen investigation until the shadow metamorphoses. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow accepts weight and becomes "careful, borrowable light"), and cost is present—Mara gives her river stone and withheld name—though the transformation reads smooth rather than fraught. Orientation anchors promptly (Blooming Library, dusk hour, Mara's role). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the shadow is consequence, not invader, which reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara files the report, accepts custody of animals, and pins the tail tip as a renewal symbol with visible cost (her reputation, the emotional labor of balancing boundaries and mercy). The causal lens holds—each beat (discovery, lists, call, sanctuary transfer) tightens options through her agency. Orientation is clear by the opening phrase. One meaningful deepening occurs when Tessa's confession reweights Mara's anger into structured compassion, altering her tactics from pure anger to a dual-track response.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: images (hourglass, coffee rings, scar, ivy, miracle-jar) recur with shifting charge, and the closure reweights the wound from rupture to legible script. Orientation anchors cleanly (tower, dawn, post-surgery). Escalation proceeds through density increase (wound inspection → ivy contact → cellar tunnel → rooftop release → street pour) with one meaningful deepening when Mara pours the light into the pavement crack shaped like her scar. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the wound knits "not shut but legible") with felt cost (pain, reopened seam, warmth leaking "like ink"). The healer backstory and miracle's origin arrive late without setup, creating a causal seam, but the final image recharges prior material and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Mara, projection booth, after-hours) land by line three. The piece accumulates pressure through lyric recursion—lyrics loop, letters tear, the film strip "incubates"—and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final act: Mara reads her letters into projected light, the lyrics find their tune via sprockets and rain, and she labels the can "deliver." Cost is felt (years of tearing letters, the booth "expanding" to release Lena's smile) and the cadence shift from searching to releasing reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through repeated meteor observation and the astrolabe's growing urgency, culminating in the vault's opening and dust release. Orientation anchors who and where early (Sel under the archway), though "Lumen Gate" and "unwritten calendar" remain abstract. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the final image (Sel under the aurora, city answering) crystallizes restored creativity with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt (exhaustion, extended vigil) but not sharp; the specific trade-off or foreclosed path remains oblique, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive early: dreamless guard, Farline train, mile marker Zero, glowing dune archive. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by ~25% through layered images (dune as depot/archive/choices, clock as midnight stasis). Closure reads as Charged Poise: the guard holds "midnight open by constant care," meeting auditors with a charm that lets "different towns breathing in the ledgers" persuade them to retreat. Cost is conceptual—nursing the bloom "until light could spread beyond my watch"—but the final image doesn't decisively reweight prior material or make a before/after legible with felt price; the stance crystallizes without visible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early (recurring translocations, deepening pattern of fears made visible) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the protagonist turns the crank, the gear clicks home, and the belief that required external verification loosens with felt tenderness. Orientation anchors cleanly (philosopher, mechanical rainforest, post-awakening), and the pattern of translocation → fear-naming → cathedral resolution coheres. One meaningful cost appears on the page: tears and the gear slipping into the mechanism signal a path foreclosed, though the emotional price could be sharper if the "argument I had lived by" were dramatized in an earlier choice rather than named retrospectively.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the vigil, indirect routes, and recurring star-punch motif build density toward a final reconfiguration where Mara trusts her own steps. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis tinged with Charged Poise)—she clips a new leash but holds it loosely, aware of the lesson. The cost is visible: she has traversed fear, rescued the dog with her own hands, and accepted that courage was waiting inside her. Orientation anchors (dog bolts, Mara at tide line, guides appear) land cleanly by ~10% of text, and the two-shard structure (shore/crossing, ridge/rescue) coheres under one window with a single transition. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara chooses the darkest descent after the vigil, narrowing options and paying off prior patience.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: the bellhop notices the thumbprint, discovers the hidden stairwell, retrieves the bolt, installs it, which enables Edda's therapy, which leads to the whispered "C" that triggers surveillance and forces the final stance. Closure is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: the protagonist chooses "a quiet that protected without erasing" with the director's arrival and hunters potentially outside—options are crystallized, cost is felt (the REMAIN alert, the risk), and the prior silent-choir policy is renounced in action. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. One meaningful tightening (bolt retrieval → therapy → whisper → surveillance response) sufficient for this length. The hunters' ambiguity ("might not exist at all") adds conceptual cost without resolving neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece opens with strong atmospheric anchoring (temple library, Orun's purpose) and follows a clear causal chain: pellet → rune → drift through time → discovery → confrontation → restoration. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (the pretender falls, the true succession is restored) combined with Orun's renunciation, which reconfigures his role with a visible choice. The cost is present but muted—walking away from the crown and appointing a council feels narratively tidy rather than fraught, and the "graceful collapse" of the library during the climax compresses what should be a high-stakes escape into an aestheticized image that dilutes urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: Mara rewrites her reports to hide the schedule in tapped rhythms, accepting complicity in controlled revelation with the cost legible in "those who listened could find the safe canal while the careless would keep following the disappearing line." The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens that tightens through pattern: atlas fragments → monthly failed attempts → beacon schedule discovery → palimpsest assembly → encoded transmission. Orientation anchors (Mara, floating station, post-ban world) arrive cleanly within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the atlas exchange reweights the "disappearance" from erosion to managed timing, narrowing Mara's stance from witness to gatekeeper.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Ilya has reignited contact with the rebellion via the stone-circle hum and receives acknowledgment, crystallizing her role as messenger with the next coordinates in hand. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered sensory detail (hum, opera glasses, coordinates, console alignment) and culminates in the reply that reweights the lull into active resumption. Orientation anchors are present early (spaceport bay, barefoot stargazer, post-raid lull). One meaningful deepening occurs when the hum becomes a communication method, narrowing her options to this risky transmission. Cost is conceptual—she has exposed herself and the network—but the on-page consequences remain abstract; the footsteps pause without confrontation, and we don't see tactical forfeiture or immediate danger materialized.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 5. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the embryo's transformation into a salamander that "lived in the hot spring channels and kept the water clean" reweights the premise of implanted destiny with conceptual cost—the oracle-program is undone. Felt cost is present: tradition's weapon becomes repair's servant, and the aftermath shows systematic change (teaching children to decode together). One meaningful deepening occurs through the kite-tail decode sequence. Minor slip: the lens wobbles slightly between causal logic and lyric accumulation, but holds at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers trauma-management tactics (breathing, attention to somatic signals, pearl of stillness) until the final beat where the buzzing-as-gull reweights prior material. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the photograph burial with date-not-wish signals a crystallized stance with felt cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first 80 words. One meaningful deepening (panic response → practiced pause → realistic assessment) suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors Mara, the lighthouse library, and the broken box by the first paragraph; spatial grounding is clear. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the narrative accrues images (tarot cards, thread, lighthouse beam, filaments) that intensify until Mara's weaving act reconfigures the portrait and stabilizes the beam—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant). Cost is legible in "not rescued, but changed" and the acceptance of fracture, though the sister's reappearance in the portrait's eyes verges on convenience. One meaningful deepening (untangling filaments → aligning slivers) suffices at this length, and the closure image reweights earlier material without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes orientation by ~120 words (Keir, post-eclipse encampment, mystery of time-slowing) and follows a clear causal chain: map clue → ink-pool travel → obelisk discovery → sabotage → return. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Keir returns with resolve and drone data, promising to "meet it awake" next time, foreclosing naive trust in authority with visible cost (the vanished proof, the need for future vigilance). The inferred lens is Causal with Situational pressure at the canyon; the escalation tightens options and the ending reweights his stance. One minor gap: the elders' demand for proof and Keir's workaround with drone data is compressed, slightly undercutting the felt cost of the evidence vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure arrives on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the consoles are reconnected, the archive shifts from tomb to forum, and the cost is visible in the protagonist's understanding that they risked arrest and Mara's disgrace. The causal chain linking the letter's discovery → internal deliberation → console activation → Council arrival → forced transparency is legible, though the Censor's abrupt embrace of transparency feels slightly convenient as a resolution mechanism. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (who, where, when), and the single-scene structure holds pressure cohesively under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Maris, Tarek, Lio), where (glass dome, desert), and when (third dusk after the tower falls) early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the layered images of roses, militia trucks, sheathed rifle, talisman, and kneeling, culminating in Tarek's decision to protect rather than capture. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Tarek stays, unbuckles his gunbelt, and plants archive seeds—a decisive reweighting of his role with visible cost (foregoing the bounty, defying the militia). The cost is legible on the page in his staying and planting. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maris sheathes the rifle and the roses refuse to open, forcing Tarek's stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Rovan releases the spike to seal the warning-echo, forecloses the goddess-prize path, and carries the lullaby internally with felt cost (empty hands, quieted garden). Escalation builds through density increase (overlapping harmonics, figure of static) and pattern break (constellations stumble, garden erupts) that reweights the stake from prize to protection. One meaningful tightening is present and cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (Celeste, penthouse, after the call) arrive promptly. The drive lens reads Causal: Lyle's tremor → Celeste investigates → she finds plate/log overlap → confronts Sato → bargain with documented proof. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers the dust-fresh plates and Sato confesses; the resolution (bargain enforced by logbook scratch) closes with cost (Sato must file damage report, observatory's miracle collapses). The closure is a Decisive Change with visible professional and emotional cost on the page. Minor deduction: the "orbit of regret" metaphor occasionally drifts toward thematic echo rather than pure causal linkage, and the bargain's exact mechanics ("rosewood nib scratching directly into his logbook") feel slightly convenient—but the cost is undeniable and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page: Lio speaks the apology, the firmware releases its stored need, and guilt becomes "muted enough to live with"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with visible cost). The drive lens is Causal/Situational Hybrid: letters prompt the quest, the amber activates the device, the tether and fold enable translation, and the apology triggers release. Orientation is swift (name, occupation, city, night within the first sentence). One meaningful tightening occurs when the translated cry becomes coordinates and "I am cold," narrowing options to confrontation. The cost—"heartbeat had been the static in every recording"—is felt but remains slightly abstract at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story accretes symbolic density (mist, tile flake, mandala, proverb fragments) and closes with a conceptual repricing—the mandala as "a map of shared doubt" reweights the unlearning from erasure into guided listening. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The closure effect is legible but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt; no on-page price is paid by Inez or the community for this shift. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tile flake refracts the proverb and the teacher's fear gives way to relief, but the transformation feels handed rather than forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: Samir, plaza, post-fire, dawn. The retrocognitive vision provides causal pressure that leads to the tessera discovery, which enables the renaming climax. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the shared loaf under the new names reconfigures survivor identity and the plaza's future with visible cost (the boy's restraint, Lina's forfeited vengeance). The drive lens reads Causal with Accumulative textures; the because/therefore chain from mosaic chips → vision → tessera → Grasp → truce holds clearly. Cost is legible in the steel cuffs and the ash-taste of both vengeance and forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: synesthetic fragments, fractured timelines, and memory layers build toward a closure image where all years clap at once and the garden stabilizes. Orientation anchors (Mara, theater, midnight, orchard) arrive promptly. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Silas takes his final bow, the timeline unifies, and Mara walks out with "nostalgia as direction," reweighting despair into possibility. Cost is conceptual—Silas's departure, the garden's fixing into one era—but the mechanics of how whispering her father's name stitches timelines feel opaque, relying on thematic echo rather than clear causal or accumulative steps.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Mara, studio, post-Static). The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texture: Jory's somatic markers → lattice test → muscovite split → route discovery → tunnel photo → public exhibit protocol. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's protocol offer and refusal to sell the negatives crystallizes her stance with social and professional cost (defying recall company). The cost is felt but not fully dramatized; the final "learned to listen for paths" operates more as conceptual repricing than embodied consequence, limiting upper-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with anchors (Mina, coastal cave, post-hibernation), teaches a pattern of heat-mapped emotion early, and deepens through tide entrapment → floating fossil → handprint discovery. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mina names the cave, leaves the fossil as promise, and begins to sing—a crystallized final moment that reweights her role from mapper to co-participant with visible cost (solitary renunciation of the fossil, acceptance of unknown presence). The lens holds; cost is felt in the act of leaving her mother's gift and singing alone to an entity she can never fully map.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a situational/accumulative lens: Lysa gathers buttons, listens to echoes, invites workers to speak, and the final release resolves the prophecy. Orientation is delayed—who Lysa is and what the warehouse stores emerge slowly, though the lyric register may justify this. The closure lands on the page (the canyon returns memories, the prophecy becomes a plan to leave), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; we do not see what Lysa or the workers forfeit or risk in that final turn. The causality is additive rather than narrowing: each step accumulates evidence without a meaningful tightening that forecloses an option or forces a visible trade-off before the release.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (mist, codes, silver hush recur and reweight). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: Rina's act of leaving the pillbox on the beam and walking back down constitutes Charged Poise—options crystallize, the relay is mended, and the cost (her burned status, the agent's death) remains visible without full resolution on the page. The escalation proceeds through discovery of Elsi, repair of the radio, and the successful warning, tightening pressure once with a felt cost at the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands with visible cost: Senn speaks the erasure aloud, Mara returns, and Rowan's anger "percolates down" into something portable—a resonant reconfiguration that forecloses vengeance. The causal lens holds: palimpsest → ferryman's condition → spoken truth → return. Orientation is swift (coachman, fog-bound crossing, evening rain). One meaningful tightening when the gutters near silence forces the crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a late situational tightening. The piece stacks fractured-timeline images (footprints, shadows, Sera's two faces) that build density toward the climax. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (potter, wasteland, oasis, dusk). The closure—rotating the lantern until "overlaps narrowed" and the oasis "chose a timeline"—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise verging on Decisive Change) with visible cost: combs crumble, the spring clears, the refuge releases into mortality. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is Earned Stasis with visible cost: Mara waters the stripped canes and arranges mirrors knowing darkness is "only a corner that can be turned," foreclosing retreat into invented safety with the repaired gauge as anchor. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—garden practice accretes into harbor competence through mirrored moonlight—held cleanly to the end. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (fire escape, harbor, Pier Nine). One meaningful deepening (mirror-shard competence validated) suffices at this length. The cost is felt but oblique; pointing to "endings still need tending" as the exact legibility moment.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors reincarnation memory, library setting, and the curator handoff by the first quarter. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through tidal cycles, sundial mechanics, stone-circle vibration, then crystallizes in the light-script instructions and ink transcription. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"coexist with the living world without needing it to forgive me"—with visible cost (wrinkled pages, imperfect record). The cost is legible in the moment of transcription and the emotional reconfiguration of guilt into self-reliance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid lens (accumulative texture with a causal turn at closure) holds cleanly. The story accumulates pressure through the day's confessions, then delivers a decisive change when the narrator admits withholding Arin's letter—a choice that reweights all prior material. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening (the reveal of Arin's identity and the narrator's secret) narrows options and lands with felt cost in the final image. Closure is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Mara, radio station, night shift, two months post-decode) land within the first sentence. The piece operates under a Causal lens: Mara recognizes the trickster pattern, rewires the broadcast chain, sends the subsonic reply, observes the beacon slip along her false map, then hands over her shield to the authorities—each beat follows motivated linkage. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: "the real contest was not contact versus fear but who got to weaponize wonder" reweights the premise, and her request to keep broadcasting the shield carries conceptual cost (she surrenders control to preserve the town's agency). The cost is stated rather than felt in image, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid): planting the compass cracks the nexus and releases the mentor, reconfiguring space from prison to stable path, with cost legible in the shaking hands and the mentor's century-long wait. The single-sentence structure and compressed timeline maintain coherence; the organ-as-sonar and compass-as-draft-tool mechanics hold throughout. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening third. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wall tries to fold the narrator and the compass insists on an exit, narrowing options and raising cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by ~80 words, meeting the test. The drive lens reads Causal through the investigation sequence, but the climax depends on Maren's convenient emotional collapse after one metaphorical "lance" gesture rather than dramatized pressure that narrows her options. The closure unit (confession + offer to paint) lands on the page, but cost remains abstract: "unite guilt with grief" is asserted theme, not a visible forfeiture or reconfiguration with felt price. The ribbon's causal role (double knot → stagehands → troupe) is clean, but the final turn bypasses embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a coherent Causal lens: Mara's parsing of the journals leads to the cemetery discovery, which leads to the confrontation and unlocking of the annex. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure—Mara sends the correction request and stands by the radar dome as "the station's instruments drew their clean lines across a sky that, at last, had room for Elias Kline's name"—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the cost is conceptual and social (the ancestor's name is restored, the "sacrifice could someday be undone"). The ending reweights the premise with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly by ~80 words. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: the hitchhiker's gift → scaffold clue → pullout discovery → self-exposure layers meaning, and the final image (hitchhiker glimpsed again, narrator ready to play under a new name) attempts Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the closure cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"ready to recount my old name as only a tune" tells transformation without showing a foreclosed path or felt price on the page. The causal chain from glass flake to pullout relies on convenience (the flake fits the lock "as if measured"), weakening earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (highway robber's son, LoopLine startup, circus train). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist lays new territorial markers "to guide myself out, a breadcrumb trail that refused to curl," foreclosing the inherited loop pattern with visible cost (LoopLine collapsed, he walks away from venture success). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through layered meanings of loops, territorial markers, and foreign bills, then the final image reweights the opening premise. Minor causality slip: the lawsuit collapse and board sale are summarized in one line without showing how the protagonist's fix arrived "too late" or what specific resistance it met.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: observatory watchkeeping → lucid dream → translation → temple rite. The closure—"decoding was not conquering a secret but keeping faith with it"—offers a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the decode-mission stake with conceptual cost (the burden of perpetual witness). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening line. However, the dream sequence is somewhat loose causally: the variable stars "pulse," then "turn carvings into lit syllables," and the narrator "spoke the syllables aloud"—this chain feels more asserted than dramatized, and the brother's message arrives as exposition rather than earned friction. The rite at the temple lands the closure cleanly, but the midpoint connective tissue is thinner than the high-band gate requires.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Causal lens: the conjurer's failed trick tightens the curse, the seed and twin's confession causally link, and Thalen's circle-reversal unbends the mirror-lid to free the twin. Closure lands on-page with cost—the vortex stops, the lake flattens, and Thalen stands between guards and conjurer. The cost is visible: years of ice paid, items returned in expanding circles, the conjurer speaks aloud without trick. One meaningful tightening (descent → discovery → reversal) is sufficient for this length. Minor orientation delay (the vortex and orchard mechanics take a beat to clarify) does not obscure the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through linked images (clipping, scars, maze corridors, cracked seal) and a final cadence shift when Lysa's blood stitches the covenant. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the seal slides whole, the mother is found, and the covenant "carried them back to a present that could wait for its future"—a crystallized moment with felt cost (Lysa bled, linked dreamers' wounds align). One tightening is legible: Lysa's scar-touch to the seal narrows chaos into order. Minor causality slip: the visionary's roots and the chorus of dreamers enable the maze-walk, but their mechanics remain abstract; the line "his own scars flared in answer" implies coordination without showing prior constraint or rehearsal.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (Mira, catacomb orchard, "tonight") land by line three. The closure unit is a Decisive Change with visible cost: Mira binds Jory's destiny to hers by trading her ability to forget pain, and the silver thread settles into her skin. Cost is legible on the page ("woke each morning with yesterdays hurt fresh as dawn"). The causal chain holds: first bargain failed because someone harvested pieces → Mira discovers the thread → new bargain with irreversible cost. One meaningful tightening (discovery of the harvested thread) narrows options and forces the final trade. The piece teaches its lyric-textural pattern early (roots as runes, bones as punctuation) and pays it off at closure when "the skull apples stopped clacking."

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist moves from proving correctness to "tracing where sound had tried to stay," a stance crystallization with conceptual cost (abandoning the appraiser's defensive posture). The drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; the speaker-cloth investigation causally links televised failure → quarry contract → research → Marla's brother, while accumulating meaning through layered memory. Cost is legible in "I did not hide behind jargon" and the shift from earplugs-as-facts to facts-as-connection. One mild orientation delay (quarry context arrives ~140 words in) and slight lens drift between modes, but the closure unit itself is clean and the because/therefore chain holds.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Nerin renounces holding the warmth, writes the guide, and plants the seed—a crystallization of stance that forecloses chasing Mara back, with felt cost ("needs it to become comprehension" → letting light pass). Orientation anchors appear promptly (magnetic arbor, Nerin, notebooks, infirmary below). One tightening: the arbor's field snaps a warning, narrowing his choice from chasing warmth to releasing and recording. The cost is legible in the shift from ambition to teaching future mourners. Minor slip: the causal link between wiring the seed and hearing Mara's memory-arrangement reads slightly elided—motive ellipsis is acceptable under accumulative design, but the mechanism remains oblique enough to nudge the score below 7.8.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early with the tidal rhythm and moon-phase memory cycle, then deepens through the creel ritual and smelting practice. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator accepts being "both the forgotten person and the librarian," a stance crystallized by the given name "Keeper of Small Miracles" with the visible cost of lost origin. Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph. The "next full moon" return of Lio/Liora and the final titan-gear wade provide meaningful tightening and a charged final image. One deduction: the causality between smelting bookmarks and the city's renewed sense of surprise could be more concretely dramatized; the turn from "repetition" to "ritual" is told more than shown in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (bunker inspector, Vault Seventeen entrance, evening) arrive early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through the pearl-seashell ritual, the recited confessions, and the dawn crowning. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pearl above the door loosens tongues, Mara files noncompliant yet leaves the shelter unsealed, and the seashell waits for new etchings—a crystallized final moment where options and stakes are reconfigured. However, the cost is mostly conceptual (filing noncompliant, leaving the door unsealed) and not dramatized with visible professional or relational consequence on the page; the final image tells us "faces soften, old grudges dissolve" rather than showing a specific neighbor's choice or Mara's price paid. The causal link from pearl-warming to community confession feels more magical than earned by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis: the protagonist accepts that self-forgiveness is "not a destination but a route I must keep surveying," with visible cost (the brother's death is not undone, but future harm is prevented). The causal lens holds cleanly from the inspection failure through the graffiti discovery to the intake gate photograph. Orientation is established early (river chronicler, three weeks post-medication, disused station). One meaningful tightening occurs when the graffiti grid number unlocks the skipped inspection site, narrowing options and forcing accountability.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the cipher unfolds through propagation delays, building density until the final name-reveal reweights the opening stakes. Orientation anchors (veiled dreamer, rented attic, vellum letter) appear early. The closure—mailing the apology before the second letter arrives, then receiving confirmation that "the library is where you dared to speak"—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), reweighting the external quest into an internal act with visible cost (the three nights of work, the act of mailing). One persistent constraint (the watch's reversals) shapes tactics throughout. The cost is legible: he has faced the silence he avoided and released the unsent words.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors early (velvet observatory at midsummer, Liora as provenance researcher). The drive lens reads Causal: Liora's plant-telepathy insights → discovery of the vent map → decision to smuggle the violin → blank report and downstream cost. Closure lands on the page: she signs the indeterminate report "before the promise loses its glow," hears the violin played in the alleys, and knows "the empire would never plug all the holes"—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost (lost position, threat from the envoy). One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; the figs' terror image and coffee-stain futures narrow her options.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Mara learns that "attention can keep the crossing from being cruel" and chooses to infuse the captured spark into the sky rather than hoard it, reweighting her stance on preservation. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of image and ritual detail rather than because/therefore linkage—and holds to the end. Cost is legible in the shift from fearful custodian to willing releaser, though the specific price (what she loses by not keeping the spark) could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara climbs, discovers the grotto, unlocks the chamber, witnesses the cycle-vision, and returns with a reframed practice of contentment. The final image—planting the young fig and remembering the grotto—reconfigures her stance from seeking contentment as prize to cultivating it as duty, a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (the hairpin left behind, the acceptance of shared labor). Orientation is clear by the opening lines. One deduction: the pool's season-showing and the mother's vision deliver insight more through symbolic tableau than causal pressure that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece is single-POV, continuous in time, with clear who/where/when anchors by the opening lines. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered motifs (mirror shard, chimes, cloak) and a cadence shift at closure when Mara wears the cloak and speaks truth rather than delivering Sile's requested permission. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—she keeps the cloak as a promise, reconfiguring her paid role into genuine conscience with felt cost (she can no longer sell easy stories). The cost is legible in "her paid conscience felt briefly like her own" and the trade-off of keeping the cloak versus delivering it. One meaningful deepening is present; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (platform, pond, night air) and the dominant stake—learning to vanish, preserving technique before Sato loses language—coheres throughout. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (ripples, magnetic pull, starlight geometry) that reweight the central question of attention and disappearance. Closure lands on-page with conceptual cost: Sato vanishes into youth so the narrator can carry the truth, foreclosing Sato's ability to teach again. The causality is elliptical but legible—grotto reverses attention, Sato demonstrated the method by disappearing—and the final image (empty entrance, notebook left behind) recharges prior material. One micro-structural issue: the grotto's mechanics are introduced late (past midpoint) and resolved quickly, compressing the tightening phase.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Oren), where (bone towers in canyon), and what (learning pulse navigation) by the opening lines. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered sensory detail (humming, echoes, birds, arrowhead appraisal) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—Oren internalizes the route as sung intervals rather than walked distance, reconfiguring navigation itself. Cost is felt in the discipline of refusal ("refusing to chase any sound that was only grief") and the patience required. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pulse slides into his humming, reweighting the premise. Closure lands cleanly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece infers as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density and recurring luminance imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Davin leaves the keystone and walks past the automaton. Orientation anchors (Davin, spire, dusk departure) land clearly within the first 120 words. The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—his gesture "outlast[s] the automated age"—and the lens holds. One deduction: the automaton's mid-climb appearance introduces a causal fork (the machine "offer[s] to generate a prayer") that deflates immediately without material consequence, creating a brief pressure wobble before the terrace payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the lamplighter moves from pier to underwater wreck, each beat layering imagery and intensifying the central question about sound's color until the vow produces the violet bloom. Closure arrives on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist commits to "keep walking my pier at night, lighting lamps so other people could find their own colors," foreclosing the solitary search in favor of service—a reweighting with implicit cost. The two-location structure (pier surface, underwater library) and the temporal envelope (lantern release framing the descent and return) remain coherent. Minor weakness: the catch-release mechanism and glowing card feel slightly convenient rather than fully motivated by prior causality, preventing full high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the edgewise coin falling blank reweights prophecy from certainty-engine to alignment-permission, and Mara's laugh crystallizes her shift from seeking external validation to accepting self-originated purpose with visible cost (fuel spent, trembling deck, crew doubt). Causal lens holds: coin prediction → split dish → signal sent → receiver confirms in past tense, each step tightening options. Orientation anchors (Mara, ambered deck, post-contraction sky) arrive cleanly within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the prophecy "becomes personal" and forces the edgewise-coin interpretation, narrowing her choice and raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (recordings → light → crystals → names) that reweights the stake of managing grief through ritualized naming. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the reaper accepts that naming fears can ease their burden, foreclosing raw grief for structured memorial work. Orientation anchors clearly (observatory, dusk, reaper with recordings) within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when scattered light crystallizes voices into nameable shards, altering the reaper's relationship to collected deaths. Cost is legible: "that hurt was why I needed other names to survive."

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal undertow. The piece accumulates pressure through images (empty nets, stopped clocks, the dripping basin) and tightens when Evin's repair matches the drip rhythm, then rings the bell to answer the unanswered call. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the "silver ripple" at the tide line is a promise rather than gift, the universe "settles by a fraction," and the bell continues counting drops—options reconfigured with visible cost (no fish returned, only the fraction of balance restored). The cost is conceptual and felt: Evin must trust an incomplete answer. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean by paragraph two (Mara, Reservoir Six, twilight ridgeway). The causal chain is tight: chime silence → drought drop → exposed Bellford → label clue → photo trail → boot print → decision to speak publicly. The closure—setting photos in the library, hanging the label, letting the chime sing—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization) with felt cost: breaking the institutional silence her father imposed. One small friction: the emotional arc from discovery to public disclosure feels slightly compressed in the final two paragraphs, though the decision itself is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors arrive clearly within the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through setting detail, starling observation, and alchemical process, culminating in a cadence shift when the metal brightens and the orchard "rang softly." However, the closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing—lands with insufficient cost legibility. Liora achieves her goal without visible forfeit; the "impossible freshness" charges the final image but the before/after stakes remain conceptual rather than felt. One meaningful deepening occurs when the starlings provide the missing ratio, tightening her path toward success.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (watcher in arbor, moonlit air lanes, tonight's supply drop). The drive lens is Causal: the impostor's pause triggers buckle-checking, which enables the trap revision, leading to capture and route correction. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the protagonist stays in the arbor rehearsing, accepting the solitary burden with visible cost ("alone, in the arbor's silence that repeated every choice as a soundless echo"). One meaningful tightening (recognizing the impostor) escalates to the capture, and the cost is legible in the final image of solitary vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (floating dojo, ego-death survivor, rewriting history) arrive early. The custody trial escalates through the Custodians' arrival, the jar reveal, and the trial demand, then the protagonist's paired motion (push/pull) forces shared breath and ends the battle with a co-guardianship charter. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (closer to Charged Poise): the protagonist reframes custody as "custody of the moment," and the clone body shudders in response to shared attention. Cost is conceptual—both are rewrites, neither original—but the physical/relational price (what the protagonist or factions forfeit) is asserted more than shown. The because/therefore chain from numbness → clarity → dojo training → trial → paired breath holds, though the final charter materializes quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, moving toward Charged Poise at closure. The hourglass anchor and tunnel ritual accumulate pressure through sensory density and the musician's lore; the macerating pulp and off-key wind build to the child's released laugh, which ricochets toward daylight. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the son's snort-laugh and wife's half-sob open a crack in the airtight house, reweighting prior silence without fully resolving grief—cost is legible in Bram's continued secrecy and the handle placed ready for "the next night." Orientation is clear by the second sentence (Bram, tunnel, late hour, hourglass). One ambiguity: the mist-shapes ("outlines of moments never spoken aloud") feel slightly underexplained—are they literal or Bram's projection?—but the pattern coheres and the ending image charges prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure: mist-and-pendant imagery accumulates through breathing the garden, the doorway on ribs, and the final dull pendant with catalog card. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): both characters choose to interiorize rather than escape, with conceptual cost legible in the dull pendant and the tag "RETURNABLE THROUGH SLEEP." Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the guardian confesses his terror and the protagonist recognizes their shared misread map, tightening the dominant stake from individual escape to mutual stance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: successive approximation and ember-breath imagery build density until the crozier's transformation cuts the charter seals—a Decisive Change with felt cost (risk of punishment, collapse of the furnace). The causal chain from broken crozier → heating → reshaping → seal-breaking is legible, and the final image (tool carried forward, pit collapsed to glass) reconfigures the premise with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's decision to drop the tallest mast and tune the city as a receiver rather than broadcaster reconfigures the premise with visible cost (one arrogance surrendered, a page torn away). The causal chain—hush inverted, signal decoded, blueprint enacted—holds cleanly under a Causal lens. The orientation window extends slightly (towers/gorge/perigee delivered ~150 words in) but the effect serves world-building pressure and does not obscure the stake. One micro turn (hearing the gap, following it to a new pulse) deepens without fragmenting.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causality is clean: Lina traces hourglass lines → matches knots/routes → aims ferry at grotto → older self explains seam → Lina radios code → ferries align. Orientation anchors (Alder Strait run, deckhand, commuter ferry) land within the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the seam held because they kept working it" crystallizes the choice to maintain the parallel ferry routes as an ongoing practice, with the cost felt in "whatever now was" and the permanent transient ache accepted. One meaningful tightening occurs when the older self's radio transmission aligns with Lina's, narrowing the seam and unfreezing the commuters. The Causal lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds through pattern (chalk grids → weaving → maze → eruption → stable lattice) with a clear cadence shift at "let it erupt" that reweights connection from preserved story to maintained tension. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final lattice image crystallizes the texture of connection with conceptual cost (memories alter, but the structure holds). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One micro-penalty: the child's role in the climax arrives late and feels slightly convenient, though it does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Mara decodes the probe → develops edge geometry → tests it on the surface → rewrites curriculum. Orientation anchors (benthic city, post-discovery year, navigation instructor) land early. The closure—Mara rewriting curriculum to prepare children for "unfolded horizons"—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (world opened, responsibility accepted) with felt cost ("grief and wonder braided together"). One minor gap: the council's shift from "uneasy but desperate" to granting ascent lacks on-page negotiation, relying on summary permission.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Mara, atrium, twilight, her role). The piece follows a causal chain: photograph → hearing aid pulse → stairwell → intervention → closure image. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Mara logs Eli as a promise and sits with her own stubborn life—a reconfiguration with felt cost. However, the mother's voice "softening into static that sounded almost like relief" relies on metaphor rather than a concrete, unmistakable image of cost. The hearing aid growing warm functions as a lyric callback, but the cost remains more conceptual than visceral, keeping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: tide window forces entry, claustrophobia resists, codex page guides navigation, reactor coil enables passage, cable repair completes Ken's work. Closure lands on-page with Mara routing Ken's log along the repaired cable—a Decisive Change that restores the link and memorializes him. Cost is visible: she endured terror, risked drowning in vapor, and physically clamped the joint. Orientation anchors promptly (sea cliff, Mara, tidal window). One meaningful tightening occurs when the corridor forces phase transition.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. Orientation anchors (Mara, opal observatory, after static clears) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The ink-spiral ritual accumulates pressure through sensory density and Lyle's fragmented-memory metaphor, culminating in the file that flags the certificate error and the annotated mistakes file—Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara stops counting, feels the room "hold her gently," and leaves "correctly recorded," forecloses the counting reflex with felt cost. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Cost is visible in the stopped count and the shift from denial to embodiment. Lens holds; closure lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the diamond goes still, the walls answer with a new voice, and travelers later hear texture translated—Ilen succeeds in creating a library without pages, though no living person can speak Vey from birth. Cost is visible: Toma's death, the speakers' throats failing, and Ilen's solitary night scraping bone until vibrations match memory. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density increases through layered attempts (diamond on palm, word for roughness, silk/grit timed to swifts) and the cadence shift at closure (late flock spiral, structured chorus) reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/concept by the second paragraph (Ilen, Resounding canyon, tunnel of echoes, dying language). One meaningful deepening: the diamond's hunger nearly erases rather than preserves until Ilen harnesses bird-patterns to control resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors promptly: Mara, Larkspur, post-Jonas's return, underground garden. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (causal escalation via the lure-and-anchor plan, accumulative texture via the music/gravity motifs) that coheres at closure when Jonas converts his bitterness into refusal. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) lands on the page: "jokes, he said, are how you refuse to disappear" reweights the opening grief-and-disappearance frame with visible cost (Jonas keeps the phone, remains a potential doorway). One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara plants the arrowhead and the gravity hiccups, narrowing options and forcing Jonas's final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens reads Causal with Accumulative texturing: Lio's rhythmic signaling → statues pause → tree uproots → struggle → dawn procession. Orientation anchors quickly (sky-bridge, Gearford, orchard edge). The closure—tree walking toward the city, statues following—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): options reweighted, the orchard "stood open," cost visible in the struggle and the tree's chains cracked. One meaningful tightening when the tree's roots wrap the statues' ankles. Cost proof: "the tree's roots wrapped their ankles, pulling the patrol line into the soil." Slight fuzziness in how the statues shift allegiance so quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors orientation early (cobalt arcade, twilight, daily mail drop) and teaches a Causal lens: linking absences → discovering the Mendery → confronting smugglers → thunderstorm → drone reply → tomorrow's gate crossing. The closure is Charged Poise: Ivo steps toward the clinic gate with renewed purpose, having delivered Nela's plea and received the mother's note; the cost is legible (risking treason, one letter he can keep). One tightening pressure point (smuggler confrontation) narrows options. The drone-reply mechanics arrive somewhat late but are motivated by prior linking.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds through the journey into darkness, discovery of the oasis, repair of the horse, and culminates in the singing that transforms silence into a craft medium. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Rowan leading the mended horse toward the junction with the train stirring carries visible cost—his voice returns not as speech but as shaped breath, and the train's readiness to "carry new possibilities" reconfigures the abandoned space. The wrong-turn choice meaningfully narrows options and the halo fragment's use at the wound creates causal pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (carpenter, train, marsh).

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered scarf-memory → geometric measurement → hidden pocket discovery → guiding patrons, culminating in "Found the coordinate of listening; tomorrow I will catalog the way in." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's stance shifts from isolated observer to active curator with visible cost—she's committed to exposing the pocket, foreclosing her private solitude. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The hyperbolic-geometry mechanic is signaled early and pays off at the bookcase moment. One meaningful deepening through the scarf's reawakening and patron guidance is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Mina photographs the empty space the figure leaves, finding "the beginning she could live" in chosen luminous absence. The cost is legible—she releases the clutched memory and accepts the figure's departure. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Mina, Tideway Library, two a.m., archipelago). The accumulative lens holds: density increases through layered light-capture attempts until the doorway forms and the final image reweights all prior longing. One meaningful deepening: the realization that she "clutched it as memory, not as a future" transforms her method and enables release. Minor tension: the middle section loops through similar beats of capturing/painting light without a sharp tightening choice until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the ritual accumulates symbolic pressure through pool, hair, star-naming, and the final diagram. Orientation anchors who and where by the ravine descent, though "when" remains cosmic-vague. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator speaks new constellation names aloud, the room steadies, and the locksmith returns the braided loop with a warning—options are reweighted and fear's future attempts acknowledged. Cost is felt (old laughter swallowed, fear will try new locks) but remains oblique; the decision to speak does not visibly foreclose a concrete path on the page, keeping the price more atmospheric than stakes-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric overtones. The piece teaches a pattern of returning images (mushrooms, constellations, notebooks, shipwrecks) and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lissa recovers her memories and commits to annual tending. Cost is present but oblique—she mails the prologue and promises future dives—yet the final image of her repainting constellations reweights prior material with visible commitment. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first third. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the ring is a latch, not a warning, and acts on it.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive by the opening beat (library, Lio, reversible exile premise) and the dominant stake—Mara's need to reverse exile—is clear. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through annotation ritual, shadow manipulation, and Mara's steadying strokes until the tag falls away as Charged Poise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tag falls; she speaks her name; the door-shaped shadow opens) with felt cost (she must choose the angle where she looks afraid). One meaningful deepening occurs when her annotations straighten the trapped shadow. Minor causality slip: the mechanics of how leaf geometry aligns with shadow to flip the balcony scene are asserted more than dramatized, creating a hinge that feels more magical convenience than earned logic.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (narrator, Soren), where (parapet, waterfall), and when (budding season) within the first 120 words. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the collection ritual, the seed ceremony, the threshold crossing, and the final fruit that restores blue. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the impossible fruit laid on Nela's tongue, color restored) with felt cost (the narrator's fear harvested, the seed replanted to maintain the weave). One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator admits losing blue and is asked to contribute that shade. Minor causality slip: the shift from pruning to drawing is not established as an option before the climax, weakening the turn's motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the interlaced hush thickens through knot-unraveling beats, and the final image—spirits dropping, sanctuary breathing—reweights the premise with visible cost (ancestor bound into mask, vow broken). Orientation anchors promptly (prism sanctuary, midnight, quartz staircase). One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist discovers the storm-spirit is their ancestor, narrowing the choice to personal sacrifice. The closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): the sanctuary shifts from haunted to inhabited, and the protagonist's act forecloses the family's fear-fed pattern. Minor causality slip: the elders' half-whispered secret and the protagonist's agreement to exhume feel under-motivated in setup, slightly weakening the before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered discovery (torn map → video reels → henge → vault → parish records). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow "no longer needed to wander" after Lena witnesses with care) that reweights the premise with visible cost—she frames the rip rather than hiding it, and the vault becomes archive rather than exhibit. However, the cost remains conceptual and told ("the shadow no longer needed to wander") rather than felt on the page through a decisive image or forfeiture that alters Lena's stance. The "soft applause" of rain and the agreement with the archivist deflate tension rather than crystallize it, and the because/therefore linkage between her witnessing and the shadow's cessation is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (diver returns to wreck two months after Earhart recovery). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered discoveries (reel, notebook, snow globe) that reweight the central question about letting go. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when the narrator releases the reel and the snow globe demonstrates "release can be measured, and still be merciful"—the final image reconfigures the opening stake with conceptual cost (choosing not to publish). One meaningful deepening through Vaughn's notebook entry shifts understanding from physics to acceptance. The cost is legible but oblique; the forfeit of fame and evidence is implied rather than felt in body or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens held throughout: density increases from tuning through encoding to sparks and thunder's break, reweighting the dominant stake (articulating unspoken needs via routing). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lio's final glyph promises to keep walking, the graffiti travels below, readers find their needs spoken back—options reconfigured, cost felt (he commits to perpetual quiet carrier role). Orientation anchors (courtyard, Lio, tonight, storm coming) arrive cleanly within the first 100 words. One meaningful deepening: the ghost's need clarifies from resurrection to routing, narrowing Lio's tactical choice and foreclosing alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands through Earned Stasis: Lysa stops the elevator, thwarts the conspiracy, and crystallizes her stance on curiosity as both sabotage and salvation with visible cost (she climbs out, evades conspirators, reaches the tenth floor by stair). The causal lens holds: diary discovery → decryption via goggles → hidden instruction → brake pull → promotion offer, each beat narrowing options. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the code shifts at floor six to address her directly, raising personal stakes and foreclosing passive delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara reels in the telescope, whispers Juno's name, and seals the notebook—memorializing through proof that "empty space where the tether broke had guided them home." The cost is conceptual but legible: her private method, dismissed as childish, now holds undeniable weight. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the layered cloud-naming, the falling telescope carving a "temporary channel," and the final margin note. One meaningful deepening (the gamble with atmospheric memory) tightens options. Orientation is clean by the opening line. Small penalty: the radio crackle recovery feels slightly convenient; the mechanism "borrowed from the remembered corridor of signal" needs one more concrete anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise blend): Liora accepts both temporal and cognitive limits, sealing the book and stepping out under her painted sky with visible cost (the demolition begins; she leaves the knowledge hidden). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (name, setting, commission). One meaningful deepening occurs when the coin unlocks the book and she translates indentations into her fractal star code, narrowing her options from simple task to symbolic acceptance. The foreman's pause and the final hammer strike charge the ending image with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt: she leaves behind both the book and the illusion of unlimited preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph and maintains a causal chain: Lio greets the light → it quivers → he maps hopscotch spirals → the light follows → engines wake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the airship turns toward the unmapped glare with Lio shouting for Yara, crystallizing his shift from passive mending to active discovery. The cost—moving into danger, abandoning "dull drift"—is felt but not deeply paid on the page; the stakes remain more potential than visceral. The lens is Causal with lyric texturing.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Mara, frozen library, eclipse locksmith). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and lyric cadence build to the final deepening when Mara grasps "Return by making, not by taking" and files her own gear, reweighting the repair concept with visible craft cost. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she exits with the finished gear and originals untouched, crystallizing the alignment principle without a decisive confrontation. One causality question: the hall of mirrors "rearranges reflections" to show her father's bench with no clear rule or cost, reading slightly convenient, preventing 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: chalk messages accumulate into collective effort, the bell returns with reweighted meaning, and the final relay-well opening reconfigures the community. Closure arrives on-page (the window to the nebula opens, Serren brightens, the crew promises to continue the practice), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no character forfeits a live option or suffers a visible loss. The orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. One meaningful deepening occurs (the grave revelation shifts trust from fear to understanding), but the resolution feels orchestrated by Serren's plan rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara adjusts the clock, the pane clears, she sings through the puppet, and her heartbeat syncs with the gears—each beat adds density and reweights the stake. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: Mara becomes "a quiet correction," the doomsday strike dims suffering rather than erasing it, and the hush spreads in "transparent, merciful arcs." The cost is legible (her life, her breath), though the metaphorical transformation slightly softens the felt immediacy. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph, and the inferred lens holds through the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the forgotten blueprint motivates the waystone assembly (causal), while the curse mechanics and orchard-as-map layer meaning (accumulative). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + forward commitment): the protagonist decides to finish the waystones, transforming the Duke's convenience into "a map of ethics." Cost is legible—"each impression I leave will be a sign"—but the final image ("the path through the labyrinth will not" look the same) tilts abstract rather than landing on a charged concrete beat. One meaningful tightening occurs when the nut unlocks the waystone and confuses the birds, narrowing options and enabling escape.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative textures (foam patterns → adhesive insight → settlement action → new bridge). Orientation anchors quickly: polymer chemist, braided ravine, one year post-disaster. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara crosses the new bridge, witnessing foam braid below, believing her work can "make a connection without erasing the split"—a crystallized stance with visible prior cost (settlement, patent license, public admission). One meaningful tightening occurs when the foam insight narrows her technical path and enables the ethical repair sequence. Cost is legible: she forfeited patent control and faced families. The lens holds cleanly, though the midpoint epiphany compresses causal steps more than ideal.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates symbolic density—glass orchard, bottled moonlight, fragments on petals—and the closure moment (vendor recognizing the story as their own origin) reweights all prior material with felt cost: the protagonist steps toward a beginning that was withheld. Orientation is clean by the opening lines (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening occurs when the moonlight map makes silences countable, narrowing the task to a single incision. The cost is legible in the final line ("stepped toward the beginning"), which forecloses the vendor's prior blankness, though the emotional price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Safi teaches the squad that remorse can be shared without spreading panic by containing it in himself, then distributing it in "small sanded portions" through the broth. The causal lens holds throughout: tasting memories → accepting contagion → blending it with his own failures → sharing controlled doses. Orientation anchors immediately (garrison chef, courtyard, post-rain). One meaningful tightening occurs when Safi descends and accepts the raw remorse, narrowing his options to either contain it or abandon his craft. Cost is legible: he carries the mixture in his body and the first soldier who touches him weeps.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with aspirational-accumulative texture. Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough; the tower–elevator tube linkage is established. Escalation proceeds through Mara's nocturnal work → Nine's testimony → the bell summons → collective repair, but the chain relies on convenience: the mayor appears "drawn by the singing" just in time, farmers arrive and comply without meaningful resistance, and the entire structural repair completes in hours. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (bridges begun, Nine invited to keep talking), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt—Mara hangs the weight "not as a relic but as proof," a thematic claim that replaces on-page sacrifice. No tactic or option is visibly foreclosed; the ending grants satisfaction without a legible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors (Nira, canyon rim, moonlit night) land quickly. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Nira's memory tangles densify through the periscope discovery, the mirror's fractured reflection, the copper helix modification, and the final descent with "layered sleeping histories." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she opts to "excavate every abandoned dream and file it under living names," reweighting her transformation from madness to archival inheritance. Cost is conceptual—she accepts the entanglement rather than severing it—but remains implied rather than viscerally dramatized (no relationship loss, physical price, or immediate trade-off shown on the page). The backstory block (mother, miner, surgery) arrives as reflective insert mid-story without a present scene cue, creating mild orientation drift; applying the BRR expanded allowance (reflection-led mode exceeding 30% with present anchors), the drift is minor but still noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the spiral unfolds through density increase (green ink shimmer → footprints on ceiling → calcite door → brass dial) with clear cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the cliff-mouth paragraph (~15% mark). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ilya copies the combinations and speaks them aloud, an act that reconfigures the grotto's harvest-logic with conceptual cost (sharing resists theft by silence). The inferred lens holds without contradiction, and the cost is legible in the final image of him clutching notes as mist reclaims secrets.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Lysa plans to carry this silence-music to neighbors, crystallizing her role as mediator between bodies that cannot sing, and the final image (insulator hanging "like a pale moon") reweights the grove's hum with conceptual cost (her ongoing solitude as quiet maker). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The piece deepens through layered wire-stringing beats and the discovery that "cracks were never damage alone," a meaningful tightening that reconfigures her method. One substantive escalation suffices at this length; cost is felt in her acceptance of persistent silence and the responsibility she carries forward.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear causal chain: Sable translates the nexus's silence into an alphabet of restraint, discovers the covenant's betrayal, delivers the message to Mera, and the council votes to renounce the nexus. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the choice not to use power—with visible cost (enemies may laugh, the choice is "narrow"). Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, stakes by the third paragraph). The lens reads as Causal with Accumulative textures; the covenant's response to the vote provides on-page confirmation that the refusal has weight.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens: Lio's quest to unlock the diary under the ticking clock of the fireworks creates coherent pressure. Closure lands as Charged Poise—he forgives Mara's memory and expands his catalog with visible conceptual cost (accepting her loud art as a parallel love letter). Orientation anchors quickly (workshop, tonight, pre-fireworks). One meaningful tightening occurs when the diary reveals the misfire danger, forcing immediate public action. The cost—trust extended to a dead woman's apology—is legible but somewhat diluted by the ease with which the watchman's suspicion dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story unfolds causally: Jun's request is denied, her sensitive nose leads her to the garden, Etsu's test reframes the seed's purpose, and her observation earns the gift with a condition that reconfigures her role from taker to contributor. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she accepts service over theft, and the condition (send back observations) forecloses the path of pure ambition with visible cost. The causal lens holds cleanly. One tightening—Etsu's bloom-watch condition—narrows options and the final act (wrapping the seed, drawing the spiral) lands the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page: Lysa presses the arrow tip into the stone tree, accepting resilience as distributed chorus rather than singular source—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing). Orientation anchors early (Pomona Drift, orchard pilot, seventh-day inversion). The narrative follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: gravity inversion deepens atmosphere, the arrow tip's warmth and echo-layering build density, and the final image reweights the premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when she crosses the hollow threshold and hears layered heartbeats. Cost is conceptual (renouncing the search for one miracle) but the final act—embedding her arrow—reads more as joining than forfeiting, muting felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Causal with accumulative elements. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the investigator breaks the convergence by disrupting the spiral, sound returns, and the final line reweights prior motifs ("measuring the haze until it becomes a map"). Orientation anchors emerge by ~150 words (port city, container yard, post-silence). One meaningful tightening occurs when the data spiral tightens to Dock Twelve and the cylindrical stack reveals the hidden plane. Cost is legible in the cut fingers and frantic action. Eligible for 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear causal–accumulative hybrid lens: Maera's chisel strikes deepen the hush and release cracks, creating a problem Lio must solve by playing the amber sheet in synesthetic translation. The closure—unfettering the sculpted hush into a choir of color, then using the darkened sheet as testimony before the Council—lands on the page with conceptual cost (the decree feels "fragile, like ice over deep water") and a resonant final stance as bell ringer keeping "both lullaby and warning." Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first sentence. The lens holds through the ending, though the Council scene compresses heavily and the "fragile" cost, while present, reads more stated than dramatically embodied in a concrete forfeiture or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (who, where, when). The Causal lens holds: Liora's choice to play the flute opens the corridor, the encounter teaches her what she guarded wrongly, and her second playing brings her back with new understanding. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): "the avalanchingly quiet hush felt like an answer she could finally carry" reweights her relationship to silence and guardianship, with the conceptual cost of accepting she feared herself. One meaningful tightening (threshold crossing) narrows options and the cost is legible in the acknowledgment of deafness.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear pattern-teaching: eachprint job deepens Kestrel's understanding of the transposed-empathy mechanism until the final blank broadside resolves her fragmentation. The closure lands on-page with visible cost (pouring out borrowed selves, returning to center) and the equation framework holds throughout. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (who, where, cosmic instability). One friction: the Council auditors subplot introduces a secondary pressure that diffuses focus slightly before the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (accumulative texture building to a conceptual repricing at closure). Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening: Rook, ridgeway, aurora, dawn. The closure lands on-page when Rook writes the question on the cairn and understands "the delivery was never about ownership but about planting"—a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (he releases the transactional model and Nera's direct presence). The vision of Nera decades prior and her words "Let them find wonder themselves" reweight the entire courier premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara refuses to accept the pendant and asks the ridge to keep it, narrowing Rook's options and forcing the shift from delivery-as-transaction to delivery-as-seed.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator stops hating the sedan and "finally let[s] her go," a stance crystallization earned by the communion revealing the car's absorbed sorrow. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through sensory anchors (frost, prism, mirror flare) and pattern breaks (shifted hush, voice weight) until the final image reweights the dominant stake with felt cost (accepting sealed grief, carrying the prism home). Orientation is established by ~80 words (quartz arbor, salvage yard, sister's sedan). One tightening: moving from wanting answers to hearing the "weight" of her sister's voice and releasing hate.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern of silence accreting, then released through the weaving act). Orientation anchors appear by line three (Yara, hut, orchard). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Yara pays her voice and teaches Jun the loom, forecloses further speech, cost legible on the page. One meaningful deepening: the puzzle edges unlock direction, then the finished panel travels. Deduction: the mechanism by which the woven panel physically appears on Jun's cot and compels his return remains under-motivated; the cost (voice) is clear, but the causal chain from weave-to-arrival elides key steps.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) at closure. Lio's refusal to keep the silk and his burial of it in the mine foreclose further bartered awakenings with visible cost (thinned memories, empty eyes). Orientation anchors early (Pomaria, Crate Hollow, Lio's role), and the descent/repair/return sequence accumulates pressure through repeated trades. One causality seam: the magician's return feels coincidental rather than earned by prior setup, arriving to collect "what he was owed" without prior contract language that would make the timing motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (abandoned repair bay, sensory mapper, green shard, brother's disappearance). The causal chain—shard creates seam, seam enables weaving, weaving reaches Jalen, narrator corrects the lie—holds under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening when the beacon reveals Jalen's location. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: the withheld truth is shared via the log entry, and the narrator feels both relief and the weight settling. The "older, alive, and furious" reveal of Jalen risks convenience (how did he survive, why bound by the bay itself?) but the correction of the record provides a Decisive Change that reweights the lie's consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (dark lighthouse, letter chain, stone cairns) and a cadence shift at the ending when the lamp returns and "did not blaze; it sighed." Closure reads as Charged Poise—the anonymous chain holds, the beam resumes, and Noah feels "a bottled safety warming in the dark" with visible cost (bleeding fingers, unspoken effort). Orientation anchors early (Noah, Brinecap Light, last run of October, lamp out). One minor seam: the phrase "after the lamp flickers out" in the inciting-incident sentence then "entered the lantern room after the lamp flickers out" mid-story reads as tense inconsistency, though it does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening clause. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: escalation unfolds via density increase (prophecy → storm → shadow-casting) and cadence shift at closure. A clear Decisive Change occurs on-page when the narrator shifts from accidental prophecy to deliberate signal-making ("tried to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows"), with visible cost (throat raw, routine unbroken, promise to choose words carefully). Minor wobble: the closing return to laughter slightly undercuts the mayor's warning without re-establishing cost, creating a micro-ambiguity in the closure's finality.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early (valley, floating tea house, two months post-transplant) and maintains a coherent Accumulative lens: density increases through sun-trail dots, each revealing a fragment of Sairi's practice, culminating in the dye jar and morpho-wing spark that reweights Maru's understanding. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the vow to practice rather than hoard) with felt cost (renunciation of loudness, acceptance of caution). Minor causality slip: the morpho wing's "cold flash, like a warning" at midpoint is setup without clear payoff when the wing later sparks joyfully.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors—maintenance worker, tower labyrinth, storm night—arrive early. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: grief flakes, dream envelopes, and moonlit repairs accrue meaning until the sapling and sextant converge in a charged image. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the labyrinth is remade to "lead outward instead of in," reweighting the quantified-sorrow premise—but the cost (municipal violation, personal exposure, the risk of discovered dreams) is felt rather than shown. The causal chain from pin-drop to sapling to roof-route to deconstruction holds under ellipsis; the moonlight-repair mechanism and dream-mapping feel more symbolic than procedurally grounded, which strains traceability at the climactic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a clear Conceptual Repricing at closure—the woven dawn transforms from private craft to communal infrastructure, reweighting the premise with visible social cost (Lysa leaves borrowed yesterdays as promises to return). One meaningful deepening occurs when the night "fights back" and Lysa feels "bound release," tightening pressure before the mica-window breakthrough. Cost is legible in the final image: she remains scattered but chooses her losses with open eyes. Minor causality slip: the infants' arrival and the specific mechanism by which wrapping them returns Lysa's memories are under-motivated, reading slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens: Marin's empathetic observation of Lysa's error, their joint discovery of the cipher test, and the Archivist's acceptance create a coherent pressure arc. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marin writes "every mistake is a map, if you read with mercy," reweighting his solitude with visible cost—he remains alone but steadied, having offered sanctuary without curing his own isolation. The orientation is clear by the second paragraph, and the invitation's flawed address becomes a nested paradox that pays off when the Archivist sees the torn halves reunited. One meaningful deepening occurs when fear and care are shown as "both impulses belonged to the same loyal hand."

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Mina, post-bird-migration city, walking to work). The story accumulates pressure through small erasures (bakery bricked over, missing statue, patrols with new badges) and tightens when Mina plants wheat in the fountain—a reversal from passive witness to active participant. Closure reads as Charged Poise: the sprout through mortar reweights the premise (individual acts of memory resist state erasure) with conceptual and social cost legible on the page. One micro turn (tea house invitation) feeds the final beat without fragmenting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (frozen library, courier arrival, Lumen Room). Closure lands as Charged Poise—Ilian's final vow crystallizes his stance with undeniable conceptual cost (the ledger becomes "a mirror in which he could not look away"). One meaningful deepening occurs when his witnessing transforms into a vow of his own, reweighting the dominant stake. The cost is felt in the shift from duty to existential commitment, though the closing image leans abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (pirate market, Mara, her goal). The closure—Mara triggering chaos, planting the fob, and securing her father's safety—lands on the page with visible cost (blood on the boards, staying hidden until sunrise). The three failed attempts create escalation, but the final reversal (knocking over tin cups to expose Lorne) feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality; the quartermaster's loyalty is asserted, not dramatized. Cost is legible but the convenience dent prevents higher reach.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening third (luminous skeptic, Lavender Bluff, election night). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as the protagonist moves from city to bluff to circle, and the convergence ritual reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist joins the circle, the ring settles, and forest tallies begin—options crystallize with felt pressure. Cost is implied (joining commits her to the carriers' vote) but not fully dramatized on the page; the "finally sure" moment charges the ending without showing what she forfeits.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the crystal cave, pigments, and mother's artifacts layer toward a final mural that reweights Mara's calling. Orientation anchors (fairground → tunnel → cave → studio) arrive promptly and the closure image—painting on crystal, stage waking, soft laugh—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options crystallize. Cost is partially legible (she steps into a vocation that "would have swallowed her whole") but the final beat prioritizes wonder over felt tradeoff, leaving the price more conceptual than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors early (Mara, calligrapher, greenhouse city, post-oasis failure). The causal lens holds: map discovery → climb → hatch opens with zinc seal → conduit reveals Lio's bundle → honest note unlocks cistern location. Closure is a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara leaves with the vellum and a "clean question," reweighting the relationship from accusation to candor, with the cost of uncertainty felt in "practiced the question in her mouth" and "the city felt answerable" (not answered). One tightening—moving from scattered loss to actionable map to candor-gated water—narrows options with visible cost (she must face Lio without certainty of reconciliation).

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when adequately and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Lysa builds, the Auditor challenges, the sculpture's light transforms the crowd's perception. However, the closure relies on summary ("the gathered crowd learned to listen again") rather than a concrete on-page change with visible cost. The fragment's consumption over time and the basin-tuning are told in retrospective summary, flattening what could have been a charged final image. The Auditor's palm-burning offers a micro-turn but his subsequent passivity ("let go and watched") deflates rather than crystallizes the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation anchors immediately: android caretaker, glass dome, desert rose farm, magnetic north shift. Drive lens is Causal with lyric compression—static triggers search for calm, box memory prompts miniaturization, bead enables controlled burn, fire triggers vent protocol, resolution plants cutting over cooled bead. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid): N-3 buries the bead, plants a cutting, records the instruction, and walks on with "fewer ghosts…more sand-scented silence." Cost is legible—he risks the roses to save them, transforms stored fears into a survival tool, and accepts fragmented wholeness rather than deletion. One meaningful tightening (jammed hatch forces burn decision) suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a mystery-investigation frame and delivers a mailbox-opening climax, but the closure effect is primarily revelatory rather than transformative: neighbors read letters aloud and feel lighter. The developer's truck idling at the gate gestures toward external stakes but never materializes as concrete pressure that Mara's choices must address. Cost is diffuse—communal catharsis—rather than a legible price paid by the protagonist. Orientation is clear; the causal lens holds through the search; the ending shifts tone but not options.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered codes (journal entries, dice, dance) and the spider-web motif that recurs and charges the final image. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with visible cost): Lyra leaves the journal, trusting the guardian will read only verse while the freed carry the real meaning—a renunciation that forecloses direct confrontation and encrypts her method. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines; one meaningful deepening occurs when the guardian tightens surveillance and Lyra reroutes alarms. Cost is legible but oblique: she abandons the lab again, this time entrusting her cipher to others, which satisfies the lens but does not deliver a sharp physical price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece establishes a causal chain: whale → parasite → memory deletion → pocket gravity → saltworks archive → release ritual → closure. Orientation anchors promptly (Lysa, harbor, post-whale). The ending delivers a Decisive Change—memories returned, parasite pacified, father recognizes Lysa—with visible cost (the town must now carry "lived-in sorrow"). The lens reads Causal with light Accumulative texture (coffee grounds, wildflowers). One friction: the council's collection motive and the parasite's appetite are told rather than dramatized, slightly weakening the middle causality.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (who, where, why by ~100 words). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Liora maps silence, the prophecy rises as ripples, she chooses filtration over erasure, and the final image (blank petals, resolved to speak plainly) reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—she walks away with private knowledge, forecloses the weapon hunt, accepts the burden—though the cost is more implied than felt in a specific moment. The because/therefore linkage is looser than full causal; the turn hinges on her insight rather than external pressure forcing her hand.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on-page: the building is saved through the narrator's cunning, Ilyas fades into mortar "like a word finally understood," delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the ghost's dissolution and the narrator's acceptance of deception. The causal lens holds: grandmother's seal → ledger knowledge → clay impression → stone sentences → hidden documents → inspector sleight → preservation order. One meaningful tightening occurs when the maintenance room opens and the documents are found, narrowing options and raising stakes for the walk-through. The "agreed upon lies" frame coheres throughout and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira seals the archive, learns the access protocol, and commits to building devices for quarantine returnees, foreclosing grief-hoarding with visible cost (the shell's silence, the sealed jar). Orientation is swift (garden, Conservatory, evening appointment). The causal lens holds: shell → resonance structure → decoded message → sealing choice → workshop plan. One meaningful tightening when Sol explains the unregistered memory forces the archiving decision, narrowing Mira's options and crystallizing her independence stance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with lyric texture. Anchors (who/where/when) land by the opening lines; the sanctuary, Senn, and Liora's purpose are clear. The reversal—basin seam reveals her father's papers and Senn's complicity—narrows options causally: Liora can sign Senn's confession or rewrite the ending herself. Closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she writes in meltwater, hands Senn the thorn, and walks out with the papers, crystallizing a stance with visible cost (coming judgment). Cost is undeniable. One meaningful tightening fits the length. Causal linkage holds, though the sanctuary door opening "on its own" flirts with convenience; it reads metaphorically under the lyric register but introduces a micro-ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Lira, canyon echo singer, Hollow Canyons). The plot follows a quest structure with clear beats: shell → messenger → journey → nexus → confrontation → restoration. However, causality is thin: Mael's capitulation after one song feels unmotivated, and Senn's physical return is not dramatized—he simply appears in the final sentence. The closure unit (joining the shell halves, revealing the theft mechanism) lands conceptually but the felt cost is abstract; no on-page sacrifice or tactical trade-off makes the victory precarious or charges the final image with loss.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Mara returns the globe to the shrine, reweighting it from evidence into a gentler "window of connection," and the child's gratitude arrives as imagined snow—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (she relinquishes proof to restore memory). Drive lens is Causal: Mara tracks Fen through dream-cameos → uses the globe and ice lens → catches his pattern → confronts him with proof. One meaningful tightening (aligning the globe through the lens to see Fen's method) narrows options and enables the exposure. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (shrine, Mara, satchel, wreck below fjord). The piece exceeds two-shard scope but teaches its mosaic structure early (shrine → wreck memory → dream-tracking → confrontation → return) with legible transitions and a single dominant stake (expose Fen, salvage purity), satisfying Track B tests without penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Ren's promise and ritual honor hidden effort with visible cost—he bows "anyway" when fishermen ignore Jiro, enacting the philosophy. The piece operates under Accumulative lens: pattern (moon paths, nets, whistling, whisk) deepens through two nights and reweights at closure. Causal linkage is clean: night one teaches repair philosophy, night two applies it to catch the smuggler. One meaningful tightening occurs when the market-net sabotage forces application of the lesson. Cost is legible in Ren's shift from scorn to discipleship and the quiet, unrewarded labor.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Causal with textural accent (investigative accumulation → revelatory turn → distributive gambit). The closure lands on-page with a clear tactical shift—mailing ledger copies to rival bureaus—that reconfigures options and accepts imminent cost (agents arriving). Causality holds: shredded letters → coordinates → orchard discovery → ledger → public dissemination. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes the diamond is a detector, narrowing the mystery and raising stakes. The orientation is slightly delayed (dusty city established, but "after the liquidation" context front-loads abstraction before grounding who/where/when), though the effect does not obscure closure. Cost is legible: evidence seized, protagonist now exposed.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (antennas, puppets, storm, broadcasts) toward a closure that reweights the premise—two isolated visionaries create shared communion through scrap-tech ritual. The final image (blank book, blueprint, "signal to answer") delivers Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (ongoing separation). One issue: the causal chain from "stealing words" to collaborative projection feels compressed; the reversal (conflict to alliance) happens rapidly without intermediate resistance, slightly weakening escalation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly: vagrant poet, feral loft, dawn, dunes. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the ritual of capturing sounds, freeing the melody, and sharing it with the village. The closure—sounds translate grief into shared music, elders answer without shame—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (community reconnection) with felt cost (Sato's role shifts from performer to translator, coins now carry names). One escalation point: the music box clicks whole, and Sato carries it to the widow, which tightens the dominant stake. Minor causality slip: the box "inhaled" and the spring loosened by feeding it sounds reads more metaphorical than mechanical, but the lens tolerates this as textural accumulation rather than strict cause-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with light Situational shading (the thieves arrive, Lio uses sound to defuse them). Orientation is clear early. The closure—Lio hands the key to the trader, the thieves leave "empty-handed" but "carrying only a new quiet inside"—aims for Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is unclear: Lio retains the key ("key tucked safe"), so no actual forfeiture occurs, and the thieves' transformation feels imposed by the fork's magic rather than earned through on-page pressure. The "sonic absolution" resolves the conflict conveniently rather than through protagonist struggle, weakening causality at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a causal backbone. The piece escalates through density increase—nightly charting, moon-path observation, teaching silent labor—that reweights the dominant stake (freeing the lowlands without battle). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the viaduct remains intact but rendered "useless...by a simple absence of obedience," and Irena returns to the sanctuary "patient at last," reweighting her internal vow with felt cost (the long discipline, the restrained wildness held back). Orientation anchors by ~100 words (Irena, basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, dawn climbs). One meaningful tightening occurs when she resists sabotage and instead charts shadows, narrowing tactics toward the third full moon window. The cost is legible: patience as endurance, the rebels' hunger restrained, the empire's control undermined not destroyed.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands on the page as Decisive Change—Mara breaks free by uploading evidence and returns to finish the report with a promise that the next death will not reverberate into silence—with visible cost (Kellan's retaliation implied, career at risk). Drive lens is Causal: the cut brake line discovery → entangled memories showing Kellan's pattern → decision to send evidence outside the authority → return with altered stance. Orientation anchors early (tunnel, investigator, seventh death). One meaningful tightening when the lantern's memories reveal Kellan's contraband route, narrowing Mara's options to compliance or external whistleblowing. Cost is legible in the risk she accepts and the fear that "no longer owned her."

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story moves through a clear causal chain: Elias's doubt → consultation with Lena → proposal of repair work → Mrs. Halden's witness → Elias's realization. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias understands that "second opinions were not excuses but openings" with the cost felt in his walk back to the jail under clearing skies. The week-long ellipsis is legible and motivated. Minor orientation ambiguity in the opening (the tin box's origin is delayed slightly) resolves quickly enough to avoid penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (workshop on acid sea, Mara tuning cart-glider). The piece teaches a hybrid accumulative-causal lens: the algorithm accrues meaning through discovery beats (loupe, kaleidoscope, transliteration) and causally enables the final flight, which lands a Conceptual Repricing—the towers glimmer "as if some unborn species had shifted in its sleep," reweighting the yearning algorithm from present tool to evolutionary seed with undeniable conceptual cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara sets the arrow tip into the glider's nose and launches; the return to the workshop after ringing the silent bell forecloses the path of ignorance with felt stakes. Cost is legible: she "toss[es] a pebble into time" with no audible result, yet the towers respond, making the evolutionary wager concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story teaches an accumulative/retrospective lens early—Mara recounts months of investigation through compressed summary—but the closure unit struggles to land with on-page cost. The final beat (walking into Legal with the patch, lying while seeding a message to families) is presented as fait accompli rather than a choice dramatized under pressure; we do not witness her weighing the risk of retaliation, the uncertainty of whether the buoy exists, or the moral calculus of lying to Legal. The recurring numbers (11-27-73) function as breadcrumbs across beats, creating pattern, but the revelation that they point to a buoy and living voices arrives late and is summarized rather than discovered on the page. The piece signals a Decisive Change (Mara moves from passive listening to active whistleblowing) but the cost—career destruction, potential legal jeopardy, the gamble that the families will find the buoy—is declared rather than felt in the final image. Orientation is clean; causality holds within the retrospective frame; the lens is coherent but the closure moment lacks the visceral weight required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by ~60 words (Mara, lighthouse orchard, tonight) and holds a Situational lens: pressure accumulates as she witnesses two opposing demands, then crystallizes their shared courage into a workable channel. The closure—showing both men safe passage and shared duties, apples picked for all—reads as Charged Poise: options are reconfigured and the cost (mutual vulnerability, ongoing interdependence) is felt even if not yet paid. One micro turn (shard brightens, anomaly recognized) deepens the stake without fragmenting causality.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator stops chasing endings, taught by Signe's counsel and the storm sequence, with visible cost (foreclosing the tourist pursuit). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through storm, parasol tip, ice-sound motif—and holds through the final image where "endings approach like weather" reweights the opening stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by ~150 words and remain stable. One meaningful deepening (storm rescue crystallizes the learning) is sufficient at this length; the cost is legible in the parting instruction and narrator's acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through the burned-letter motif, mirrored confessions, and the pavilion as crucible, culminating in Mara's decision to keep the pages intact—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) that reweights burning as erasure rather than release. Orientation anchors quickly (platform, vineyard, pavilion) and the single-scene window holds spatial coherence. Cost is legible (Mara abandons her impulse to erase, the sentinel feels "less mismatched"), though the ending's reflective summary ("feeling less mismatched") dilutes immediacy and leans toward told insight rather than charged image, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Iri's honesty "had chosen the right kind of secrecy," crystallizing her role as preserver without owner—a stance that forecloses easier paths (reporting the prophet, refusing him access) with felt cost (ongoing risk, complicity). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the parapet's noon twitch, the prophet's arrival stress, then the dawn ritual deepens via confessed doubts as "stone set true," widening the clearing and settling the parapet "into a steadier sleep." One meaningful tightening (the bargain and shared rite) reweights the dominant stake. Cost is legible in "her honesty had chosen" and the "whisperfield calm" return with new weight.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors promptly (Mara, Briarwick, lavender field behind factory ruins, "by the time vines began climbing"). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through community participation, the acetate fence accrues arcs, and the final walk-through collage reconfigures collective identity from fragmented grief to "our hurt." The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the masterpiece "finished only because everyone had made it") with conceptual cost legible in the collective labor and Mr. Gant's final ladder climb. Cost proof: the sentence "her masterpiece finished only because everyone had made it" delivers conceptual cost by reweighting Mara's initial solo ambition into communal authorship. One tightening occurs when the storm forces neighbors to hold sheets steady, shifting from passive reception to active guardianship, and the constraint of the anniversary date and storm narrows the emotional frame.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the suspended hush shifts from curse to cradle, and the crystal's echo becomes a teaching tool. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—three "sequence" shards build density toward a cadence shift at the testimony table. The cost is conceptual and social (the Council wanted blame; the narrator offers a map and plea), legible in the final image. However, the sequences feel more like reported discovery than lived pressure, and the transition from scholar-observer to active witness lacks a single on-page moment where refusal was possible and foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The fog garden, videotapes, driftwood markers, and capsule archive build density toward the final image of Mira adding her mother's name and copying recordings onto sleeping tapes—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where longing crystallizes into preservation with felt cost (the intimacy of aging amplified, the act of listening rather than letting hush win). Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (Mira, low tide, fog sculpture garden, field recorder, chalk). The closure reweights the premise of "clinging to echoes" through the layered archive voices, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—Mira's specific forfeiture is understated. One meaningful deepening occurs when Orrin whispers her own rasp, tightening the personal stake.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal. The runaway clock hand creates a clear obstacle, Mara's leaf-tick governor restores stable tracking, and the launch command completes a because/therefore chain with visible stakes. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change—the camera pod climbs, the quake subsides, and Mara's listening to leaf ticks and telemetry reweights the opening promise to "harness the ephemeral." Cost is legible in the phrase "let loss escape," implying both technical success and unresolved grief. Orientation is anchored early (Lunar Observatory, Mara, tonight, tremor), and the causal chain holds without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly: hospice ward, Mara, blood work, Elias dying. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—hymning the mundane accrues pressure through repetition and the broken-record motif until the taped-together vinyl charges the ending. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias exhales in time with the warped hymn, and Mara keeps singing; the cost is Elias's death and Jonah's six-year wait, both legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when Jonah admits he kept the larger half, reweighting the shard from relic to mutual artifact. Minor slip: the timeline between blood work results, Mara's call, and Jonah's arrival feels compressed without a clear timeframe anchor, slightly blurring escalation tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure unit—Liora dipping her finger into the reservoir and relearning the last rune to send shadows home—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (self-binding to the reservoir). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern build toward the final reweighting. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first third. One meaningful tightening occurs when the automaton opens the sealed door and reveals the reservoir. Minor deduction: the spoon-bending premise remains ornamental scaffolding rather than a constraint that shapes tactics; cost at closure is conceptual but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on-page as Rowan steps through the hedge door, a Decisive Change driven by accumulated evidence (tooth, star map, bone-setting marks, the girl's jaw) that transforms his skepticism into active pursuit. The Causal lens holds: each discovery narrows his certainty until crossing the threshold becomes inevitable. Orientation anchors quickly (bone setter, morgue, garden, riverbank). One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes "someone else with his lessons" did the work, collapsing coincidence into pattern. Cost is visible: he abandons his skeptic's position and enters literal darkness on a changeling's promise.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean by the opening lines; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (memory resurfaces → polishing → installation → teaching). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Lio's vow shifts from punishment to purpose with visible cost (he can finally look at neighbors without flinching, foreclosing his isolating guilt). The final teaching beat extends the closure effect with conceptual cost—communal vulnerability replaces individual penance. One meaningful tightening occurs when he breathes apology into the sphere, narrowing his internal options and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Jun's nod and the narrator's grateful recognition that "confession could be compost" reweight prior shame with a forward stance; the cost is visible in the surrender of the pendant and the qualified "not forgiving me yet." Orientation anchors who/where/viral aftermath by the second paragraph. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: moss-garden imagery, drip-pattern encryption, and the honeyed-hush motif build pressure through density and cadence shift rather than because/therefore links. One meaningful tightening occurs when Jun arrives and the archive plan becomes a shared risk.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (mist-nexus layering, gathering shapes, ink-river pressure, recurrence of shell and whisper). Orientation anchors (Mara at desk, manuscript, shell fragment) land by line 3; the transition into the nexus is signaled ("stepped between two sentences") and the spatial logic (shredded chapters underfoot, ink river, bank of metaphors, wet book at source) remains coherent. Closure: Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid)—Mara opens the wet book "against its will," writes the stepping-stone ending that refuses the easy bridge, and the reversal of the ink river carries the hopes back with visible cost: she chooses "quiet, multiple shapes of hope" over applause, and the shell "becomes only a fragment again" but is kept as a reminder. Cost is legible in the final image (no applause, the contracted ending replaced). One meaningful deepening: the upstream wade against the current, the gathering of shapes, and the vow at the book all tighten options and charge the final scene. Deduction: the accumulative beats (cameos, shapes, climbing the bank) are rich but occasionally blur causality—why does the vow at the top make the cameos return as witnesses, and how does writing the scene reverse the river? The linkage is poetic but not entirely motivated within the established rules of the nexus.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marn builds a device, the keepers add breath and memory, the arbor responds. Closure arrives when the youngest keeper receives the crank and the rite is "restored," but the cost remains abstract—Marn walks away "lighter," yet no specific forfeiture or trade-off is dramatized on the page. The Orientation Test is met (who/where/when by the opening), and the pattern coheres, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the resolution feels declared rather than earned through visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through ritual arrangement, flash-paper ignition, sealing, and the aurora's response. Orientation anchors (subarctic crater, withered orchard, post-meteor world) arrive early. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—when the copied intervals cause the aurora to loosen, crystallizing the map's purpose without a decisive physical change. Cost is conceptual (starlight passed on "without breaking the seal"), visible in the final image but not viscerally felt as a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Ivo studies, measures, marks, and builds across days until the device ticks and the echoes align—a density increase that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 3. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he completes the work, the cavern exhales, and he carries wonder stored for later need. The cost is conceptual—wonder captured and deferred—but the final image makes it legible without a sharp emotional price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on the page: the weaver moves from trapped passivity to self-aware orientation practice, with visible cost (calcified thread, acceptance of the recurring task). The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through shingled hush, drowned constellations, whalebone lattice, then shifts cadence at the final turn toward starlight alignment. One meaningful tightening (grotto trap → orientation → release) is sufficient for this length. The orientation test is satisfied by line 4 (grotto entrance, lamp lit, stone scales visible).

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Miriam, loft, post-Jory death) arrive by ~60 words. The piece accumulates via three carved lessons, each deepening her stance, and closes with Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): she lifts the panel into light, tastes "bitterness and sweetness together," and settles the lesson "what is here will go, so build hands that open"—a crystallization of grief as work with visible cost (the seven months, the empty cage, the deliberate containment). The cadence shift from rain-stitched opening to ember-glow ending reweights the dominant stake. Cost is legible in the final image: she lets the lesson settle rather than claiming resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara collects fragments, the lagoon rearranges them, the ghost rises, payment is exchanged, the bolt is fixed, and the carousel settles—a meaningful deepening and tightening. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara renounces the desire to rewrite the night and commits to small repairs, with visible cost (loss of her developed images and ambition). Orientation is legible by ~120 words (Mara on the stalled platform, kinetic lagoon, post-carousel-halt). The lens holds, and the cost is felt. However, the causality linking the ghost negotiation to the bolt repair feels slightly elided—Mara fixes the bolt "without spectacle" but we don't see her struggle with the tool or the decision in real time, which mutes the closure's immediacy and caps the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Lina, abandoned terminal, post-carnival survey). The causal chain from discovery → water system restoration → beacon activation is coherent with motivated ellipsis in the technical work. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the beacon as Charged Poise: the terminal's silent decades resolve into active signal, options reconfigured from demolition to preservation, cost legible in Lina's professional defiance and the terminal's patient wait now ended. One tightening (discovery of architect's letters) reweights the maze from bureaucratic to personal.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist accepts he will never hang bells again but finds music in honest longing, with the cost legible on the page—"I could bear the longing honestly, and that honesty was music." The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the density builds from glacial silence → quartz murmur → bear communion → score-writing, with a clear cadence shift at the ending that reweights the stake. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist moves from copying clocks to marking pulses as measures, narrowing his tactics and forecloses the dream of literal bells.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Mara discovers the taped order → realizes the silence was engineered → broadcasts the evidence → the community begins to reconsider its faith. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the canal "began…to talk in its own voice") with conceptual cost visible in the community's slow turning and Mara's knowledge that she has "salvaged choice." One tightening (the tape discovery narrows her options from investigation to action) is sufficient for this length; the inferred lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Lio decodes the knot pattern, follows the three instructions, meets the weaver, learns of the council threat, demonstrates the code's value, and secures the clerk's agreement. Orientation anchors (Lio, golden dock, foggy morning) arrive early. The closure—placing the seed in the dock crack with a knot above it—offers a Conceptual Repricing that binds preservation to living cycles rather than secrecy, with felt cost (the weavers stepping into openness, abandoning their shield). One meaningful tightening occurs when the clerk recognizes his family name, narrowing the threat to the old methods and enabling the compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (traveler, palace garden, queen) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the garden description, the thread as relic, and the projection method layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when the queen "leaned into me as if my ribs were a railing." The closure reweights the narrator's search for "the geography of healing" through the red thread as "payment and a compass," offering Charged Poise with felt cost (intimacy, shared breath). One meaningful deepening occurs when the projection lets the queen feel the boy's humming, narrowing her grief from wound to map. Cost is legible but somewhat diffuse across the final two paragraphs rather than crystallized in a single image.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers artifacts and sensory density toward a climactic release of pigments that reweights the mechanical world. Causality is clean—Lorian retrieves the egg, assembles the nest, triggers the release—and the final image (colors staining brass, palace creaking) reconfigures the status quo. Cost is legible but oblique: the nun's confession frames bitterness, and the unguarded Cradle invites future mistakes, yet the felt price to Lorian himself remains conceptual rather than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear early (coast, boardwalk, firefighter protagonist), and the piece moves from dispatch call through rescue to hospital to lagoon in a causal chain. The closure—leaving the coin as a message of compassion—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no live option is visibly foreclosed. The copycat coin discovery is a micro-turn that reframes the protagonist's fear, yet the final act feels more symbolic gesture than decisive choice with stakes. The ellipsis from shack fire to "later at the burn unit" compresses key aftermath (e.g., how the sister was extracted, transport logistics) in ways that flatten escalation. Closure participates under an Accumulative/Situational lens but lacks the sharp tightening or visible price the 7+ band typically requires.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (breadcrumb trail → underground hall → constellation match → box opening), and the ending image (Mara carrying freed light back to the city) delivers Charged Poise with conceptual cost: the city will remember and ache. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (city, Mara, Archivists' commission), and the sidereal-patience motif recurs purposefully. However, the latch mechanism feels more like a puzzle solution than a tightening driven by protagonist agency; the final "listening to the room" beat leans on atmospheric patience rather than a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost: Lior chooses the "slower transit" to the outskirts, forgoing immediate return and accepting generational timescale for change, visible in "the Garden watched their first wheel glow, troubling in its gentleness." Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—violet dust, falling petals, gear grooves, and radiance accumulate meaning through the transit, then the final image (children's shared wheel) reweights the premise with quiet authority. Orientation anchors early (Nebula Garden, exile context, calculating gear). One substantive deepening when the automaton warns of unintended consequences raises the conceptual price legibly.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Jonas gathers observations, ties ribbons, and layers poem fragments toward a communal memorial. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph. The closure—placing the finished stone at dawn as the spirit releases—reconfigures private mourning into shared form with visible cost (the spirit "let go," Jonas's question answered). One meaningful deepening occurs when the spirit teaches him to read clusters and braid losses. The cost is felt but somewhat diffuse; pointing to "the spirit let go" as the exact cost moment keeps this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the first ~100 words (Mara, clock tower, low tide, recent wreck). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered objects (bob, rake handle, lead sliver, tide marker) and the closure—showing the widow the engineered imbalance—reconfigures meaning through conceptual repricing with social cost (the nod, not forgiveness). Causality is motivated throughout: the pendulum's drift was engineered, Torren left instructions, removing the lead restores truth. One minor gap: the exact mechanism by which the lead sliver "pulled time ahead of the moon" is asserted rather than demonstrated, but the image of Mara cutting the notch and the wave meeting it "neither early nor late" lands the closure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page with visible cost: the ledger is unearthed, the case returned, and the ash planted, reweighting Tomas's secrecy as sheltering rather than betrayal. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (threaded tapestry, layered rumor, counted colors) and holds it through the final velvet image. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (cemetery, silo, chess table). One friction: the chess-clock frame promised by the title and opening recedes after setup; the clock's mechanics never constrain a present choice, only backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal/Accumulative hybrid: Jora's method (measuring, modeling, drafting conditional sentences) advances through because/therefore linkage, and the closure arrives when her charter leads to spring implementation and systemic transformation. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the first two paragraphs. Closure form is Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: the villages transform iteratively, and the final image reweights her childhood vow into a working method. Cost is visible (confrontation with the Warden, the constraint of one page, risk of leading others astray) but felt cost at the climactic writing moment is muted—she simply dips the nib and writes. The causal chain from ignorance maps → model → conditional charter → spring results holds without breaks, and the single-page constraint meaningfully tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an accumulative/textural lens: Mara collects lyrics, stitches them into scores, and orchestrates a public reveal. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (copyist, archive loft, post-famine city). The closure—the concert where dust whispers back and Censors are stopped by their own steps—reads as Charged Poise; the audience hears meaning and the mist "holds stories like seeds," but the immediate consequence (arrest? next broadcast?) remains off-page, leaving cost more conceptual than dramatized. One meaningful tightening occurs (the concert decision), yet the causal chain relies on convenient alignment: the shortwave dial glow unlocks the covers exactly when needed, and the Censors' boots shimmer on cue without prior setup of that mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a situational lens: Lira performs her portrait ritual under the pressure of inspectors arriving. Orientation is delayed—the curfew, her trade, and the gallery's purpose emerge gradually across the first third without clear spatial grounding until the back room. The closure offers a micro-turn (inspectors leave, she begins the next portrait) but lacks a decisive change or visible cost to Lira herself; the emotional crystallization happens *to the inspector*, not through her agency. The ending reads as repetition (she will continue) rather than reconfiguration, and no felt price is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure lands on-page with visible cost: Orin builds the teaching rig after Mara's refusal, forecloses institutional validation, and commits to an underground transmission with no promise of reach—cost is legible in "walked back to his sewer home" and the crude pipe-fitting apparatus. The causal lens holds: bartering notes → auger → digging → cog → archivist → rejection → DIY pedagogy, each step motivated by prior stakes. One structural wobble: the climactic confrontation with Mara is summarized ("laid out competing narratives in plain terms") rather than dramatized in dialogue, slightly muting the peak beat's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (Mara in velvet library, autumn, pre-vote fundraiser) and accumulates pressure through rehearsal beats that subtract noise, building to a closure where sustained silence becomes verdict. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the choir's earned quiet sits as implicit argument, and the councilman's response signals a shift. Cost is legible—Mara risks the fundraiser's failure by refusing to plead—but the councilman's capitulation arrives too easily, reducing the felt price and undercutting the earned nature of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the seed's growth cycle and the alignment deadline, culminating in the fruit's distribution and the tree's final pruning. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final line—"certain that beauty was the safest form of defiance"—reweights the gentle rebellion premise with undeniable pressure, and the open canopy image charges the ending. Orientation anchors cleanly (greenhouse, Mira, seed) by the first third. Cost is conceptual and felt (pruning away Ministry propaganda, risking neighbors) but the final pruning's specific price—what Mira forecloses—is asserted rather than made concrete on the page, reducing the closure's bite by −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture (riddle → tower → truth-speaking → box opens → drones revive). Closure is a Decisive Change: the queen core revives, routes are published, drones lift. The cost is legible—Sela's fault goes public, Maro abandons his comfort lies—and the because/therefore chain holds. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maro realizes "the riddle said open what cannot lie" and stakes crystallize. Orientation is clean by the booth opening. No causality breaks touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (orris shard, displaced objects, houses awakening) and culminates in a pattern-break when neighbors gather and restore keepsakes, reweighting the dominant stake (understanding house aliveness) with visible cost (Mara releases the shard, "softening even the arguments that would come later"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara tests her theory by moving the clock and the house drains; closure lands on-page when she sanctifies the shard at the tide line and writes her new rule. Cost is legible: she surrenders the compass-object and accepts future friction ("arguments that would come later").

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal/Accumulative hybrid with causal dominance at closure. Orientation anchors are delayed but present by ~180 words (underwater city garden, after revealing the secret). Escalation proceeds through four nested revelations, each narrowing Ilyan's stance and reweighting his testimony; the final directive—"Tell them the whole seam"—operates as Charged Poise, crystallizing options and imposing conceptual cost (his prior disclosure now incomplete, harm risked). The closure is on-page with felt intellectual cost, and the lens holds. One meaningful tightening through the revelation cascade is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who (climber with notebook), where (infinite staircase), and what (capturing a missed opportunity) by the first two paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered reflections, the perpetual motion device, and the dice, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when the protagonist refuses further expectation and the machine stalls. Cost is legible: "the opportunity was not waiting above or below, but already lost in the act of climbing." One minor causality question: the machine's dependence on the protagonist's expectation is asserted rather than fully dramatized, but the closure image—sitting until "the texture of the missed opportunity softened"—lands with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative lens: moonlight sparks daydreams, script accrues on glass, strangers return with offerings, and the final word "rouse" reweights the premise with felt cost (Mira surrendering to sleep after sustained vigil). Orientation anchors promptly (rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, waxing moon cycle). One tightening occurs when Ro's memory unseals and he agrees to collaborate, narrowing Mira's solitary method into shared proof. The closure lands as Charged Poise—sleep as trust, the last word inscribed—but the cost is more asserted ("finally felt sleep approach") than shown through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (accumulative texture building toward a situational crystallization) and delivers closure through Charged Poise: the guards hesitate, Nemea keeps singing "not because the dread was gone, but because the arts had been thawed back into breath." Orientation is delayed—who/where/when coalesce only after the beekeeper opening—but the grotto city frame becomes clear by the second paragraph and the disorientation does not obscure the ending. The escalation from eviction notice to ice-door thaw to impromptu opera house follows a clear because/therefore chain, and the final image reconfigures the stakes (singing despite dread). Cost is felt but not entirely visible: Maris risks Council wrath, but no on-page consequence lands beyond the guards' damp boots.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (Orin, island, low tide). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Orin surrenders the forced rescue, the stone steadies, and he rows away knowing he initiated "a life beyond its blueprint"—visible cost in forsaking the sister-rescue and accepting the original timeline. One meaningful tightening occurs when the yoyo puzzle unlocks the stone's radiance and the drowned day rewinds, then Orin's refusal to intervene reconfigures his stance from compulsion to acceptance. Cost is legible in the act of letting the moment pass and the shift from "ravenous" hunger stone to "quiet."

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing closure—the protagonist tricks fear by making the light fail, leaving the curse broken and the funhouse dark. Orientation anchors (funhouse, after resuscitation, photographic curse) land early. The escalation is a deepening through recursion (mirrors, photo strips, final booth) rather than causal turns, which fits the lens. Cost is legible: the advisor dissolves into "my own breath," fear "slid off," and the funhouse goes dark—a before/after is clear. One persistent issue: the paradoxical instruction sequence feels slightly telescoped; the dream dictionary's margin note arrives and solves in quick succession without prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: Leeward layers sound, the crew joins, the storm arrives, the freighter alters course, and the sailcloth score reveals a path. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final night moment where he sits "grateful that his calling was not to predict disaster but to translate it into music" reweights his role with felt cost (gratitude implies prior doubt or fear). The orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the squall forces the crew to use the loose spar as a beater, integrating danger into the music and narrowing their options.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pattern accumulates through spiral/crack/whistle mechanics, each beat adding density until the gate splits. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira stands at the threshold seeing the mirrored city and waiting expedition, options crystallized, cost felt (stepping into the unknown to join those who vanished). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when journal spirals map onto city streets, reweighting the watchers from external threat to built-in code. Cost is legible in the final image: she must leave her city to reach the expedition.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. The confrontation escalates through Hadrin's admission and Mara's counter-offer, narrowing to the bargain that recaptures the letter with annotations—a Decisive Change with visible cost (Hadrin's exposure, Mara's compromise on full truth). Orientation anchors (Mara, disused station, after the petal) arrive within the opening lines. The rosebush signal and ivy motifs charge the final image with seasonal metaphor, though the cost could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered sensory detail, the pavilion's submerged architecture, and recurring motifs (inkwell, notes, her mother's absence) that converge at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira escapes Beran, plants her final note, and returns to shore with the inkwell "warm against her ribs," crystallizing her commitment to chart absence rather than recover the lost. Cost is visible—she defies the council, risks confrontation, and commits to a solitary memorial project—and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening occurs when she places the first stone herself, feeling "time resisting her hands," then escalates when Beran's intrusion forces her to choose between retreat and completion.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost—Maren photographs evidence, conceals the discovery, and carries the proof out, foreclosing open action and accepting personal risk. Orientation anchors early (who, where, mission). One meaningful tightening occurs when the catalog code leads to the stamp, then the folio reveals the forgery, narrowing options to covert documentation. Cost is legible: "If the council learned I had found it, they would drown the evidence more thoroughly than the sea ever had."

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Lumen Isle, post-shadow-detachment, Mira at workbench). The piece adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat (learning gem polishing, traveling to basilica, entering Archive Spire, projecting dream, folding crane, shadow's return) layers density until the climactic "split into flame and paper" reconfigures the dominant stake. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: Mira steps into the projection, splits herself, and folds grief into the crane, yielding the shadow-bird and her tears. The cost is legible (she "leaves part of herself in the light") and the final image reweights prior cranes from dead objects to vessels that can hold shadows. One minor ambiguity: the phrase "transform the recording into a new shadow" suggests creation rather than retrieval, but the ending clarifies Jalen's shadow returns, so the logic holds under lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (floating observatory, ash sea, survivor narrator). The story follows a causal arc: overload → cooling breakers impose a twelve-minute window → protagonist uses geode and perturbation math to map a gradient of "unused potential" → feeds that data into the guidance net. Yet the closure—"forcing every future drone to feel that pause as mercy"—lacks on-page proof of cost or consequence; we see the action declared but not its price or immediate friction. The lens reads Causal, but the ending substitutes assertion for dramatized closure, capping the score below high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through linked images (stones drinking light, star trails, matrix chips interlocking) and a cadence shift at the tuner activation. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second sentence; no penalty. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the tuner hums, pulses organize, and the pilgrim laughs in recognition—options are crystallized and the conceptual cost (belonging is assembled, not found whole) is legible on the page. The "frequency of belonging" motif accumulates density and the final image reweights prior searching. One small causality note: the wall segment "swung inward on hidden hinges" after star trails "pointed beyond the dome toward the western wall" is a motivated ellipsis that holds under Accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands on-page: Mara confesses the withheld truth, Jonah rejects the false memory, and they walk toward shared acknowledgment with felt cost (her fear named, his grief chosen over polish). The piece teaches a causal lens early—guilt → black market work → discovery of her own surname → confession—and holds it through the ending. Orientation anchors (cobalt terrace, dusk, Mara waiting, Jonah arriving) arrive clearly within the first third. One meaningful tightening occurs when the driftwood dolphin reveals Mara's connection, narrowing her options and forcing the confession that forecloses her evasion.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a causal lens: Lena's inspection discovers wire restraints, she uses the drawer pull as lever, the boy's recognition shifts both commanders toward apology, and the final crossing is earned by witnessed contrition. Orientation anchors quickly (parapet, neutral line, exchange night). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the exchange completes with felt cost—Sarin's "shaking hand," Vek's borrowed shame—and the drawer pull now carries collective repair. One tightening deepens stakes when the boy's mother is named, humanizing the abstract exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Theo writes the apology in the logbook, converting years of evasion into documentation that might prevent another death—a visible, irreversible cost. The causal chain from canceled ferry → inland paddle → utility-pole navigation → museum pier holds cleanly under a Causal lens with Accumulative texturing. Orientation anchors promptly (coastal kayak launch, morning, Theo). One meaningful tightening occurs when Lita's parallel run and the squall converge to test his resolve, narrowing options to reach or retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the labyrinth journey accumulates symbolic pressure through newspaper clues, murals, pinholes, and quotes rather than tight causal linkage. Closure appears to land via Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: choosing testimony over escape), but the final cost is told rather than shown—"I carried no miracle, only a statement" summarizes rather than dramatizes the forfeiture. The orientation is delayed: who, where, and when are not fully anchored until the aquarium hatch (~30% in), though the post-procedure clinical frame arrives earlier. The Orientation Test penalty applies (−0.4), and thematic summary in the final lines ("maybe empathy can be rebuilt word by word") replaces scene pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page: Mira's metamorphosis into a hound is a Decisive Change with visible cost (loss of human body and keeper role). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through spice-scent mapping, bark shiver, and the corridor reveal, then delivering a cadence shift when she "lets it fall away like shed bark." Orientation anchors (who, where, phoenix timeframe) arrive within the first 100 words. One meaningful turn—Sable's demand for equality—tightens stakes and forecloses her return to human form, meeting the 600–800-word sufficiency standard.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the protagonist's choice to "ask the tree to return them slowly" and "stay willingly perplexed" reconfigures her relationship to lost time, paid off in the final image where "the blank space had filled with overlapping palms" and "a scar that proved time can return when you stop unfastening yourself from it." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—vapor-tree, pouches of lost time, the cracked saucer—building density that culminates in visible cost (reliving the hours) and a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (postpartum, cartomancer, missing time). One micro causal slip: how the protagonist knows to look for the dolls' tea set or interprets the crack's match to the tablecloth blank feels slightly under-motivated, but the pattern teaches itself and the closure effect remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a Causal lens: Mara's search → photograph sorting → quilt stitching → vial application → hatch opening follows motivated linkage. Orientation anchors (spaceship Orison, hydroponic bay, archive) arrive early and remain stable. The closure—Mara stepping through with Lio—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (naming her cruelty, accepting buoyancy, pushing "steady as prayer"), satisfying the 9+ quick test. One meaningful tightening occurs when the quilt's silver threads align and the hatch recognizes her honesty. Minor penalty: the seam-finding mechanic (shimmer on photos) is set up but the exact process of alignment feels compressed in the final third, slightly muting escalation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by paragraph three. The drive lens reads Situational-Accumulative hybrid: the "whispering hush" accumulates pressure through the day's gifts, the cave detour, and the volcanic tremor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Amina "finally felt the texture she sought: change was hot, granular, and shared." Cost is conceptual and relational (shared survival with Toma, release of the lightning bugs), but the final beat—"gathering stranded villagers"—arrives as summary rather than on-page action, softening closure's felt impact. The prophecy frame remains decorative; it does not constrain tactics or narrow options in the cave sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.9)
    Orientation is muddled: the reader learns "I, the vigilant lock sentinel" but the relationship between the Archive Door, the terrace, the sundial, and Captain Orven's arrival is spatially unclear past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The inferred lens is Causal, but key turns depend on off-page mechanics (locks "easing open by a hair" after a spark pulse) rather than on-page decision pressure. Closure offers a Charged Poise moment—"every lock still intact, yet none truly theirs"—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically visible, and the revolution's success arrives without genuine friction or sacrifice shown in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the dust settles into patterns, the eel runs mirror the rock sequences, and the culminating helix reveals the lost rope. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~80 words. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Eren chooses to stay and teach, foreclosing flight—and the "Forgive" moment reconfigures his guilt with felt cost (the promise kept, the future of teaching accepted). One minor slip: Marel's arrival and the collaborative dust-spreading accelerate the resolution without much resistance, slightly softening the earned quality of the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator descends with "plates like fragile oaths," carrying a new mode of resistance—measured light instead of louder speech—and the cost (accepting father's betrayal, relinquishing direct confrontation with censors) is legible in the final image. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes density through layered images (darkroom timer, star map, bus timetable) and cadence shifts (storm easing at dawn, masks coming off) that reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first 120 words (stormlit observatory, annual Skywatch, censored poet). One meaningful deepening: the father's confession reframes the narrator's understanding of scars from personal wounds to shared coordinates.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: Lysander decodes the sundial → Veller demands the card → Lysander challenges him to a duel → victory enables him to reveal the evacuation plan. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure—Veller arrested, route revealed, sundial's line signaling the overture—lands on the page with social and conceptual cost (Veller's theft exposed, citizens' safety secured). One weakness: the "evacuation plan" stakes are declared late and feel convenient rather than organically seeded early, slightly undercutting causal inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation is delayed: we don't anchor "who" clearly until the prison library paragraph, and "when" remains vague until late. The piece operates as accumulative/textural mosaic across multiple time shards (spring riots, June shift, summer deepening), but transitions are abrupt and the causal linkage between beats is weak—events happen because the premise requires them, not because prior choices narrow options. Closure offers a conceptual repricing ("fracture could shine, if you let it bloom"), but the cost is abstract and not dramatized on the page; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift marks the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through recurring images (clock, compasses, film, piano) that reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the tidal arbor and departure hall setting are legible early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lio discovers the hidden room and plays the avoided chord, narrowing options and crystallizing the before/after. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): he releases the loop, the compasses steady, and he plays not to hold but to let go—cost is felt in the shift from steely longing to strength that keeps time. The film-reel map method and the hidden stairwell sequence are causally motivated and pay off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes clear anchors (Tavo, ridge, dawn, seed, monsoon threat) and follows a Causal/Situational hybrid: the dream interpretation enables the planting, which yields the tree, which restores collective memory. The closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (the tree holds and "its leaves listened"), and the conceptual cost—Tavo's "surrendered certainty" as he pours his breath—is present. However, the mechanics of the waking dream and the voices emerging from leaves remain somewhat asserted rather than fully motivated; the tree's sudden growth and choral voices feel like resolution by fiat rather than earned escalation, lowering the closure's felt inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist's shift from blaming the father to recognizing their own complicity, manifest in the pruning act and the "deepening cerulean" final image). Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (Halcyon Islet, post-severance, mail boat arrival). The closure unit—pruning the twig and recognizing "the severance…had begun with my own silence"—lands on the page with felt cost (the acknowledgment forecloses the easier narrative of pure victimhood). One meaningful deepening: the compass needle's inward turn. Escalation is more atmospheric accretion than causal tightening, which slightly softens the closure's necessity, but the RR holds under the accumulative lens and the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.4)
    Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held perfectly. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara renounces her grand ambition to "rewrite the night" and commits to "tend the small repairs," a stance crystallized with visible cost (she gives up the images behind her eyelids, feels her old ambition fade to a "dry taste"). The pattern of fragments and the ghost's test cohere into a decisive emotional shift. The final image of the lagoon rotating "to keep the stories from sinking into silence" reconfigures the stakes with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.4)
    Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph. The accumulative/textural lens holds firmly, building through layered imagery to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure: the queen’s grief is reconfigured, and the narrator receives both payment and a new understanding. The cost is legible in the final image of the thread marking the skin as a “reminder that every departure can be woven into meaning.”

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a decisive change (release of pigments, reconfiguration of the mechanical world) with felt cost in the "bitterly sweet smell" and the nun's confession. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the plot advances via because/therefore linkages.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds: because the gear is mute, Lior builds a harness; because the automaton warns of replacing furnaces, he chooses a slower transit. Closure is a Decisive Change (teaching children) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (the glowing wheel promises to break the loop) with felt cost (the Garden is troubled). Orientation is immediate; structure is a single, coherent transit with one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly, building through patterned repetitions (ribbons, poems, pauses) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Plot follows a clear causal chain from inciting incident (finding the broadcast) to climax (the concert). Closure is a decisive change with the successful dissemination of stories, though the felt cost—beyond risk—is somewhat light. The inferred causal lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate and the structure is tight for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative lens holds; closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in the scattering of ash. Orientation is immediate, and the mirage of safety constraint shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.4)
    Strong causal lens: Mara's actions (repairing the zither, innovative rehearsals) lead directly to the fundraiser's impact. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise) where the councilman's decision is catalyzed by the earned silence, with clear conceptual cost ("as if he too were crossing that long bridge of unlearning hatred"). The lens holds without ambiguity, and the final image is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal lens holds firmly; closure is a decisive change (the fruit's consumption and the garden's creation) with visible cost (the risk of patrols and the careful pruning). Orientation is immediate; the persistent constraint of the Ministry shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost—Ilyan understands his partial truth replaced one lie with another, and the Founder's whisper "Tell them the whole seam" reconfigures his mission. The structural weakness motif shapes tactics and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout; closure is an Earned Stasis where refusing to imagine a better landing ruptures assumption, slowing the machine and reconfiguring confinement as honest; cost is legible in "the texture of the missed opportunity softened into something I could carry" and "each one was mine."

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds tightly: Mira's painting directly causes Ro's visit and their shared recognition. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with clear cost—Mira's approaching sleep as trust, and the community's awakening. The final image of writing "rouse" reconfigures the stakes without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands on-page with cost: "arts had been thawed back into breath" reconfigures meaning under a causal lens. Orientation is clear early, and causality holds from inciting incident to resolution. Persistent constraint (Council's eviction) shapes tactics, and cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a resonant Earned Stasis with on-page cost ("he let the moment pass unaltered"); orientation is clear early; the hunger stone's constraint shapes the entire climax.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a decisive change (fear departs, funhouse darkens) with legible cost ("slid off me like wet paint"). Causal lens holds firmly: resuscitation→curse→funhouse journey→clasp solution. Orientation is immediate; the pattern of advisor-as-breath is taught and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds tightly: each beat flows from Leeward’s agency (tapping, sketching, climbing) and produces consequential reactions (crew coordination, freighter’s course change). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—the repaired mallet and the insight that “prophecy needed harmony” crystallize the story’s rule-set. Orientation is immediate and vivid, and the two-shard structure (crisis then aftermath) is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture. Closure is a Decisive Change (Lira steps through) with Conceptual Repricing (the gate is a mouth, the expedition waits). Causality is tight: pattern language leads to discovery, journal provides key, spirals map the city, leading to revelation. Orientation is immediate and vivid. Cost is legible in the "sunwashed dread" realization. A minor deduction: the final gate-opening feels slightly rapid after the meticulous buildup, a hairline softening of the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.4)
    Causal lens holds tightly: each beat follows from Mara's goal to recapture the letter. Closure is a decisive change—she retrieves the document and secures a path to truth—with cost legible in the "bare" rosebush and "cold wind." Orientation is immediate; the rosebush signal and station setting anchor who, where, and why within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: Lira accepts she cannot recover her mother but can chart the spaces, with cost legible in wet sleeves and warm inkwell. Causal lens holds tightly from motive to action.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Orientation is immediate; causal lens holds tightly from entry to decoded catalog to stamp discovery. Closure is a decisive change: she secures proof and chooses stealth, foreclosing confrontation with a felt cost (council would "drown the evidence"). The stamp’s provenance and blank cards as receipts create a because/therefore chain that narrows options authentically.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages; closure lands on-page with decisive change and felt cost (splitting into flame and paper); orientation is clear early and persistent constraint of dream recording shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.5)
    The plot is a tight causal chain from overload to discovery to decisive action, with a clear 12-minute clock raising stakes. Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration: feeding the pool into the guidance net forces future drones to feel pause as mercy, a change with felt cost (the unreachable wedding courtyard). The inferred hybrid lens (causal/conceptual) holds throughout, and orientation is anchored within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds; orientation is immediate; closure is a conceptual repricing (belonging as aligned pieces) with legible cost in Mara's surprise and pilgrim's laugh. The missing-pieces constraint shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens holds strongly: the watch hand discovery forces the confession. Closure is a decisive change (truth-telling and the plan to return the watch) with clear, felt cost on the page in Jonah's choice of "pain over polish" and their shared walk. Orientation is immediate; the single-scene structure with integrated backstory via concrete cues (the watch hand, driftwood) tightens cleanly to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost in the exchanged apologies and drawer pull; the causal lens holds tightly from setup to exchange. Orientation is clear within 120 words, and the moon-phase constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks; the ending reweights meaning without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands on-page with a decisive change (writing the apology) and felt cost under a clear causal lens; orientation is immediate, and the persistent constraint of the compass shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal drive lens holds; orientation is clear by ~120 words. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (tossing the baseball, returning to testify). The time traveler's revelation integrates without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal lens holds tightly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a decisive change (metamorphosis and entry into the corridor) with a palpable, on-page cost—the loss of her old body—that shapes the final image. The fortune and spices create a because/therefore chain that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative structure builds to a resonant reconfiguration; the closure image of the filled tablecloth with a scar line lands with clear cost and no causality breaks. Orientation is clear, and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a decisive change with felt cost; causal-hybrid lens holds; orientation is clear early; the persistent constraint of her gravity trait shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is clear within 120 words; accumulative/textural lens holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (the eruption and survival). Prophecy and coincidence are integrated without breaking causality, and the final image reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds firmly; closure is a decisive change (successful silent revolution) with clear conceptual cost (empty Cradle of Sparks). Orientation is immediate, and the plot's linkage is tight, though the resolution faces minimal opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds strongly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Eren chooses to stay and teach, foreclosing a life of running with a clear, felt cost ("breathing the borrowed dawn as if it were Lysa's last breath returned"). Orientation is immediate, and the final image reweights prior material decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the poet reconceives censorship as "measured light," reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("every absence had a place and every hurt a latitude"). Cost is legible in the final image of carrying "plates like fragile oaths." Orientation is anchored early; pattern of ritual repetition is taught and pays off cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal lens holds tightly: discovery leads to confrontation, duel, and revelation. Closure is a decisive change with clear cost (Veller arrested, plan revealed). Orientation is immediate, and the sundial's constraint shapes tactics. No causality breaks; the ending lands with a resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal lens holds tightly with because/therefore linkages from meeting Mara to lockdown to breaking into the library. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing ("fracture could shine") with cost legible in the smuggled exchange between libraries. Orientation is immediate, and mosaic shards cohere without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.6)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change under a causal lens: Lio's active pursuit of the film reel leads to the hidden room, where his choice to play the goodbye chord reconfigures his stance with felt cost. Orientation is anchored within 120 words, and the lens holds without ambiguity. The persistent constraint of the broken clock shapes tactics and charges the final image where time is repaired.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the tree anchors memory against the monsoon, cost legible in Tavo's surrendered certainty and the community's chorus. Orientation is clear within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands on-page with felt cost (realization of own silence and pruning); causal lens holds tightly; orientation clear early; persistent constraints (compass, lace) shape tactics.


== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean and quietly tight: flood → reassignment → discovery of wing dust → decision to experiment → discovery of spiral → leak diagnosis → repair → changed dust maps and internal reorientation. The accumulative structure is well handled; each iteration of the experiment and each new observation subtly reweights both the greenhouse problem and Mara’s relationship to data. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: measurement is reframed as story and accumulation, with a visible emotional cost in how she resituates her grief. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the accumulative/textural drive is coherent start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality is tight: the bomb leads to the ledger, which drives the canyon retracing, which yields the revelation of the councilman and the decision to embed proof in glass before exposing him. The structure stays linear and legible, with one clear escalation path and a satisfying closure in the schoolhouse reveal plus the return to the studio. The cost—risking another attack, using smuggled charcoal, destabilizing local power—is implicitly but clearly present. The ending offers a decisive change and a resonant reconfiguration of her life’s purpose without any loose or retrofitted plot threads.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: Orren arrives with a particular past, Mara presents a flawed system, he uses his tuning forks to diagnose and then correct it, culminating in his decision to stay as translator of silence. The piece follows a single-scene causal progression with one clear deepening turn when they test his own traumatic memories, then another when the child is steadied with the brass fork. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the “empty slot” is re-priced from loss to question/purpose, with the enduring cost of living inside his storm memories. Stakes are more gently intellectual/emotional than dire, but they’re coherent and fully resolved at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens: package → lens → library → receiver → realization → repair → quieted sea. Orientation is immediate and consistent despite the lyricism, and the library sequence tightens naturally into the act of “revitalizing the quiet.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the dead are cataloged and housed, the sea’s weight conceptually lightens, and Marek exits with a changed relationship to his role and the cracked lens. The cost—time, physical strain, and his implied acceptance of being “the last volume to be shelved”—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: the Quiet Fund’s anonymity → gratitude letters → rumor of laundering → officer’s threat → rerouted midnight run and reinforced anonymous solidarity. Orientation (who/where/when) is established immediately and the structure moves linearly with one meaningful tightening at the officer’s visit. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Amira and the community recommit to feeding each other anonymously despite danger, with sanctions still in force. The main weakness is that the officer confrontation resolves quickly and bloodlessly, softening the sense of real cost at the structural peak.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: past-life memory → unsettled day → encounter at the viaduct → experiential ritual → reconfiguration and release. Causality is clear even in a lyric mode: the memory prompts the question, which primes her openness to the pilgrim, whose method directly produces the internal vision and subsequent shift. Closure is strong and on-page: she reimagines calling after the soldier, loosens the knot, and walks away practicing a new rhythm that redefines her future stance toward love. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with causal through-line) holds consistently without orientation slips.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: hired to fix the dreaming bridge → given halo fragment → photos animate and reveal prior maze and trapped designer → narrator rebuilds maze → confrontation at center leads to a choice that frees woman/Lio at the cost of the photos. The drive reads primarily as accumulative/textural, but the because/therefore logic holds and supports a clear before/after. Closure is strong: the world’s rules (memory stored in reflections) are honored, and the decisive change—allowing the materials of memory to disintegrate—reconfigures stakes with visible cost. Orientation (who/where/what) is solid from the opening; no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: rumor → puzzle of keys → hidden vault → militia threat → deliberate impediment → smuggling seeds out → sharing them with farmers, giving solid on-page closure with cost. The drive lens is clearly causal, and the ending delivers a decisive change (seeds in people’s hands, not in a hidden vault) with conceptual and physical stakes. The main limitation is that the opposition never truly threatens to overturn her plan; the militia’s arrival and confusion feel briskly dispatched. Structure is otherwise clean and well-scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal line is clean: Jory’s death → Mara’s obsession and technology → Rell’s request → prototype test → confession and Mara’s decision. The structure holds as one continuous present-day scene braided with tightly anchored backstory, and the closure (Rell’s admission + Mara’s plan to go to the magistrate) lands with unmistakable consequence. One slight softness is how smoothly the prototype performs on its very first real-world trial, which minimizes tactical complication. Still, the drive lens (causal with strong textural accumulation of “absences”) is consistent and the on-page cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clear: Lio’s practice with portraits and moonbeams leads to his fixation on the door, the coded bouquet signals imminent opening, the jar enables the confrontation, and the reinterpretation of the sound creates a concrete choice with cost. Structure is tight for one scene with woven backstory; the drive is causal with a strong lyric overlay but never ambiguous. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis: he forecloses the “untaken line” and accepts loss of mystery to preserve your life. Stakes and price are legible and on-page even though the fate behind the door remains occult.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: return → reinhabiting the space → working with glass → quiet reconfiguration at the end. Causality is coherent (thaw enables return; guilt motivates plan; making glass walls culminates in opening the space) and the closure moment—stopping narration, laying the bookmark, and waiting—lands as a clear resonant reconfiguration with cost. Stakes are internal but legible. The piece flirts with being almost all texture, yet maintains just enough forward drive to avoid feeling static.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is strong: discovery of the file → flight to the library → decrypting the cast → confronting Vaughn with shell and projection → the crew’s turn and new future. Closure is decisive and on-page, with Mara changing from hiding to public exposure at real personal risk. The piece compresses some potentially rich beats into summary, but the throughline remains coherent and tight. Cost—risk of erasure and physical danger—is implicit but credible in context.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is cleanly accumulative: climb to fort → chapel conversation → battlement ritual → storm peak and booklet dissolution → quiet post-star darkness, with each step deepening the central method of navigation. Causality holds under a textural lens—each ritual (closing the booklet, pebble clatter, retelling) leads logically to the final conceptual repricing of what a “map” is. Closure is strong: the last star’s disappearance coincides with the narrator’s internalization of direction, and the price (loss of external lights and literal map) is on the page. Stakes remain more conceptual than concrete, so the urgency is atmospheric rather than sharply tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative structure around repeated twilight loops is very clean, with each loop adding texture until the discovery of the crack raises stakes and forces a new tactic. The closure is a genuine conceptual repricing: J-17 reinterprets the Second Chance Program and its own memory wipe, and the choice to stop looping forecloses an available path with visible cost (the finite violin, the end of experimentation). Causality within the speculative premise is internally consistent: the violin causes loops; loops cause amalgamation; amalgamation leads to the final insight. The single-scene frame holds without orientation debt, and the ending lands firmly within the established rule-set.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clear and tight: sabotage rumor → Mara hiding the lens → deciphering the doodles via the lens → catching Eli in the act → choosing openness → revealing the true purpose of the “sabotage.” Closure lands as a decisive change in Mara’s tactics and the institution’s stance, with the public display of tickets and lens as a concrete before/after marker. The story fits a single continuous window with one temporal glide (“two weeks earlier”) that’s well anchored. The only structural weakness is that the positive twist (accessibility project) feels slightly convenient and under-opposed, softening the climax’s difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is tight: present-tense ritual night framed by efficiently deployed backstory about the earlier lie and its partial repair. Causality is clear—past deceit → desire to prove something beyond Bureau forgiveness → request for the controlled experiment with Mera → measured physiological alignment as payoff. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: luck is reframed from external magic to the measurable embodiment of lived alignment, with a felt cost in Elias finally owning his actions aloud. The arc is quiet but coherent; no major set-up is left hanging.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: call to lab → lever pull → time-sideways vision of future damage → rooftop repair using the same principles → ethical reframing and reset. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: they foreclose a reckless discovery path in favor of controlled, responsible use, with the price being the deliberate damping of Sen’s ambition. The global drive lens reads as Causal with a conceptual overlay and holds solidly through the end. If anything, the cost remains somewhat abstract and low-risk on the page; nothing truly breaks or nearly does.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: water-activated maps → movement through liminal spaces → keyhole/door opening → discovery of the ledger → dawn implementation with other musicians. Each step is causally legible and escalates knowledge and possibility without breaking the lyric mode. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the building’s purpose and the idea of performance are reweighted by Varga’s arrangement being enacted. The cost—abandoning traditional stage performance and risking a spectral, ruin-born form of music—is implied but not sharply dramatized, keeping this just short of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine—false report → Eli vanished in storm → fever and obsessive guilt → Mara’s reframing work → Eli’s rescue and confession—holds cleanly under a largely accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist’s understanding of truth, guilt, and weather shifts from singular catastrophic hinge to calibrated, multi-forecast reality, with cost in the acknowledged loneliness created by the lie. The mountain-weather rules and the emotional logic of the fever frame remain consistent, and the backstory of the night of the lie is well-anchored and purposeful. The rescue’s success is convenient but does not feel arbitrary, because the story’s true resolution is the internal and relational repricing rather than survival suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is strong and clean: Mara’s confession → midnight drive → valve installation → ghost shift revelation → discovery of the tag/note → decision to reseal and call Mara. Structure is a single coherent episode framed by the earlier confession, with no orientation debt and a clear narrowing of options as the supernatural “accounting” becomes unavoidable. Closure lands as a decisive change in stance—choosing not to collude in silence—rooted in prior beats and with evident relational and moral cost. The only thing keeping this just shy of 9+ is that the emotional repercussion of exposing Mara, while implied, could be sharpened with one more concrete beat at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: library set-up → swan transition → obsidian refuge encounter → return and revaluation of decay. Causality is coherent in a lyric key—each step follows from the keeper’s motive to check if the refuge “still breathed,” and the swan/refuge logic is taught early enough to feel natural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the keeper applies the refuge’s lesson to the fallen ceiling and later visitors, creating a clear before/after in how they relate to change. Stakes remain primarily conceptual and quiet, which fits the mode but keeps the sense of risk relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Mara’s mutism → Liora’s methodical sessions → locket touch → eclipse idea → grove scene → hum and first word. The story holds a mostly linear structure with one small backstory fold, and closure lands clearly with Mara’s “He used to whistle” / resumed speech as a decisive change. Stakes (will Mara reconnect to her grief in language?) are implicit but consistent. The only minor weakness is that the eclipse is a bit convenient as a catalytic event, though it’s seeded early enough to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival in the silo → discovery of the hearth → diaries → tapestry → conceptual realization → final signpost. Causality is tight, with each find deepening the core stake of orientation after the end of dreaming, and the world’s rules never wobble. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the plea to "set the axis back" is reweighted by Lysa’s realization that this is impossible, so the only meaningful act is meticulous remembering. That choice carries a clear cost—the irrevocability of loss—and the final image of stories "turning toward their new north" makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: prophetic fortunes → microdot specs → lighthouse as control point → misdirected messages → patrol boat crisis → Lian’s conscious redirection and renunciation. The structure moves smoothly from setup in the shop to the island, with each exposition piece (how the light orchestrates flow, open secrets) paying off in the climax and ending. Closure is strong: burning the fortunes and writing an uncoded message constitute a clear before/after conceptual shift with visible cost. The only modest limitation is that the patrol threat resolves quickly and largely off-page once the beam is redirected, softening the sense of prolonged jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: impending possession → Selo’s choice of rhetorical rather than violent tools → specific rhetorical moves → Mara’s memory and counter-act → parasite expelled and rift stabilized. The Dimensional Anchor’s constraints (one color, limited promises) are introduced early and paid off at the climax with the drawn circle. Closure is a decisive change (possession broken) plus a conceptual repricing (unknown as neighbor, not enemy) with a visible cost (Mara’s shivering, the rift’s tremble). The scene is continuous, well-oriented, and the global drive remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is accumulative and coherent: kiosk work → memory mapping → ascent to the crown → dawn ritual, all causally linked by the narrator’s experiments with return. The closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—time is re-understood from road to rhythm, and her role shifts from nostalgic sufferer to active conductor via fortune slips. Causality is lyric rather than mechanical but remains internally consistent; the mirrored horizon and nautilus ritual feel like a rule-set followed through, not a late convenience. Stakes and cost at closure are more internal than external, but that’s appropriate to the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece tracks cleanly from walking the viaduct to finding the tablet, triggering fractured timelines, experimenting with branches, and making a decisive selection, all in one continuous scene. Causality is legible—each new rule (paused instant, tablet generating paths, inhalation as trigger) appears before it’s needed and drives the next move. Closure is strong: choosing a single gravity-embracing timeline forecloses endless branching, and the cost is legible in her new “heavier” state. The structure is more accumulative than twist-driven, but it still tightens meaningfully toward the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is coherent and tight: strange drums → broken needle → filament of hush → backward play and scoring of the record → snapping of the parasite and restoration of feeling. The story stays in one scene with clean spatial and temporal continuity, and the closure beat (the filament snapping, the Listener withdrawing, and Mara carrying a new lesson out of the cavern) is unambiguous and earned. The drive lens is primarily causal with some textural layering, and the Decisive Change is clear: the world’s emotional state shifts. The only restraint on a higher score is that the solution arrives relatively smoothly once explained, with little sense that alternative options were seriously weighed or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: followed home → note about rogue quarantine and danger to self → decision to avoid direct confrontation and “progress laterally” → discovery of the cover-up → rescue of Mara → evidence sent out and escape → reconfigured ending back in the courtyard. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the piece holds a coherent causal drive lens through to closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: solitude has been redefined from pure refuge to a chosen stance that now includes Mara and a sharpened sense of risk. The main drawback, at this level, is that some beats (penetrating the zone, freeing Mara, escaping) resolve a bit efficiently, softening the felt difficulty of the middle stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: the mysterious vial and note → Conservatory visit at the moment of transformation → ultraviolet reveal of the dedication → explanation of the catalyst role → decision to uncork → emotional and situational reconfiguration. The structure is essentially a single, continuous scene with integrated backstory that always tilts his present stance. Closure is decisive: he moves from running from this place to literally hanging his lanterns to guide others, with the ledger revelation deepening cost and reweighting the past. No significant orientation or lens ambiguity; the drive remains clearly causal with a strong emotional RR at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clean: beings arrive → bargains offered → narrator proposes ethical compromise → grotto ritual → conditional binding in the knot → later human use. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the narrator forecloses limitless mapping of time in favor of guarded access, with a clear cost to personal desire. The later shard of drivers visiting reweights the earlier decision without feeling like an afterthought. Structure holds under an accumulative/lyric lens yet still satisfies causal expectations at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean and causal: hush descends → hall is to be shuttered → Mara retrieves the bowl and chooses to act → journey to greenhouse → unbinding at cistern → reconfigured world on exit. Orientation is excellent from the first line (coast, Echo Harbor, aftermath of rainforest fire) and the single-scene arc through the greenhouse is easy to track. Closure lands solidly as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush around the orchard breaks and Mara’s stance toward “unfinished” beauty crystallizes. The main limitation is that the unbinding proceeds smoothly on first attempt, with little on-page sense that failure or misstep would significantly alter options.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece runs as a clean, single-scene causal arc: client arrives with numbness, Mira probes via static and story, discovers the buried truth, makes an altered compound, and Orin’s inhalation completes both the lung transformation and his emotional reckoning. Stakes and constraints are legible early (his imminent ambering and need for a last feeling), and every beat logically follows from prior choices. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Orin moves from denial to earned grief, and Mira from pure counterfeit to risking genuine involvement, marked by writing the brother’s name. Cost is on the page in Orin’s tears and Mira’s acceptance of ongoing professional boundaries despite her new tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: symphony → misaddressed envelope → library encounter → shared story → plan → later chain of envelopes and the final “repeating error.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: kindness becomes a self-sustaining system, embodied by the letter looping back to Mara. The structure is linear and easy to follow, with the later vignette functioning as a satisfying echo rather than a new arc. The main limitation is the relatively low sense of risk or constraint impinging on Mara’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Sava’s desire for belonging leads her to the search, which leads to the arbor discovery, which prompts the reinterpretation of the tag and her decision to remake the kin web. Closure is strong via a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: belonging becomes an active craft, and the tag’s meaning shifts from pure safety-marker to invitation. The cost is emotional and social (risking asking to be woven in, reconfiguring inherited customs) and is legible on the page. Escalation is modest but coherent, with the winter/ice-sheet risk and the lost child’s memory adding quiet pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: pendant → rumor → Orren’s time-sculpting → borrowing-time mechanism → descent into the Giant → cadence-lock puzzle → uncaging. The global drive is cleanly causal, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: echoes are born where endings are refused, with an explicit time-debt cost. The nap-time constraint and the risk of waking the Giant stay coherent and sharpen the late beats as he “sighed toward waking.” No serious orientation or rule-breaking issues emerge, and the set-ups (pendant, canal clay, cadence lore) all pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story’s structure is clean: present-time ritual framed by a single, well-integrated backstory thread about Orren’s disappearance. Causality is tight and legible under an accumulative/textural lens: waiting for the last drop → using the glass eyes on the mosaic → the stalactite sequence aligning with the pattern → seam opening → ladder-bridge attempt → conceptual acceptance. Closure lands firmly via a resonant reconfiguration: she gains a theorem about reachable-but-not-retrievable love and alters her future stance without resolving the loss. No major setups are abandoned, and the final tile repair and walk home close the loop without feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is tight: outage → child’s cry → Lio’s retrieval of the fragment → caching and note → dawn encounter → Lio’s repricing of visibility forms a clear causal and accumulative arc. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts a form of visibility that doesn’t require stepping out, with the tape fragment as hinge. Orientation is immediate (library, dawn, outage) and never slips despite the lyric prose. No set-up is abandoned; everything introduced (outage, pipe chases, caches, fragment) participates in the ending’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative surface: storm → leaf arrival → trellis break → tactile contact → progressive changes → experiment with new trellis method → thematic resolution. Orientation is crystal-clear from the first line (who, where, when, what she wants). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts a porous, co-creative stance and mails her findings, with the leaf pressed in her journal as a charged final object. The arc tightens once in a satisfying way when she chooses to rebuild the trellis differently, rather than attempting a second, larger reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and causal: arrival → chapel discovery → map → sinkhole → instrument vision → brooch exchange. Orientation is excellent and the rules of the world (rain trails, convergence) are introduced through action rather than exposition. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator exits with altered tools and understanding, having paid a price. Stakes are emotionally scaled to the form, though the urgency of the initial “after the water wars” frame is less tested than it might be.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Sera’s wish activates the pearl, which diverts to Lan, triggering the possession and forcing their joint musical exorcism. The story maintains a single continuous scene with clear spatial and causal logic (crystals → pearl → shadows → inhabiting force). Closure is a conceptual repricing: Sera’s understanding that the cave “tunes” stories, and that unseen forces are guided by narrative attention, lands on the page with the cost of Lan’s risk and their effort. The only limitation is that the conflict resolves relatively smoothly once they start singing, without a further complication or failed attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: Sorrel’s three visits, Ilven’s reveal, and the three public evenings form a clear progression that tightens around the question of how the town will confront its erased past. Causality is sound—each new shard of information shifts Mara’s tactics and leads directly to the orchestrated final note. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the trumpet’s first post-exile sound being an “invitation” rather than an order reweights the entire exile apparatus and Ilven’s earlier sabotage with real conceptual cost. The piece balances summary and scene deftly within the word count, with no orientation or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clear: vow → phantom punch → months of mapping cracks → secret platform → conditional ticket → confession → train → fortress. The story fits a mostly continuous scene with one smooth descent into the underground and lands a solid Charged Poise closure as she steps into the fortress to “speak” the unspoken. World rules around the Midnight Line and the punch are consistent within the slipstream frame. A touch more friction or delay at the decision to board could sharpen the sense of risk in the central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: tile → first transcription → realization of shifting pattern → collaborative writing with Jory → three-way session with Leena → dawn closure. Causality is consistent and legible under a textural/accumulative lens, with the tile’s behavior and the whales’ appearances reweighting the stakes rather than solving them mechanically. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara’s stance toward “meaning” shifts in a way that forecloses easy dismissal and carries the cost of ongoing exposure to others’ grief. A hair more on-page bracketing of time progression (the sequence of evenings) could strengthen the spine, but the current structure holds firmly.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: solar storm → corridors’ mutiny → need for a leader → revelation of the amulet’s curse → Ilias’s choice to become the goodbye he seeks. Closure is both decisive and costly: he steps through the slit of darkness and feels his immortality peeling away, a clear before/after with conceptual and personal price. The story holds a coherent Hybrid drive lens (external mutiny + internal reckoning) all the way to the final conceptual repricing of “after goodbye.” No orientation or rule-consistency debts materially undercut that arc.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Ivo’s arrival → Sami’s need → plan for a con → Mara’s counter-plan via Mercy → agents’ arrival → asylum decision. Closure lands as an earned reconfiguration: Mara’s allegiance and method shift, creating a breach with her father and a new, risky path rooted in truth. The single-scene structure in the prep room is tight and easy to orient in, with no temporal or spatial confusion. The slight convenience of the agents shifting relatively quickly under Mercy’s influence keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: shop → recognition of history’s stall → established lamp method → dissatisfaction → journey to bonsai labyrinth → intensified method → revaluation at the lightning-split oak → return with altered stance. Causality is coherent and legible, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he no longer tries to overwrite silence with bustling invented scenes but to catalog the textures of absence itself. The stakes and costs are contemplative but real—if he fails, the town becomes “nothing at all”—and his choice to continue in this narrower, disciplined way is a form of earned stasis. A slightly clearer beat of present-tense jeopardy or friction could have tightened the structural pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: death-on-paper → work in the maze → discovery of the label → investigation by tides → 9H files → redistribution and whispered names, with each step causally or texturally linked. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts a nameless, vessel-like identity and redistributes the erased histories, with cost in permanent self-erasure risk and isolation. The piece stays largely in one throughline, but the central investigation and its stakes could be foregrounded and tightened a bit sooner to heighten the sense of structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: artifacts lead to micro-experiments, which culminate in the temporal “whisper” where he revisits and retells his past. Causality is soft but legible—each object unlocks the next layer of the method, and the final Conceptual Repricing (the riddle as method, not answer) lands clearly. Closure is on-page and coherent: the before/after is Eli as external myth-debunker vs. someone who hears gaps and owns his role in myths. The cost—standing in every fled conversation and re-hearing them—is present but slightly underplayed, keeping this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain from posted “heritage upgrades” to Majo’s chip to the graffiti network to the night of reorganization is clean and coherent. The closure—a signed moratorium plus Ira’s mural—lands as a Decisive Change with resonant reconfiguration; the city’s fluidity is now policy-relevant, not just aesthetic. The piece leans on summary over fully dramatized scene, which keeps some beats (especially the retying itself) from achieving maximal immediacy. Nonetheless, the structure is tight and the before/after is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative frame: impact → inspection → chemical timers → hush → farewell image, all under the ticking clocks of night and dawn. The iodine strips create clear beats that organize the night without feeling schematic, and every return to the crater or dome advances the central drive toward “the last dark.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final photograph and sand grain reprice the entire night as an act of elegiac witnessing with undeniable conceptual cost. Nothing crucial is left offstage or resolved by fiat; the quiet ending still registers a before/after clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: ship needs fog guidance → bird fails → courier brings it → Lio repairs and recalibrates it → Sera sails guided by the restored drone and renewed faith. Orientation is excellent from the opening sentence, and the single-scene structure with a mild time pressure from the departing ship keeps the frame tight. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ship’s departure under the hummingbird’s song makes the “repair” of guidance/faith concrete. The only limitation is that failure stakes (what happens if the Meridian goes without the bird) stay mostly conceptual rather than being sharply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: falcon → cryptic message → condensation insight → extrapolated coordinates → journey → discovery → quiet revaluation at the spring. The structure fits a compact expedition arc with one key tightening (the condensation-as-map realization) and a solid closure unit that reconfigures the meaning of the blank space and Riven’s work. Cost is primarily conceptual and anticipatory (what the Ministry will do, what it means for maps-as-weapons) rather than enacted, which keeps the stakes slightly abstract on the page. Still, the piece ends in a charged poise that clearly marks a before/after in knowledge and stance.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal and accumulative: Sava diagnoses the problem, experiments with rhythm, gradually enlists others, and this culminates in the decree-carrier’s reversal when the town “proves itself alive.” The throughline from imbalance → tuning experiments → communal cadence → political reprieve is coherent and legible. Closure is decisive—the district is not abandoned—and the “before/after” for the town is unmistakable. The main weakness is that the external decision (the carrier folding the decree) happens very quickly and with minimal resistance, softening the sense of hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight and legible: snapped tether → gathered hush blocking signal → decision to unsnarl rather than cut free → release of harvested silence → use of perfume vial → access to mirror and mind-network → outgoing distress “pulse.” The piece maintains a single continuous scene with one dominant stake (survive and get a signal out) and pays it off with an on-page conceptual repricing: the hush redefined from curse to reservoir, and memory becoming the true medium of communication. The closure has cost—air nearly gone, uncertain survival, a piece of herself surrendered to the temple’s archive—and that cost shapes tactics, not just flavor. Structure is clean with no orientation debt or late rule-breaking conveniences.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric frame: chaplain → lattice → listening/hovering → old wing → revelation of bodies in the lens → decision to wait and leave a trail. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear almost immediately, and the lighthouse/prison geometry remains coherent. Closure lands as a charged poise: the boy has accomplished his drive (finishing the story) but at the cost of ceding the hush to the dead and accepting likely disbelief. The price of his lineage and chosen invisibility is legible in the final waiting image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: bead → apparition → resonance → theory of resonant awakening → construction of resonator → sacrificial repayment and orchard blooming. Backstory (the burned orphanage and prior life) is economically folded in and directly reshapes the present stakes rather than pausing them. Closure lands as a decisive change with visible cost: the bride is freed, the valley is saved, and Eli is left emptied of name and bond. The structure is essentially one escalating arc without wasted moves; a hair more time on the immediate bodily stakes of the sacrifice could push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story holds a clear accumulative throughline: from the plate’s arrival to Ila’s experimental method to the town’s eventual following of the stitched path and the redefinition of reverence. Causality is coherent—her decision to use sleepwalkers and thread leads to the rediscovery of the altar and to a new covenantal understanding of the labyrinth. Time jumps (plate weeks ago, repeated nights) are summarized but anchored and legible. Closure lands as a strong conceptual repricing: reverence shifts from prohibition to an ongoing communal practice, with history and risk acknowledged.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: return → hiring → excavation → tremor collapse → discovery of alcove and motto → opening the tomb → conflict over sealing it → notebook discovery → sundial reconstruction and staying. The tremor provides a well-timed structural turn that forces new tactics and reframes her inner arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the watch stopped at noon, the notebook of interrupted journeys, and the working sundial together reprice the idea of faith and time with a legible before/after. Stakes remain mostly personal and institutional rather than acutely perilous, which slightly softens structural bite but not coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: dawn preparation → receipt of the letter → margin scan → discovery of ghost-notes → chalk-map route → hidden hatch → decision to bait the thief. Closure lands via a conceptual and tactical shift—turning a supposedly untraceable, anonymized letter into a trap that will “announce the thief,” reweighting the whole mail system. The main limitation is that the cost is mostly implied (legal risk, danger of crossing the Archive) rather than made sharply felt in the closing beats, which keeps the ending from fully biting. Still, the drive lens (primarily causal with strong textural support) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: Liora’s pattern-listening leads to the secret map; Kest’s arrival surfaces the conspiracy; the orrery–beacon synchronization and eternal flame test identify the chosen possibility; the lieutenant’s interruption forces an on-the-fly mis-synchronization that protects them; they then send the encoded evidence out. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative textural pressure), and the closure lands as Charged Poise: the chart is dispatched, the logs are subtly altered, and the city is poised “before the coup” with new options and a clear conceptual cost. No orientation or logic gaps appear despite the complex world rules. The only minor limitation is that the coup’s macro-consequences stay offstage, but the immediate structural unit closes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece uses a mostly accumulative structure: journey through the labyrinth → ritual with shard and letters → escalating spirit messages → re-evoked courthouse moment → Elias’s arrival and on-page apology. Each step follows from the prior one under the story’s rules (offerings and evocation intensify the spirits’ engagement, culminating in “SAY IT HERE”). Closure is strong: a clear decisive change occurs when she actually apologizes to Elias and gives him the healed shard, foreclosing the path of endless unsent letters. The only slight softness is Elias’s arrival feeling a bit convenient, even though rumors and his own ache are invoked as causal justification.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: misinterpreted word → stakes of potential ambush → Lani’s decision to decode the cast → clarification of intent → stand-down and vigil. The piece holds a single continuous scene with one clear tightening (discovery of the funeral/meeting ambiguity) and a decisive change in external outcome. Closure lands both concretely (the stand down order) and conceptually (reframing the cast as a labyrinth that can be unknotted), with visible social cost avoided and emotional cost acknowledged. No orientation or lens ambiguity remains by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: rumor → journey into the orchard → fragment/film investigation via the knowledge network → discovery of the schoolhouse niche → projection of the children → waking and application. Causality holds even within dream logic (aligning film and fragment leads to identifying the schoolhouse; inserting the fragment enables the “click” and subsequent light-work), and there are no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara’s relationship to art and process is reweighted when she wakes and chooses to carry the dream-method into her commissioned world. The cost—accepting vulnerability and openness in a professional context—is conceptually legible, though not explicitly pressed against an external counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative, lyric structure with nested awakenings is coherent and pattern-taught; it never loses who/where, even as reality folds. Causality is dream-logic but consistent: echoes and the coin trigger deeper “rooms” in the pause, leading to the conceptual test about the “last layer.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara consciously chooses uncertainty in response to Tomas’s question, reweighting all prior beats. The cost—relinquishing her default of professional certainty and control—is conceptually clear if subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Lio’s arrival → greenhouse becomes a hub → distributed garden-code network → Bureau crackdown → raid on the greenhouse, where environmental constraints and prior setup pay off. The piece lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: by the end, the resistance infrastructure is in place and functioning, even as the Bureau presses in. Stakes and timing of the raid feel earned, not arbitrary, and transitions through the “within a week” summary are legible. The main limitation is that the cost of the raid is mostly tension and near-miss; no on-page loss sharpens the before/after as much as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: blackening lilies → elders’ request → postcard map → descent and song → tearing and sinking the card → lilies’ renewal and softened anger above. The piece lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: peace is renewed at emotional cost, and the world’s rules about peace-as-plant are reweighted on the page. Structure is tight and linear for a lyric piece, with no orientation or lens ambiguity. The main limitation is that success feels almost assured once she reaches the cistern; there’s little sense that failure is a live possibility beyond the conceptual price she pays.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: cracked chime → need for full song → journey to museum → acquisition of bamboo tube → repair → activation and release of names. Structure is linear, easy to follow, and the story lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: from mute orchids and regret to reawakened names and a charged ongoing duty. Cost is primarily emotional and conceptual (exposure to archives of extinct feelings, confronting the chime’s grief), but it is legible. Escalation is modest yet coherent for a lyric piece, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: past theft and secrecy → poisoned trust → planned ritual with explicit rules → shared promises → painful truth-reveal → redefined use of the codex and a new pledge. Orientation (who, where, when) is established very early, and the ritual mechanics pay off without last-minute rule changes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they choose to wield the codex’s power to stitch trust rather than enforce obedience, and Mara relinquishes unilateral control of the ink well. The cost—shared shame, the end of secrecy, and a more fragile, hard-won trust—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean: the political dispute → the seemingly blank note → adhesive analysis → decoded solution → public explanation → accord, with each step narrowing options. The closure is a decisive change with cost: Mara publicly stakes out a third path and implicates herself and Rolen, risking both factions to avert future disaster. The volcano setting and note-decoding are not mere ornaments but integrated devices that enable the key turn. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the situational pressure remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal: Oren’s arrival and the twin meteorite chips force Mara to interrogate Merek’s past, which leads to his confession and her dawn decision. Orientation is solid from the opening line, and the story maintains one continuous, legible window of time with well-placed reflective folds. Closure lands as a decisive change—she risks real-world consequences by sending the birds, in tension with her survival habit of falsifying paper trails. All key set-ups (meteorite chip, paper-trail skills, hidden scores, dust-mote method) pay off in the final movement.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: logbook → weather code → pavilion wood → hidden plate → timed corridor → doorframe plate and realization. The piece honors its accumulative, lyric feel while still providing a traceable sequence of discoveries and a legible closure unit (her crossing with redefined understanding of thresholds). Cost is more conceptual than visceral but present: she forecloses staying safely on her original terrace. Structure holds as a single continuous scene with well-managed backstory interleaved through present cues.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece has clean causal flow: warrant → descent → meeting → tour of the ruin → decision to open the terrarium → shared exploration until dawn, all cohering under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. Orientation is precise despite the lyricism; we always know where they are and why each move follows. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city reclassified from tomb to site of shared belonging, with time and separation still a live cost. The only limit is that the “until sunrise” frame doesn’t quite convert into a hard, choice-forcing final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causality is strong and legible: strange disappearances → hypothesis about emotional routes → bird-seed trail to anomaly → crater glass reveals terror → Mira’s backstory and broken promise → confession → ridge restored. The story maintains a single coherent drive lens (causal with a conceptual overlay) and delivers closure through a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s rules are reweighted and a path literally reappears. Cost is present in Mira’s need to confront shame and the implication that other paths may remain lost, though the resolution verges on neat. Structure is cleanly one arc with a central scene and no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: orchestrated randomness with the bishop leads to the watchwoman’s involvement, which leads them to the booth and the trapped boy, culminating in a tactically clever, character-driven rescue. Structure is tight and linear within one night, and the story lands on a resonant reconfiguration where Milo folds the rescue back into his art without claiming prophetic power. Cost—the boy’s near-drowning and the emotional disruption of the night—is legible, and the final stance about “arranging gates for chance” grows directly from events rather than being imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: nostalgia ban → exile → speck anchoring → rhythmic adaptation → keeper’s bargain → tattooing with altered ink → release → onward mission. The piece sustains a single coherent drive (how to preserve forbidden longing without censorship) and lands closure with her decisive choice to remain in exile and weaponize her new body-text. The anchoring constraint functions well as the central mid-story complication. Escalation is elegant rather than intricate, so the structure feels strong but not quite at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: notice → nocturnal reckoning at the pond → dawn repair → conversation in the atrium → revised recommendation, with the pond method reprised to frame the ethical choice. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost: the demolition is averted in favor of a public workshop, explicitly at odds with the luxury marina plan. The main structural limitation is how readily one inspector’s awakening seems to overturn entrenched economic pressure, which slightly softens the felt difficulty of the win.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: ridge walk → memory of cabin fire and lie → encounter with Jonah → story of Eli as tool to shift Jonah and recommit to truth. Backstory is well-anchored in the present (the box, the ridge, the meeting) and never floats. Closure lands as an on-page stance crystallization—Mara’s decision to confess and Jonah’s changed relationship to his fear—though the confession itself is deferred off-page. A hairline softness is that the present-time problem (Jonah’s freeze) resolves through a single conversation without any immediate counter-pressure or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: Mina retreats to the grotto → experiments with balloons → discovers cross-timeline data → refines equations → applies them to lift the town. Structure stays linear and legible, with one clear transition from private grotto work to public communal launch, and closure via actual flight. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal progression plus conceptual repricing of hope as computable/ensemble), and the final act satisfies that lens, but cost at closure is mostly inferred (risk and sacrifice are underplayed). No major causality breaks or orientation issues, yet escalation feels more like an elegant unfolding than a pressured narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain from entering the ivy-veiled passage → finding diaries → decoding the film strip → revealing the vent chamber → making the report decision is clean and coherent. The piece lands solid Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure: she chooses concealment at personal and civic cost. Structure is essentially one continuous exploration with rising discoveries, no orientation issues, and no broken setups. A minor limitation is that the Restoration Office pressure appears almost at the end, so the institutional conflict feels slightly under-developed relative to the family/architectural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: healer’s conditions → search via lullaby → encounter with painter → mirror corridor → moral choice → return of heartbeat and reconfigured outcome. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean by the first paragraph, and the ticking bells provide a clear structural spine. Closure lands decisively when the protagonist chooses the boy’s life and the mirror collapses into a single, altered future, with the cost visible. The final realization about why the painter remains elusive functions as a satisfying conceptual reweighting of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: Sera’s choice of ritual → demand for sacrifices → objections → personal offerings → vows → burning and signed treaty. The piece delivers a clear closure unit (Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing) as Sera recognizes peace as ongoing labor rather than forgiveness. Structure is tight for a single-scene negotiation; no beats feel vestigial. The only slight softness is how quickly both commanders accept a high-cost ritual, which reads more like compressed inevitability than fully pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: engineered drought → visible “map” → solitary pilgrimage → failed playback → deliberate shattering of the egg. Structure is tight as a single continuous scene with integrated backstory that always tilts the present action. Closure lands as a decisive change in what she’s trying to do with the egg and her power (“the drought would end when she allowed it”) with a clear cost. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the hybrid causal/accumulative design is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: Maris’s covert preparation → guiding the governor into the sanctuary → exploiting the breath-lock → physically unsealing the threads → the echoes’ release that destabilizes the governor’s power. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change in the city’s relationship to vows and in the governor’s authority, with an implied personal risk for Maris. The structure is tight, one continuous scene with backstory flashes anchored to present stimuli, and there are no causality breaks. The only limitation is that obstacles in the sanctuary sequence resolve a bit smoothly, with minimal real threat of failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: gallery argument → retreat to dome and confrontation with past theft → formal experiment with reversal → public test via puppet show → Mara’s boundary → explicit contract and communal performance. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: Ilya contracts to ask, share proceeds, and grant veto power, reconfiguring his artistic practice and power. The later dome performance with shared truths and boundaries functions as a resonant coda rather than a soft reset, deepening the same drive. Structure is linear and clear despite lyric density, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: dawn climbs, the broken frame and moth wing, the re-engineered signal, then the monarchs’ passage and dismantling of the frames. Causality is tight at the scale this piece aims for—old failed “interrupted cadence” leads directly to the reed metronome solution. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the sky “listens” once, and Arin accepts the work’s transience with visible cost (he dismantles what worked). Stakes remain intimate and understated but never feel vague or unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: past guilt → invitation north → decoding and re-braiding → auroral “performance” → casting a durable strip → carrying it south, all under a single atonement drive. Causality is tight in a lyric mode; every step (learning from the punched card, reconfiguring the rope, then casting) grows logically from the prior one. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: their relationship to their earlier mistake and to the dead is reweighted with visible cost (arduous journey, painstaking labor, emotional vulnerability). Orientation is clear from early on; no lens or timeline confusion undermines the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is coherent: dreams → seal → bunker access → decaying directive → dream interrogation → final order and exit. The dream shard is clearly anchored in the bunker frame, keeping orientation stable despite the lyric style. Closure lands as a conceptual/stance shift (accepting “WALK UNTIL THE WALKING WALKS YOU”), with the bunker’s purpose completed and the protagonist’s role redefined. The cost is mostly conceptual and existential rather than dramatized through loss, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: receiving the tile → decoding the vow → waiting for Mars → opening the stair → confronting the mask → trading certainty for covenant. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing plus earned stasis: he forecloses his old life of pure empiricism for “coordinates for a sky no empire owned,” with the snapped stylus as visible cost. Orientation is secure from the first paragraph; the between-regimes palace and his role are clear, and the single-POV, single-drive structure holds. The only modest limitation is that the risks of entering the chamber and engaging the mask remain abstract rather than foregrounded as concrete potential losses, which softens the sense of peril.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    The scene is tightly structured around a single pressure: can Lio alter the refugees’ trajectory from vengeance to release during the city’s most violent shift. Causality is coherent—his earlier lie about the box, the sanctuary rules, and the healer’s teaching all funnel into the choice to open the music box at peak panic. Closure is clear: Mara’s decision to let go of the knife and lead without threats marks a decisive change with a felt cost. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal chain plus accumulative bodily/rhythmic pressure) and holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: find broken sextant → attempt reconstruction via mirrors and breathing → climb terrace to test → initial failure as star “slides” → refinement with ground mirror → partial success that reconfigures his situation. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with a causal through-line, and the final beat (restored orchard in the mirror while the real district remains ruined) delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with a tangible cost. Orientation (who/where/what) is established very early despite the lyric style, so there’s no navigation debt. The structure—a single progressive arc—fits the length and the closure lands decisively without feeling over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: breach of contract → trespass into cathedral → search for ribbon → encounter and aid the true client (boy) → renewed vow beyond institutional contracts. The story holds a single scene with escalating pressure around whether she will act despite having “no right,” leading to a clear conceptual reconfiguration of vows at the end. Closure lands on-page with cost: she embraces continuing repair work outside the guild’s sanction. A slightly sharper sense of external risk (e.g., consequences of being caught) could intensify structural stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: cameo → orchard anomalies → bathroom realization → cameo’s transformation → final accession note, with the nonlinear inheritance concept binding it causally and thematically. Closure is a resonant earned stasis/conceptual repricing: she recognizes the trap and chooses complicating preservation over disclosure, with a clear before/after stance. A slight trade-off is that some causal links (e.g., mechanics of the family planting the orchard) remain abstract, placing the piece more on the lyric/accumulative than fully causal side, but the drive lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Orren’s arrival → entrance to the mountain-store → clerk → trapped readers → curator → vault → new grammar, all in a clear because/therefore sequence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the “library of unlearned lessons” becomes legible through omissions, and future rescue missions are fundamentally altered. Costs are mostly conceptual and off-stage (what would have been lost without this intervention), with minimal sacrifice dramatized in-scene. Structure is linear and coherent, with no orientation problems or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is strong: Mara boards with a goal, discovers the ship’s rules (filaments, portraits, mannequin), learns the price (certainty), then enacts a solution via storytelling that opens the garden and reconfigures the ship’s drift. Closure is decisive and legible—the ship choosing a direction and Lio “sparked” into wholeness mark a clear before/after with conceptual cost. Some rules are delivered a bit expositionally through the mannequin, but they’re consistent and used. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a conceptual accent, and it holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: the anomalous seal leads her to the tower, the rope-door mechanism, the gap archive, and finally the recovered treaty and her decision to publicize it. Structure is tight within one continuous scene plus the gap “shard,” and closure is solid—a decisive shift from institutional erasure to active remembrance with social cost implied. Some stakes (harm to the town and students) are delivered in a single explanatory sentence, so the magnitude of the cost is more told than dramatized. Nonetheless, under a causal drive lens, the before/after of the university’s ethical stance is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: disruption of cave harmonics → diagnostic use of ice fractures → discovery of Forge → redirection and bargain. The story maintains a single continuous throughline and lands a clear Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration when the beings agree to feed on the Forge, reconfiguring danger into managed coexistence. Cost is present but subtle—Sava assumes ongoing responsibility and accepts that absolute silence is impossible. Structure feels tight and legible, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality is clean and legible: prism sabotage → meteor/shard → hush effect → intensified experiments → rekindled beacon → answered signal. Structure marches in a clear progression of attempts and payoffs, with no teleporting props or rule breaches. Closure is strong: the world moves from apparent randomness to an articulated, lived proof that “the world is stitched, not random,” with the cost of long solitude and obsessive labor implicit. No major orientation or lens-clarity issues appear, and the ending decisively reconfigures the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clear: investigate monuments → absorb others’ memories → storm escalates and threatens Archive → decisive risky act of inscribing self into the crystal → reconfiguration of stakes and identity. Causality holds under a textural lens: each new memory exposure increases risk of self-dilution while the approaching storm heightens urgency. Closure lands cleanly via a Conceptual Repricing: nostalgia is re-understood as an inward compass and shared memory as literal architecture stabilizing the fog. The cost—partial surrender of a bounded self—is legible in the narrator’s acceptance of a “widened” identity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal throughline is clean: arrive → learn need for diversion → discover note → design altered show → council’s attention is redirected → gate is opened → camps enter in order. Closure lands clearly with a Decisive Change (the literal opening of the river gate and the camps’ controlled entry) plus a tonal reconfiguration of what fireworks are for. The child’s hidden note and the council’s relatively quick capitulation read as slightly convenient, smoothing over what could be a rougher moral or logistical fight, which blunts some potential cost. Still, for this length, the structure is tight and the before/after (closed fortress vs open gate) is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is tight: one continuous scene with well-anchored reflective inserts, all causally linked to the present conversation and the use of the cicada. The global drive is Hybrid (situational conflict + accumulative/textural time-magic), and it holds cleanly; each move (council demand → tangent → cicada activation → foresight → proposal to move north) follows. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: Mara accepts the harbor’s coming as another tide and chooses a new watching ground, with the relationship reconfigured but intact. The cost (her maps becoming artifacts, the partial betrayal in hidden jars, Iven’s fear) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: ascent, inversion, progressive tastings, approach to the dangerous scorched vines, then descent and private payoff with the jar. Causality is solid under a largely accumulative/textural lens—each silence sampled deepens the premise and prepares the gilded hush climax. Closure is an on-page resonant reconfiguration: the final image reweights fear and space after the gilded hush is captured and opened. Stakes and outcome are fully legible with no orientation or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The single continuous scene is cleanly structured: boarding, crossing, storm-glass warning, adjustment, arrival, with a clear before/after in Mara’s stance. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: his trained management of sound leads to specific tactics (slowing, signaling, guiding her attention) that reweight the central premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, and while the cost is understated, it’s legible in Mara’s relinquishing of her defensive panic for a new way of relating to silence. Escalation is modest—no hard complication beyond the wind—so structurally this reads as a beautifully shaped vignette rather than a fully maximized arc.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clear and satisfying: Archive discovery → waterfall/orchard → murals → hidden gate → throne decision, with each step motivated. The global drive is causal with a clean closure unit: she reaches the throne and decisively redefines what “claiming” means. Cost is present but conceptual (forgoing power, risking the night quest), not dramatically dramatized. Structure is linear and coherent but could use one more sharpened beat of pressure before or at the throne to feel fully inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: thinning threshold → encroaching grief → rattling ring → Mara’s choice to open and use her scars → Lio’s release and the reinforced boundary. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she keeps her sanctuary but changes her stance on what cutting contact can mean, with a visible before/after in her behavior toward Lio. The scene holds as one continuous, pressured window without orientation issues. The rescue mechanics work lyrically but border on tidy—Lio’s salvation feels slightly low-friction given the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: bank’s diamond demand → quantum texts → bolt-and-drum device → Mara’s personal sacrifice → communal confessions producing enough diamonds. The story obeys its own rules for the “concepts made physical” world and builds to a closure where the farm’s survival and Mara’s moral stance both shift. The glitchy texts are a bit convenient but are established early as a rule of the world, so they feel like premise rather than deus ex machina. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of Mara’s life with pressure, not a tidy fix-it.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: curiosity → crank → hidden gramophone → dust pattern → hollow book → ledger and wax strip → confession → abdication and reallocation of funds. Closure lands as a decisive change with real consequences, and the story stays in a single, well-oriented scene. The only slight weakness is that several key steps depend on near-mystical intuition and an elegantly convenient room mechanism, which softens the sense of arduous discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece follows a clear accumulative arc: guarding/observing → discovery of the program → passage through the leaded-glass door → marionette and unsnapping ritual → revelation of the compass and vow. Each step causally unlocks the next while also deepening the core pressure between observation and participation, culminating in a decisive change when he promises to escort the compass “beyond the greenhouse, into dawn.” Closure is strong: the before/after in his allegiance and trajectory is legible and carries conceptual and emotional cost. A fractional shortfall from top band comes from the stakes remaining largely internal, with no external test or counterforce on the page to further tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: Josie’s request → the odd blank page → dust map → hidden bundle → letters → present-day meeting. The story maintains a single, coherent drive (uncovering why the file ends in blankness) and resolves it with both factual and emotional closure. The closure beat—Mara and Josie at the table with the button and the reframed understanding of Lottie—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt cost. Structure is conventional but very sound, with no orientation or lens ambiguity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: failed rendezvous → booth → ledger revelation → flaw in revisions → decision to hit the press → plate swap → dispersal of pages. Closure lands via a decisive change in plan and tactic, with a concrete action that will materially disrupt the Ministry’s narrative. Some elements feel slightly convenient or summary-resolved (the ledger flaw and the press truck’s vulnerability are told rather than discovered under friction). Still, the drive lens holds and the before/after in options is legible with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → descent → preparation → dewdrop-clock climax → hush and aftermath, with no orientation debt. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a causal spine: his whispers gradually disrupt the code’s pattern until the last dewdrop is converted into “pure blankness.” Closure is solidly on-page: the world-state shifts (town no longer under prophecy), and the conceptual/human cost (erasure of his mother’s lingering voice; his solitary listening at the end) is legible. The only limiter against even higher territory is that the mother’s past choice and the prophecy’s world-scale implications stay largely conceptual rather than being tested in a live dilemma on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is very tight: the anomalous leaf → moonstone dust → DESCEND warning → monuments and further leaf-reading → “UNDO THE LATCH” → vault revelation → public reading → LIFT and stabilization. Closure is decisively on the page and twofold: Veyroot’s literal fall is averted, and the social order reorients from theft to shared memory with visible conceptual cost (“swallowing the names of the ground below” must now be publicly owned). Structure is compressed but legible, with no orientation or lens ambiguity. The only slight compression is how quickly the elders accept and read the bark-book, but within this length it still reads earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: harbor fire → admiral’s request → recurring midnight chimes and feathers → conservatory investigation → tunnel/waterfall → discovery of the compass rose → confrontation and bargain with Corin. The drive lens reads primarily as Causal with a thematic overlay, and closure lands in the explicit bargain and the altered behavior of the clocks at the end. The conceptual cost—abandoning the comfort of certainty for probabilistic thinking—is clear, though it remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized. All set-ups (feather, chimes, burned map) pay off; no major teleports or plot amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causality is tight: Orin’s disappearance → Mara’s obligation via the coin → alchemical test → discovery of Orin’s name in the water → decision to seek “smaller redemption” → coin revealing Ellis → confrontation → retrieval of the body and sealing it. The drive lens reads as Causal throughout, with each step a because/therefore escalation rather than and-then. Closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara has altered her relation to names and to her own past thefts, and Orin’s fate moves from uncertainty to honored, costly certainty. There are no orientation or rule-breaking slips; the world’s constraints (no resurrection, names as reagents) remain consistent and govern tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: hired purpose → trek into the gorge → harp as mechanism to access confession → following the sound to Elowen → extracting the final, darkest admission → partial release and escort out. The drive lens is primarily causal with an accumulative emotional overlay, and the closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration when Elowen’s invisible bundle dissolves and Mara feels her “own grief laugh softly.” Stakes and rules (harp, echo, confession) stay consistent and are all paid off. The only limitation is that the resolution feels slightly smooth for the depth of guilt invoked, leaving a small sense of underexplored aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: wake → orient to forest and strap → recall tribunal and bargain → decode forest → conceptualize mercy → depart with an internalized map. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, with trauma-responses and proprioception providing a plausible internal logic for “reading” the archive. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the function of mercy is redefined with visible personal cost (relived torture, embodied map). The one limitation is that the climactic decoding leans abstract, with little concrete resistance or jeopardy at that peak beyond continued endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: childhood seed → present return → discovery via paintings → descent through hatch → lens union and name-recitation, all under one POV and a clear causal chain. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing/RR: the world is reconfigured by the names being spoken into “street corners and school lessons,” with the seam held open. Stakes escalate modestly via the darkening shard and the need to keep the seam open long enough to hear the names. Cost is mainly conceptual/emotional; there’s no serious risk or failure mode on the page, but the arc is tight and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece tracks cleanly as a single causal scene with a strong accumulative texture: dust → ghosts → ceiling void → barrel → mechanism → partial release → sealing the leak. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the elevator is quieted, the crack will be sealed, and the ghosts’ watch is effectively over while his burden continues in altered form. Stakes are modest but coherent (set the elevator and the dead to rest / close the breach between eras), and each step follows plausibly from the last. The only limit is that the sense of risk or “what happens if he fails” remains oblique rather than concretely pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: spiral frost → awareness that contracts are slipping → deciphered “demand for a rupture” → deliberate misuse of the press → systemic reconfiguration and frozen moment with Mara. The story teaches its rules (negotiable reality via printed agreements) economically and keeps them consistent through the climax. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: the catalog’s orderly perfection is broken in exchange for an irrevocable, compressed eternity. The only limitation is that some consequences (for Lio, for the world) stay conceptually implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine is clean: shard → meeting → storm/futures → map revelation → joint decision → exhibition, with each beat tightening options. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and decisive change: they refuse both factions’ binary narratives and choose a risky, ambiguous public act. Cost is legible in the risk of both sides weaponizing or rejecting their compromise and in Len’s renunciation of pure revolutionary certainty. Structure is linear and coherent; one could argue for a slightly clearer on-page sense of concrete consequences beyond changed arguing in the plaza.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: light is stolen → Ivo must enter the forbidden chamber with a token → confrontation and bargain → repair and release of light, with closure on-page. The global drive is Causal with a strong conceptual accent, and the ending offers a Decisive Change (city’s light restored; Thief re-aligned) with a conceptual cost (binding to truth, accepting decay). The main weakness is that the ordeal never genuinely threatens to fail—no complicating reversal or near-miss tests the plan. Still, structure is tight and appropriate for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a clean causal line from factory shutdown → decision to investigate cliffs → cave descent → lagoon revelation, with psychometry sequences integrated as motivated visions rather than arbitrary flashbacks. Orientation is solid early: we quickly know who Mara is, where we are (post-factory town → limestone cliffs), and the temporal premise. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the revelation about the factory’s planned site and Mara’s choice to leave the compass and offer petrichor reweight the premise with conceptual cost (owning vs revering hush, certainty vs doubt). The only structural softness is that external stakes remain low and there is no major mid-story reversal, just a steady deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: GPS failure → coastal wayfinding → archway shelter → lantern activation → time-bridge collaboration → sculptures as plan → townspeople follow signs and avert disaster. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal events with accumulative symbolic weight), and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing where alliances across time reframe what “repair” means. Cost is present but mostly conceptual/emotional—we never feel the wall nearly failing on-page—which trims a bit of urgency. Still, the before/after is legible and satisfying: Mara moves from lost individual to nodal ally whose actions materially alter the town’s options.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: postcards → cathedral job → observation of night-blooming stock → deciphering the etched window → reinterpreting the mother’s question and travels → returning to paint the new mural panel. The structure uses a clean seasonal arc (autumn pavilion, winter cathedral, spring return) with a single major turn in the transept window scene and a resonant closure image. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Lina’s understanding of “why the flowers bloom at night” and of her mother’s life is permanently reweighted, with grief and solace intertwined. No key setup is dropped, and there are no orientation or motivation gaps that undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain from courthouse letters → zeppelin decoding → retrocognitive pull → physical journey → parley → retrieval is clean and propulsive for such a short piece. The drive lens feels primarily causal with a situational overlay, and the closure (tin box surfacing after the bargain) lands as a Decisive Change with a conceptual cost. The story maintains one dominant stake—recovering the diary without harming the living—and resolves it with an earned compromise. A touch more on what concrete dangers await if the diary is mishandled would deepen the felt cost of the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: devastated wish-town → Sen arrives with bottle and ethic → coin-triggered plan → soap/lantern work → families return → bottle’s true nature realized → civic charter and symbolic placement of the bottle. Time jumps (three mornings, by the week, by the month of new tides) are efficient and don’t blur orientation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s “economy of miracles” is reweighted into an ethic of making, with the bottle’s non-opening reframed as integral rather than frustrating. The only soft spot is that conflict peaks more conceptually than in a discrete scene of confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery → private listening in the orchard → realization of prophetic content → recognition of a loophole → public warning that alters the outcome. The grid-failure event is summarized rather than dramatized, but the because/therefore logic remains intact under a hybrid causal/textural lens. Closure lands as a decisive change (he acts to avert catastrophe) plus a conceptual repricing of what “records” can do. The emotional cost—his permanent unease and lack of admissible evidence—is clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: sorting seeds → spiral activation → corridor/revelation → tactical response in the atrium → seed/ice closure → hatchling return, all under one coherent drive. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Lio reinterprets the inheritance as a loan with ongoing cost and reorients his life’s work accordingly. Stakes around time theft and repayment are made legible with the rule “reopen the spiral only when you can bear to feel what you did not earn,” and that rule is honored at the end. Structure is single-scene with one interior excursion (the corridor) that’s fully anchored; there are no orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly causal: storm prediction → inspection/repair → institutional demand for a full test at zero hour → Maris’s technical workaround → her decisive act. The time pressure of midnight and the glue curing provides a simple but effective spine, culminating in an on-page Decisive Change (switching to the vane) that reconfigures the stakes from compliance to sane warning. Closure is solid: the storm arrives, the vane performs, the Office is answered with data, and the bell’s final, non-alarm ring marks an after-state. No orientation or lens-clarity problems; it runs as a tight causal/situational hybrid with causal dominant at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: solitary maintenance → meteor-tracing → anomalous convergence → dawn exploration and logbook → communal reopening of the dome. Causality is sound and legible while the piece also functions texturally, and the closure—Lio reconfiguring the station and his grief into a shared practice—lands with clear cost and before/after. There are no orientation issues, and every major setup (glass shard, tracing method, station’s half-abandonment) sees meaningful payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: life with ghosts → arrival of Mara → recognition that the covenant has become a tangle → decision to read the slips aloud. Each step follows organically, with the ghosts’ clustering around the box and Mara’s specific gesture at the hive tightening pressure. Closure lands squarely on her active choice to untie the covenant by reading, culminating in Mara’s slip (“I forgive you for surviving”) and the felt afterstate of an oasis that “could be tended again.” The cost—relinquishing her hoarded words and accepting absolution she didn’t ask for—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: Eli’s borrowed year and the failed numerals set up the problem; the garage sale message incites the journey; the trade at the capsule produces a concrete transformation and a new ongoing role. Causality is strong and legible under an accumulative/textural lens (“because” rather than “and then”), and the closure—his transition from terminal countdown to timeless keeper—is a clear before/after with cost. The world’s rule-shift (numbers going soft) is integrated through action (tags instead of prices, stories instead of coordinates), not dumped. The only limit is that external stakes remain relatively low-temperature—there’s no major structural surprise or hard dilemma at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: the storm and kite snap lead to the string and feather, which lead Rian into the dispute over the net, then to the child’s loss, and finally to the wounded drake and the poem’s completion. Structure is linear and legible, with each beat reusing earlier elements rather than introducing new ones late. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his philosophy is tested across human and nonhuman breaks and crystallized in the final juxtaposition of drake, returned feather, and “Woven Dawns.” Cost is present though quiet—time, care, relinquishing the feather—and clearly felt in that last image.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: diagnosis → recognition of the pillars’ script → remodeling → communal gathering → her lying down, with each step causally and thematically linked. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—discovering the seed pods and nursery function redefines the temple and her life’s work as part of a larger, ongoing system. The illness clock shapes the arc but remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through escalating constraints. Still, the story lands a coherent before/after: from humans interrupting the temple to humans entering the script as just one species among many.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: signal → assignment → relic → footprints → crystals → bronze door → chamber → shard theft → altered report. The piece lands a solid Conceptual Repricing closure: “homecoming” is redefined as a biochemical convergence that can be hacked. Stakes remain conceptual rather than materially dangerous, but the before/after in knowledge and stance is unmistakable. Structure holds as a single coherent scene with escalation rather than a tour.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: one continuous ritual sequence on the jetty that builds methodically from arrival, through negotiation, to partial renewal. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/ritual lens: listening to birds → addressing the dead in dead languages → mixing specific soils/ashes → perceptible response and reconfiguration of the concord in soil. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive victory, with a clear before/after: from broken sea-oath to a charged, tentative land-oath. Stakes and costs are conceptual rather than dramatized as immediate jeopardy, which keeps this excellent but just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal line is clean: Sera’s disappearance → riddle/locket → cylinder decoding → revelation of betrayal and plan → journey to relay → broadcast and confrontation. Orientation is strong from the opening image of the cracked wasteland and scrapyard settlement through to the relay station, with no spatial or temporal confusion. Closure lands as a decisive change: the council’s secret is broadcast and the wasteland’s power dynamics begin to reconfigure, with real implied cost to Lio, Sera, and the settlement. The main weakness is that the physical rescue and confrontation resolve a bit quickly and smoothly given the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story is tightly structured as one continuous causal sequence: return → observation/sketching → discovery of the true north discrepancy → decision to exit toward it. Closure lands as a decisive change—walking away from the station with a new understanding of self and purpose—with an emotional cost of isolation. The drive lens reads as largely accumulative/textural but with clean causal links between realizations and actions. Stakes remain introspective rather than materially pressing, which keeps the arc strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: vow → infiltration via chivalry → chess-cipher to locate Serren → rooftop confrontation with the “key in the sky” → leap that unlocks the sundial and enables escape. The closure beat (stepping into the sky-map corridors to “steal tomorrow”) is a decisive change that reconfigures options with conceptual and physical risk. Setups like the sundial’s condition and “key in the sky” pay off elegantly without retroactive hand-waving. The only minor limitation is that resistance after the chapel beat is mostly environmental and implied Skywright pursuit, making the final escape feel slightly less embattled than it might.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean and strong: hired as crisis actor → overhearing in the gallery → the “Unbind the archive” message → walking-spell to open the latch → theft and concealment of testimonies → imprisonment → broadsheets changing the city’s course. Closure lands both in plot (lawful succession pressure replaces bloodlust; the council frees the narrator) and concept (history of gestures vs. official lies), with cost shown through the arrest and risk. The inferred drive lens is causal with lyric accumulation, and it holds without contradiction. The only minor limit is that the council’s decision appears slightly off-stage, though it follows plausibly from the broadsheets.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is cleanly causal under a lyric surface: need → ascent to bookstore → seer’s terms → feather test → seeding the stone → path out. Closure is a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration: the narrator trades protective forgetting for a painful, truer home-path, and the mountain releases them. The nightly substitution rule and the naming talent both pay off in the late race through the shifting aisles, so set-up is honored. Cost is legible on the page in the act of reliving the “raw moment” with the mother and the explicit risk of being stranded in “kinder lies” if they fail.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: tapestry → decoding moves → labyrinth navigation → gate choice → release of time, all anchored in a single continuous situation with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she chooses “return” and metaphorically offers a draw to her past, paying an emotional cost. The structure balances puzzle and interiority without losing drive. Slightly more on-page resistance or complication in solving the maze could sharpen the sense of jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is strong: banishment → return before ritual → dissemination of fractured accusation → dawn confrontation → sacrifice and consequence. The canyon’s rules (price for listening) are introduced early and paid off cleanly, with her strategy of spreading the name through poetry driving the main turn rather than coincidence. Time progression from night to dawn is clear and supports a coherent, continuous scene. The closure—a Decisive Change plus conceptual repricing around truth and art—lands firmly on the page with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Plot and structure are strong: the sinking workshop and softening pontoons provide a clear throughline from initial threat to solution to stabilized ending. The causal chain—brew draught, descend to Lung, map pockmarks to scars, receive memory/design, repair pontoons—is legible and satisfying. Closure is both physical (the workshop steadies) and internal (she explicitly forgives her brother and herself), with a tangible cost in relived trauma. The main limitation is that the discovery of the repair method through the statue-oracle leans slightly on pre-established magic rather than introducing a new, testing complication once she has the idea.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: mirror crack → urgency to fulfill the old promise → wrong turn into caves → discovery of oasis → choice about how to leave the shell → return with a new stance. Closure lands as a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: he both completes the ritual and alters his future behavior (“ready to paint arrivals”). The cost—relinquishing the shell as an anchor and his self-protective distance—is legible on the page. Structure is straightforward and well-contained in one continuous arc with backstory woven efficiently into present action.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: explanation of the cork and its rules, the night ritual as test, then Jonas’s response and the morning reconciliation. Causality holds under an accumulative/lyric lens: each step (cork → intention purification → tuned tower → felt tremor → Jonas’s off-stage receipt) builds toward the closure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration of the relationship and the “volume” belief, with Jonas altering stance and the pair tending the light together as promise rather than weapon. The magic’s mechanics stay slightly impressionistic but not enough to undermine coherence at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is tight and legible: hydraulics fail → calls begin → censer’s behavior decoded → routes re-mapped → journey to aqueduct → reunion and reframing of the device as promise. Causality is clean under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens; each midnight call concretely alters the map and the narrator’s tactics. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator’s role, the censer, and the station all reprice from mechanical guidance to a fragile, human promise, with the emotional cost of accumulated losses intact. No orientation or lens-clarity issues undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: empathy-virus world → Mara’s role and limitation → arrival of the smuggled eye → experiment and adoption → external intrusion by the Ministry → tactical deception and burial. The piece maintains a single coherent drive and POV with no orientation debt, and the storm-season worsening plus Ministry arrival provide a clear tightening. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara chooses secrecy over absolute honesty to protect the orchard, with cost implied to her identity and ethics. The only minor limitation is that the Ministry threat resolves a bit quickly for the weight it carries, skimming the edge of convenience without quite tipping over.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is tight: arrival of the drowned man → discovery of the boutonniere → memory-fragment method → deduction at the unmarred piling → retrieval of the packet → naming and archival in the logbook, culminating in the narrator’s reframed understanding of Eamon. Causality is clean and accumulative, with each clue meaningfully following from the previous one under Eamon’s “observe the gaps” method. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final realization about Eamon’s isolation and role as custodian of absences clearly reweights everything prior and carries a felt cost. There are no orientation issues or unkept setups; all introduced elements are either paid off or thematically harmonized.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean and motivated: chip → coordinates → hike as creek rises → sinkhole → cavern → slab → Ellis → binary passages → choice. The story stays within a single POV and essentially one unfolding expedition scene, with backstory kept to short, anchored insertions. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: she chooses the wet passage that erases the way back and reframes the “doorway of decisions” as the act of stepping through. The only structural weakness is that Ellis and the press arrive late and somewhat compressed, making his long vigil and the father’s theory feel slightly underdeveloped relative to their importance.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: warning → decision to climb → ritual → offer → descent and cauterization, with each step clearly motivated by Maelin’s goal and the Star-Priest’s threat. Closure is decisive and on-page: she literally enters the fissure, gathers the bleeding starlight, and closes the wound, foreclosing the path of ruling by stolen stars. Cost is present, though mostly conceptual—she “loses the throne” is stated as an understood bargain, not dramatized in consequence. Structure (brief pre-journey compression, then continuous grotto scene) is tight and coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scene is cleanly structured: arrival with purpose, mid-scene revelation about the Academy’s demand, decision, and then the executed protest as closure. Causality is tight under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: Toma’s warning prompts Lio’s revaluation, which directly leads to the changed method of releasing the suns. Closure lands clearly with “We will be our own measure” and the constellation over the nexus, a Conceptual Repricing that carries implied institutional and personal cost. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the external fallout remains off-stage and entirely prospective, muting the sense of immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: cabin → lucid dream loops around the grave → visual of threaded time → return to writing with altered stance. Nonlinear dream logic still maintains a coherent because/therefore chain (seeing grave → temporal leakage → lucid exploration → reframed relationship to his own timeline). Closure is strong: choosing authorship over becoming a rumor is a resonant reconfiguration with emotional and conceptual cost. The “grave punctured the calendar” insight neatly retrofits the temporal confusion without feeling like a patch.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is cleanly causal: the mailed screw and note lead to Iris’s diagnosis of hidden fear, her decision to intervene in person, and the on-page reconfiguration of the birth-room dynamic. Orientation is impeccable from the first lines—who, where, and when are clear, and the move from shop to birthing house is fluid. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Iris confirms on the page that her new way of perceiving can still “unveil ordinary miracles,” with the water clock sound tying back to the opening. The cost—living without smell and without her former identity—is present but felt more conceptually than viscerally at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight: past failed circles → current ritual risk → requirement to stabilize the platform in one held-breath beat. The flashback is cleanly cued by sensory detail (mineral scent) and directly informs the present tactic (revisiting and extending the superstition with a fourth circle). Closure lands on-page with cost as she chooses to give the storm a “mouth” and then openly writes her trauma on her own skin. The before/after is legible and consequential: from superstition failing her to a deliberate, costly integration of storm and scars into craft.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation, drive, and stakes are clear early: Marin comes to the archive before the orchard is cut to perform an apology-based ritual. The causal chain (wiring shelves → induced currents → ghostly response → fuse popping → decision to write the correction) is coherent and accumulative. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she cannot undo the harm but redefines what can be saved and at what cost. Escalation is modest rather than wrenching, but on this length it’s sufficient and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: arrival at the library → descent into the well → engagement with mirrors/spiral → re-emergence and re-entry into the corridor of time, all under a single POV. Causality under an accumulative/situational lens holds: the universe’s hiccup leads to the corridor, which leads to the library, which forces confrontation with illusions and culminates in unification and renewed duty. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing—reality is not broken but revealed as seamed—and this decisively reconfigures the narrator’s options and obligations. The main constraint is that the “hiccup” and time-corridor remain more premise than live clock, so pressure feels steadily contemplative rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is clear and causal: missed supply boat → hydraulic lag → ice → late sunrise sighting → inspector confrontation → shared reset with mantle clock left wrong. The global drive reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative thematic layering), and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration around what clocks measure and what accuracy is for. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatic—the institution regains its measurement while a deliberate inaccuracy is preserved—but it’s on-page and coherent. A small escalation gap is that institutional consequences for the missed signal remain abstract, which slightly mutes the sense of risk at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is clean: noticing the pattern → building and using the two-pulse system → observing the auditors’ behavior → confrontation → choice to leak data. Closure lands via a decisive change (sending logs) and conceptual repricing of “barriers” and “loyalty,” with a legible cost implied in defying her bosses. The structure holds as a single pressured window leading to that act, with no serious orientation issues. Stakes could be made slightly more concrete on the page (e.g., explicit professional or legal consequences), which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality is tight: heart attack → request → library note/map → subway traversal via seat-scrawls → envelope with call numbers → archival proofs → hospital-line scrawl → exhibit and bedside conversation. The structure is a clean quest that resolves into conceptual repricing/earned stasis rather than a conventional decision, but the before/after is clear and scaled appropriately. Cost is legible in her having to face her father’s double life and assume responsibility for transforming it into pedagogy rather than inheritance. No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the mosaic of travel, library, and hospital line remains unified under her drive.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean: established routine → purposeful wrong-number caller → resurfaced guilt about Lena → decision to violate the operator rule and call her. The structure stays within one continuous scene with integrated reflection that always tilts the present, and the 2:17 call is an effective tightening fulcrum. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change (Mara reopens the relationship) plus a Resonant Reconfiguration of estrangement-as-bridge, with cost legible in her risk and vulnerability. Nothing important is left structurally dangling, and the pattern of opening/closing notes pays off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight: finding the locket forces a re-evaluation of Jun’s death, which compels Mara to rewrite the covenant, confront the authorities, and alter the public ceremony. Closure lands both as Decisive Change (the new covenant spoken and signed, the old page torn out) and Conceptual Repricing (the town’s relationship to the sea reframed around admitted appetite and small losses). Cost is on-page: the council’s shaken composure, public confession of guilt, and the irreversible destruction of the earlier “accident” record. Structure is cleanly single-arc with a legible midpoint turn (the locket discovery) and no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean: rumor → meeting Mara → acquisition and explanation of the rock → chain of kindnesses → return of the rock and walk home, with a clear before/after. Causality under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds: the reciprocity rule drives the kindness chain, which in turn reconfigures the station into a community and the narrator’s stance. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a hard plot turn, but the cost (giving the rock back, accepting ongoing mutual dependence) is on the page. The only mild weakness is that external obstacles are light; everything unfolds somewhat smoothly once Mara appears, which keeps pressure more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative quest: market → forest entry → deepening search → observatory stone → stillpoint pool → return, with each step causally or texturally linked. Orientation is strong from the outset (blind mapmaker, vellum, market, astronomer) and the hidden stillpoint drive is clear. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the stillpoint is redefined from refuge to a place where feeling can be held without drowning, with visible emotional cost in facing her brother’s panic. A slight softness is that external obstacles are minimal, so tension relies almost entirely on lyric escalation rather than concrete complications.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: past seed error → reassignment → established revision method → anomaly’s tightening and new signal → discovery of the bent nib → realization about the courier → specific historical edit. Closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: she alters history in a targeted way and reconceives the signals as invitations, not warnings, with visible ethical and ontological cost. The structure holds as a single continuous scene with interleaved reflection that always re-anchors in present stimuli. Nothing important is resolved by coincidence; each turn follows from established rules and character logic.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative arc: arrival with empty camera → guided “mapping” of silences → foghorn failure as an acute intensification → musical performance as payoff. Causality is tight under a textural lens: each step in the mapping project leads naturally to the next, and the foghorn’s failure is a clear pattern break that forces accelerated action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: by the end, silence has been concretely converted into shared sound, and the narrator’s relation to forgetting and proof has changed with felt cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early and never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: art trail → ridge seam → archive → code/message → reel → decision to burn systems, not books, via broadcast. The piece maintains a single clear drive—fulfilling the promise to Miko by re-aiming her fire—and closure lands as a decisive change with visible cost (abandoning her prior tactics and exposing herself publicly). Transitions (into the archive, then out to the tower) are brisk but legible and appropriate to the scope. Nothing crucial is solved by coincidence or off-stage fiat; each revelation stems from prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is clean: entry into the garden, drug administration, shared vision reaching overload, institutional alarm, and a coda of altered aftermath. Causality is legible under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens—each new sound/memory layer escalates entanglement and risk, culminating in alarms and their refusal to disengage. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they leave with proof and a shared ethical stance about memory, then the narrator’s return reframes the garden as a chosen ritual rather than a clinical site. Stakes and cost (overload danger, loss of privacy, deepened grief) are present and earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine is tight: storm disrupts systems → unauthorized runner triggers test → challenge raises stakes → successful whisper proves the system → unexpected crane slip forces real-world application of her method → institutional change via the signed reroute. The piece maintains a single coherent situation and escalates without detours or amnesia. Closure lands clearly with Len’s signature and Mara’s sense that the maze now “listens” to her methods, a Decisive Change plus resonant reconfiguration. If anything, the test’s success is a touch smooth—no serious doubt that the whisper will carry—but this doesn’t undercut the structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under a causal lens, the chain from her arrival → mirror/star lattice → discovery of the body → summoning patrol is tight and legible. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from withholding to full confession, with real cost implied (legal/social consequences, living with what she’s done). Every major beat arises as a “because/therefore” from the prior one, and the mirror/star mechanic is set up before it becomes crucial. Structure is cleanly one scene with steady forward motion and no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: he learns of the impending vote, devises the window-board scheme, executes it via the grotto timing, which in turn precipitates the mayor’s change of stance and the council’s decision. Structure is linear with one night-to-dawn arc and no orientation debt; the drive lens (primarily causal with some accumulative texture) holds throughout. Closure lands clearly with a Decisive Change—the grove is kept—paired with a modest but real reconfiguration of civic possibilities. The only limitation is that the resistance never poses a strong counter-move on the page, so the outcome feels a touch easy.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: pirate’s gift → Rusk confrontation → decision to free the island → collaborative unchaining → narrator’s own departure. The Accord’s rules, the scrimshaw’s function, and the island’s behavior all integrate logically and drive action rather than serving as loose concept. Closure lands strongly through a decisive change and resonant reconfiguration for both Rusk and the narrator, with visible costs. The only ceiling constraint is that the escalation remains relatively smooth and expected once the scrimshaw’s purpose is revealed, without a major structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: posting the notice → Orin’s arrival and methods → confession and shared ritual → re-siting the bouquet and inner reconfiguration. Structure is linear and coherent, with a clear before/after anchored in the bouquet’s relocation and the final realization about grief and lightness. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change, but the cost—accepting that no comfort surge will come—is plain. Escalation is quiet and almost too smooth; no serious beat misfires, but pressure never tightens beyond mild resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: entry after the ban, negotiation with guards/Soren, experimentation with the pillars, and a final crossing, all in one continuous, legible scene. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is strong—each act of paraphrasing intensifies the colonnade’s response, leading naturally to mist, dissolution, and the shadow figure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the sacred border is functionally undone and Lira accepts the cost by walking into air. The only limitation is that the price of this crossing (death, liminality, exile?) is left conceptually rather than concretely specified, muting the final beat’s bite slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is tight: Mara wants the reed tongue, Joren demands awakenings, her escalating offers and tactics lead to a reconfigured bargain and a clear before/after in how awakenings are valued. Causality is clean—each move (plant messages, portrait, spiral) is a direct response to Joren’s last refusal or confession. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he opens the pouch, shares an awakening instead of hoarding or trading it, and accepts a new constraint on his behavior. The brief exposition on the awakening economy is slightly blocky but doesn’t harm orientation or the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clear: Mara arrives with the lens and a problem, they experiment, redesign the pilgrimage, council pressure rises, and the press walk forces a choice that reconfigures the project. The decision to play the unpolished archive to the press is a clean closure beat with conceptual and social cost (Mara’s deceit exposed; officials publicly challenged). The piece holds a Hybrid/accumulative lens: each experiment and design tweak thickens the stakes around authenticity until the final reweighting at the chamber. All major set-ups (lens, bells, archive, pilgrimage) pay off without dangling threads.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is tight: rock bottom → offered method → test case with Lysa and basil → charged success → widening pattern of birds and arrivals, all causally linked. The drive lens reads as Accumulative with a clear causal spine, and closure lands on Mara’s reconfigured role as a steward of the observatory’s light. The cost—living in ongoing grief while choosing responsibility over oblivion—is legible in the final images of her husband imagined beside her and her vigilance about “not spilling into harm.” There are no dangling setups or orientation issues; the observatory’s rules hold.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: arrival at the loft, revelation of the inheritance, deciphering the code, a field excursion applying the method, and a return with a reweighted understanding. Causality is coherent (grandmother’s will → Aurel’s promise → decoding → city walk → new map and vow), and the accumulative drive lens (pattern-building) holds to closure. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the inheritance reframes from “research” to a living civic practice with obligations and cost. The only limit is that escalation of stakes remains relatively gentle and conceptual rather than sharply constraining options.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine: curiosity → theft of the key → activation of the pagoda with a pattern-avoidant method → revelation of Keth’s self-weaponized memory → retrieval of the formula and a changed stance toward teaching. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: purification is redefined from erasure to a way of holding memory without being ruled by nostalgia, and she reorients her life’s work accordingly. Stakes escalate from personal risk (defying elders, emotional destabilization) to civilizational legacy and the ethics of memory. A hairline limitation is that the city’s future consequences remain offstage, keeping the ending more conceptual than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: damaged dreams → noticing the dusk shadow → investigation via archival footage → revelation about abandoned stones → confrontation and transformation in the conservatory → institutional change. Closure is strong, with a decisive on-page reconfiguration (reinstating the rite, giving the shadow a stone and a role) that clearly creates a before/after. The piece leans slightly toward summary in the investigatory middle, softening moment-to-moment pressure and making the solution feel almost too frictionless. Still, for its length, the structure holds under a primarily causal lens with a satisfying, thematically charged ending.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of con → night in the workshop → lists → call → decision to report and help → sanctuary and public statement, with each beat logically motivated. The story maintains a single, coherent drive—how Mara will respond ethically to the fraud—and lands clear closure when she acts in line with her redefined principles. The sanctuary run is a brief summary but feels like a necessary finalization rather than an elision of drama. The before/after is legible and costly: she moves from stunned complicity to a new, self-demanding mode of action.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean and strong under a Causal lens: wake → plant-telepathy revelation → decision to move the miracle → tunneling → rooftop release → street restoration → re-read scar. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: the miracle is relocated, the neighborhood’s condition perceptibly shifts, and her wound becomes “legible” rather than simply healed. Stakes stay tightly focused on whether she can transform rupture into meaning by returning what was displaced. No major setup is dropped; the only mild limitation is that external resistance is minimal, but internal and physical constraints carry enough pressure at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is clean: arrive at booth → incubate/handle strip → psychometry vision that reveals Eli/Lena and the looping lyric → realization about unused love → ritual projection and reading → relabeled can and exit. Causality is soft but coherent under the textural lens: each concrete interaction with the film pushes her from passive reader to active finisher of an “unfinished ritual.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes unused love as residing in unfinished acts and alters the fate of this specific strip by writing “deliver.” The cost is mainly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatic, which keeps this just shy of top-tier for a prestige market.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: famine of inspiration → suspicion of siphoned stardust → method of resting and tracing meteors → map/spiral → vault opening and city’s release. The accumulative nights of observation and marks on birch bark build toward a clear closure beat where the vault unlocks and the dust returns, providing a legible before/after. The elders’ role as antagonistic force is mostly conveyed through inferred confession and stored relics rather than direct pressure, which softens the sense of risk. Still, the structure holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens with a satisfying, on-page reconfiguration at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure tracks cleanly from arrival at Mile Zero, to triggering the archive via the clock, to exploring divergences, to the auditors’ attempt to collapse the archive and the guard’s resistance. Causality is legible under an accumulative/textural lens: each deeper engagement with the archive sets up the final confrontation and the concept of “holding midnight open.” Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the auditors back off and the guard remains bound to ceaseless, fractured vigilance. The cost is present but felt more conceptually than viscerally, keeping this just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/mosaic structure is clean: translocation episodes build a pattern of confronting unnamed fears, which then motivates the targeted search for the “hinge” and culminates in the cathedral. The causal logic is internally consistent under the story’s rules—the sixth sense and wind-guidance generate the on-page decisions that bring the narrator to their hinge. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the core life-argument is explicitly revised and the sixth sense is redefined as a “frontier-sense,” with the forest recast as a map they become in sleep. A minor weakness is that some transitional beats (“By the fourth translocation I understood the pattern…”) are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly smoothing over potential intermediate frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: leash breaks → failed chase → encounter with guides → indirect ascent and vigil → sign (yelp) → hazardous descent → rescue → altered return. Closure is strong: rescuing the dog and reconfiguring her relationship to “what breaks” constitutes a clear before/after with cost. The single-night, single-POV structure is coherent, with the vigil as an effective mid-story hinge. The only thing holding it just below the absolute top band is that the outcome feels slightly fated once the guides appear, with little real doubt of success.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: rule of silence → Edda’s need to speak → missing bolt → secret stair → revelation of surveillance → deliberate rule-breaking with ‘C’ and the concealment under the piano. The hidden engineers and REMAIN system concretize the abstract stakes and make the fortress rules feel non-arbitrary. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator adopts a new stance toward silence in a single charged scene with visible risk. The only slight limit is how quickly and conveniently the secret door yields such a large revelation for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal line from entering the library to exposing the pretender is clear and satisfying, with each magical step (ink pellet → rune of drift → cryptic notes → mosaic star) paying off something set up earlier. The drive lens is primarily causal with a strong textural overlay from the library’s shifting time and shelves, and closure lands firmly when the false sky is sundered and the usurper is unmasked with concrete proof. The library’s graceful collapse provides a tangible cost that reconfigures the premise of truth-as-archive. The one limitation is that obstacles resolve smoothly; there’s little sense he might fail at any point once the pattern is established.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine is clean: curiosity about vanishing routes → pattern noticed in beacons → timed expedition → encounter and revelation → altered reporting practice. Closure lands as a conceptual and ethical shift—she moves from trying to expose the disappearance to participating in a selective concealment—with a discernible cost. The hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds throughout, with the lunar cycle and periodic beacons cohering the structure. A hint more on what she concretely risks (professionally or personally) by hiding information would sharpen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is cleanly causal: discovery of the circle → realization the hum matches star intervals → deduction of coordinates → decision to use the hum as a covert channel → sending the “reignite” message → receiving a reply just as another presence arrives. Orientation (who/where/when) is swift and solid, and the single-scene window fits the scope. Closure lands as a charged poise: the rebellion’s lull has been breached, the network has answered, and Ilya has visibly changed her risk posture by not hiding. The cost—potential exposure to the Directorate and a personal end to safety—is implicit rather than dramatized, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: Nara’s past with implanted destiny leads to guarding the relic, the narrator’s plant-telepathy reveals the kite-script, which enables the specific unsealing ritual and the imprinting twist. Orientation is clear early—reconstruction, hot springs village, burned temple—and the piece maintains a coherent throughline to a decisive change (oracle → salamander Rebuilder). Closure carries a conceptual and practical cost: forfeiting the old certainty of oracles in favor of a riskier, co-authored future. The only thing holding this out of the 9-band is that external resistance is largely offstage, so the climax leans more intellectual than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story runs as a tight situational arc: arrival of the research team → drone-triggered panic → negotiation of space and coping → re-encounter of the trigger under new tactics. Causality is clean (her history → job → panic → request to land drone → later recalibration), and the structure steadily tightens around the core stake of whether she can inhabit this place without dissociating. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses continued return with eyes open, marked by the buried photograph and dated labels. The cost—living beside reminders of violence without numbness—is clearly felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: broken reality → retreat to lighthouse → tarot box/key → library threads/visions → descent to lens → weaving/tension release → steadier beam. The structure is essentially single-POV, two-layer scene (library then mechanism) with a clear tightening via the walls closing in and the need to act before the library crushes her. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara’s way of seeing and using her art decisively shifts, and the world’s behavior (beam, walls) reflects that change with conceptual and emotional cost. Hybrid drive (causal with strong textural escalation) is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: eclipse → raid/time-slowing → map/ink clue → portal → obelisk discovery → obelisk destruction → political fallout at camp. The ink mechanics are taught early and then paid off via the corridor and the obelisk, so the speculative rules feel coherent without exposition dumps. Closure lands via a decisive act (shattering the obelisk) plus a conceptual repricing (time-slowing as engineered terror), with an on-page cost in his inability to prove it through ink. Structure is linear with one purposeful transition, maintaining clarity and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: letter arrives → realization it’s bait → decision to use dormant networks → public scandal → Council confrontation and policy shift. Single-scene flow with a brief, credible time jump (“by noon,” “hours later”) maintains orientation while keeping pressure on the core decision. Closure lands via a concrete institutional change (reconnecting consoles) and a redefined role for the archive, with risk and cost still in play. The Council’s rapid pivot to “claiming transparency as his own idea” veers slightly toward convenience, but not enough to break plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: tower falls → new council/bounty → Tarek’s arrival → militia pressure → Tarek’s choice to protect Lio and stay. The story builds in a single, coherent scene under a causal lens and lands an on-page closure where Tarek forecloses the path of easy compliance with violent order. The cost—risking his standing with the council and his profession—is legible but somewhat underplayed, as the militia retreats with minimal resistance. Structural scope (one dominant stake, one major turn when the militia arrives) fits the length well.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: entering the garden → luring the echo → confrontation and sacrifice form a clean arc with clear because/therefore links. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and earned stasis when Rovan abandons his original goal to protect the garden, with the cost legible in “empty hands” and the ache he carries. Orientation is immediate and stable despite the surreal premise, and the drive lens (primarily accumulative with causal underpinnings) holds to the end. One could argue for a slightly steeper escalation curve, but the cadence still resolves with satisfying inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: call → suspicion → journey → logical test → darkroom reveal → ethical bargain, with no serious plot amnesia or contrivance. Closure lands as a Decisive Change and mild Earned Stasis: Celeste forecloses the path of sensational exposure in favor of a constrained, quieter truth. The cost—sacrificing a blockbuster story and accepting a compromise solution—is legible but described more than dramatized in a pressure-cooker scene. A slightly too-smooth acceptance of the bargain by Sato keeps this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: letters → observatory → translator → time fold → sister’s cry → apology and release. Structure fits a single continuous arc with one significant tightening at the lab when the device activates, and closure arrives in a clear before/after of guilt intensity. The laboratory and firmware mythology are efficiently but densely set up without derailing momentum, and the final realization that his heartbeat was the static is a satisfying, legible turn. A slightly more dramatized sense of risk or potential failure at the climax could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: arrival in the grotto → mapping the mood with the mandala → proverb eruption → Inez’s tactical interjection → reconfigured ritual and quiet denouement. Causality is intact and legible, with each move growing from the prior one (the tile’s properties, the hush, and the teacher’s anxiety all pay off at the climax). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: unlearning is reframed from passive erasure to a practice that can be guided, with a visible shift in how the group relates to their forgetting. Stakes stay intimate rather than explosive, but the before/after is clear and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Samir reads the mosaic → finds the tessera → confronts Lina with retrocognition → she discovers her cousin’s role → she’s offered a third path → she brings the cousin for the Grasp and public renaming. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a causal spine and thematic accumulation, and closure is a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: plaza and people are renamed, and the Grasp is enacted with cost. Stakes (what kind of justice will define the post-fire order) stay coherent and culminate on the page. The only reason this doesn’t go higher is that the cousin’s capture and submission are compressed into a brief evening jump, softening moment-to-moment pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clear: Mara’s choice to stay late with the coin leads her into the orchard, to Silas, to the echo ritual, and finally to the stitching of the fractured timeline and his release. The global drive reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative, echoing images), and closure lands cleanly with both the ghost’s departure and the garden stabilizing. The cost is subtle but legible: Mara relinquishes the haunting allure of fracture for a single, steadier era and a reconfigured relationship to her own past. Structural scope is tight and appropriate, with no orientation issues or dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: Static Shock → pill recall → callers → Mara’s test with Jory → discovery of the route → hospital tunnel → citywide protocol and corporate pressure. The structure compresses time but stays coherent, with each development arising from the last rather than coincidence. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: “hidden pathways” shift from literal tunnels to ethical shortcuts “between panic and care,” with the cost visible in Mara’s quiet defiance of the recall company. A slight sense of ease—solutions arrive without real on-page obstruction—holds this just below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: we move from premise and backstory into a tide-caused entrapment, then discovery, realization, and a reconfiguring final act. Causality is strong under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: tide → entrapment → fossil activation → discovery of non-human handprints → reconception of the fossil → choice to leave it. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing and mild Earned Stasis: Mina accepts the caves as a sentient archive and gives up her object to complete that system, with a felt shift in what “mapping” means. The cost is more intellectual/emotional than survival-based, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Lysa’s noticing of “trash” → cataloging buttons → realizing the prophecy is braided → inviting others to speak → collective recognition → confrontation with the foreman → final, redefined prophecy and decision to leave. The piece uses a compressed, accumulative structure, but the beats build coherently toward the on-page Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing at the cliff mouth. Closure lands: the workers’ options and stance toward the warehouse are reconfigured, with implied costs in defying ownership and abandoning their old life. Some phases (the broadening of participation, the logistics of “sell the amber fairly, and leave”) are summarized rather than dramatized, which trims some potential impact but doesn’t break structure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: Rina returns → writes snow codes → draws Tomas → reaches Elsi → repairs the relay → saves villages and redefines her own courage. The story uses a tight single trajectory (cliff to shed to cave and back) with one clear deepening beat (discovery and repair of Elsi and the radio) and an ending that functions as Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration via the pillbox-as-vow. Backstory is interleaved with present action in a way that clearly informs current stakes and choices without stalling momentum. The only light limitation is that the cost of “saved three villages” remains completely offstage, so the macro-stakes are more told than dramatized, keeping this just under the topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Drive lens reads as primarily causal: the palimpsest promise and ticking gutters create a clear chain from arrival to vow to Mara’s return. Orientation is excellent; who/where/when and the rules of the river and time limit are legible early. Closure is solid—a decisive change (Mara restored, Senn’s promise rewritten) plus a resonant reconfiguration of Rowan’s inner stance—though the magical payoff (Mara’s appearance once the vow is spoken) feels a touch easy given the build-up. All major set-ups (clock, promise layers, ambient awareness) pay off cleanly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clean: arrival → perception of anomalies → experiments with light/shadows → meeting Sera and hearing the oasis’s history → realization about stacked timelines → deliberate centering via the lantern in the chimney. Closure is on the page and legible: the oasis chooses a single timeline, the combs finally decay, and the spring clarifies, with the implied cost that other refuges/timelines are foreclosed. The hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds throughout, with each new anomaly and shimmer not only decorating but tightening the conceptual stakes. Nothing crucial teleports or is retroactively patched; setup details (smoke, beekeeping chimney, lantern) all pay off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: broken gauge tooth → Mara’s covert mobility and mirror skills → discovery of the false bitting → truck interception, then a resonant return home. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara reconceives her gardening as practice for a broader, riskier form of “saving,” with the mirrors and rosebush charging the final stance. Stakes scale appropriately for the length—local but concrete—and the price (her stepping into danger, then choosing ongoing vigilance rather than retreat) is legible. There are no orientation or lens issues; the single throughline holds from fire escape to harbor to stairwell.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: library → assignment → stone circle → revelation → return, with each step causally motivated and no dead limbs. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, but causality is solid—each discovery tightens or reweights the central question of what to do with guilt and knowledge. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: realizing that brittle awakenings and imperfect records must suffice, leading to the concrete act of copying and returning the sundial. The cost is legible in the renunciation of perfect memory and absolution, and the reincarnated past remains a constraint rather than getting magically resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is tight: storm → installation commission → day of ghostwriting → Arin’s arrival → public confession and ritualized tying of the ribbon. Causality is clean under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, with each step narrowing from general, anonymous longings to a single, personal reckoning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he reverses his defining past choice on the page and accepts a renewed bond at real emotional risk. The only thing holding it short of exceptional is that the external consequences of the confession feel implied rather than sharply dramatized beyond the hand-taking.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: initial decoding success → social schism and institutional pressure → recognition of manipulation pattern → risky counter-plan → transmission and observable response → reframed stakes at the end. The piece delivers closure via a resonant reconfiguration: Mara changes the implied question from “answer or not?” to “who controls the channel?” while still under live threat. The ending beat pays off prior setup (charts, trickster pattern, factions outside) without feeling mechanical. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the Causal drive remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean: the inherited compass and rumor of the key → entry into the mutinous nexus → use of organ to navigate shifts → confrontation with the Archive and lock → discovery that the “key” is consent and the compass’s placement → freeing the mentor and stabilizing a path out. The piece teaches its surreal rules early (“distances argued, doorways voted”) and then consistently exploits them in rising tests, with no orientation debt. Closure is decisive and on-page: the act of planting the compass irreversibly alters the nexus and the larger world’s mapping possibilities, with a felt cost in risk and relinquishing old geometries. The quiet epilogue under starlight reads as an earned reconfiguration rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: missing evidence → lone ribbon → reconstruction method → discovery of the quick-release knot → decision to visit the troupe → visual match and vocal tell → confession. Orientation is clean despite some lyricism; we always know who’s where and why. Closure is clear and costly: truth is extracted, Maren’s career/reputation and the town’s willful blindness are implicitly sacrificed, and the narrator’s method vindicated. The only limitation is that the investigation resolves on the first confrontation, so the arc feels a shade easy for the stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is strong and clean: jet stream shift → exposed journals → coded isobars → cemetery → coffin nail → confrontation → annex opening → proof and registry correction. Structure fits a single, continuous investigative arc with one main escalation run; there are no dangling setups or logic breaks. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: Elias’s status is formally corrected and the weather experiment reframes as an experiment in memory, with a clear before/after. The only thing keeping this from the very top band is that the annex/key mechanism, while elegant, resolves quickly without much impediment once revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: hitchhiker’s question → gift of flake → deciphered clue → scaffold-arrow → hidden box → camera → self-portrait and decision. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: they move from being trapped in “never” to actively seeking amnesty, with a clear before/after in legal and existential terms. The stakes and cost are legible, though the path has more inevitability than friction, so escalation feels elegant rather than grippingly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.0)
    The hybrid causal/accumulative structure is clean: father’s trade → inherited bills → LoopLine’s loops → circus-train lab → algorithmic critique → collapse → decision to walk the father’s route. The global drive is coherent, and the conceptual repricing at the end—“some paths circle back…someone has marked the land to make it so”—lands with clear cost and before/after reweighting. The mosaic compression of the startup’s rise and fall is efficient and doesn’t break causality or orientation. One could argue the lawsuits/board sale are briskly summarized, but they serve as credible external pressure rather than contrived resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine is clean: temple crumbling → need to decode → lucid-dream experiment in the temple courtyard → revelation of the vault-for-grief function → on-site rite that reconfigures how they carry loss. The structure (observatory → dream → observatory → temple) is legible and accumulative, with no orientation or lens ambiguity. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: decoding is reframed from solving a puzzle to maintaining a grief-keeping practice, and that shift has an emotional and ethical cost on the page. Every major set-up (variable stars, Nera’s brother, the rite requiring two witnesses) pays off in the ending unit.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: failed trick → cursed lake premise → seed + “frozen truth” hint → dawn descent → discovery of twin and curse machinery → tactical choice with the seed → release and confession on shore. Structure is tight, essentially one continuous throughline with a brief opening shard, and closure lands clearly with the lake’s stilling and the conjurer’s spoken confession. Cost is legible (years in ice, accumulated missing objects, Thalen’s choice to shield a culpable man), though the underwater solution (two seeds chewing each other) resolves very smoothly with minimal resistance. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a thematic repricing of mirrors at the end, and that hybrid holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: rumor → glade → visionary → hedge mechanics → dream-walking → cracked seal → self-wounding repair, with each step narrowing options. Closure is solidly on the page: the covenant’s seal is repaired at emotional and physical cost, the mother is found, and they return to “a present that could wait for its future,” a clear before/after shift. No orientation issues; the world’s rules (future arriving early, eclipsed covenant, scar-link) are introduced before they’re relied on. The only limiter is that the resolution, while earned, resolves both personal and cosmic stakes somewhat smoothly, with little on-page resistance once the key tactic is chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: prior bargain → Jory’s relapse → return to broker → offer of theft → discovery of the frayed knot → new, costlier bargain. Backstory is tightly integrated and always tilts the present stakes rather than stalling them. Closure lands clearly with a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis: Mira binds Jory’s destiny to hers at the cost of permanent, unforgetting pain. No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the drive is lucidly causal under a lyric surface.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: public failure → exile job → discovery of the scrap → investigation → conversation with Marla → revised understanding of purpose. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly with the livestream fiasco and the quarry trailer, and the piece holds a stable causal lens throughout. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: work shifts from proving expertise to validating other people’s memories, with an on-page emotional cost. A touch more external jeopardy (e.g., risk of the report being dismissed) could have intensified structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparatory setup of the observatory and seed leads to the experiment, the brief contact with Mara, and the renunciatory act of letting the spirit go. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each ritual step in the experiment increases the meaning of the final planting and written “guide for future mourners.” Closure lands as an Earned Stasis / Resonant Reconfiguration: he redefines the observatory’s purpose from capture to witnessing, with clear cost to his desire to hold on. The only minor limitation is that external stakes remain low-key and the previous abbot’s story hints at a darker potential path that isn’t quite dramatized as an on-page alternative choice.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    The accumulative structure is clean: world premise → problem of tomorrow’s absence → creel use → realization that catching isn’t enough → furnace/bookmarks ritual → return of Lio/Liora and naming of the narrator. Causality is soft but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens, with each new practice arising from a preceding lack or contradiction. Closure lands on the page when the narrator receives and accepts the new name, a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (they acknowledge their forgotten self and choose to continue in this role). No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the single scene/timeframe remains legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal arc—from routine inspection to discovery of the shell, activation of the pearl, communal confessions, and the unsealed bunker—is coherent and cleanly motivated. The structure fits a single continuous scene with one deepening turn (down into the caves) and a clear closure: Mara redefines compliance versus community and files the bunker as noncompliant while leaving it open. Cost is more conceptual than dramatized; the risk of leaving a shelter unsealed is understood but not directly tested. Still, the closure reads as a solid Resonant Reconfiguration under a primarily causal lens with accumulative grace notes.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: return to site → map alignment → tunnel → graffiti → grid reference → intake gate → report, with each step narrowing avoidance and raising the emotional cost. Orientation is solid from the opening paragraph; the drive lens remains causal with an internal-arc emphasis. Closure lands via a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the same professional tools once used to conceal negligence are now used to expose it, and the cost (living with guilt minus self-erasure) is explicit. Nothing important is resolved offstage or by coincidence; the graffiti is a discovered pressure, not a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: first letter → quest with watch → discovery of library → decoding cipher → realization of his own culpability → preemptive apology before the second letter’s “verdict.” Structure is cleanly accumulative within that causal spine, and the closure—reframing the second letter as moot because he’s already acted—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Orientation (attic → canal district → glowing library → back to attic) is clear despite the surreal elements, and the rules of the watch/library interaction are internally consistent. The only small limitation is that the “proof” demanded by the second letter remains abstract; a concrete on-page consequence if he had failed would sharpen the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: assignment → contact with the violin → plant warnings and coffee divination → discovery of vents → envoy pressure → decision and execution of the smuggling plan → reweighted future in the final melody. Closure is a clear Decisive Change plus conceptual repricing: the empire fails to consecrate the relic, Liora forecloses the imperial-myth path at personal cost, and the violin’s music moves into alleys instead of Coronation Hall. Stakes (orchards cut for cannonwood; mythic legitimation of empire) are not just declared but transformed by her specific tactics. The main slight softness is that the consequences for Sorell and Liora remain forecast rather than briefly dramatized, which keeps the cost just short of fully visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: ascent → ritual with Orin and the chip → realization about the chip’s true function → choice to release the spark → return. Causality follows well under an accumulative/textural lens; each step (static → grotto → chip in Orin → transfer to sky) deepens the same throughline rather than scattering. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reconceives the spark as something to soothe endings rather than resist them, and her stance going back to the parlor is visibly changed. The only limit is that the central turn—that the chip shelters but does not resurrect—is intellectually neat but comes a touch quickly and smoothly, without much struggle or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean and purposeful: vineyard → fig tree ascent → grotto exploration → vision and conceptual turn → descent with a new stance. Causality is solid (hairpin as key, scalloped rock revealing the loam and generational vines, pool reconfiguring her understanding), and the drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/lyric bias paid off in the final images. Closure lands decisively when Mara offers the hairpin, reframes contentment, and envisions the shared duty with her brother, with a clear before/after. The only restraint from a 9+ is the relative safety of the path—there’s little structural risk or complication beyond the single, graceful arc.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    Structure is clean: campfire → ascent → lantern-room choice → conversation with Sile → exit, with each step causally linked and legible under a situational/accumulative lens. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: Mara keeps the cloak and reframes her role, with on-page cost in risking her livelihood’s easy certainties. Escalation remains primarily internal; there is no major external complication beyond Sile’s request and the chime warnings, which keeps the arc modest in scope. Still, the before/after is clear and the final promise to “keep questioning for both of them” lands as a genuine shift.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: recruitment → lesson on the platform → symbolic pattern recognition → journey to grotto → revelation of the rule → Lior’s final vanishing. The global drive is Causal with an overlay of conceptual repricing at the end, and closure lands via the narrator’s new role and Lior’s self-erasure. The grotto’s rule-set (reversing attention) is introduced and then paid off logically, though its mechanics remain purposefully a bit mystical. Stakes and cost are more emotional and conceptual than plot-driven, but they are legible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: Oren’s long-term goal sets up the ritual, the flock and pulse arrival are the central tightening, and the vision plus learned intervals provide a clear closure beat. Causality is soft but legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each step (climbing, placing the arrowhead, humming, waiting for birds) naturally leads to the final inner-navigation event. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: before, navigation is an aspiration; after, he possesses a concrete, repeatable method. The cost is more conceptual than dramatic, which keeps this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: automation displaces him → he seeks the keystone’s unmeasured light → mist-walks to the spire → confronts the automaton’s claim → adopts a simple protective ritual and leaves the keystone. The spire sequence escalates smoothly, with the arrival of the automaton and Davin’s harness-dropping choice as a clear structural hinge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the sacred is preserved by his refusal to commodify it, and the automaton is literally blinded by what it cannot quantify. All anchors (who/where/when, world rules) are established early without confusion, and there’s a tight sense of before/after for Davin’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/textural lens: tag → wreck → library → registry → luminous vows → spoken vow → recharged relationship to his work. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of his honesty and vocation, with the colored bell-tone as a decisive internal turn. The journey to the wreck and the discovery of the perfectly apt “Luminous Vows” drawer feel a touch convenient, but they are foreshadowed enough not to read as arbitrary. Stakes remain primarily inward and metaphysical, which slightly mutes the sense of risk despite the ticking air supply.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean and complete: static bursts → backwards-language decoding → three frequencies with tagged outcomes → coin cast → decision to split the dish → final burn and transmission → immediate retroactive confirmation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and charged poise: Mara accepts purpose as loop, not monument, and irrevocably commits the last fuel, foreclosing retreat. Cost is on-page (spent reserves, stressed machinery, strained crew trust) and the before/after is legible in both the station’s state and Mara’s stance. The hybrid causal/accumulative design holds consistently without any orientation or rule-breaking slips.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure is clean: one continuous ritual scene whose beats accumulate—setup of observatory and cylinders, activation of the phonograph, crystallization and naming, then departure. Causality is legible under an accumulative/textural lens: because he plays each recording and bends the light, images and crystals form, enabling the naming that gradually reconfigures his burden. The closure beat—tucking the final crystal into the blank ocean and leaving with new names—is a resonant reconfiguration that clearly marks a before/after in his relationship to fear and sacrifice. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid from the opening and no set-ups are left hanging.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: Evin arrives, studies the drip, rebuilds the bell, endures social doubt, then rings it and gets a subtle but decisive world-response. Causality is tight under a quasi-accumulative lens—understanding the drip directly enables the repair, which directly enables the answering bell and fractional rebalancing. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the universe “settles by a fraction,” the sea “tilts like a listening ear,” and his devotion bends but doesn’t break, with the bell left as a ticking engine of ongoing cost. Stakes remain conceptually large but locally gentle, so the sense of risk never fully sharpens beyond that one experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: chime falls silent → label discovery → photo investigation → memory of father’s lie → return to Bellford → choice to publicly reframe the story. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Mara redefines the reservoir from haunting to “audit” and chooses truth-telling over institutional erasure, with on-page cost to her inherited role. The two main temporal shards (investigation vs. later bar/meeting) are legible and linked without confusion. Stakes stay intimate rather than outwardly explosive, but the structural progression is tight for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: need for a tarnishless metal → seek waterfall/orchard per teacher’s rule → observe starlings to solve the ratio → successful transmutation → inner reconfiguration. The structure is essentially one continuous, well-contained scene with brief, anchored backstory that tilts present choices. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she fuses logic and intuition and achieves the transformation, with her future before the council implicitly changed. Stakes never feel muddled, but the external pressure from the council remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatically tightened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is cleanly causal: suspicion about Courier Nine’s voice → muscle-memory test via the buckle → tactical revision of landing coordinates → trap and capture → public route revision and aftermath in the arbor. Orientation is excellent; the role, location, and stakes are all legible within the opening and never blur. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator reaffirms the watcher’s burden by choosing public truth and continued vigilance over punitive satisfaction or escape, with a clear before/after in the network’s trust. The only reason this does not reach the 9-band is that the turn is more quietly ethical than structurally radical; the arc is exemplary but not formally surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The situational spine is clean: Custodians arrive, demand a trial, the protagonist must choose how to respond, culminating in a reconfigured custody arrangement. Causality holds, and the closure—shifting from legal ownership to mutual guardianship—lands as a Conceptual Repricing with emotional cost (the crack in numbness, the abandonment of being “the” original). However, the factions’ capitulation to the protagonist’s method feels somewhat compressed and low-friction, with systemic change arriving quickly once they are made to “breathe together.” The drive lens reads as Situational/Accumulative and is coherent, but one more concrete resistance beat would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clear and causal: mysterious seed arrives → dual investigations → realization about OrthoGen → construction of the seed room as trap → confrontation → conceptual resolution. The closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Mara’s space and the seed’s meaning are redefined around stewardship rather than commercialization, with a before/after legible in the contract refusal and new rule. No orientation issues; the temporal compression (“built a new room overnight”) is a little convenient but within genre plausibility. All major set-ups (wax seal, brook, seed room mechanisms) pay off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: grief → tip from musician → midnight tunnel ritual → harvested pulp → morning laughter, with no major logic gaps. Structure is cleanly bifurcated (night ritual / morning aftermath) and the transition is effortless. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the household’s emotional atmosphere shifts in a small but decisive way, with the cost of Bram confronting haunting images and risking the grotesque labor alone. The drive lens reads primarily causal with an accumulative lyric overlay and holds consistently through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean: the pendant draws the narrator → encounter with guardian → explanation of rules → experiment with “interiorizing exteriors” → crisis when the pendant tries to open a passage → joint refusal and conceptual repricing of what “home” means. Closure is strong Earned Stasis: they forgo the apparent solution (stepping through) at real emotional cost, and the dulled pendant plus catalog card crystallize the new terms. The accumulative, lyric structure is consistent with a hybrid causal/textural lens and never loses orientation despite rich imagery. Every major setup (sleep-cult pendant, boundary of light, homesickness, guardian’s half-existence) is paid off in the ending stance.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: Mara’s arrival with the crozier leads to Jun’s questioning, then to the experimental reforging, then to the crozier’s repurposed power burning away the charter seals. The story lands a clear decisive change—Mara and Jun alter the instrument that enforced her destiny and use it to dissolve that destiny on the page. The cost is legible in their mutual fear of punishment and the irreversible collapse of the furnace pit into glass, signaling no going back. Structure is tight and linear, though external resistance is minimal, keeping this just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: arrival to tune, use of the hush shard, discovery of the missed ending, following the gap beyond expected frequencies, receiving instructions, and dismantling the mast. The Decisive Change is on-page and physical (dropping the tallest mast, retuning the city as receiver), with clear before/after stakes in the city’s role and the loss of its “arrogance.” The closure carries conceptual and material cost—the city sacrifices power to gain a new function, and Mara gives up the old broadcast paradigm. The only slight limitation is that external opposition is soft; the pressure feels more like solemn duty than urgent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean and purposeful: strange vanishings → clocks/time anomaly → discovery of the hourglass/pattern → decision to stay aboard and experiment with the radio → deliberate run to the grotto → encounter with the older self → stitching the seam via pattern-matching radio code. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative textural overlay, and the closure (timelines stitched, commuters reanimating, grotto fading) is legible with a before/after cost in Lina’s ongoing responsibility. Exposition about the seam’s nature is folded into action enough that it doesn’t stall momentum. The piece stays within a single coherent window and pays off all seeded elements, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clear: small installation → expanded maze → opening-night eruption → reconfigured lattice. Causality is solid (the need for control leads to denser weaving, which traps the narrator, which forces the choice to pull the mirror). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when connection is redefined as “tension maintained” and the lattice stabilizes around that insight, with a felt cost in relinquished certainty. Slightly more emphasis on tangible external consequences (social/professional) could sharpen the sense of cost further.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: alien probe → decoded lattice → hypothesis about edge geometry in the sky → hard test via surface ascent → proof and curricular reorientation. The story achieves closure via a conceptual repricing: navigation becomes moral responsibility in light of unfolded horizons and alien contact. One could wish for a more pressured on-page decision or setback during the ascent sequence; the council’s approval and the test itself unfold relatively smoothly. Still, the structure fits the length and ends with a clear before/after in knowledge and stance.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight: the photograph → recognition and hearing-aid pulse → following the signal → finding Eli and the suicidal call → reframing the connection → release. Structure is cleanly single-scene with minor spatial shifts that are always anchored, and each step follows logically from the last. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: grief’s chain is interrupted, Mara’s past is recontextualized via the “PLEASE” addition, and the final image makes a before/after legible. No significant orientation or lens ambiguity undermines the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causality is tight: tidal window → entry → collapsed corridor → coil/phase method → pressure lock → broken cable → repair and transmission, with each step arising from the previous. Closure is a clear decisive change plus conceptual repricing: she restores the cable and Ken’s “last log” to the world, paying with fear and physical risk. The coastal-stakes line arrives a bit late and feels more told than dramatized, slightly softening perceived external cost. Overall structure is clean single-arc causal with a satisfying, earned cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight: death-certificate error → Mara’s bureaucratic erasure → discovery of Lyle’s email → bringing the shard → spilled ink scripts → files rewriting the ledger and her status. The structure holds as a single, continuous scene with integrated backstory and culminates in a clear closure beat where her legal resurrection and internal stance shift coincide. Closure is a strong conceptual repricing: life/death reframed as “recorded/not recorded,” and defragmentation as shared repair. The only constraint is that external stakes (will the fix work? could this fail?) stay implied rather than put under more concrete on-page threat.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: the canyon and diamond are introduced, the curse reveals itself, Ilen develops the bird-pattern method, and the night without swifts forces a culminating test. Causality is sound and easy to follow despite the lyric mode, with each development (“that was when the curse showed itself,” “day after day,” “on the night Toma died”) naturally building on the last. Closure is strong: the creation of the echo-library is an on-page reconfiguration with conceptual cost (Vey survives only as mediated resonance). There is a bit of summarizing across “day after day” and “years later,” but it serves scope rather than dodging climactic scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: rumors → undercover placement → phone confessions → reveal to Edda → plan in the garden → gravitational/musical crisis → negotiated resolution. The structure balances summary (the earlier calls) with a fully dramatized climax, and the garden sequence delivers a clear before/after: Jonas nearly becomes a doorway and is pulled back into ordinariness. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the threat isn’t erased but reframed into an ongoing, negotiated relationship with the Choir via the phone. A minor limitation is that the precise mechanics of how bitterness becomes “the punchline, not the price” remain more conceptual than dramatized in action, which slightly softens the sense of concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor → decision to trespass → heart-rhythm tactic → access to the chained tree → musical freeing that transforms the orchard and statues. The drive lens is primarily causal with a strong thematic overlay, and the closure (tree uprooting, orchard opened, moving toward the city) constitutes a decisive change with clear before/after. Cost is legible in the struggle against the statues and the implied upheaval of the city’s order, even if bodily consequence to Lio is light. No major orientation or rule-change issues arise; the world’s logic holds through climax.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: the constrained mail route and theft problem lead to Ivo’s investigative method, which leads to discovering the smugglers’ timing, confronting them, deploying the storm, and the drone crossing that earns the Mendery’s reply. Structure is linear, lucid, and tight for the length, with no orientation issues despite a dense world. Closure lands as both Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: Ivo’s decision to keep a “treasonous” promise and cross again reframes his role from courier to active healer of promises. The only slight limitation is that the political danger around his treason remains conceptual rather than concretely tested in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the halo fragment → heightened bells and enigmatic warning → deliberate wrong turn → oasis and water loosening the hush → repair and song that reconfigure silence. Structure is linear, single-POV, and well anchored in place, with a clear before/after in Rowan’s relationship to silence and the train. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing rather than a hard decisive turn; the cost of rejecting the EXIT path and embracing risk is present but underplayed. The piece could edge higher with a slightly sharper sense of what Rowan risks losing if the “wrong turn” fails him.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: we move from routine, to the scarf-triggered hypothesis, to geometric mapping, to the spatial pocket, to the new practice of guiding readers. Causality holds under the lyric lens—each step follows from Mara’s prior observation and experimental temperament. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: “Found the coordinate of listening; tomorrow I will catalog the way in” reframes her role and the library’s nature with a subtle but legible cost (her solitude is now porous). The only limitation is that external stakes remain low-key, which slightly softens the felt cost of this change.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/causal lens, the structure is clean: Mina’s dawn practice → the camera flaw → extracting the silhouette → the overnight vigil and layered photograph → the dream’s return and departure. Orientation is strong from the first sentence (who/where/when are quickly clear), and the world’s rules are consistent without over-explanation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final act of photographing absence reweights the entire prior quest, and the cost—losing the dream in order to gain a livable beginning—is legible. The only small limit is that the external stakes stay relatively contained to her inner life, giving the arc a slightly cool distance.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean, accumulative descent-ritual-ascent with clear causal links: town → ravine → disorienting stair → ritual room → naming → return. The piece teaches its slight disorientation early and repays it when the room spins and the pool blinks, making the structural instability part of the unlocking process rather than confusion. Closure is strong: the narrator leaves with the key reclaimed, idea freed, and the nexus “closing like a book,” a decisive reconfiguration of options and meaning. Cost—ongoing vulnerability to “weather” and fear’s new tactics—is implicit but felt.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: decades-old theft → sailor’s rumor → dive → notebook → constellation pattern → mushroom choice → restored memories and reframed world. The story maintains a single throughline and lands a decisive change with visible cost and a reweighted understanding of the Ring Court and shipwrecks. Backstory is woven in through present triggers without stalling momentum, and the closure beat (writing and mailing the prologue, returning to tend the orchard) clearly marks a before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: tribunal sentence → mentorship in the hidden library → tea-leaf geometry practice → alignment of shard-mirror and shadow → reversal of the exile mark. Closure is a clear decisive change with cost articulated (“Then the exile becomes permanent, and the city will call it your fault”), and the final beat reconfigures options for Mara. However, the reversal of exile happens after a single, relatively compressed session, so the difficulty curve feels slightly easy for the stakes as framed. Structure (single continuous scene with a light external frame of the swing) is tight and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: pruning practice → revelation of the seed and second current → confession about Nela → ritual at the waterfall → traversal and healing → seed replanted to maintain the weave. Closure is decisive and on-page: Nela’s color returns and the seed is replanted to bind the worlds, with an emotional cost in the narrator exposing fear and using that fear as material. The piece maintains a single, coherent throughline with no orientation lapses despite its lyric density. The resolution borders on ease—few real setbacks in the other orchard—so escalation feels more like a smooth unfolding than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: job → knowledge of the hush → elders’ secret → midnight descent → knot-unraveling → ancestor reveal → freeing and re-binding the spirit. Each move follows as a “therefore” rather than an “and then,” and the net’s progressive untying offers a clean structural spine through to the slab opening. Closure is strong and on-page: the hush transforms into breathing, spirits gain weight, the ancestor transfers into the mask, and the sanctuary’s role is redefined. The cost—breaking a generational vow and permanently altering the sanctuary’s governing force—is legible without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: damaged map → reels → shadow discovery → henge → vault → maps of erasure → ethical choice about reopening. Orientation (who/where/when) is swift and clear, and the story sustains a coherent throughline. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Lena reconceives the chapel as companion to erased lives and alters its future use accordingly, with a legible before/after. The main limitation is that most major turns proceed smoothly, with little on-page resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean: return to deeper wreck → exploration → discovery of Vaughn’s material → listening to the reel → reconfigured understanding → act of release. Causality and accumulative texture work together; each discovery tightens the focus on “letting go” and leads plausibly to the final act. Closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: the quest to locate a crash is reframed as a search for the moment of chosen descent, with the cost acknowledged. No orientation or lens-clarity issues; everything tracks within one coherent drive.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: lightning awakens the chip/ghost, which generates the need to encode before thunder, leading to the realization about routing and Lio’s final commitment. Causality is lyric but legible—each step (“chip warms” → ghost tremor in strings → urgent encoding → interpretive spark-strike) follows from the last. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Lio takes on an ongoing role with a visible emotional cost and the final image of readers below confirms the stakes matter. The only minor limit is that the thunder deadline is more symbolic than tightly enforced, slightly softening the sense of constrained time.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: finding the diary → decoding with the goggles → learning the sabotage plot → acting at the eighth floor → facing the magistrate. The single-scene elevator ride provides a tight spine, and the instructions about the maintenance hatch and brake land as a concrete, earned turn rather than a late rule-change. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Lysa’s stance toward her role and ambition shifts in the promotion scene, with the cost of risk and lingering smallness still felt. A slight compression of how much diary content she can absorb in the ascent is noticeable but doesn’t materially harm structure or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: tether break → drift toward storm with dead radios → Mara recalls Juno’s belief and her own experiment → she creates a physical “channel” with the telescope and line → that act recovers the signal and alters their heading. Closure lands as a blend of Decisive Change (they regain contact and a safe vector) and Conceptual Repricing (the broken tether’s “empty space” is refigured as guiding memory), with clear cost in risk and emotional exposure. Structure is tight, single-scene with interleaved backstory that always tilts the present choice, and nothing crucial resolves off-stage. The only slight limit is that the mechanics of the “remembered corridor of signal” are more poetic than logical, but the story has taught that rule well enough for it to hold.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal spine is clean: demolition deadline → need to paint and retrieve book → decoding the coin → accessing and then resealing the safe → stepping out under the painted sky. Structure is a single, continuous scene with one clear tightening (the demolition crew’s approach) and a closure that functions as a conceptual repricing of “limits” and preservation. Cost—she must leave the tree and her work to demolition—is legible and on-page; the book’s sealing complements her acceptance of constraint. The only thing holding it just below the very top tier is that the foreman’s acquiescence is frictionless, slightly softening the sense of tested options at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: strange lantern → attempt at greeting → hopscotch pattern decoding → phrasebook door sketch → engines wake and ship turns toward the unmapped glare. The piece lands a real closure beat (the Meridian reorients and Lio’s isolation is reconfigured into answered discovery), and the single-scene structure is coherent. The main limitation is that stakes and cost at the turn toward the “region marked only with old warnings of glare” remain conceptual rather than concretely pressured, so the decisive change feels exciting but low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: arrival → entry → exploration → prophecy discovery → interpretive realization → making instead of taking → exit with new stance, all causally linked. Closure lands solidly as a resonant reconfiguration: she leaves with knowledge and a self-forged gear, not a stolen part, with the cost being labor and renunciation. Orientation (who/where/what she wants) is established early, and the hall-of-mirrors/prohecy mechanics are legible. The drive is mostly accumulative/textural with a coherent causal spine, and nothing crucial is resolved by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is strong: crash → chalk messages → bell/ghost → relay revelation → grave/logs → collective rebuild → departure, with each beat logically motivating the next. The closure is decisive and on-page: they complete the relay, choose to leave for the nebula, and assume Serren’s role of guiding future arrivals, with a clear before/after. Some large events (months of rationing, the full rebuild effort) are summarized rather than scened, but at this length they still maintain coherence and pressure. The inferred drive lens (causal with a lyric surface) holds cleanly through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine is clear: looming final ripple → shimmering pane → tactical clock adjustment with the puppet → sacrifice → reconfigured apocalypse, all under an accumulative lyric surface. Closure is strong and costly: Mara’s heartbeat is taken by the gears, she becomes stored time, and the world’s ending is conceptually repriced into a dimming rather than erasure. The doomsday clock, pane, and lullaby all pay off at the end with no dangling set-ups or deus ex machina. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean from the opening sentence, with no structural confusion despite the poetic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal spine is clean: travelers arrive with a concrete problem, the narrator deploys the nut and blueprint to navigate escalating danger, and closure lands with a decisive new commitment. The ticking clock (frost in forty-seven minutes) and environmental changes (first frost threading the corners) maintain temporal and spatial orientation. The closure unit—a choice to complete the waystone system, reinterpreting the Duke’s design—lands on the page with visible conceptual cost. The rescue sequence is smooth enough that risk sometimes feels a touch under-tested, which slightly softens the structural punch.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: past bridge failure → return to ravine → foam-triggered insight → new formulation and legal stance → rebuilt bridge and crossing. The story lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s relationship to her work, guilt, and the site is reweighted in the final crossing image, with cost intact (“She did not feel absolved”). Reflection is well anchored in present action and feeds each new choice rather than stalling momentum. Structure holds together as a single throughline despite summary compression in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is tight and legible: setup with the cart and bottle, presentation of the parole test, the counting/incision sequence, then the reveal that the freed story is the narrator’s own and the decision to depart. Under an accumulative/lyric lens, the causal chain is coherent and satisfying, and the closure beat (being “freed…from the blankness” and stepping toward the root) lands clearly. Stakes are mostly internal and abstract, and the process flows without much friction or complication, so the arc feels more graceful than pressured. Still, the before/after line in the narrator’s self-conception is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: courtyard → map room brief → journey to sinkhole → pavilion descent → return and communal sharing. Each step follows logically (rain reveals sinkhole; myth motivates exploration; pavilion jars lead to Safi’s decision; the absorbed remorse then shapes his contact with the garrison). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Safi accepts the role of container and redistributor of guilt at felt cost, changing how the fortress will process remorse. The causal chain is tight for this length and there is no orientation or lens confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: Mara’s decision → tower setup with weight and tube → conversation with Nine → bell summons farmers → collective repair before dawn, yielding a concrete Decisive Change plus a resonant reconfiguration of the community. The use of the clock (striking one, then two, then dawn) gives the structure a satisfying temporal spine and anchors the escalation. The main weakness is plausibility and resistance: a condemned, cracked elevator is surveyed, organized, and “rehabilitated” structurally and socially in a single night with almost no on-page opposition, which softens the sense of cost. Still, the before/after is legible and conceptually satisfying, with the counterweight motif carrying into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative with causal underpinnings: canyon → discovery of periscope → modification → revelation about the surgery → new stance. Each step follows logically, and the mother/miner reveal reweights all prior material without feeling like a bolt-on twist. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Nira reframes her condition as inheritance and commits to a new role. There are no orientation issues; time, place, and goal are clear early and stay stable.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: one continuous causal sequence from summons and journey through entry, spiral path, calcite door, archive chamber, then exit. World rules (gravity inversion, luminous ink, seeds, threshold effects) are introduced before they matter and remain consistent. Closure is a coherent Conceptual Repricing: the grotto reframed as an archive, with the cost of what it takes from people, and Ilya’s tactic of speaking the combinations aloud to resist its theft. Escalation is somewhat smooth rather than sharply turning, but the final tremor and falling books give a satisfying cadence shift with stakes felt.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: hedgehog → walk to monument → analysis → first wire → amplification block → multi-wire “orchestra” → plan to bring it to people → leaving the insulator as an ongoing hum. Causality within the lyric frame is solid—each tactile experiment leads to the next refinement and culminates in her reoriented purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the cracks are reinterpreted and her mission shifts from private exploration to communal bridge, with a clear before/after. Stakes remain modest and internal, but the story does not fumble any set up or leave key beats unclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: silenced bells → Sable investigates the nexus → decodes the covenant → confronts elders → council renounces the nexus, averting catastrophe. The closure is solid Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the city chooses public military restraint with a clear conceptual and political cost. Structure is tight for a single continuous arc, with backstory (the prior eclipse) directly reweighting the current decision. The only missed opportunity is the lightly sketched council deliberation, which slightly softens the sense of a hard-won, contested turn.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is clean: prior recovery of the diary → sonic unlocking → discovery of the unsafe fireworks → crate-by-crate intervention → public reading that reconfigures blame into trust. Orientation is strong from the opening (“workshop under stars,” fireworks tonight) and the drive lens remains causal through to closure. The warehouse fire backstory and Mara’s written confession feel a bit convenient in how thoroughly they explain and resolve the danger, but they still read as motivated rather than contrived. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost—Lio risks social suspicion, surrenders his prior judgment of Mara, and accepts a new understanding of joy and noise.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: Jun arrives with a goal, meets resistance, uses her family mapping habit to bypass it, is tested at the bloom, gains new understanding, and receives the seed under conditions that carry cost. The piece maintains a single throughline under a causal lens, with a clear before/after hinge at the bloom and the seed-gifting. Closure is solid: her situation and stance are reconfigured, and the condition to report back prevents a consequence-free win. The only limit is that the test proceeds without any serious risk of failure once accepted; stakes could tighten further at the vigil itself.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: raider skirmish → discovery of the arrow tip’s property → experiment → decision to seek its origin during inversion → navigation via water to the arches → encounter with the echo-tree → conceptual revaluation and renunciation. Orientation is excellent—who/where/when and the inversion rule are all clear early—and the echo-tree sequence pays off the earlier superstition. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: Lysa abandons the idea of a single miraculous source, with the cost of giving up her unique object and the fantasy of an easy solution. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and planetary rather than urgent in the moment, which keeps the structural arc from feeling fully high-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: silent town → vanished cargo plane → patch clue → wind-mapped labyrinth → convergent silence machine → protagonist disrupts the geometry to restore sound. The drive lens is primarily causal with a conceptual overlay, and the closure delivers both a Decisive Change (breaking the convergence) and a conceptual reweighting of “foresight” in the last line. Stakes and constraints (limited minutes before the crew returns, need to decode an engineered airflow system) are legible, and there are no serious causality breaks. The only slight limitation is that opposition remains mostly environmental and offstage, so the climax leans more on puzzle-solving than direct confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: mission into the cavern → hush becomes a literal threat → musical counteraction → return to surface and political repercussion, all causally linked. The closure—Council’s charter plus Lio’s return to bell-ringing with a new, charged stance—reads as a decisive change with resonant reconfiguration. The causal chain from sculpted hush to political decision is mostly plausible, though the Council’s rapid capitulation via one performance feels slightly easy at this length. The hybrid causal/accumulative drive remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: past failure → journey back → decision to uncase/play the flute → passage to an alternate range → encounter and reframing → return with altered understanding. The two-shard structure (original canyon and emptied-world visit) is legible and the rules of crossing are taught through action rather than exposition. Closure is strong: she comes back to the same canyon but not the same stance, and the cost of risk (possible mis-return) is clearly implied. A slight softness is that the traversal itself proceeds with minimal friction once she decides to play, reducing moment-to-moment jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean for a lyric-accumulative piece: halo fragment arrival → discovery of its function → expanding experiments → auditors test case → final self-emptying sheet. Causality is legible even as it’s couched in metaphor and equation; each step arises as a clear “therefore” from the last. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: Kestrel regains a coherent self at real cost, and the town’s relation to sorrow/empathy is permanently altered. The only minor limit is that external consequences (e.g., Council stakes, cosmic stakes of vanishing stars) remain more implied texture than tightly dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: route from Nera → lamplighter encounter demonstrating the relic’s function → meeting Mara → decision to relinquish ownership and reframe the delivery. The accumulative structure culminates in a clear conceptual repricing of what “delivery” means, with the cairn question as a decisive closure move. The vision of Nera on the ridge decades earlier retrofits the pattern without breaking orientation. Stakes are primarily conceptual/emotional but feel coherent and resolved on the page with a real before/after in Rook’s understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: one central ritual scene with a brief but causally clear aftermath, all under a Hybrid/Causal-accumulative lens. Each move follows logically—summoned mystic → frost/prism ritual → revelation via mirror → choice about what story to tell—toward an on-page conceptual repricing of the car and her grief. Closure is strong and costly: she redefines her sister’s absence, releases hatred of the car, and accepts an ongoing, complicated relationship with the evidence of love. No orientation or lens-clarity issues; the pattern is taught early and held through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean: Jun’s absence → vow → stalled loom due to feared cost → discovery of puzzle pieces → border-map enabling the weave → the work exacts her voice → Jun receives the message and returns. The accumulative lyricism never muddies who is doing what or why, even as time compresses into seasons sliding “like cards.” Closure is a decisive change plus earned stasis: she sacrifices her voice, succeeds in the long-distance communication, and reconfigures the future by teaching Jun the craft. The cost is explicit on the page (“she knew she could never speak again”), anchoring the entire structure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: arches failing → failed repairs → magician’s offer → descent into mines → bartered knowledge for memories → forging anchors → final renunciation of the silk. The story maintains a single throughline and lands an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change when Lio buries the silk and returns to his forge altered. Costs (lost memories) are repeatedly dramatized rather than only asserted, tightening stakes as events proceed. A hair more dramatized resistance to the magician’s economy or a sharper on-page pivot in the final exchange could lift the structural charge further.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: shard → seam → alternate bay → beacon → hatch → rescuing Jalen → amending the log, all clearly motivated by the protagonist’s drive. The piece lands a solid Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing in the log entry that redefines truth as shared weight. World-shifting mechanics are sketched efficiently enough to follow, though the ease of hopping to the “right” open-hatch and intact-log universe slightly softens the sense of difficulty at the climax. Still, the structure holds under a causal lens with a satisfying before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: lamp failure → discovery of the letter and cairn code → interim protection via stones → physical repair of the light, all under the constraints of fog and dead radio. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Noah joins the anonymous chain and restores the beam, with the cost in labor and vulnerability clearly on the page. Time and space remain coherent and anchored, with no orientation debt. The single-scene arc fits the length and stakes, with no unkept setups or convenience fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: established routine → careless prophecy → incoming storm → tactical repurposing of lantern and newspapers → successful evacuation → redefined role at dawn. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she moves from accidental savior to someone asked to wield her prophetic voice deliberately, with the final line crystallizing an ongoing cost rather than neat resolution. Orientation is strong from the first sentence, and the single-scene arc with a brief aftermath stays legible. A hair more on-page friction (close calls, partial failures) during the storm could deepen the sense of risk without altering structure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure (tea house → prism-map → sun trail → jar → vow) is clean, with each step causally and thematically linked, and orientation is solid from the opening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Maru reconceives her transplant from “plot hook” to “practice,” accepting Sairi’s journey as an ethical discipline, with cost implied in the risk and responsibility. The three-morning sequence of tracing dots is efficient escalation rather than meander. Nothing crucial is left dangling or resolved by coincidence, and the donor heart constraint shapes tactics and tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: the storm-night rounds → pin in the silence → sapling discovery → sextant/dream mapping → realization of the labyrinth’s true function → deliberate deconstruction → reconfigured maze. Closure is a clear conceptual repricing: grief shifts from a purely bureaucratic instrument to something that can be “measured yet still heard,” with the protagonist’s stance and the town’s tacit order both reweighted. The story maintains a single coherent drive under a hybrid causal/textural lens, with no orientation debt despite its lyric density. The cost—defying a quietly oppressive civic system—is legible even if institutional backlash is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine—Lysa goes to the greenhouse to weave dawn and save the realm, learns/uses the Loom, swaddles infants, then opens the seam at the mica window—is clean and legible, with clear before/after stakes. Closure lands as a concrete Decisive Change: dawn returns via her crafted cloth, with the cost of her scattered self explicitly acknowledged. Some major turns (e.g., the realm paying her back in memories, the night “tightening like a collar”) are summarized rather than dramatized stepwise, which slightly mutes the sense of mounting difficulty. Still, the story maintains coherence and delivers a satisfying, costly resolution within its lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clear: mistaken invitation → investigation → encounter with Lysa → discovery of cipher → Archivist’s judgment → Marin’s decision, all cohering under a Causal lens. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marin redefines his relationship to solitude and error, with the cost of further retreat from his public identity. Stakes are modest but legible, and the secret-door / hidden-library mechanics remain consistent. The only limitation is that the Archivist’s reversal comes very smoothly, softening the sense of hard-earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is tight and coherent: city erosion → mysterious invitation → tea house revelation → confession and partial absolution → reparative action → coda sprout, all under a clear accumulative/causal lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mina moves from passive noticing and complicity to active, risky repair, with the wheat planting and later sprout marking a before/after in her relation to erasure. Each beat follows logically (her guilt makes Sada’s offer and her acceptance plausible), and the brief patrol-footsteps moment sharpens the sense of cost without needing explicit confrontation. No orientation issues; the piece sustains one dominant drive cleanly through to the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal line is clean: courier → endangered slide → reconstruction attempt → realization that his witnessing must become participatory, culminating in his final vow. The structure is a single accumulating scene with one clear tightening when the slide threatens to go dark and the vow remains fragmented, forcing him to lend it something of himself. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Ilian’s role in the Archive’s mission is conceptually reweighted, with a clear emotional cost implied in his lifelong commitment. A slightly more explicit on-page consequence for failure (beyond conceptual loss) could have pushed escalation further, but for a lyric piece the drive is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: goal → constrained environment (hush) → series of tactical attempts → chaotic public reveal that kills the deal. Each false start is not just incident but a structural tightening that forces new tactics. Closure is decisive and on-page—the bargain dies, sheriff flees, Mara’s proof is planted—with a clear cost in blood and risk. The only slight softness is the off-page reliance on the quartermaster, which leans a bit on convenient trust without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is cleanly causal: ring → journey → encounter → offer → convergence, with each step growing logically from the last and from the world-rules. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural component, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when the “compass” is reframed as pointing to agreements and the narrator chooses to vote for mercy. Cost is legible in the implied danger of aligning with security risks and abandoning Bureau safety, as well as the internal surrender of pure skepticism. Setups (grandmother, taste-listening, elections) all pay off in the final convergence; nothing important is left dangling.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: the echo fading → numbers pulsing → descent to cave → ruined lock → improvised solution → studio → notebook → mural-stage awakening. The piece adheres to a single, continuous throughline with one deepening turn at the discovery of the notebook, which reinterprets the mother’s absence and the meaning of Mara’s work. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Decisive Change when she accepts the larger vocation and activates the hidden stage with her mural. The main structural limitation is that external resistance is minimal, so the lock problem resolves relatively smoothly once she chooses to stay and solve it.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is strong and legible: finding the map → reconstructing it → reaching the hatch → learning about Lio and the cistern → using honesty to reveal the final map layer, culminating in a clear before/after in her options. The drive lens reads primarily as Causal with a thematic overlay, and closure lands as a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing: the city, her relationship, and water scarcity all look different after the conduit revelation. The main weakness is a slight convenience in the inciting discovery (the treasure map under her own floorboard feels a bit neat for such a pivotal secret). Still, escalation and payoff are coherent, and the cost of pursuing the cistern via candor rather than resentment is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.3)
    Structure is clean: the story moves from status quo (Lysa’s ritual) to disruption (Auditor’s decree) to confrontation and a reconfigured order, all within a single continuous scene. Causality is solid—Auditor’s arrival prompts Lysa’s escalation with the sculpture, which triggers the bells’ response, the crowd’s shift, and the ledger’s dissolution. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the system keeps seasonal muteness but with a reweighted, communal understanding of silence and truth, and the ice’s melting extends that closure in time. The cost is primarily conceptual and symbolic (loss of the fragment, rewriting of rules), but it is on the page and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: north shifts → systems wobble → real overheating risk → blocked hatch → need for controlled burn → use of the fear-box → vent trigger → escape and conceptual resolution. Closure is strong: he both saves the roses and reconfigures his relationship to fear/static, with a clear before/after in his orientation and inner noise. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with thematic accumulation, and the story stays in one continuous, well-contained window. The only slight limitation is that the operational mechanics (how exactly the compression vial works, why this old vent protocol still functions) are sketched rather than stress-tested, though not enough to break plausibility or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: locket → courtyard stories → following arrows → key-in-brick reveal → communal reading → conceptual realization of the mailbox’s purpose. Causality holds under a largely accumulative lens, and the closure (reconfiguration of the mailbox from mystery to timed vessel for apology) lands clearly with cost in vulnerability and belated grief. The external pressure (drones, evictions, developer truck) is evocative but doesn’t significantly constrain options or tactics in the climax, feeling more like atmospheric threat than an active line of plot. Still, the story reads as a cohesive single arc with one meaningful deepening and a satisfying, legible end-state.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Lyra returns, can’t cut power, so uses ciphered journal + dance; the guardian presses; she reaches the manual release and reroutes alarms, leading to pods opening and escape. The piece satisfies closure with a decisive change (the detainees freed and moving out) and a conceptual repricing of vulnerability-as-strength via the coded journal. However, the guardian’s threat never fully materializes beyond surveillance tightening and lights cutting, so the climactic beat feels slightly too smooth and low-cost. Structure is otherwise tight, with one continuous, legible scene and no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: beached whale → memory loss → divination → saltworks investigation → discovery of jars → decision to return grief → restoration of names. The piece balances compressed exposition (the council’s bargain with the parasite) with on-page action, and closure clearly registers as a decisive change with cost. The main structural softness is that the town’s consent and the parasite bargain arrive largely as explained backstory rather than dramatized pressure, which slightly dilutes the impact of the reveal. Still, the before/after is unmistakable and the drive lens (primarily causal with conceptual repricing at the end) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: rumor → journey to haven → attempt to hush → encounter with coded prophecy → recognition of double-edged stakes → invention of a third path. The piece maintains a single scene with clear spatial and temporal anchors (night into dawn). Closure is decisive and on-page: she reconfigures the prophecy and chooses to bear the warning personally, foreclosing simple erasure. The cost—personal risk and loneliness of knowledge—is legible though understated rather than dramatized in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is excellent: roof, building, imminent inspection, and stakes are all clear very early. The causal chain is strong and clean—seal → building language → hidden cavity → documents → planted evidence → preservation order → Ilyas’s disappearance. Closure lands with both an external decisive change (heritage protection) and an internal reconfiguration (the building “settles,” Ilyas’s purpose is fulfilled), with a faint but legible cost in his loss. The inspector scene resolves surprisingly smoothly, muting some sense of risk or resistance that could have intensified the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: city rules → appointment → examination of the shell → revelation of the brother’s memory → decision to archive under her own terms, forming a coherent arc under a causal drive lens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines what “safe” memory and independence mean and commits to a new course of action (the workshop) at visible emotional cost. The single-scene structure with a brief forward look to the workshop remains tight and legible. There are no causality breaks or orientation issues, and the quarantine system’s rules hold consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: invitation to confess → offer of key → Liora’s counter-proposal → discovery of the compartment → exposure of Senn’s prior treason → her redefinition of the confession and exit. The piece delivers a clear Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: she rejects both martyrdom and co-optation to write a third-path confession aimed at public judgment. Stakes and knowledge narrow in a single continuous scene, with no orientation issues or unkept set-ups. The future consequences are off-page but the cost of walking toward “the coming judgment” is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine—shell inheritance → warning/map → journey of overheard fragments → nexus confrontation → shell recombination—is clean, with each step motivated by Lira’s goal and new information from the shell. The piece reads under a primarily causal lens with an accumulative texture: each disclosed conversation reorients Lira’s understanding and narrows options. Closure is strong via conceptual repricing: the joined shell redefines echoes as evidence of theft and gives Lira a new mission, with Senn’s restoration as concrete cost paid. The one limitation is that the Choir’s defeat and the larger web’s unraveling feel somewhat abrupt and lightly dramatized, reducing the sense of resistance at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: melted globe → suspicion of heat → Fen’s dream incursions → exploitation of “windows” → shared-dream sting → public exposure, with each step clearly motivated. The shrine and ice lens provide a tight present-time frame that anchors the flashback-like visions, and the ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the globe’s meaning and use are decisively altered. Some high-tension beats (tracking Fen, organizing the confrontation) are summarized rather than dramatized, which trims potential impact but does not break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: Jiro’s nighttime practice and philosophy lead to Ren’s apprenticeship, which enables Ren to read patterns and catch the smuggler sabotaging nets. The story holds a clear drive lens (causal with accumulative texture) and delivers closure through Ren’s conceptual and behavioral shift (“watchfulness could be mended too”) and subsequent tactical action. Stakes—protecting the town’s trade and reclaiming meaning in quiet work—are modest but coherent and paid off on the page. The ending tea scene cleanly seals the before/after without resorting to explanation-heavy wrap-up.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causality is clean and legible: letters → coordinates → Stillpoint → ledger → staged exposure → preemptive mailing before seizure. The single arc from private job to systemic revelation is efficiently compressed and lands a clear closure beat when the protagonist anticipates the Ministry’s move and counters it. The cost—inviting inter-bureau conflict and personal danger—is conceptually strong, though the danger remains offstage. Structure stays within one coherent throughline without dropped set-ups or confusing transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal under a mostly single-scene frame: Eli’s eavesdropping on Mara’s broadcasts leads to her accusation, confession, and their collaborative experiment, which in turn produces the skywide shadow-show that reconfigures the valleys’ loyalties. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he remains alone but now with a blueprint and a reciprocal signal, a legible before/after around how he relates to belief and community. The drive lens is stable and clear, but the path of events lacks a real snag or reversal—the collaboration unfolds with minimal complication, which keeps the structural arc from feeling fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly causal inside an accumulative, lyric frame: Sato finds and “purchases” the box, attempts repair via jars, unlocks the melody, then reintroduces it to the community, culminating in the intergenerational gathering. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his work shifts from private hustle to public bridge with visible cost (giving the jar for free, staking his identity on the ritual). All key setups—the jars, the widow, the unsprung box—pay off organically. The main constraint is that external risk never tightens beyond emotional stakes, so the arc feels elegant but gently sloped.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal line is clear: offer → refusal → attempted theft → sonic intervention → escort to chapel → securing the relic, all under a time pressure that darkness will open the crypt to anyone with the key. Closure lands as an earned stasis/resonant reconfiguration: Lio keeps the relic safe while transforming would-be thieves into witnesses bearing a new quiet, with a felt cost in his ongoing, heavy responsibility. The rules of the relic and the crypt are introduced early enough and not contradicted. Stakes skew more conceptual than visceral in the climax, but they remain coherent and paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: horizon-mapping → awareness of caravans and rumors → discovery of the viaduct → study of its “tides” → training rebels → timed unyoking and grain diversion. The piece uses an accumulative, slightly summary-driven middle, but still preserves a clear before/after and a concrete closure beat. Cost is implied through long preparation and self-discipline rather than an acute on-page crisis, which keeps the structure strong but not searing. One could argue the final operation goes a bit smoothly for the buildup, slightly softening structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal throughline is clean: investigation → discovery of lantern and cut brake → link to unresolved complaints → Kellan’s directive → her counter-move sending evidence out. The closure unit is strong: she formally writes the death as preventable and asserts that the next will not be silenced, a decisive stance reversal under pressure. The magical/psychic aspect of the lantern is integrated enough not to read as a deus ex machina, but the leap to Kellan’s broader contraband operation feels a touch compressed. Overall, the structure fits the length and delivers a clear before/after in her options and allegiance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight: the failed letter → Elias’s doubt → consulting Lena → the alternative plan → the work nights → Mrs. Halden’s visit → Elias’s reframed understanding. Time jumps are compact yet legible, and the prison/shop shuttle is handled with economical summary. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world hasn’t forgiven Darren, but the terms of repentance and “deserving” are reweighted with visible cost (labor, risk, no guaranteed parole). No major set-ups are dropped, and coincidence does not resolve anything.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: Mara’s curiosity → decoding the spiral → recognizing an algorithm → integrating it with the bell and glider → using it to navigate to the dead coast → activating the bell tower → conceptual reframing of the algorithm’s purpose. Orientation is clear early (acid sea, floating workshop, Jory vs Mara), and the structure flows in one coherent arc with a small but legible turn at the coast. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: the algorithm is re-understood as an evolving clapper for a future ear, and Mara’s decision to ring anyway stakes her to that long bet. The only brake on a higher score is that the on-page price and narrowed options at the end are implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is beautifully tight: number anomalies → hidden patch file → audit trail → Chute → Asteria chat → conspiracy → Legal confrontation and coded leak. The structure is linear but compressed, and closure lands as a decisive change in Mara’s stance toward the company, with conceptual cost (career, safety, complicity) clearly implied. The “Chute equals exile not deletion” reconfigures the entire premise of her job and the cold case. A touch more on-page friction or pushback in the morning Legal scene could further heighten the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: shard discovery → dispute → Mara’s investigation with mirrors → reconstitution of the ball → mediated plan for shared duty, with no orientation issues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where private fears are converted into communal responsibilities, and the final image of Mara watching the ice confirms a new, workable equilibrium. However, the sense of a narrowing funnel of options is modest; nothing meaningfully fails or backfires on the way to the solution. The piece leans slightly accumulative/lyric in the middle but stays legible under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Structure is clean: a compressed past-to-present lead-in, then a continuous marina sequence with one escalation (the storm) and a clear closure unit. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: her obsession leads to relief work, which places her with Signe, which sets up the storm rescue and the final reconfiguration of her quest. The closure (“endings approach like weather: you trawl for signs, then let them pass”) is an on-page conceptual repricing with emotional cost, reweighting all previous “study” of endings. Orientation (who/where/why) is clear very early despite the lyrical opening.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean and linear: bus gone → encounter → pavilion conversation → joint decision not to burn → dawn departure, with no orientation issues. Under a situational/accumulative lens, pressure coheres around whether they’ll repeat the burning/erasure pattern or reframe it through mutual witnessing. The closure (Mara keeping the pages intact and the narrator feeling “less mismatched to the world”) is a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after in stance. Stakes remain modest and somewhat abstract, which keeps this just shy of top-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly causal: prophet arrives → parapet destabilizes → elders’ fear → Iri’s bargain → risky dawn ritual → parapet steadied and relationship reconfigured. Orientation is excellent from the first line; the encampment, dunes, and underground parapet are clear and consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Iri chooses to trust and collaborate, the prophet calibrates his voice, and the parapet settles into “steadier sleep,” marking a clear before/after. The cost—risk to the parapet and to Iri’s standing with the elders—is present but held in conceptual tension rather than dramatized consequence, which keeps this just shy of a 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: Mara begins with a private ritual, one encounter with Mr. Gant teaches the social pattern, and this scales outward into a community practice that culminates in the candlelit walk-through. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the town’s stance shifts from isolated grief to shared ownership of hurt, and Mara’s “doorway” exists on the page. Causality is soft but coherent; each expansion logically follows the previous beat without contrivance. The main limitation is that there’s little sense of a risk that the project might fail or fracture, so the final success feels more inevitable than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean and legible: a present-time testimony frame containing three numbered sequences that cover discovery, descent, and revaluation, all converging on the Council scene. Causality is strong for a lyric piece: stealing the crystal → mapping vines → decoding the door → discovering the root lexicon → choosing to frame the hush as cradle, not curse. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: the crystal’s tap reveals the hidden door to the Council, transforming an inquest for blame into an invitation to re-see the library at conceptual cost. The only slight limit is that the Council’s actual reaction is withheld, leaving the external consequences implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece follows a clean quest structure—arriving with an aim, following the driftwood map, locating the hidden microphone, then discovering and adding to the archive—so each beat causally leads to the next. Closure lands when Mira decides to speak her mother’s name into the time-microphone and then copy that living archive onto the unwatched tapes, a clear reconfiguration of her initial goal with conceptual cost (choosing mediated echo over impossible preservation). The drive lens is accumulative/textural but underpinned by clear “because/therefore” linkages, and there are no orientation or causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: quake → clock feedback loop fails → tracking and launch windows ruined → Mara designs the leaf-based governor → stabilizes clock → captures the swarm and greenlights the launch. Structure is tight, essentially one continuous scene with brief, well-anchored backstory that informs present choices (her father’s lesson, Lio’s absence). Closure lands as a concrete Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: the world-state (clock and launch) shifts and her relation to time/loss is reweighted in the last breath. The cost—risking the final window, working through an escalating quake, and accepting only a fleeting, data-mediated redemption—is clear though understated.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal spine is clean: prognosis → Mara’s visit → discovery of the address on the shard → phone call → Jonah’s arrival → shared listening → death. Each step follows convincingly from the prior one, with no arbitrary conveniences beyond the already-given coincidence of the address on the vinyl. Closure lands solidly in the final image of the warped hymn, handclasp, and last breath, with a clear before/after in the state of the family. The drive lens remains causal throughout, with textured lyricism layered on rather than substituting for cause-and-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: Liora activates the key via runes → the loop creates “false noon” → the automaton indicates the crack → the hinge-rune opens the hidden stair → mirrors/door → key-as-traveler → noon reservoir and reconfiguration of the world’s broken noon. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a strong conceptual-repricing closure: understanding noon as a snapped circle reweights the entire “spoons bent reality” premise. Closure is solid—Liora completes the loop, returns the shadows, and implicitly unseals her mentor’s fate—though the cost is more conceptual and inherited than sharply dramatized in a single, pressured decision. There are no orientation debts or unkept set-ups; the only reason this doesn’t go higher is that the stakes and consequences, while coherent, remain mostly at the level of elegant cosmology rather than felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: finding the substitute body → doubt → garden search → tooth and notes → re-examination of corpse → confrontation with the girl → choice to enter the hedge. Closure is solidly a Decisive Change: Rowan commits to the door, reconfigured from skeptic observer to active searcher, with conceptual and practical risk. The only limitation is that some key prior beats (Lina returning changed) are summarized rather than dramatized, slightly softening immediate on-page pressure. Still, the story maintains coherent, escalating because/therefore logic to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows a clear causal line: fishermen’s tale → grotto exploration → discovery and weighing → polishing as working-through → village installation → communal reconfiguration. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural bias, but causality is intact and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of his vow and role. There are no orientation issues; who/where/when are anchored early, and the single-scene-with-coda structure fits the length. The emotional cost of the closure—reframing a long-held vow, risking visibility with neighbors—is on the page and conceptually tight.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal throughline is clean: viral confession → exile → plan to build archive → icicle-code key → summoning Jun → proffering the pendant. The drive lens is essentially causal with lyric texture, and the closure beat—a new alliance plus the cost of giving away the pendant—lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Stakes and constraints (social ostracism, risk of erasure) are mostly handled in-scene rather than summarized. The only soft spot is that the external risk of being caught or the archive being destroyed remains abstract, so structural pressure is more emotional than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is cleanly causal within a lyric frame: shell → nexus → ink river/current → climb to the source book → vow → new ending → reversed river/dawn. The closure beat—Mara choosing to write an ending that resists the contract’s gravity, with the world of the story reconfigured (river reversing, hopes returning)—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible conceptual cost. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal quest inside an accumulative allegory) and holds throughout. The only slight limitation is that external consequences (publisher, career) remain offstage, keeping the cost more thematic than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: Marn arrives under a time-bound summons, attempts a mechanistic remedy, discovers that alone is insufficient, then integrates the keepers’ songs to achieve restoration and hand off the tool. Causality is tight and legible under a primarily causal lens with accumulative texture: each step (vine-harp, crank, failure of machine-alone, communal song, weaving light) follows from the last. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the orchard revives and, crucially, the practice is transferred to the youngest keeper, marking a before/after in communal knowledge. The cost is more conceptual/social than visceral, but it is on the page and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build: arrival in the orchard → ritual with objects and plate → activation of safekept starlight → sealing the well → shared mapping with the cartographer → slight loosening of the aurora. Causality within this lyric frame is coherent and legible; each action grows from the last without teleporting props or rules. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world’s frozen pause is minutely altered and the safekept light is bound with cost (it cannot be used for escape, only for shared stillness). The cost is conceptual and ethical rather than dramatic, but it is on the page and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure—arrival, study, experimentation, solution, departure—is coherent and clearly causal under a textural lens. The cavern’s problem (overflow of echoes) links well to the broken timer and his ultimate fix, and the “last day before the pass closed” gives a soft ticking clock. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the cavern exhales, the timer now holds echoes, and his original aim is reweighted. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival → ritual work → spatial trap → orientation solution → transformed tool → application with widow → reflective return to valley. Causality is tight within the lyric frame: the grotto’s hush and geometry cause the entrapment, the lamp and teacher’s lesson motivate the orientation tactic, and calcification enables escape and the new burden-frame. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the same conditions that trapped the weaver become a chosen “sheltering roof,” with the ongoing cost of bearing others’ burdens in bone. Everything needed for that ending is seeded earlier; nothing critical feels retrofitted.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural drive: one continuous scene, framed by the boiling kettle, in which carving the panel gradually reconfigures Miriam’s relation to her loss. Causality is clean—each memory channel arises from a specific moment (Jory’s teaching hands, the accident, the empty cage) and leads to a carved lesson, culminating in a coherent closure image when the panel returns to clarity. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: she chooses an enduring ritual of teaching over private clinging, accepting that “what is here will go.” Structure and stakes scale appropriately for the length, with no orientation or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal throughline is clean and satisfying: Mara’s longstanding regret drives her to collect fragments, use the camera wheel at the charged hour, negotiate with the lagoon/ghost, pay in images, and then perform a small, precise repair instead of a grand re-doing. Closure lands clearly as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid: she renounces the desire to rewrite the night and accepts a humbler, ongoing role, with the visible consequence of the lagoon rotating to keep the park aloft. Each step is motivated and builds on prior rules (how the lagoon rearranges words, how images live behind her eyelids), with no unkept setups or rule-breaking conveniences. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a strong textural overlay, and that lens holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: discovery of the sextant → discovery of the water system → experiment with redirected flows → power restoration → architectural revelation → antenna beacon. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the accumulative build to the final conceptual repricing (“hope is conserved when it is redirected”) holds together. Closure lands via a clear before/after in the terminal’s state and Lina’s understanding, though the professional and personal costs of defying the demolition brief are underplayed. The piece reads as a tight lyric-leaning causal story with one coherent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulation from desk to forecourt to bear to sunrise, with backstory anchored concretely to present stimuli (stone, vibration, scent). Causality under an accumulative/textural lens is tight: leaving the desk → touching quartz → memory loosening → bear’s arrival → wound/silence insight → new score. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he will not return to bells, but redefines his practice and accepts longing with cost. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the before/after is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is strong: silence on the radio → suspicion → salvage of the wreck → discovery of tape and note → deduction linking it to the Flood Saint myth → decision to hijack the morning broadcast → community’s conceptual shift. The structure is cleanly linear with one major tightening at the discovery of the note, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration when the community regains “choice” over its story. The only structural softness is how smoothly the station infiltration goes—external resistance is almost frictionless—yet this doesn’t undercut the conceptual closure. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear from the outset despite the lyric opening.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal spine is very clean: decoding Mara’s rope → summoning the weaver → learning of the council’s wire plan → urgent demonstration to the clerk → negotiated compromise and symbolic seed-planting. The one-hour deadline before the wire shipment provides clear temporal pressure and focuses the climax on a concrete test (the bowline and the clerk’s name). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: secrecy is traded for survival of the practice, and Lio takes on an expanded role. The cost is conceptual/social more than visceral, but it’s legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is clean: arrival with mandate → waiting in the garden → the queen’s appearance and the projection → the reading of the obituary → the payment/departure, all causally linked. The drive feels primarily accumulative/textural, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration and Conceptual Repricing when her son’s “death” is reframed as mapped absence and the narrator receives the thread as compass. Stakes and cost are legible: she gains a way to live with his absence at the price of accepting him as gone in a new sense, and he takes on a piece of that grief. Closure is satisfying and contained within the scene, with no unresolved structural debts.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Lorian’s dissatisfaction → descent to vats → selection of the improbable egg → return to the Foundry Cradle → assembly and activation of the flawed pattern → pigments and conceptual revelation → choice to leave the Cradle open. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: beauty is recast as error and refusal to be copied, and the world’s rules are implicitly altered. Cost is present but largely conceptual—the risk to the palace’s stability and the bittersweet acknowledgment of an erased wild world—rather than dramatized in concrete consequence. Structure (one continuous arc with a clear tightening at the engine activation) fits the length and holds its lens.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: call → misdiagnosed brush fire → engine stuck → hike in → shack/accelerant → rescue → burn unit → investigator → return to lagoon, all culminating in her deliberate symbolic act. The global drive lens is primarily causal with a strong thematic/accumulative layer, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes and outwardly redirects the family fire legacy. Stakes and options are consistently narrowed, and the investigator’s discovery of the copycat coin is the one neat but earned pivot that sets up the ending. No orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the only restraint is that the investigator beat feels a touch summary compared to the embodied rescue scene.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: clue → geese-timed start → limescale breadcrumbs → maintenance door → underground pedestal → latch solution → memory release → maternal reveal → decision to let the city remember. The story maintains one dominant drive (open the box / free the memories) and lands clear closure when Mara chooses to undo her mother’s protective forgetting. World rules (breadcrumbs, constellations, mechanical logic) hold well enough to support the puzzle structure. The maternal reveal comes late but still reads as an earned, consequential reweighting rather than a bolt-on twist.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: discomfort in the Garden → attempt to activate the gear → engineered transit with sonar and moth → discovery of observatory and automaton → choice about how to return and whom to teach. Closure is decisive and legible: Lior’s stance shifts from seeking an individual solution to instituting a communal, slower change, with clear conceptual cost (risking cultural discipline, accepting limited impact). The structure is linear and clean for a lyric piece, with one main tightening in the nebula passage and a controlled, reflective return. Stakes remain mostly internal and social rather than physically acute, but they’re coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens cleanly: repeated visits, retracing stones, increasing spectral guidance, and the final communal ritual accrete into a clear before/after. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Jonas moves from solitary craftsperson with a question to someone who has embodied an answer in the season-stone and can let the spirit go. Causality is coherent (ribbons → reading clusters → designing new tablet → family gathering), and there’s a legible conceptual cost in accepting grief as shared rather than private. The main limitation is that beats blur slightly into one another in tone, so structural turns are more subtle than they might be for elite-market tension.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: guilt over the missed winding beat leads to examining the pendulum, which reveals the secret weight and Torren’s encoded map, which then leads to recalibrating both clock and tide marker and finally confronting the widow. The structure (tower → discovery → ridge → tower → widow) is clean and easy to follow, with the flashback anchored to specific objects (bob, handle) rather than abstract exposition. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: Mara cannot undo deaths but commits to ongoing correction, and the town’s understanding of engineered imbalance is concretely altered. The only minor limitation is that institutional fallout (council consequences) remains offstage, keeping the resolution slightly quieter than the set-up might allow.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain—widow’s request → silo investigation → tapestry decoding → ash-tree dig → ledger discovery → easing echoes and planting—is clear and satisfying. Closure lands on-page with both decisive change (ledger unearthed, secret understood) and a resonant reconfiguration (the night and echoes reweighted). Stakes and obstacles remain relatively gentle, but nothing breaks logic or undermines the arc. The piece holds a consistent causal lens while allowing lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal throughline is clean: council demand → Jora’s modeling and fieldwork → charter composition → communal adoption in spring. The structure is mostly linear with one well-handled time jump to payoff the charter’s effects, giving clear closure via regional change rather than a purely internal epiphany. The global drive reads as primarily causal with an accumulative thematic layer, and the final paragraphs reweight earlier beats effectively. Stakes, constraints (one-page charter), and outcome are all legible without loose ends that matter at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: famine → secret radio → copying lyrics → luminous dust → Censor crackdown → cloaked scores → public concert as climax, with a resonant before/after in how the city relates to story. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong Causal spine and Accumulative imagery, and the closure is a Conceptual Repricing where story becomes an unavoidable ambient force. Cost is present conceptually (defying harsh censors, recruiting a hunted pirate signal) but under-dramatized; the concert goes off with little concrete resistance beyond a brief Censor intrusion. A bit more friction or a tangible near-loss at the climax would push this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival under curfew → constructing the portrait from fragments → inspectors’ intrusion → near-desecration of the drawing → exit and quiet recommitment. Causality is coherent and accumulative: the illegal, ash-based portrait draws state scrutiny; the rocking chair’s “warning” interrupts the smear at exactly the right moment. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Lira continues her work knowing safety is a mirage, scattering ash into the vanishing light, with emotional and conceptual cost clear. The one slight softness is that the external threat resolves more via atmospheric intervention (the chair) than by a decisive tactical choice from Lira.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: plague aftermath → Council narrative → Orin’s need for proof → decision to dig → discovery → failed institutional recognition → building his own rig. The structure holds as a mostly continuous throughline with one backstory strand (the navigator) that clearly tilts present action. Closure lands as an earned renunciation: he forgoes institutional incorporation and immediate food in favor of an independent, more fragile pedagogy. The cost is legible though relatively quiet—social marginalization and continued precarity rather than a sharper external consequence—keeping this just below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clear: threatened closure → fundraiser with borrowed instruments → rehearsals → performance that shifts the council’s stance, with the zither and the earned silence structurally paying off. Backstory is well-anchored in present stimuli and consistently tilts current choices rather than drifting. The closure—council’s decision and the charged quiet—lands on the page with a legible before/after. The main structural softness is how swiftly and cleanly the council reverses; a bit more resistance or ambiguity in that turn would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is tight and coherent: seed → growth → pruning dilemma → alignment → communal meal → charged final image, with clear because/therefore links. The closure, Mira shaping the tree into an open canopy after using its fruit to seed resistance, reads as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (irreversible escalation against the Ministry). The accumulative build from quiet kitchen acts to the alignment night is smooth and legible. No significant orientation or causality slips interfere with the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal spine is clean and strong: drone drops box → riddle points to tower → Sela’s confession and the queen core → Maro’s truth-opening act that restores the system. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the story maintains a single, continuous throughline with no dropped setups. Closure lands clearly as a decisive change in the world and in Maro’s practice of “legend,” with the honey-of-thunder image reweighting all prior beats. The cost—public exposure of Sela and the council’s failure as the price of repair—is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is accumulative and clean: discovery of the shard → experiments with object placement in Alderwick → expanded practice in other homes → communal test during the blackout → renunciation at the tide line. Causality is legible under a textural lens; each “because” is an intensification of the same drive (to restore aliveness) through increasingly public stakes. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: aliveness is redefined as attention and arrangement, and Mara writes a new rule that forecloses casual displacement for herself. The cost—releasing the shard and accepting that power must be diffused into the city rather than hoarded—is understated but on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight: return to the city → mental summons → threading through weaknesses → chamber/altar → escalating revelations that reframe Nerina’s drowning and Ilyan’s prior testimony. Structure is cleanly linear and contained to one expedition, with the global drive clearly causal and closure delivered as a Conceptual Repricing in “Tell them the whole seam.” Each revelation meaningfully reweights earlier assumptions and deepens stakes rather than feeling like mere info-dumps. The cost—his public error and the political implications of correcting it—is implicit but legible and lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative with causal underpinnings: staircase → dice → proofs → machine → rupture of expectation, all linked by the narrator’s reasoning. Orientation is clear despite the surreal setting, and the global drive (causal/accumulative internal argument) is stable. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: accepting that redemption is not on some future landing decisively reconfigures the meaning of the climb, and the cost is explicit in the shaking hand and long sit. Every major setup (dice, perpetual motion, infinite staircase, missed opportunity) is paid off without loose threads.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative with a causal spine: moonlight → letters → brush → panes → Ro’s arrival → shared song → experiment → community response → Mira’s earned rest. Closure is strong: the offerings and the final word “rouse” reconfigure Mira’s premise from fragile hypothesis to lived proof, with the cost that this belief must now be risked against a still-hostile city. The single-scene frame with embedded flashbacks is clear and never disorients. Stakes are modest but fully honored at this length; one more moment of immediate jeopardy or doubt in the middle could have sharpened the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: eviction notice → plan to hide/rescue the frozen opera cache → communal thawing with bread → transformed museum-opera house → confrontation with guards and partial reprieve. Backstory (family bread custom) is anchored in present stimuli and directly retools current tactics, so it strengthens rather than stalls the scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the guards depart, Nemea’s singing and the museum’s role are reweighted, and the cost (ongoing precariousness) remains palpable. A hair more friction or uncertainty in the final guard encounter could push the structural stakes even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight: backstory → journey to lighthouse → yoyo puzzle → timed initiation → confrontation with the rewound drowning → renunciation and new configuration of life. The drive lens is clearly causal, and the closure is an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: he refuses the rescue and thus changes his future options with cost. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid within the opening paragraph, and there are no causality breaks or unkept setups. The only reason this isn’t higher is that the “stone feeds on certainty” rule edges toward being stated rather than fully dramatized, softening the impact by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight: post-resuscitation curse → need to stop images killing others → seek advisor/funhouse → dictionary paradox → tactical use of clasp in the booth → breaking the curse. Structure is linear and legible, with one escalating corridor of choices leading to a single, decisive act. Closure is on-page and concrete: the photo comes out dull, the advisor collapses back into her own breath, and the funhouse goes dark, clearly marking a before/after. The cost (risk of another lethal photo, self-inflicted pain, and confronting the hall of her own glowing images) is visible at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: broken anchor → drift toward lanes → Leeward’s sonic strategy → storm and freighter encounter → score-guided escape and later rescue. The escalation from impending collision to squall to hunger/boredom reads as a coherent progression under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, and the final beat reconfigures the premise into an ongoing practice rather than a one-off miracle. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his “calling” is repriced as translation rather than prophecy, with the cost of constant vigilance and improvisation implied. A slightly more dramatized on-page consequence (e.g., a narrow miss with the freighter) would sharpen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight: fracture → cistern → stair/journal → reinterpreted city patterns → rivets/watchers alignment → whistle-answer on the gate → opening and crossing. Closure lands cleanly as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing (the gate as a mouth; the watchers as part of the wall; the city mirrored beyond). The cost is largely conceptual and implied—she leaves her world and steps into an unknown “throat”—rather than dramatized in concrete personal or social terms. Structure fits the length well, but a sharper sense of irrevocability or risk at the final beat would deepen the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine: theft of the letter → clandestine meeting → argument over truth vs. peace → negotiated conditional release. Closure is solidly a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s history, Hadrin’s role, and the “noble lie” are all reweighted in the final image of Mara carrying the letter toward morning. Stakes and timeline are legible from early on, and there’s no orientation debt. The only minor limitation is that Hadrin’s capitulation feels a bit swift given his long-term investment in the lie.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: Lira leverages her survey assignment to infiltrate the pavilion, discovers artifacts, is interrupted by Beran, conflicts with him, and escapes while completing her secret mission. The global drive feels primarily causal with a lyric surface; each beat follows intelligibly from the prior one and the raised drawbridge/payroll departure are used coherently. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she has embedded her message in the foundations, preserved the inkwell, and accepted that mapping absence is the only attainable “recovery.” Stakes are modest but consistent with scope, and there are no orientation or lens-clarity failures.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: mission → confusing catalog → alternative hypothesis → hidden cabinet → stamp and registry → incriminating catalog cards → choice of what evidence to remove. Orientation is excellent; the who/where/when and investigative drive are anchored early and never blur. Closure lands as a mix of Earned Stasis and Conceptual Repricing: she exits with knowledge and evidence that reweights the council and the maps, while accepting secrecy’s cost. The only limiter is that external pressure (time, danger in the water, or active obstruction) remains mostly conceptual rather than structurally constraining her options.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight and legible: loss → preparation (gem polishing) → journey to basilica → learning the rule about luring shadows with dreams → costly ritual on the spire that brings Jalen’s shadow back. The piece lands clean closure: Mira’s before/after is clear as she converts her private torment into public lanterns that help other mourners, with an on-page cost of leaving part of herself in the light. Structure is mostly linear with one smooth transition from tea garden to basilica, holding together under a causal lens with lyric overtones. Escalation could benefit from one more concrete complication or genuine risk of failure at the spire, but nothing breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is tight: we get a clear present-moment problem (overload, countdown while breakers cool) intertwined with the long-arc drive to locate “unused potential.” Causality is clean under a mostly causal/partly conceptual lens: overload → drift into pool → geode calibration → perception of alternate branch → choice to change guidance nets. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost—the protagonist can’t reclaim his own branch but alters future drones—which is clearly legible on the page. The only mild limitation is that the transition from abstract mapping to “I can feed this into the guidance net” is compressed and could bear one more concrete beat of resistance or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: arrival → offering of the chip → decision to search via drone → discovery of the notch and hidden passage → assembly of matrices → activation of the tuner. The piece delivers clear closure via a conceptual and experiential shift—belonging reframed as alignment of missing pieces—and this shift is enacted on the page. Stakes and prior information pay off without teleports or late rule changes. Cost is mostly retrospective (his long pilgrimage, the war’s erasures) rather than sharply felt in the climactic moment, but the structure itself is tight.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is clean: her profession → driftwood discovery → recognition of shared past → moral crisis at delivery → confession and Jonah’s refusal of the capsule. Backstory about the storm and community hush is efficiently folded into the present, clearly reweighting the terrace interaction rather than stalling it. Closure is a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration: she abandons manufactured memory, he declines the service, and they commit to returning the watch hand. The cost—surrendering an easier narrative for both of them—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    The scene is tightly structured around a single exchange window, with the moon-phase protocol and “crack in the flagstones” giving a clear, contained arena. Causality is clean: the neutral rules and wire restraint force Lena into the pivotal improvisation with the drawer pull, which then cascades into the shared apology and symbolic reparation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the boy crossing with the handle reweights the entire war/home premise with a felt cost. The only small limitation is that the early threat (Lena as first hostage) never reenters the immediate stakes once the exchange proceeds.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is tight: canceled ferries and bad weather lead to the inland route, which leads to the decision to face the logbook, culminating in the written confession. The global drive lens reads as Causal with a strong internal arc, and closure is a clear Decisive Change combined with Resonant Reconfiguration: he stops hiding and concretely offers information that might save others. The squall and Lita’s parallel run provide a clean mid-story tightening that tests his resolve. There are no orientation issues or causality breaks, and the cost of his choice is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causality is clean: procedure → ball and hints → newspaper trail → labyrinth → staged moral tests → final decision. The structure compresses an extended journey but keeps orientation clear and uses each set-up (newspapers, ball, lake, quotes) in later beats. Closure is decisive and on-page: he rejects the safe exit and chooses testimony, reconfiguring his path with implied legal and personal consequences. The only mild weakness is the time traveler’s explanatory speech, which edges toward didactic but doesn’t break the spine.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story tracks cleanly from set-up (fortune + orchard) through ritual, apparition, the condition of change, to metamorphosis and passage, with clear because/therefore linkages. The closure—a decisive transformation and crossing with visible cost—is fully on the page and satisfies the initial drive to “reforge a bond beyond death.” Structure is essentially one continuous scene with steady forward motion; there are no orientation or lens-clarity problems. One could argue for an extra beat of resistance before the yes, but causality and closure remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight: missing minutes → ominous tarot → blank on the tablecloth → crack in the saucer → ascent to the glade → confrontation with the pouch → negotiated return of time → repaired tablecloth. Closure is a decisive reconfiguration: she forecloses the strategy of “unfastening” herself from time and commits to bearing it, with the scar-line on the cloth as concrete cost. The accumulative, lyric progression remains clear under a consistent lens, and there are no orientation debts. Stakes and rules introduced early (lost time, cards, cloth) are all paid off cleanly without retroactive patching.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: promise to the child → rumor of the dimension → method via photos → construction of the quilt → confession to Lio → activation of vial/quilt → opening the hatch and stepping through. Causality is strong under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens; each mystical rule (tears as seam, honesty as heat, vial as catalyst) is seeded before being used. Closure is decisive and on-page—she opens the dimension and carries Lio through—and the emotional cost (confronting her own cruelty, leaving the dead ship) is legible. There are no orientation issues or unkept setup elements.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: present-time frame on the beach with one embedded day-summary, then a single foray into the cave and back out, all following a clear causal chain under a slightly mystical logic (hush → cave → tremor → guided escape → gathering villagers). The global drive reads as Hybrid (causal survival thread + accumulative thematic build), and closure as a resonant reconfiguration: her question about transformation is answered in a way that reweights her giving. Coincidence is framed as her chosen medium rather than a cheat, so the bugs guiding them out and the timely crack in the wall feel set up. Stakes escalate coherently from personal inquiry to life-or-death eruption, but the danger beats resolve a bit quickly, softening potential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: blackout → terrace/sundial move → signal to co-conspirators → locks easing → Orven’s inspection beat → coordinated exfiltration. The covert revolution’s success by dawn and the image of intact-yet-usurped locks provide a clear on-page closure with a legible before/after. The drive lens (causal with a textural overlay of images) holds throughout, and the stakes (who owns the locks and the fort’s power) are coherently resolved. The main limitation is that complications never seriously threaten to derail the plan, so structural pressure feels slightly under-tested for a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal: friction’s disappearance → Lysa’s death and promise → Eren’s experiments with dust and stones → Marel’s arrival with a concrete need → the joint ritual that reveals Lysa’s rocks and the word “Forgive,” culminating in his decision to stay. Backstory is well-anchored in present stimuli (the bluff, the harness, the vial) and consistently tilts current choices rather than pausing the story. Closure is decisive and on-page, with a clear before/after in Eren’s stance toward his curse and his promise. No major causal seams or orientation issues surface despite the high concept.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece teaches an accumulative, single-night ritual structure early and then honors it: arrival → setup with map/timer → repeated exposures → father reveal → reweighted ending. Causality is clean (the timetable leads to the envelope, which leads to the father’s note, which reorients the vigil’s meaning), and there’s no orientation debt. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: the narrator decisively shifts from seeking louder speech to “measured light” as their mode of resistance, with cost and acceptance visible. The before/after is legible and earned without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: investigation → discovery of the coded route → confrontation over the card → duel → public revelation and political consequence. The piece achieves a solid Decisive Change (Veller’s arrest, the plan’s unveiling) plus a conceptual reweighting of the atrium and anthem. Stakes and information all pay off on-page, with no orientation debt or broken rules. The cost is more conceptual and civic than personally visceral, which slightly limits impact at elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is tight and accumulative: street poet → prison library connection → riots/lockdown rupture → discovery of the rusted branch → founding of the open library → two-way clandestine exchange. Causality is clean (the coffee tin and Mara’s dream set up the later tactics) and the time jumps are legible without bogging down in exposition. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: two libraries quietly sustaining each other, with enduring constraints (prison walls, surveillance, instability) still in place. The cost—risk of contraband, loss of the original library, Len’s own instability—is implicit but clear enough to give the before/after real weight.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight: flickering compasses → courier’s reel → exploration via projector → discovery of the refuge room → choice to play the forbidden chord and then to improvise a new ending. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay, and closure lands clearly when Lio rejects an endless loop in favor of finite goodbyes, reconfiguring his relationship to time. The cost—giving up refuge from endings and accepting his wife’s absence—is on the page and tied to his decisive musical act. No major orientation or rule-breaking issues undermine the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clean causal spine (Council’s request → climb → experimental setup + dreamwork → vision → planting ritual → sprouting tree → crowd and monsoon test) with no orientation issues and a clear before/after. Closure is strong: the knowledge-tree is reawakened, the island’s memory re-anchored, and Tavo’s stance on “proof” is reconfigured with on-page cost (surrendered certainty). The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural component, and it holds through the end. The one mild limitation is that the path is very smooth—few genuine surprises or complications appear once the method is accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: arrival → Sera’s teaching → trek to the cove → boarding the Wanderer → bonsai pruning and realization. Causality under a textural lens holds: each step grows organically from the compass’s pull and Sera’s method, and the closure (needle pointing inward, pruning) lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost. The “tides of remembrance” concept and the lace instructions are introduced early enough and brought back in the climax, so there are no dangling setups. Escalation remains quiet, but the ship encounter and bonsai cut tighten the emotional stakes decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative drive lens holds firmly, using the dust experiment to bridge the gap between abstract grief and concrete repair. The closure (a Conceptual Repricing) lands effectively, though the discovery of the structural rot via butterfly scales pushes the bounds of plausibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.1)
    The plot hinges on severe physical impossibilities: melting sand requires ~1700°C (unattainable in a stone campfire), and embedding paper in molten glass would incinerate it instantly. Additionally, the structure is overly episodic, reading more like a synopsis of a longer story than a dramatized short.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path that lacks a "try-fail" cycle or complicating midpoint. The resolution relies on a "magic logic" calibration that fixes the central issue instantly, making the climax feel procedural rather than dramatic. The closure works conceptually but arrives without the requisite narrative resistance to make it satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from an inciting arrival to a decisive, cost-laden action (sacrificing air/safety to power the machine). While the mechanics of using breath and a lens to transmute sound into light rely on dream logic, the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "chased stillness" is pacified—lands with undeniable emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story employs a mosaic structure that effectively spans time, though the heavy reliance on iterative summary ("The next week," "Then a rumor") in the first half slightly distances the reader from immediate scenic pressure. The transition to the specific midnight climax is well-handled, and the closure—ringing the bell in daylight—is a resonant Decisive Change that reconfigures the story's central rule set.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative structure is linear and relies heavily on a *deus ex machina* (the pilgrim) to facilitate the climax. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible and the camera obscura mechanism provides a clear "before and after," the lack of complications or failed attempts makes the resolution feel too convenient for a literary drama.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality is impeccable within the story's dream logic; the "halo fragment" is established early as a key that unlocks the "paper" reality, and the climax logically follows the rules of that magic. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration—lands with the tangible cost of the destroyed history and the woman's disintegration, resolving the bridge's instability.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central puzzle is solved instantly via summary ("By decoding the arrangement... she reads"), bypassing the struggle required to earn the entry. The "bear" escape, while inventive, resolves the tension with a whimsical shift that feels convenient rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative structure compresses three distinct timeframes (request, fabrication, fitting) into a short space, which technically exceeds the "continuous scene" default but works as a cohesive causal chain. The resolution relies on a "magic gadget" reveal (hearing the cut line in the voice), which risks convenience, but the emotional logic holds the lens securely. Closure is definitive and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving efficiently from the setup of the theft to the supernatural mechanism of the door. Closure is decisive and resonant, utilizing the established "moonbeam" logic to resolve the plot without a deus ex machina. The causal link between the stolen moment and the opening door is taught and paid off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from a return driven by external thawing to a resolution driven by internal warmth. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the transformation of the bunker into an observatory physically manifests the psychological shift.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.5)
    Causality strains significantly under the contrived nature of the clues; the antagonist writing incriminating dates on a child's cast only to wipe them is implausible. The climax relies on unearned mechanics, where a seashell inexplicably functions as a tape recorder and smudged notes physically "project" onto a wall, breaking the story's established reality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, pivoting beautifully around the destruction of the booklet. The move from visual reliance to aural/internal navigation constitutes a decisive Conceptual Repricing that satisfies the closure requirement with clear cost (the ruined gold, the lost star).

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The closure functions as a decisive Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist’s programming, earned by the visible cost of the cracked bridge. The loop mechanism is taught efficiently, and the exit is driven by a clear, character-specific decision to preserve the "truer present" over infinite knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The plot is tightly constructed around the lens and ticket mechanism, leading to a strong confrontation scene with Eli. However, the resolution feels unearned; the board’s immediate acceptance and the "thawing" of deep institutional mistrust happen too conveniently upon seeing the evidence, lacking the resistance or friction that would make the victory feel genuine.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes a flawless Conceptual Repricing at closure: the luck meter validates him not for magic, but for the physiological alignment of authentic work. The causal chain is tight, moving from the inciting meter reading to the ritualistic confession, and the resolution satisfies the premise while subverting the expected "magical" outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive, moving efficiently from the experiment to the crisis and resolution. The use of the "sideways time" mechanic to fix the rotor is a clever, satisfying closure (Decisive Change) that validates the premise without over-explaining. The plot logic holds together well within the short scope.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed around the decoding mechanic, moving cleanly from the pit to the rehearsal room with clear causal linkages (water reveals map -> map leads to location -> action yields next clue). The closure—reconfiguring the orchestra into the corridors—is a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration that logically follows the established rules of the ghost's game.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is seamless, moving from the fever-break orientation through the pivotal "smudge" scene to a decisive external confession. The closure is a high-quality Conceptual Repricing where "swaying" is revalued from instability to resilience, grounded in the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is compelling, with a strong closure that effectively reconfigures the relationship and the protagonist's burden. However, the mechanics of the hidden note—painted over yet containing a written confession—strain logical credibility (why write a confession if she "never told anyone"?) in an otherwise grounded investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative loop (Library → Refuge → Return) creates a sturdy structure for the thematic pivot, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the keeper’s duty—lands effectively. The causality of the swan-portal is imaginative and established early, anchoring the surrealism. Momentum sags slightly in the middle, where dialogue explains the refuge’s purpose rather than letting the action demonstrate it.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Mara whistling) is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, but the ending is undercut by a summarizing epilogue that explains the resolution rather than letting the scene land. The "healing" progression follows a standard trajectory without significant causal friction or unexpected setbacks. The timeline compression ("Weeks passed") weakens the buildup to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is cohesive, moving from investigation to realization with a clear, resonant closure. The connection between the physical alignment of the tapestry and the metaphysical "displaced axis" is handled with strong poetic logic, though the specific realization about "dreaming minds" anchoring the axis feels slightly more like an epiphany than a causally derived conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving efficiently from the inciting departure to the lighthouse crisis. The causal pivot—the "west steps" prophecy acting as a warning rather than a literal direction—is a brilliant structural turn that leverages the established magic system for a decisive resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight and inventive, with Selo's interventions logically dismantling the parasite's hold via established magic rules. The closure is a valid Decisive Change (the drawing of the circle), though its impact is slightly softened by the narrator explicitly explaining the philosophy ("exorcism was less a battle...") rather than letting the image stand alone. The cost remains largely abstract/conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a precise Accumulative/Lyric arc where the ritual preparation pays off in a resonant moment of alignment. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the protagonist's relationship to time through the setting's specific mechanics, satisfying the high bar for lyric causality.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative demonstrates excellent efficiency, establishing the loop mechanics and stakes immediately within the "breath held moment." The causal chain is tight: the tablet triggers the fracture, and the protagonist's specific skill set solves it. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the timelines fold, landing with the tangible cost of her rising "heavier" and losing her escape mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear, tight causal arc from diagnosis to resolution, with the "backward song" mechanic providing a satisfying logical pivot. The closure is decisive and legible, effectively reconfiguring the status quo. The inciting incident and climax are well-paced, though the solution relies on a slightly convenient magical interaction (scratching the record hurts the entity) that is accepted largely due to the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is efficient, moving from a tense setup to infiltration and resolution via a distinct methodology ("lateral progression"). The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing solitude as a choice rather than a defense. A slight drag occurs mid-story with the exposition-heavy whisper explaining the quarantine's true purpose, but the causal chain holds.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative momentum is generally strong, but the discovery of the ledger serves as a convenient plot device that externally absolves Lio of his debt and shame, softening the closure's earned cost. Additionally, the expository paragraph regarding Glassharbor’s knowledge of the transformation briefly drags on the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is definitive and structurally robust; the slipknot mechanism serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the premise, resolving the immediate threat while establishing a lingering conceptual cost (the burden of the gatekeeper). The logic of the magic system is taught clearly via the rope's history and paid off with the "third game" resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is clear and the "Conceptual Repricing" closure—accepting the unfinished world rather than restoring the old—lands effectively. However, the climax relies on fable-logic where the "knot" loosens immediately upon being found, lacking a "try-fail" cycle or a felt price paid for the success.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    The scene possesses a tight causal chain where the static diagnosis leads directly to the decision to use real shame. Closure is excellent; Orin’s transformation is completed physically while his humanity is restored, and Mira’s act of writing the name serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration of her professional boundary.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "conceptual repricing" of the error at the closure is satisfying. However, the ending relies on a high-coincidence loop (the letter returning to her) that feels convenient rather than causally earned, and the time-jump to the epilogue dissipates the scene's immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a clear inciting incident to a Resonant Reconfiguration at the arbor. The "seventh day" time jump creates a slight mosaic feel that works within the fable mode, though the discovery of the tag relies partly on luck ("flared"). Closure is strong, with the act of weaving the lattice serving as a decisive integration of the protagonist’s skills into the community.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.4)
    The causal chain is flawless; the "interrupted cadence" functions simultaneously as the thematic core, the physical lock mechanism, and the protagonist’s pivotal action. The closure lands as a "Charged Poise," where the immediate goal is achieved but the cost (the accrued time-debt) hangs heavy and unresolved, perfectly fitting the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is solid, with clear orientation and a logical progression of the magic system leading to a decisive closure. The ending successfully reconfigures the relationship (reachable but not retrievable) with visible cost. The only slight drag is the reliance on explicit summary of the realization ("took that as the theorem") rather than letting the bridge image carry the full weight of the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a significant coincidence (the cabinet springing open in a power surge) to provide the key resolution object, bypassing necessary struggle. While the emotional closure is legible, the linear, obstruction-free path to the ending lacks the causal friction or paid cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on iterative summary ("By noon," "In the evenings") which distances the reader from the climax of rebuilding the trellis. While the causal chain from the linden leaf to the transformation is coherent, the ending—mailing findings to a university—feels slightly clinical and tidy, deflating the mystical resonance of the preceding metamorphosis.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain with a defined beginning, middle, and end, achieving a Decisive Change at the climax. However, the pacing feels compressed and synoptic ("We lifted the stones," "At low tide we walked"), reading more like a summary than a fully dramatized scene. The convergence mechanism is convenient, but the emotional logic of the closure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the inciting incident is sharp, but the resolution relies on a soft magic fix ("tuning" via song) that de-escalates the threat too easily. The causality of the ending feels more thematic than distinct: the entity leaves simply because they sing, without a "decisive change" in tactics that costs something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    The closure is resonant, successfully reconfiguring the town's silence into invitation. However, the structure relies heavily on iterative summary ("seven days, then fourteen") to span weeks, trading the immediate pressure of a continuous scene for a fable-like montage that distances the reader from the process.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is sturdy, moving logically from the route-mapping method to the surreal station. Closure lands effectively with a decisive change (boarding the train) that feels earned by the prior test, though the transition to the "Fortress" is slightly abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulation of transcribed squares builds coherent pressure toward the "blank space" resolution, a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration that revalues the silence of grief. The arrival of Leena functions effectively as a pressure-intensifier fitting the established logic, and the closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent; the solar storm causally drives the spatial mutiny, which necessitates the amulet’s use. Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist is fundamentally rewritten by his choice, satisfying the premise with high conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    The plot moves with strong causal linkage, escalating clearly from the prep room setup to the confrontation with the agents. Closure is decisive; Mara's intervention reconfigures the outcome and permanently alters her standing with Ivo. The agent's rapid softening relies slightly on the fable-like quality of the ink, but the physical use of the "toe tag" grounds the turn in psychological reality.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure works well, moving from the shop to the mountain to deepen the central metaphor. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing of the silence, effectively shifting the protagonist's stance from mourning to artistic preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc moves cleanly from an accumulative mode (collecting fragments) to a causal investigation triggered by the label, landing on a strong Resonant Reconfiguration. The discovery of the files provides a concrete focus for the closure, satisfying the setup without resolving the unresolvable (his own death). The pacing is tight, though the "woman in a neon vest" providing the key clue is a slightly convenient bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative structure is a linear scavenger hunt driven by the compass and letter rather than protagonist agency; he follows instructions until the ritual succeeds. While the transition into the "whisper" timeframe is imaginative, the progression lacks causal friction or setbacks. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "universal riddle" solution feels like a foregone conclusion of the ritual steps.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative operates as a high-level synopsis or fable-like summary rather than a dramatized story, relying on "and-then" sequencing that spans weeks without a continuous scene window. The resolution is unearned and convenient; the antagonist's immediate capitulation upon seeing the moving city ("realized privatization would turn all this into a museum") functions as a "soft reset" that dissolves the conflict without genuine struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.4)
    The "chemical clock" serves as a brilliant structural device, creating a tactile countdown (Accumulative lens) that dictates the pacing. Closure is earned and resonant (Charged Poise), securing the memory before the "museum" era begins.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.6)
    The causal chain is clean and the resolution is clear, but the ending acts as a "soft reset" (problem solved by skill) rather than a reconfiguration with a legible cost. The absence of a felt price paid by the protagonist caps the score, as the closure resolves the external stake without altering the internal status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from puzzle to solution to verification with strong momentum. The use of condensation on the window to provide exact map coordinates is a creative but slightly convenient coincidence that leans on poetic logic rather than strict causality. Closure is decisive and resonant, with a clear cost (political danger) acknowledged on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, but the resolution relies on "symmetric satisfaction" where the magical mechanism solves the structural and bureaucratic conflict too easily. The causality of walking fixing physical architecture is accepted as a premise, but the climax—the official simply folding his paper—lacks friction or earned cost beyond mentioned bleeding feet.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure is excellent, with a tight causal chain where the environment actively reacts to the protagonist's struggle (pulling the wire tightens the hush). The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the method of rescue from technology to memory with a felt cost that justifies the risk. The logic of the magical realism holds firmly from inciting incident to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from a specific backstory to a high-tension discovery and a resonant "Charged Poise" closure. The ending leaves the door ajar both literally and metaphorically, paying off the setup with a felt cost: the protagonist possesses the truth but knows he remains the "cry-wolf" boy in the eyes of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, leading to a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration where the debt is paid with visible, physical cost. The closure is earned, resolving the immediate conflict while leaving a resonant emotional echo that fits the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story utilizes a chronicle/montage structure ("weeks ago," "one dawn") rather than a contained scene, which diffuses immediate narrative tension. While the closure lands a strong conceptual reconfiguration, the lack of a dramatized climax prevents the cost from being felt in real-time.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story relies heavily on narrative summary spanning weeks, violating the single-scene default and reducing the immediacy of the inciting incident and climax. While the closure is logically coherent, the reliance on synopsis prevents the cost from being viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causality is generally strong, moving from the scan to the discovery of the theft, but the climax relies on a convenient coincidence where the child's pre-existing hopscotch squares align with the thief's hidden route. This "lucky break" weakens the investigative logic, even if the trap mechanism itself is clever.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot is tightly constructed with a clear causal chain and a decisive closure that alters the status quo. The resolution of the guard scene relies on a rapid application of the "adjacent possibility" mechanic; while established, this solution feels low-cost for the protagonist, preventing entry into the 9.0+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pivot from "back" to "before" is a brilliant Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes the narrative goal from impossible time-travel to moral courage. The arrival of the brother borders on convenient coincidence—resolving the separation without an active external signal from Mara—but fits the fable-like logic and serves as the necessary test for her crystallized internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.7)
    The central mechanism (decrypting the cast) is clever and the inciting incident is strong. However, the resolution relies on a "fable logic" where a single explanation instantly dissolves deep sectarian hatred, making the closure feel unearned and frictionless despite the causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (waking with the altered film) effectively bridges the dream and reality. However, the reliance on the "knowledge network" moths to solve the central puzzle (aligning the film) weakens the causal chain, turning the protagonist into a passive recipient of instructions.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    The "nested awakenings" structure is executed with precision, teaching the reader the dream logic immediately so the recursive deepenings feel inevitable rather than disorienting. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; the return to the initial physical space with altered knowledge creates a tangible sense of change.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is solid, utilizing the established greenhouse conditions to resolve the climax logically. The summary bridge (&quot;Within a week&quot;) slightly dilutes the tension of the conspiracy forming, but the closure—a Charged Poise where the protagonist stalls for the group—lands effectively with implied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, leading to a Decisive Change where the armistice is renewed through a necessary sacrifice. The mechanism of the resolution is logically planted, though the pacification of the captains' grandchildren feels slightly accelerated.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clean, competent causal arc: diagnosis, quest, retrieval, and repair. Orientation is immediate and grounding ("opal library," "glass-orchid caretaker"). The transition to the museum and back is handled smoothly within the short scope, and the closure—lighting the orchids—lands with a clear sense of restored order and "softened" regret.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, with a clear inciting incident (the team's departure) and a defined closure unit (the restoration of trust). The revelation of Ilyon's test provides a satisfying causal twist that deepens the resolution. The pacing is effective, though the resolution relies heavily on the magic system to bypass interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from a public impasse to a private discovery and back to public resolution. The closure (Accord signed via technical compromise) creates a Resonant Reconfiguration of the factional conflict. The forensic analysis beat is slightly convenient for a machinist's toolkit but is handled swiftly enough to maintain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.4)
    Causality is tight and masterful; the "paper trail" clue elegantly subverts expectations, turning a source of suspicion into proof of loyalty. The closure lands with a Decisive Change (sending the birds) backed by a Resonant Reconfiguration of her worldview, satisfying the drive lens completely.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, following a clear scavenger-hunt structure that leads logically to the climax. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where Mira accepts the distance as a form of connection. However, relying on a written message to explicitly explain the story's logic ("sacred thresholds exist where...") weakens the dramatic impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is graceful, moving from inspection to connection with excellent pacing. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—the feather shifts from a warrant of death to an oath of belonging. The causality of opening the jar leading to the shared walk is sound.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies on a significant coincidence ("the answer fluttered down from the sky") to bridge the investigation and the discovery, bypassing the need for active problem-solving. The resolution operates on a low-cost loop: the protagonist diagnoses the issue, prescribes a fix, and the world immediately resets without unexpected complications or sacrifice. Causality is soft; the bird seeds appearing exactly when needed undercut the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure perfectly executes the "orchestrated serendipity" premise, turning a random game into a causal rescue mechanism. The "coincidence" of the boy's location is earned by the established rules of Milo's attention and the sanded board. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the rescue becomes part of the performance art.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Causal lens holds firmly; the release from the bench is earned by the completion of the verse and the mastery of the garden's rhythm. Closure arrives as a Decisive Change—fledging into a network of exiles—with the paid cost of the permanent tattoo and the binding to city grief.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.1)
    The resolution relies on "fable logic" where a committed antagonist instantly reverses policy due to a poetic metaphor. This lacks causal credibility and elides the necessary cost for such a victory.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is decisive with Mara's choice to confess, but the backstory block (~40% of the text) stalls momentum significantly. The pivotal turn relies on a summarized internal process ("reflecting deeply") rather than dramatized interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is efficient and coherent, moving from the grotto experiments to the town's rescue with clear causality driven by the multiverse discovery. Closure is a Decisive Change (escape/lift), logically following the established rules. The town's rapid "unknotting" leans heavily on fable logic, but fits the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    The closure—a lie to authority to preserve dignity—is impactful and well-earned. The mid-story relies heavily on the "found diary" trope to deliver exposition and mechanics, which stalls the active discovery process until the film strip is used.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands clearly with a Decisive Change, but the causality relies heavily on the mirror revealing a perfect solution where doing the "right thing" yields no external loss. The lack of a difficult trade-off (the protagonist gains both the boy's life and the sister's survival by giving up a crutch) reduces the narrative tension and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure is impeccable, utilizing the ritual steps to create a tight causal chain that leads inevitably to the resolution. The ending lands a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the redefinition of peace from a signed paper to "daily labor" is earned by the preceding sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure—breaking the egg—is a resonant reconfiguration of the goal. However, the climax relies on a "malfunction" (wafer cracking while the shell remained intact) which feels slightly convenient and physically counterintuitive, softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is strong and the orientation is immediate, establishing the stakes and setting efficiently. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change that lands firmly, though the mechanics of the resolution (the prepared threads) feel slightly convenient, resembling a puzzle solution rather than a tactical adaptation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative suffers from "synopsisitis," compressing a complex timeline into summary beats ("Tonight...", "On opening night...", "Weeks later") that dilute tension. The structural jump to the "weeks later" epilogue creates a "Symmetric Satisfaction" ending where all conflict dissolves into a happy circle, undercutting the raw cost of the contract signed in the bar. The pacing moves too fast to let the stakes land viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a tight causal chain where the discovery of the logbook—triggered by the snapped frame—directly informs the solution (cadence). While finding the wing is a serendipitous inciting clue, the subsequent logic of using the technician's failure to engineer a solution is rewarding and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is precise and satisfying, following a clear process logic from invitation to casting. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that creates a tangible artifact of memory, though the lack of significant setbacks makes the trajectory feel slightly linear and low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is clear and closure lands with a tangible cost (blood/thumbprint). However, the middle section relies on a dream-vision dump to deliver exposition about the generals and the forest, which stalls momentum and functions as a convenient backstory delivery mechanism rather than active discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and causally driven, moving seamlessly from discovery to decoding to the decisive threshold. The closure is a quintessential Resonant Reconfiguration, where the snapping of the stylus physically manifests the internal cost of the covenant. The "circuit traces" reveal is a well-earned twist that recontextualizes the setting without breaking the established reality.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tight, with the established rule of the reappearing pin converting a potential deus ex machina into a strategic beat. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where resentment is traded for peace—lands effectively. The resolution relies heavily on the magical efficacy of the box, which works within the fable-like logic but feels slightly swift in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clean Causal lens where the protagonist’s initial failure with the sextant forces a tactical pivot (force vs. invitation). The closure is a valid "Conceptual Repricing," where the physical territory is traded for a captured reflection. The logic of the magic system is taught efficiently, and the final beat lands with the weight of a completed process.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and efficient, moving from the breach to a specific repair task that tests the protagonist's resolve. Closure is strong: the girl's reconfiguration of the ribbon's purpose creates a Resonant Reconfiguration that answers the "deciduous vow" premise with a fresh image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative executes a clean Causal/Situational loop where the closure (writing the accession note) acts as a high-cost Conceptual Repricing of Mara's life. The bootstrap paradox is handled with mechanical precision, using the logbook and cameo to lock the causality on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a linear, episodic structure (obstacle-solution) where tension dissolves quickly via the protagonist's expertise. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the repetition of the "renegotiation" mechanic to solve both major conflicts makes the causality feel mechanical and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream logic, but the resolution relies on a convenient property of the swatch card (unfolding into a fabric book) that wasn't foreshadowed. The climax resolves via a "magic key" moment where narrating instantly clears the fog, lacking a sense of earned struggle or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "just-so" structure where the magic system accommodates the protagonist without friction. The resolution relies on a convenient ritual that works perfectly on the first try, leading to a tidy ending that resolves the institutional conflict without personal cost to Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clean, coherent arc from inciting incident to a resonant reconfiguration of the status quo. The transition from physical mapping to inter-species negotiation is handled well, with the ice-reading sequence serving as a strong bridge. The closure lands effectively, establishing a new, stable paradigm for the world.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is coherent, but the resolution suffers from "symmetric satisfaction"—the world answers the protagonist's hope immediately and perfectly without exacting a visible cost. The arrival of the caravan by dawn, timed exactly with the signal, feels convenient and lowers the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal trajectory where the established mechanic (conjecture) solves the climax. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration that solidifies the protagonist's new role, effectively balancing the surreal premise with grounded logic.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    The pivotal discovery of the note relies on a convenient magical coincidence (the tile warming "as if waiting") rather than agency, weakening the causal chain. Additionally, the resolution is rushed; the Council's deep-seated political resistance evaporates instantly with a "grin," bypassing the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and distinct, using the "tangential approach" as both a magical mechanic and a conversational tactic to turn the beat. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor transforms from doom to passage, and the move north is a decisive action with the felt cost of abandoning the ancestral grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, utilizing the gravity inversion to physically manifest the internal struggle. Closure is excellent; the final image of the jar opening in the room constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration, visibly altering the protagonist's relationship to their environment. The drive lens holds perfectly from the setup through the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from the inciting arrival to a resonant closure without wasted motion. The causality is tight: the storm glass warns, the car reacts, Elias intervenes, and the resolution is earned through that specific tactic. The ending—a Resonant Reconfiguration of Mara's state—lands with genuine emotional weight and clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.7)
    The plot is a coherent linear quest with a legible Causal drive, but the obstacles (travel, painting, gate) offer little resistance, creating a "smooth run" effect. Closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (updating history instead of ruling), but the lack of causal complications or setbacks flattens the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound, following a clear mythic logic from the encroaching threat to the ritual resolution. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lio is released and Mara accepts her stasis, though the progression feels linear and slightly inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from the inciting financial pressure to a community-based resolution. While the "glitchy text" acting as an instruction manual slightly mechanizes the middle beat, the shift to collective burden-sharing provides a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc to a strong Decisive Change closure, where the abdication is enacted with visible cost. However, the investigative leap from the handle to the hidden shelf relies heavily on "intuition" rather than derived clues, and the dust-pointing mechanism, while poetic, borders on magical convenience. The structure is otherwise sound, satisfyingly linking the opening rumor to the final restitution.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream-logic where the discovery of the program causally leads to the ritual and release. Closure is distinct and resonant: the acquisition of the compass and the renunciation of the order mark a legible Decisive Change with conceptual cost (loss of belonging).

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is excellent, using the physical "dust map" to drive a causal discovery that feels earned by the protagonist's skills. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where the button reweights the meaning of the empty file, landing with visible emotional cost. The compression of time ("When Josie arrived") is efficient and maintains the scene's unity.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative moves with dream-like fluidity, but the transition from the lagoon to the press truck relies on a significant causal convenience. The "booth key" opening the truck's "antiquated lock" strains plausibility and resolves the heist's obstacle too easily, bypassing necessary tension.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal logic is tight, with the accelerating dewdrop rate acting as a live clock that forces the protagonist's hand. Closure lands with a Decisive Change that reconfigures the world state (prophecy erased) while extracting a permanent, felt cost (the loss of the mother's voice).

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative compresses the climax excessively; the Elders' decision to read the secret aloud merely because of the monument trail breaks the causal chain of their established secrecy. The resolution feels convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear, but the climax relies heavily on Corin stepping out and explaining his entire plot in a monologue, which deflates tension. While the closure (the bargain) is a valid Decisive Change, the "explain-everything" dialogue that precedes it removes the burden of discovery from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is tight and unbreakable; the kintsugi repair of the coin directly drives the discovery of the thief. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara’s internal ledger is balanced (“lighter by one lie”), satisfying the narrative promise.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, with the harp and tooth serving as integrated causal tools rather than convenient magic. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "cost" is the shared weight of the confession and the physical toll on Mara. The pacing effectively balances the heavy backstory with the immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is strong—a Conceptual Repricing of "mercy" that propels the protagonist back to dawn with a defined purpose. The "forest as archive" logic holds the causality together, though the arrival of the clearing feels slightly convenient compared to the rigorous setup.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and causality holds, with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where the names are restored. However, the progression is frictionless; obstacles yield immediately to "intuition" and magical tools without forcing the protagonist to improvise or fail first.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality is tight and investigative; the dust analysis logically leads to the discovery, which unlocks the backstory and resolution. The closure (marking the wall, taking the spring) is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands with the tangible weight of the "small heart" in the pocket, satisfying the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from the frost anomaly to the press rupture. The closure acts as a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where the cost of the library's stability is paid to secure the personal moment. The logic of the magic system holds firm through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight, utilizing the "visible time" mechanic effectively to solve the mystery. The shift to summary for the final exhibition ("Third Act") slightly distances the reader from the moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, with excellent orientation and a logical progression of events. However, the closure—while thematically resonant—arrives with minimal resistance; the antagonist yields immediately to the "honest music," making the victory feel slightly unearned in terms of causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Conceptual Repricing of the compass's "flaw") lands effectively. However, the plot relies heavily on the "psychometry" mechanic as a low-resistance tool to deliver exposition blocks (the visions) rather than dramatized discovery. The journey is linear, with the visions serving as convenient bridges between plot points.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies on magical convenience where three driftwood sculptures inexplicably convey complex engineering plans to a town that obeys them instantly. The ending resolves all conflict with a net gain (wall fixed, lantern kept) and zero paid cost, failing the rubric's requirement for visible or felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story violates the short-form scope default by summarizing a season-long timeline rather than grounding the narrative in a continuous scene or tight shards. The climax relies on the "explain-everything" anti-pattern, where the protagonist literally reads the thematic and plot resolution from the window glass, removing interpretive work.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative reads as a synopsis or outline rather than a fully dramatized story, sequencing events ("I saw," "I understood," "I answered") without settling into a scene. While the causal chain is logical, the summary mode rushes the climax and distances the reader from the pivotal "parley."

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal logic is sound, tracing a clear path from resource extraction to societal revival. However, the story relies heavily on narrative summary and montage ("On the third morning," "Word traveled," "By the month of new tides") rather than dramatized scene work. This flattens the narrative arc into a synopsis-like sequence, violating the single-scene default without the density of a true mosaic.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative builds tension effectively but dissipates it with a summarized climax ("The message spreads... crews are ready") rather than a dramatized scene. The resolution hinges on a convenient loophole found in the "patterns," which feels like a low-cost exit from the central dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal logic follows a strong lyric/thematic coherence where physical order (seeds, cleaning) counteracts metaphysical chaos (time spiral). The closure acts as a Conceptual Repricing—redefining inheritance as a debt of maintenance rather than a gift—which lands effectively. The resolution via administrative tasks (schedules, labels) is thematically tight but risks feeling slightly convenient given the magical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal structure is impeccable; the glue constraint creates a ticking clock that dovetails perfectly with the storm's arrival. The closure is a decisive, on-page reconfiguration of the warning system with clear risk (defying the Office) and validated outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on a massive coincidence—meteors physically aligning to point like fingers at a hidden tunnel—to drive the plot. This mystical convergence resolves the search without character agency, functioning as a deus ex machina that undermines the grounded, mechanical setup of the station.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is excellent, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "tangled covenant" is untied through a concrete ritual. The narrative drive is clear, utilizing the sister’s appearance as a decisive causal trigger that leads directly to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from the garage sale discovery to the silo trade with clear causality. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing where Eli trades his finite time for a timeless duty; the new status quo is legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative structure is episodic and relies on high-convenience coincidences, particularly the drake’s arrival at the exact moment of closure to mirror the feather. The conflict resolution with the brothers lacks causality—their anger dissolves simply because Rian begins mending, skipping the necessary beat of negotiation or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.7)
    The story relies on a montage structure ("For years," "One night," "Soon," "With her remaining weeks") which violates the preference for immediate, scene-based causality. While the closure lands a resonant reconfiguration, the execution reads like a fable's synopsis rather than a dramatized narrative, lacking the immediacy of a specific time-bound crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands with exceptional precision; the chemical lock puzzle (terpenes + crystals) is a tight causal pivot that recontextualizes the premise from spiritual return to biological sampling. The final theft is a decisive change earned by the protagonist's specific skills. The drive lens (Causal/Investigative) holds flawlessly from the initial hypothesis to the final evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is a tight, cohesive Accumulative design that executes a ritual to achieve a Resonant Reconfiguration of the story's central treaty. Closure lands with precision as the "submerged concord" is successfully transferred to the soil, fulfilling the premise. The progression is flawless, though the protagonist overcomes obstacles with a level of mastery that reduces the sense of risk or "felt cost" required for the 9.0+ tier.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.3)
    The investigation holds tension, but the leap from the general riddle ("turn the storm") to the specific cylinder ("ONLY DUST") lacks a causal bridge. The climax resolves a physical threat (running guards) with a thematic abstraction (distant radio responses) that ignores the immediate timeline and danger.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear inciting return, a methodically escalated calibration scene, and a decisive closure that reconfigures the protagonist's life. The causal link between the "double sky" and the "true north" realization holds the drive lens perfectly. Closure lands with the visible cost of abandoning the station's sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is legible and linear, but the resolution relies heavily on the magical convenience of the sundial and a "leap of faith" trope. While the closure (entering the map) is conceptually distinct, the "key is a choice" beat feels familiar and resolves the physical peril without a grittier, earned price.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear inciting incident (the note) leading to a mechanically specific rising action (the walking pattern). Closure is achieved through a decisive change—sacrificing personal liberty for historical truth—landing with a visible cost (imprisonment) and a conceptually reconfigured final image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is legible with a clear goal, obstacle, and resolution (Decisive Change). The closure lands with a functional release, but the solution to the "shifting reality" threat relies on a suddenly reactivated backstory talent rather than a new tactical choice made under pressure, which softens the causal impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear, causal line from the inciting decoding to the climatic release of the woven hush. The closure is distinct and resonant, offering a "Resonant Reconfiguration" of the protagonist's values. Pacing is steady, effectively utilizing the frozen-time constraint to build tension without typical action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with a flawless causal chain leading to a resonant closure. The resolution—paying for truth with the artist's ability to see color—is a perfect example of a Conceptual Repricing that lands with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from threat to ritual to resolution, though the "statue as oracle" provides a convenient, precise blueprint that lowers the cost of the climax. The closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration (forgiveness), but the physical repair feels somewhat rushed in summary ("In the minutes that follow").

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative structure is solid, with the mirror crack effectively inciting the journey to the cave. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the shell is left behind, marking a legible change in stance with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a coherent magical realism logic where the ritual (cork, scent, tremor) causally leads to the resolution. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of the couple's dynamic. The inciting atmosphere ("heat wave broke") is well-integrated as a physical enabler for the sound/magic, grounding the fable in pseudo-physics.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story effectively utilizes a "summary-to-scene" structure, using the iterative nights of phone calls to build accumulation before the specific arrival of Sera. Closure lands with emotional resonance (the machine as a promise), fitting the Accumulative/Textural lens. However, the heavy reliance on summary for the first half creates distance, and the resolution rests on a convenient convergence—that the navigator’s mysterious contact happens to be the son Sera is seeking—which strains causal credibility even within a fable.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is robust: the specific disability compels the search for a specific cure, which is then tested and immediately put under high-stakes pressure by the Ministry patrol. While the transition summarizing the "storm season" acts as a functional bridge, the climax effectively forces a decision that reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to truth. The closure lands a decisive "Conceptual Repricing" of safety, validating the cost of secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative logic of investigating via "negative space" (missing smells, wrong knots) is ingenious and sustains the magical realism frame with strict causal consistency. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration of the logbook as a grave for the unowned past, delivering a felt cost to Eamon’s isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is tight, leading directly from the puzzle to the journey and confrontation. The closure (choosing the wet path) is a clear Decisive Change with the cost of severing the past. The "ants" beat relies slightly on situational luck but fits the established intuition trait sufficiently to maintain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a tight causal chain from the warning to the ritual and final choice. Closure is definitive and resonant: the Decisive Change (closing the wound) is paired with a Conceptual Repricing where the "ordinary" night becomes frighteningly free. The orientation is clear, and the drive lens holds firmly through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed under a clear Causal lens; the warning leads directly to a decision that alters the status quo with visible cost (the loss of the suns). Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the release of the suns redefines Lio’s stance from craftsman to protester. The ending lands firmly on the page, satisfying the 9+ closure gate requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure effectively utilizes the dream/wake cycle to advance the plot, with the "swap" serving as a pivotal realization that recontextualizes the inciting incident (the grave). Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing—writing to tame time—which lands with a felt cost (the acceptance of the "mess"). The narrative logic holds the surreal elements together without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving efficiently from the shop to the birthing house and back with clear causality. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands well, though the ease of the climax flattens the potential impact of the "miracle."

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed under a causal lens; the setup of the childhood trauma and ink mechanics pays off decisively in the closure. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical stabilization of the platform mirrors the internal stabilization of Ila’s trauma. Backstory is woven seamlessly into the "held breath" timeframe, anchoring reflection to immediate sensory cues.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is tight: the overdue apology fuels the ritual, which forces the confrontation and resolution. The closure is definitive and costly, marked by the broken bottle, the blown fuse, and the writing of the correction, delivering a decisive change in the protagonist’s state.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is solid, moving from the inciting "hiccup" to the climactic ritual and a clear resolution. The closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing—shifting from escape to duty—though the middle section relies on summarized "admissions" of cost rather than fully dramatized trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative builds tension effectively with the ice blockage, but the resolution of the conflict with the inspector relies on a "soft reset." The inspector’s anger evaporates too conveniently upon hearing the "counting backwards" explanation, bypassing the necessary struggle or cost to earn that alliance.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative drive is clean, utilizing a Causal lens where the laser experiment leads directly to the confrontation. The "setup" of the laser functionality pays off beautifully at closure, though the resolution relies somewhat on the strangers explaining the plot in dialogue rather than Lena discovering the truth through action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc follows a clear causal chain (clues leading to realization), but the timeline and spatial logic fray in the final third. Returning to the library to set up a public exhibit for students in the middle of the night/storm, before visiting the recovering father, strains credibility and pacing. The "exhibit" beat feels inserted to satisfy a setting constraint rather than arising from urgent character need.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is a tight, effective causal loop where the stranger's crisis acts as the direct catalyst for Mara's breakthrough. Closure is achieved through a decisive change (using the dial-out key) that reconfigures her reality. The setup of the "dial-out key" as a forbidden privilege is efficient, and the ending lands with a palpable shift in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is flawless, moving from the inciting discovery of the locket to the resonant climax of the ceremony with tight causality. The "regenerated covenant" serves as a perfect structural hinge, transforming a bureaucratic procedure into a high-stakes metaphysical confrontation. Closure is achieved through a decisive change that feels both inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is strong, with the "cooling" mechanic effectively driving the narrator's actions and the transition from client to companion. While the exchange sequence relies on summary ("I gave... the barber mended...") rather than a fully dramatized beat, the closure lands with a resonant, earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure—redefining the map from borders to currents—lands with genuine conceptual weight. While the flashback to the astronomer is efficient, the resolution of the stone's obstacle relies on a somewhat frictionless "dowsing again" rather than a costly tactical change.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative operates on a cohesive dream-logic where the physical state of the pen mirrors the protagonist's psychic rigidity. The causal link between "loosening certainty" and fixing the bent nib is metaphorical but accepted within the established anomaly rules. Closure is strong, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration of the garden memory with visible cost (facing her own rudeness).

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, but the climax relies on a convenient coincidence (the foghorn failing) to provide the necessary silence rather than a protagonist-driven turn. The transition to the musician reading "mapped silence" operates on dream logic that, while poetic, strains causal credibility. Closure is achieved through the camera offering, but the cost feels symbolic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a linear "breadcrumb trail" structure that effectively drives momentum but relies on convenient progression; the solution to the cipher via an "intuitive leap" bypasses earned deduction, slightly weakening the causal chain before the decisive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the setup of the experiment to the climax of the shared vision and a resonant aftermath. The coda, where the protagonist returns and opens the gate by drumming, borders on dream-logic (bypassing security), but effectively cements the thematic resolution of keeping the dream alive.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, moving cleanly from the inciting storm to the challenge and then the escalating emergency. The coincidence of the crane slip works because it complicates the situation rather than resolving it, forcing Mara to prove her theory under life-or-death stakes. Closure is decisive and earned, with the signed order representing a clear change in the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is distinct and creative, using the setting's mechanics (shutters/light) to drive the resolution. Closure is decisive with a clear change in the status quo (body revealed, help summoned). The narrative logic holds together well within the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative operates in summary mode, compressing a complex overnight operation into a smooth montage that lacks the friction of a dramatized scene. Causality is soft; the town-sized puzzle works perfectly on the first try, and the political outcome—a total reversal by the council—feels like a fable’s conclusion rather than a consequence of pressure. The ending arrives without a "because/therefore" chain of escalating risk.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is clean, and the closure—where the narrator detaches their own life—is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration. The climax, however, relies on the scrimshaw as a shortcut to bypass Rusk's resistance, weakening the causal chain of the human drama.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structural economy is flawless, using a two-shard timeline to compress the arc efficiently. Closure is decisive and physically grounded (releasing the petals), with the "blade wash" offering a distinct, resonant final image that reconfigures the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is efficient and tight, moving from the legal opening of the ban to the metaphysical dissolution of the border. The closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration/Decisive Change) is achieved through the established mechanic of "paraphrasing" reality, which pays off the setup perfectly. The causality holds under a fable-logic lens, where semantic shifts alter physical properties.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    The causal chain is tight, moving logically from rejection to a transformative counter-offer. The closure lands a brilliant Conceptual Repricing: the shared awakening subverts the established rule of loss, creating a resonant, earned evolution of the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is solid, but the middle section relies on montage-like summary ("The more we questioned assumptions... We redesigned the loop") to bridge the inciting incident and the climax. Closure is legible, but the "months" summary in the final lines dilutes the immediate impact of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and montage ("Some nights," "When the city learned") to reach closure, dissolving the scenic tension of the specific encounter with Lysa. While the conceptual resolution is clear, the synopsis-like compression prevents a tight causal chain from building meaningful pressure within a single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Accumulative structure works well, moving from the loft’s intimate decoding to the city-wide verification. Closure is distinct and resonant (Resonant Reconfiguration), though the street sequence relies on summary rather than dramatized resistance, which slightly softens the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causality is tight and moves logically from the inciting theft to the mechanical climax with the pagoda. The mechanism of "avoiding patterns" to counteract the "atoms of nostalgia" provides a coherent, rigorous logic for the resolution. Closure is decisive, recontextualizing the protagonist's role in the city.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    An exemplary causal chain: the investigation of the silent footage creates a precise pivot that solves the mystery and motivates the cure. The closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration where the shadow’s nature and the library’s protocol are permanently altered with clear, dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is tight, moving from reflection to decision to action with excellent pacing. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration; the return to the workshop and the pinning of the tail tip effectively crystallize the thematic arc with visible cost (the public statement and emotional labor).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure lands with a clear Decisive Change and felt cost, but the inciting logic (anesthesia telepathy) is convenient and the tunneling sequence (bread knife vs. stone) breaks physical causality.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from a haunting hook to a ritualistic release that feels inevitable yet surprising. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical act of projecting blank light resolves both the external mystery and the internal ache with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    The plot is a clean, linear procedural that moves from inciting incident to resolution without significant deviation or doubt. While the causality of the star-tracing ritual is legible, the narrative lacks a decisive turning point where the outcome is truly at risk; the "elders" and "guards" remain abstract concepts rather than active forces of opposition. This results in a sequence of events that feels inevitable—an execution of steps rather than a dramatic struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Earned Stasis) lands with the lasting cost of the protagonist's fractured existence. The climax—auditors retreating merely because they "heard" the history—feels slightly convenient conceptually compared to the gritty mechanical setup, but causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mosaic structure effectively teaches the translocation pattern early, building a coherent accumulation of meaning. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration (turning the crank, leaving the gear) that feels earned and permanent under the story’s dream-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The pacing is excellent, using the "indirect routes" to create structural tension against the protagonist's urgency. The climax relies on dream logic (punching through wire), which fits the fable mode but slightly strains physical causality.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing a two-shard structure that bridges the discovery of the surveillance room with the act of defiance. Closure is a strong instance of Charged Poise; the standoff is earned, and the cost of the protagonist's choice is immediately felt in the "REMAIN" order.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story relies heavily on summary, particularly in the final act where the confrontation is reported rather than dramatized, deflating the tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, and the closure—adopting the rhythm to hide the path—is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration with ethical cost. The middle section relies on summarized iteration ("Every month she took the page out") which slightly softens the immediate pressure, but the structural integrity is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the discovery of the stones to the transmission, ending in effective Charged Poise. The pivot relies on a slightly convenient convergence of the hum, star intervals, and previously unmentioned "pilgrimage charts" to solve the puzzle, softening the causal rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative relies on a significant coincidence—the storm delivering the specific kite needed to the exact tree—rather than protagonist agency to bridge the gap between intent and ritual. This convenience undercuts the causal chain and resolves the central obstacle without earned effort.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    The drive lens (Situational/Accumulative) holds perfectly from the inciting drone buzz to the final image. Closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration: the burial of the photo and the "dates, not wishes" philosophy physically manifest the cost of her realism.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative drive is consistent under a Situational lens, with the "walls closing in" creating effective pressure that forces the climax. The resolution—weaving filaments to stabilize reality—operates on dream logic that fits the established world, though the causality of the "map strings" opening the trapdoor feels slightly loose.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clear, leading from investigation to discovery and resolution. However, the mechanism of entering a memory via spilled ink feels like a convenient, unestablished magic system that lowers the difficulty of the investigation. The closure is legible, but the "note" writing is a weak bridge to the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the "archive as forum" closure works as a Conceptual Repricing of the setting. However, the Censor's pivot to "transparency" feels like a convenient soft landing that resolves the plot without forcing the protagonist to navigate the full fallout of their treason.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story builds a strong situational frame but falters at the climax with a "soft reset" resolution. The militia's retreat—driven merely by a speech and "unsettled" feelings about the roses—lacks sufficient causal weight for a paramilitary force pursuing a bounty, making the external victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is precise, with a clear inciting incident and a climax that logically follows established rules. The closure functions as a strong Conceptual Repricing: the "broken patterns" are re-contextualized from a danger to a necessary defense against tyranny. The release of the spike creates a distinct "after" state with clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from suspicion to mathematical proof to physical evidence (dust) and finally to a negotiated resolution. The closure (a Conceptual Repricing of the situation from "fraud" to "funding crisis") lands with the visible cost of the lost headline. The use of the logbook intervention provides a tangible, high-stakes resolution on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and compelling, leading to a closure unit that functions as a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration. The realization that his own heartbeat was the "static" offers a devastating, earned conceptual twist that satisfies the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing of "forgetting." However, the resolution relies heavily on the tile flake functioning as a convenient magical tool that instantly dissolves the conflict, bypassing the need for a more complex causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, moving from the solitary vision to the confrontation and finally the restorative ritual. The closure is excellent: the "Grasp" provides a Decisive Change that enacts the story's philosophy with visible, physical cost (restraint and labor) rather than abstract forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "echoing trick" provides a legible lyric logic for closure, effectively using the "fractured timeline" concept to drive the scene. However, the mechanism relies on the convenient revelation that the ghost also experiences time as flavor, which smooths over the causal difficulty of the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent, moving efficiently from the inciting incident (Jory's arrival) to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the closure (symptoms recontextualized as a map). The leap from a studio light test to successfully locating a specific "sealed service tunnel" is slightly convenient, compressing the investigation phase, but the causal chain remains unbroken. The closure—refusing the buyout to offer an open protocol—lands with clear ethical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is flawless, moving from physical entrapment to metaphysical connection with clear causality. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the surrender of the fossil acts as a tangible cost that permanently alters her relationship to the unknown.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on iterative summary ("Each dawn," "On the seventh night") rather than a dramatized scene, violating the scope default and distancing the reader from the crisis. The causality follows dream logic suitable for a fable but lacks the grounded, moment-to-moment tension required for immediate literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.2)
    The resolution hinges on a causality break: bridging a radio contact with a "sliver of solder" is physically impossible without a heat source (soldering iron), reducing the climax to a magical fix. The specific utility of the pillbox contents (salt and solder) to the specific problem feels overly convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing the "ticking gutters" as an effective countdown that forces the inciting incident into a crisis. The closure is a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration: the return of Mara and the rewriting of the debt change the status quo irrevocably. The causality is clean, driven by the protagonist's specific skill set.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from diagnosis to a decisive act of "centering" that functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with a clear conceptual cost: the loss of the oasis's miraculous immortality in exchange for a "mortal present," logically following the established rules of the kiln/pottery metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the "bitting gauge" provides a solid causal anchor, but the climax relies on a convenient, low-stakes application of Mara's gardening skills established just prior. The closure (mirrors in the stairwell) is a resonant image that successfully reconfigures the opening state, though the path there lacks significant reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is cohesive, moving from isolation to a defined purpose with clear causality. Closure lands effectively with a Conceptual Repricing (isolation to "spacing"), anchored by the physical action of copying the script against the rising tide.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.1)
    The plot relies on the high-coincidence arrival of the lover at the exact moment of the installation's completion to force the climax. Closure is earned through a "soft reset" where years of separation are resolved by a single gesture and a letter, lacking a commensurate on-page cost or friction. The narrative arc functions but depends heavily on convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a tight Causal arc, moving cleanly from pressure to realization to technical intervention. The climax is active and well-paced, creating a legitimate sense of urgency. The resolution lands a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the "trickster" explanation feels slightly convenient—a rapid backstory patch to solve the central mystery—preventing the closure from reaching the highest tier of inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (freeing the mentor/changing the map) is a distinct resonant reconfiguration. However, the solutions rely on dream-logic conveniences—the compass point acting as a universal skeleton key and "consent" casually altering physics—which softens the causal friction and earned cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.0)
    The ending relies on the "explain-everything" anti-pattern, where the antagonist summarizes the entire crime in a convenient confession immediately after a single challenge. This deflates tension and resolves the mystery through summary rather than dramatized discovery or action.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on "lock-and-key" plotting, where progress is determined by finding physical tokens rather than causal decision-making. The resolution hinges on a "soft reset" exposition dump where the antagonist voluntarily explains the entire backstory because a prop (the nail) is presented. Closure is achieved, but it fails the cost proof test—Mara restores the name without paying a visible price, resulting in unearned symmetric satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a linear fetch-quest structure (clue → travel → item → act) with convenient causality ("until I remembered the wrapped construction"). While the closure is decisive, the progression lacks complication or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.4)
    The story violates the scope default by summarizing years of history rather than grounding the conflict in a specific scene. Causality is narrative ("LoopLine rose fast," "startup began to fall") rather than demonstrated through on-page action and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.7)
    The plot relies on a convenient lucid dream to bridge the gap between data and translation, functioning as a narrative shortcut that bypasses the intellectual struggle of decoding. The transition to the temple ("By the next new moon...") compresses the climax into a summary, reducing the visceral impact of the ritual. The pacing feels rushed, prioritizing the delivery of the thematic message over the causal unfolding of events.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and tightly structured, with a clear inciting incident (the seed arrival) and a satisfying resolution rooted in the established magic system. The logic of &quot;reversing the circles&quot; to unbend the glass operates on a coherent fable-logic that fits the tone perfectly. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the restoration of balance is earned through a specific, on-page action (planting the seed, unbending the mirror).

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing a clear Causal drive lens where the protagonist's specific actions directly unlock the next stage. The closure—sealing the crack with blood—validates the cost, though the final exit ("covenant carried them back") leans slightly on magical convenience rather than character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight and escalates cleanly from the brother’s relapse to the broker’s confrontation. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira accepts eternal pain to lock the trade—lands with undeniable, visceral cost ("yesterday's hurt fresh as dawn") and logical permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causality is tight, with the livestream failure motivating the quarry job and the cloth discovery driving the pivot in methodology. The closure (proposing the listening station) creates a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the brother connection is a slightly convenient validator.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from setup to a high-stakes connection and a decisive release. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shift from "trapping" the spirit to "planting" understanding recontextualizes the initial ambition with visible emotional cost (letting the sister's warmth fade).

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens functions perfectly here, teaching the rules of identity migration before tightening into the specific ritual of the furnace. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration that is fully legible on the page: the protagonist accepts the loss of their own past to serve the city's futureless present. The return of Lio provides a concrete, causal payoff to the established creel mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative structure is solid, with a clear inciting incident and a decisive closure that reconfigures the bunker’s purpose. The spatial pivot to the "crystal caves" is a sharp genre shift that risks jarring the reader, but the final image of the "crown" lands effectively with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.0)
    The plot pivots on a causality break: finding a stranger's graffiti that happens to contain the specific survey grid number of the failure is a contrived coincidence. This "magic clue" resolves the central mystery without the protagonist earning it through the established skill set.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The plot is tightly constructed around the watch's mechanics, creating a robust causal chain where the tool drives the discovery. However, the story’s climax relies on summary ("had already mailed") to convey the decisive final action, slightly distancing the reader from the immediate cost of that commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative follows a tight Causal arc where the plant warnings and coffee foresight directly drive the tactical decision to use the vents. The closure is a distinct Decisive Change that resolves the immediate problem of the violin while accepting the larger danger from the empire. The mechanism of the "perforated destiny" is taught early and paid off at the climax without feeling like a Deus Ex Machina.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from a well-established ritual process to a decisive change in philosophy at the climax. The closure—choosing to offer the spark to the sky rather than keeping it—lands as a Conceptual Repricing of her trade, supported by the “empty hands” image.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and concludes with a resonant Conceptual Repricing (planting the fig). However, the inciting discovery of the grotto relies heavily on coincidence—finding a never-before-seen opening in a tree she likely knows well—which slightly weakens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing a hybrid causal-situational drive where the environment (chimes, mirror) dictates the protagonist's moves. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara keeps the cloak—lands with undeniable conceptual and felt cost, effectively repricing the initial contract.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    The closure lands a pristine Resonant Reconfiguration; the lesson on vanishing pays off physically and conceptually as Sato disappears into his youth to let the narrator appear. The causal drive is tight, moving from instruction to a necessary, costly exchange of places.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive ritual logic leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing (navigation as relationship, not movement). While the causal chain is solid, the trajectory is linear and lacks a felt price or "try-fail" cycle, resulting in a low-friction procedural success that softens the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, moving from the city's sterility to the spire's chaotic sanctity without wasted motion. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Davin leaves the stone but changes its context—lands with thematic weight and the felt cost of his perilous, unanchored climb. The logic of the "mist walking" pays off causally at the terrace wall.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe causality and plausibility breaks shatter the narrative reality. A flame-lit "hooded lamp" cannot function underwater, and the protagonist holding their breath long enough to curate a library and read logbooks defies physical limitations without an established surrealist frame. The continuity error of setting a singular lamp "at intervals" further disrupts logic.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.4)
    Flawless execution of a causal loop (bootstrap paradox) where the closure recontextualizes the opening without confusion. The "edgewise coin" serves as a precise pivot point that forces the climax, and the cost (burning the last fuel) is visibly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic where the ritual creates a tangible change in the atlas. The closure—hiding the final crystallized sob rather than naming it—is a distinct, resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's burden, landing with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Causal lens holds firmly; the ritual logic (dripping rates) creates a coherent cause-and-effect chain that justifies the magic. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the "silver ripple" validates the effort without a cheap fix, and the renunciation of the bell serves as a tangible cost. The "promise rather than a gift" resolution perfectly suits the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story relies on a summary/montage structure (Ridgeway -> Station -> Town -> Meeting) rather than a continuous scene, which distances the reader from the immediate pressure of the investigation. While the causality is sound and the closure (the town meeting/audit) is decisive, the lack of a sustained dramatic scene reduces the visceral impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the closure lacks a legible cost; the protagonist succeeds completely with a "happy" ending where the solution (a memory of a lesson) arrives conveniently. The lack of a visible price paid for the transformation caps the score, as the victory feels too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is precise: suspicion leads to verification, which leads to a trap and resolution. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration of the status quo—trust is restored, but the protagonist's isolation is reinforced. The use of the parachute buckle as both a detection tool and a physical restraint tightly integrates plot mechanics with character history.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration that unites the opposing factions through a shared experience. However, the resolution relies on a metaphysical martial art that physically compels the antagonists to comply, which feels slightly disconnected from the established legal/combat causality.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story violates the short-story scope default (single scene or two shards) by compressing weeks of events (germination, construction) into a synopsis-like montage. This "outline-like and-then sequencing" prevents the accumulation of scenic tension. While the closure (venting the room) is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, the path to it relies on time-lapses that dilute the causal chain's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and coherent, moving from a vividly established ritual to a validated result without exposition dumps. The closure (Charged Poise) is excellent: the laugh works, but the pull cord on the windowsill signals that this is now an ongoing burden of maintenance, not a one-time cure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from inciting desire to a climactic choice that reconfigures the goal. The closure lands with a tangible cost (the pendant turns to stone), though the final catalog card borders on being too neat a resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a clear Decisive Change with the burning of the charter and the collapse of the furnace, fulfilling the prompt's structural needs. However, the pivotal moment relies on an unearned epiphany ("when the penny drops") that creates a causal gap, and the mechanism of the resolution is purely symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clean Accumulative-to-Causal arc, moving from tuning static to executing a blueprint. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change—the city is physically altered and repurposed—with the cost of labor and the loss of the mast clearly paid on the page. The pacing is tight, with the discovery of the signal acting as a natural pivot point.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving effectively from the uncanny slipping to a decisive resolution. The dream logic of stitching time via radio codes works within the established tone, though the transition to the grotto feels somewhat compressed. Closure lands well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, merging the timelines with a clear sense of restored order.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative structure moves seamlessly from exposition to crisis to a resonant reconfiguration of reality. The climax (yanking the mirror) is an active, character-driven choice that logically precipitates the surreal resolution under the established fever-dream rules.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "world had room again," and the curriculum rewrite grounds the epiphany in action. The score is held back by the middle section; the Council’s permission is granted with convenient ease ("uneasy but desperate"), bypassing a potential crisis beat that would have strengthened the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causality is tightly wound; the photograph serves as a perfect plant-and-payoff mechanism, transforming from a mystery object to the tool of resolution. The closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration of the ghost's message) lands with earned emotional weight and clear logic.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a clean causal line from entry to diagnosis to repair, with the "phase mouth" premise established early to earn the climatic solution. Closure is a Decisive Change that resolves both the external cable failure and the internal grief, blending the technical and personal with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and cohesive, moving from the inciting status of "dead" to a "correctly recorded" resolution through a clearly established, albeit speculative, ritual. The closure lands with a precise Resonant Reconfiguration—a change in status and an internal release of fear—that feels inevitable under the story's hybrid causal-thematic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure (the library of echoes) is conceptually resonant. However, the climax relies on a convenient coincidence—the "late flock" of swifts appearing exactly when needed to organize the sound—which resolves the central crisis through luck rather than purely through the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear inciting incident (Jonas’s condition worsening) leading inevitably to the ritual climax. The use of the arrowhead as a planted constraint that pays off creates strong causality. Closure is resonant: the threat is contained but the connection (the phone) remains, creating a satisfying "Earned Stasis" where vigilance is the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving efficiently from the bridge to the orchard to the confrontation. The closure—a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the tree walks back to the city—is vivid and logically earned by the established mechanics of the shell and rhythm. The pacing manages the fable-like transition from observation to revolution effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear inciting incident and a logical progression of discovery using the "linking absences" method. Closure is strong, offering a decisive change in Ivo's life. A minor credibility slip occurs in the climax: the drone falls "harmlessly" after being slammed with rain and static, yet is immediately functional for a return flight—a convenience that slightly undercuts the physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear fable-like logic with a defined micro-choice at the junction that pays off at the oasis. The scratched warning acts as a slightly heavy-handed plot device to direct this choice, but the closure—reconfiguring the train's purpose—lands with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear situational drive, moving logically from hypothesis (geometry) to experiment (the scarf) to application (helping the patron). Closure lands successfully as a Resonant Reconfiguration of her role from librarian of books to cataloger of connection. The progression is smooth, perhaps slightly lacking in obstacle friction, but the causal chain holds firmly under the magical realist lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal arc is strong, moving from a distinct method to a surprising but earned resolution. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a clear cost—accepting absence—though the mechanics of the realization are slightly over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a coherent dream-logic where the physical journey mirrors the internal psychological shift. The closure is decisive: the "idea" is freed, and the "nexus" closes, marking a permanent change in state. The "first star" mechanic serves as a satisfying causal link between the setting and the resolution. The pacing is tight, moving efficiently from disorientation to clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is achieved, but the plot hinges on a significant causality break: a paper notebook remaining "legible" after decades in seawater is a convenience that defies physics to provide the necessary exposition. Additionally, the summary ending ("Decades of blankness folded back...") rushes the emotional aftermath, telling rather than showing the integration of the returned memories.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story achieves a resonant closure via a Decisive Change that is both magical and psychological; the cost (admitting fear) is paid on the page. The "ritual" logic of the tea leaves and shadow holds firmly under a Situational/Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story follows a fable-like structure where magic conveniently solves the central problem (sister’s illness) without a significant on-page cost or sacrifice. The resolution is a case of symmetric satisfaction; the magical fruit cures the illness instantly, making the ending feel unearned by the narrative mechanics. Causality is soft, relying on ritual rather than hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causality is tight and unbroken; the physical action of unraveling the net directly drives the escalation of sound and the climax. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where the "hush" is permanently transformed into song, satisfying the causal drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is strong, linking the video evidence effectively to the physical discovery at the henge. Closure lands clearly as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the chapel’s purpose, though the resolution feels slightly frictionless, solving the mystery with linear efficiency rather than complex negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is immediate and grounding, establishing the specific "where" and "when" effectively. The narrative arc moves cleanly from the inciting search to a resonant closure (releasing the reel), satisfying the causality requirement. The discovery of the notebook provides a solid mechanical bridge for the thematic realization.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing the "space between lightning and thunder" as a natural ticking clock that forces action. The pivot from "resurrection" to "routing" serves as an excellent Conceptual Repricing, recontextualizing the goal and satisfying the closure requirement with deep resonance. The ending feels earned and final, resolving the immediate tension while leaving the world changed.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is strong, utilizing the elevator's ascent as a pacing mechanism. However, the resolution—immediate praise and promotion—lowers the narrative cost, resolving the tension too neatly without a lingering price for the protagonist's transgression.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands with a distinct Conceptual Repricing as Mara validates the "memory of air," but the specific mechanism—wake turbulence restoring a radio signal—strains causal credibility even within the story's "poetic physics." The setup is strong, but that specific payoff feels slightly convenient compared to the otherwise grounded aviation details.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative moves clearly under a thematic-accumulative lens, culminating in a strong Conceptual Repricing where Liora chooses acceptance over preservation. While the logic of abandoning the book contrasts slightly with the urgency of the warning, the thematic coherence of "accepting limits" carries the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on dream logic rather than causal grounding; the connection between hopscotch squares, starling spirals, and coordinate data is convenient invention, not earned discovery. The closure lacks the required "visible or felt cost"—the resolution is purely additive (gaining a companion and a route) without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causality is tight; the library's constraints (ice, warning note) force a shift in tactics from taking to making, utilizing the protagonist's established skills. The closure is a specific, dramatized physical act that satisfyingly resolves the central stake with visible effort and adherence to the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and montage ("tight months," "each morning") rather than a specific, high-pressure scene. This synopsis-like structure dilutes the inciting incident and climax, reducing the visceral impact of the events. Closure is present and logical, but the linear progression lacks a sharp, earned turning point on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent Causal lens within a fable logic, leading to a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist's life is exchanged for the world's solace. The closure lands with undeniable cost, and the "aftermath" shard effectively cements the change.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative arc is efficient and tightly structured, moving from the inciting arrival to the rescue and final resolution with excellent pacing. The Causal drive is strong; the use of the nut and blueprint directly solves the central problem. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure—a decision to permanently alter the labyrinth's navigation—is a decisive change that feels earned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative structure violates the short-story scope by summarizing a year-long process (research, court hearings, construction) instead of dramatizing a specific moment of change. The plot relies on "and then" sequencing where complex obstacles (corporate lawsuits) are resolved in a single sentence of exposition. It reads like a synopsis for a longer work rather than a self-contained story with scenic causality.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causality is tight, with a clear inciting incident (docket) leading to a specific climactic action (incision) via a defined method. The closure is a decisive change where the protagonist abandons their trade to enter the narrative, landing with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving swiftly from the Commander's request to the transmutation of the memories. Closure lands effectively via a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the cost of the "raw" memories is visibly paid by Safi and then distributed, altering the garrison's state.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative shifts into broad summary at the pivotal moment ("Work began..."), bypassing the dramatization of the climax. The resolution relies on "magic" (the elevator speaking to the farmers) to dissolve the conflict instantly without earned causality or tactical maneuvering.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from inciting incident to a decisive change where Nira accepts her role. The causality relies heavily on symbolic logic (wiring a mirror repairs synapses), which fits the genre but feels mechanically smooth, lacking a moment where failure creates palpable drag or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative arc is clean and tightly structured under a Causal lens, with the gravity inversion providing a functional ticking clock. The revelation that his habit (seeds) serves as the literal key to the door is satisfying thematically, though it borders on convenient alignment (lock-and-key fit) rather than a solution forged under pressure. Closure is distinct and resonant, with the protagonist altering the state of the "forgotten" information.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc from observation to resonance, effectively building the instrument and the moment. However, the closure introduces a logistical contradiction—leaving the sole insulator behind while simultaneously planning to let neighbors use "the porcelain bridge"—which muddies the physical reality of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a compelling setup and investigative phase in the nexus, but the climax is severely compressed. The crucial confrontation with the council is summarized in a single sentence ("When the councillors voted"), robbing the narrative of tension at its peak. While the closure (renunciation) is valid, the transition from the field to the council hall feels rushed, bypassing the necessary dramatization of the persuasion.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies heavily on the "Scroll of Truth" convenience where the diary entry contains exactly the warning needed for that specific night. The climax resolves too softly; the watchman is disarmed by a monologue rather than a costly choice, and the resolution lacks a felt price for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is seamless, with the "doodling on wrapping paper" acting as a clever causal pivot that unlocks the forbidden garden. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist gains her desire by accepting a constraint (service/reporting).

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a coherent arc from inciting incident to a resonant closure where the protagonist reconfigures her understanding. However, the pivotal moment where the arrow functions as a magical compass relies on convenience ("She decided... tugged her") rather than earned causality, weakening the middle build.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a tight causal chain with a clear Decisive Change enacted physically by the protagonist. The "wind machine" logic holds together well within the story's frame, and the introduction of the ticking clock (the forklift) effectively pressures the climax and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.3)
    The cavern sequence builds solid tension, but the resolution at the Council relies on an "easy win" anti-pattern where the opposition collapses instantly ("even the rationers weep"). This lack of resistance in the second shard makes the victory feel unearned despite the "fragile" nuance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is a clean, fable-like loop where the protagonist enters the underworld and returns changed. The mechanism of the flute opening the "corridor" is established and paid off well. The resolution is a valid Conceptual Repricing of her role, though the "lesson" phase in the other world relies on a somewhat convenient, didactic interaction rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    The fable logic is coherent and the mechanism of "transposed empathy" drives the narrative cleanly to a resonant closure. The final image of the ledger acts as a strong Conceptual Repricing, though the Council conflict is resolved through summary rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure leads to a clear Conceptual Repricing of the delivery task, effectively shifting from possession to planting. However, the climax relies on Mara's sudden decision to abandon her purchased relic, which feels driven more by the story's thematic needs than by hard-earned causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless arc under the Situational/Hybrid lens, where the pressure of the ritual forces a Resonant Reconfiguration of the narrator's grief. The closure—transforming the burden of truth into a protective lie—is a Decisive Change that lands with clear conceptual and relational cost. Causality is tight, with the magical mechanism directly enabling the emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean fable structure with a distinct beginning, middle, and end, and the closure—Jun's return at the cost of Yara's voice—is resonant. The logic of the puzzle-map operates well within the magical realist frame, though the reliance on sequential summary ("Weeks later") flattens the narrative arc's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies heavily on montage ("Each night he wrapped...") and summary to cover a long duration, violating the rubric's preference for scenic immediacy in this word count. While the causality is sound and the closure is distinct, the "told" structure reduces the tension of the inciting crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    The resolution relies on a mechanism that violates the story's own rules; the shift from spontaneous leaps to controlled weaving is a convenient patch to force the ending. This breaks causality, as the protagonist gains agency over the magic system exactly when the plot requires it.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.2)
    A significant causal breach undermines the narrative: the protagonist delays fixing a lighthouse failure for a full night and day to build small stone cairns, which a ship impossibly sees through fog. This prioritization lacks on-page justification and disconnects the high stakes (shipwreck) from the protagonist's primary activity, treating a mechanical emergency with fable logic that clashes with the established realism.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a magical inciting incident to a resourceful climax using the newspaper cutouts. Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the town is saved, but the dangerous compulsion to laugh/prophesy remains, charging the final routine with tension. The transition from prophecy to the specific mechanics of the "crawling" shadows relies slightly on poetic logic over causal clarity, but it fits the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative structure functions as a compressed parable, using a montage for the three-day search that successfully bridges the inciting incident to the climax. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that feels earned, with the release of the dye serving as a concrete action sealing the internal change. The timeline compression is handled well, though it distances the reader slightly from the physical struggle of the search.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive with a strong Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the climax relies on a logistical leap: a single maintenance worker manually deconstructing and rebuilding a massive stone/panel labyrinth in one night strains credibility, even within the story’s magical realist logic. This ease of resolution undercuts the magnitude of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the causal logic of the magic system breaks when the established cost (losing memories to save others) is subverted by the realm "paying her back." This reduces the necessity of the final trade-off, making the closure feel slightly unearned despite the resonant final image. The pacing is extremely compressed, summarizing seven days of action in a single sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.7)
    Causality is undermined by a significant logic gap: if Lysa eventually found the secret library, her motivation for shoving the invitation under the upstairs neighbor's door is spatially and logically unexplained. Additionally, Marin's status as a long-time employee conflicts with his treatment of the invitation as a novel "test" or license to enter his own workplace.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    The closure lands with precision; the final image of the sprout serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration that physically manifests the "tenuous absolution." The causal link between the risk of planting and the result is earned, with the cost of Mina's safety and shame clearly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.4)
    The narrative arc is precise and economical, moving from the disruption of the courier to the resonant reconfiguration of Ilian's worldview. The closure is earned through specific, on-page action (the whispered vow) that reweights the initial premise of the Archive. The drive lens is consistently maintained, blending the situational pressure of the decaying slide with the causal necessity of Ilian's intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is solid, with clear causality and a defined inciting set of circumstances. However, the explicit labeling of "First false start" and "Second false start" acts as visible scaffolding that momentarily distances the reader. The ending logic relies slightly on the visual reveal of the badge to resolve the immediate scene, making the fob's role in the climax secondary (insurance) rather than primary.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is tight and efficient, utilizing a Hybrid Causal/Situational lens that holds perfectly through the closure. The inciting inquiry leads directly to the climax via the established "taste" mechanic. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist joins the ritual—lands with the conceptual cost of abandoning Bureau safety for a forbidden connection.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative flow is linear and the orientation is solid, but the central causal link (opening the lock) is confused. The text implies she manually shims the lock with a crystal wedge but paints a portrait to "hide" it; in a solitary setting, this action lacks logical necessity and reads as a forced aesthetic beat rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative drive is consistent and logical, leading to a strong Resonant Reconfiguration at the closure. While the inciting incident (finding the map) relies on convenience, the subsequent causal chain involving the Archivist and the trade of truth for knowledge is tight and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is legible, and the closure—where the ice melts to sustain the truth—offers a resonant image of sacrifice. However, the climax relies on a quasi-magical intervention (the ice burning the Auditor as "proof") rather than a decision driven by human agency or ingenuity, weakening the causal chain. The resolution feels slightly rushed, solving the conflict with a symbolic victory rather than a deeply earned one.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative arc is tightly causal, effectively linking the environmental crisis to the protagonist's specific toolkit and backstory. Closure lands with a Decisive Change that resolves the immediate danger while permanently altering the protagonist’s relationship to his memories.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative structure is solid, moving from the locket to the letters with clear pacing. However, the puzzle-solving logic relies on convenience; the arrows "leading nowhere" suddenly becoming a coherent map of memories, and the photo revealing a hidden keyhole, borders on video-game causality. The closure is effective as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the community's trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with high stakes and a defined goal, supported by excellent immediate orientation. While the logic of "dancing" to produce "static" relies on a stylized dream-logic that strains physical causality, it remains consistent within the story's established rules; the closure lands with a decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clear and the closure—accepting sorrow to regain identity—lands with weight. However, the foreman's permission serves as a low-resistance plot gate, and the resolution via coffee-ground instructions compresses the final agency into a magical guide.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative follows a tight Causal drive, moving efficiently from the inciting attempt to hush the brook, to the complication of the poison warning, and finally to the synthesis of the "third path." Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the immediate threat is neutralized, but the conceptual price—Liora’s responsibility to speak the truth plainly—lands with weight. The pacing manages the transition from magical operation to moral resolution seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The drive lens (Causal) is clear, moving from the threat of demolition to a magical discovery and resolution. However, the pivotal climax—the confrontation with the inspector—is summarized ("slipped the documents... as if they were his own notes") rather than dramatized. This creates a "telling" effect at the moment of highest pressure, weakening the narrative tension just before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a legible inciting incident and resolution. The closure (opening a workshop) is a decisive change, but the pivot from the scene's containment to this broad future action feels abrupt. Orientation and pacing are generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the climax relies heavily on the antagonist’s convenience: Senn hands Liora the exact key needed to destroy him, apparently ignorant of its physical function. While Liora’s deduction regarding the basin’s seam is clever, the "hidden door opening on its own" at the end leans into unearned magical realism within a political thriller frame. Closure is reached, but the antagonist's unforced error weakens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story relies on a "tale" structure that summarizes travel and passage of time ("First it repeated... Later it offered") rather than adhering to the short-story scope of one continuous scene or two dramatized shards. This synopsis-like bridge dilutes tension and violates the structural defaults for this length. Closure is distinct, but the path to it lacks scenic immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece reads as a synopsis of a longer narrative rather than a short story, violating the single-scene scope default. The climax is narrated in one sentence ("told the crowd") rather than dramatized, robbing the ending of causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative structure is coherent and the closure lands cleanly with a resonant final image. However, the plot pivots on a convenient "detective leap"—reading net cuts as a map—which feels thin and fable-like rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story violates the scope default by compressing a multi-leg journey (City to Orchard to City) into a synopsis-like structure. The climax ("Back in the city, I staged my findings") is summarized rather than dramatized, which distances the reader from the causal turns and reduces the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on summary to resolve its central tension, with the crowd's unification described rather than earned through the scene's action. The causality of the climax (puppets on clouds uniting valleys) operates on dream logic that undercuts the gritty setup.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clean fable logic, but the resolution relies on a "magic fix" where the repaired box instantly bridges a deep generational divide. The ending offers symmetric satisfaction without the friction or earned reversal required for higher-tier literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is clean, with immediate orientation and a decisive closure that reconfigures the antagonists' intent. The resolution relies heavily on the "magical" efficacy of the sonic technology, which risks feeling slightly convenient, but the setup ("stranger duty") earns the payoff. The final image of the key as a weight of forgiveness provides excellent resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative functions as a synopsis or fable rather than a dramatized story, spanning weeks of action in a few hundred words ("Night after night she returned"). This "outline-like" sequencing dilutes all pressure, and the climax is narrated as a completed logistical success rather than a lived struggle with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal line: investigation leads to discovery, which forces a confrontation. However, the "hidden route" revealed by the lantern's magic serves as a convenient solution to the physical obstacle of escape, bypassing the need for Mara to solve the navigation problem through her own skills. Closure is strong, with a decisive action (uploading the data) that creates a resonant before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative structure fits the two-shard model perfectly, bridging the proposal and the test with clear causality. Closure is exemplary: Mrs. Halden's refusal to offer cheap forgiveness validates the "action" theme with a felt, realistic cost (Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration).

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from decoding to flight to resolution, and the closure works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence is accepted as a message for the future. However, the progression feels slightly linear and low-resistance, with the solution (the kaleidoscope) working almost too perfectly to create high narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight and compelling, moving from anomaly to investigation to discovery with clear logic. The closure is a strong Decisive Change where Mara pivots from archivist to rescuer, accepting the risk of her "lie." The transition into the "Chute" feels slightly compressed, blurring the line between physical space and digital interface, but the emotional payoff lands.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.4)
    The resolution relies on "symmetric satisfaction," where a magical fix (the map) instantly resolves the conflict without forcing a difficult trade-off or dramatizing the negotiation. The mechanism of stitching the ball is poetic but causally opaque, and the ending summarizes the characters' compliance rather than earning it through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.7)
    A significant credibility break undermines the climax: a "delicate" carved bone parasol tip cannot plausibly cut a heavy fishing net fouled in a propeller, especially in a storm. This physics amnesia forces the resolution through convenient tool use rather than believable causality.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves valid closure through Mara's decision to keep the letter. However, the inciting coincidence—the narrator possessing the exact same symbolic object (burned letter edge) as the protagonist—strains credibility and greases the emotional connection too easily, bypassing potential friction.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causality is tight and seamless; the Prophet's arrival disturbs the wall, necessitating the ritual which serves as the climax. Closure is a sophisticated Resonant Reconfiguration, where the meaning of "prophecy" and "protection" is reframed through their shared risk. The pacing manages a complete arc within a short word count without rushing.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.3)
    The story relies heavily on summary montage ("months," "summer deepened") rather than dramatized scenes, violating the scope defaults for this length. This structural drift dissolves narrative tension and prevents the "cost" of the closure from landing with immediate, scenic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mosaic structure ("fractured sequences") is established early and perfectly suits the premise of undefined language. Closure lands effectively with a Conceptual Repricing that transforms the "hush" from a crime scene into a cradle, recontextualizing the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from a philosophical quest to a concrete discovery that reconfigures the protagonist&#039;s understanding of her goal. The logic of the &quot;driftwood pointing toward a feeling&quot; operates on dream logic, which fits the genre but softens the causal chain slightly. Closure is excellent, with the final act of copying recordings offering a Resonant Reconfiguration of the initial problem.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal drive (Quake → Broken Clock → Leaf Fix → Launch), and the closure lands with a successful action and thematic resonance. While the physics of using a falling leaf as a precision chronometer during an earthquake strains credibility in a tech-heavy setting, the story sells it well as a specialized "older method" consistent with the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is clean and the causal chain is logical, moving efficiently from the lab report to the reunion. However, the convenience of the son's immediate availability and compliance—navigating a hospital flight schedule and arriving within what seems like minutes—slightly strains credibility under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is impeccable, operating on a clear magic system (loops vs lines) established early and paid off at closure. The narrative arc moves efficiently from investigation to discovery to resolution without a wasted motion. The closure—joining her shadow to fix the break—reconfigures the world state with a satisfying conceptual click that feels strictly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative structure is loose for this length, relying on travel summaries (Garden → River → Garden) that dissipate scenic tension. The realization at the riverbank feels like it should have been integrated into the initial garden scene or memory to maintain a tighter, single-shard container. Closure is strong, but the bridge to get there relies on convenient transit.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure via Resonant Reconfiguration is legible, successfully shifting the community's relationship to light. However, the resolution relies on soft fable-logic where the glass glows simply because of "intention," lacking a hard causal constraint or on-page cost that would earn the outcome robustly.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands with a Decisive Change that satisfies the causal drive; the handover of the pendant is a potent resolution. The logic of the "icicle code" is poetic but functions effectively within the story’s established speculative rules.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dream logic is consistent; the shell acting as a portal establishes a clear causal chain into the nexus. The closure is decisive (bridge vs. stepping stones), but the "climb a bank of broken metaphors" pushes the meta-narrative too far, briefly breaking immersion with self-referential cuteness.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and complete, following a clear causal chain from the machine's failure to the communal solution. The closure—transferring the tool to the keepers and leaving with lighter pockets—qualifies as a valid Conceptual Repricing of the ritual. The pacing is steady, though the transition from failure to solution feels slightly linear and low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc, building through ritual steps to a resonant closure where the map is shared. The arrival of the cartographer provides a necessary external beat to ground the ending, though the "cost" of the closure is largely symbolic rather than strictly causal.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and logically sequenced, utilizing a poetic logic that fits the fable-like tone. However, the progression is largely linear—problem, process, solution—without a significant structural tightening or reversal that jeopardizes success. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (storing wonder), but the lack of a tangible cost or sacrifice limits the ending's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a clear Situational Drive, where the environment acts as the primary antagonist. The trap is established quickly, and the resolution via alignment—foreshadowed by the lamp burner’s design—provides a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with the cost of perpetual vigilance ("orientation must be chosen each time").

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing the boiling kettle as an effective clock to pressure the scene. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration where the finished panel and the final realization ("build hands that open") fundamentally alter her relationship to the grief with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing a hybrid Causal/Situational lens where the ritualistic negotiation drives the plot. Closure is excellent: a Resonant Reconfiguration where the park is not "saved" in the traditional sense, but functional purpose is restored at the cost of the protagonist's dreams. The logic of the magic system (stories for ghost, memories for bolt) holds up under scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative arc is a clear, linear process of discovery and repair, but the transition to finding the architect's office is convenient and unearned by the immediate action. The closure is a "fix-it" success without a distinct, felt cost on the page; the victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is excellent; the Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's relationship to silence (from endurance to scoring measures) lands with conceptual weight. The causal chain is solid, though the bear's arrival is a convenient situational pressure that drives the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.9)
    The causal chain snaps at the pivotal deduction: using a sundial at twilight to "mark the true time" of a written note via a tide chart is illogical technobabble. Additionally, finding a note that explicitly commands "CUT THE DAWN BULLETIN" is a convenience that simplifies the investigation too much.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative relies on summary to bypass the climax ("demonstrated... clerk agreed") rather than dramatizing the struggle; the resolution is too convenient and unearned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is exemplary; the "explained absence" acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration that explicitly re-prices the grief from a wound to a map with conceptual and emotional cost. The causality is tight, using the established "projecting presence" mechanic to bridge the gap between the Queen's need and the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal arc from the inciting dissatisfaction to the search and final transformation. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, altering the world's rules with visible consequence (the stutter in the song). The epiphany via the "seam in the air" is slightly expository, but the resulting action and thematic payoff land effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.8)
    A severe "False Expertise" failure occurs when the protagonist performs a surgical skin graft during a structure fire, shattering suspension of disbelief. The late introduction of the copycat plot pivots the story away from the rescue arc, creating a disjointed episodic structure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "fetch-quest" structure (geese → crumbs → door → puzzle) that relies on sequential problem-solving rather than escalating causal pressure. The climax hinges on a coincidence (the mother’s involvement) that narrows the world’s scope instead of expanding it, though the closure itself—releasing the memory—is decisive and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative structure is elegant, utilizing a fable-like logic that remains internally consistent with the established "science fantasy" rules. The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration; Lior’s choice to remain on the outskirts rather than return as a hero carries a tangible social cost and thematic weight. The drive lens (Causal/Thematic) holds firmly from the inciting exile to the final teaching moment.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative structure is a montage ("each evening," "on the first night") rather than a dramatized scene, violating the short story scope defaults and dissipating tension. The inciting incident and climax are procedural steps in a summary rather than immediate, pressurized events.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure is excellent, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the mechanical fix mirrors the social penance. However, the plot relies heavily on a significant coincidence: the rake handle with specific calibration numbers washing up exactly when needed. This fortuitous arrival of "the manual" undercuts the earned nature of the discovery, though the resolution itself is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.5)
    Causality suffers from a "magic decoder" solution where the cipher is solved instantly via an unexplained skill ("counting graves"). The instruction to "bury the ledger" leads to them immediately *finding* it already buried, creating a confusing temporal/logical loop regarding the dead husband's actions and the message's intent.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story relies on a summary epilogue ("That spring...") to validate the protagonist's success, shifting the weight off the on-page scene. While the moment of writing conditional sentences is a valid climax, the immediate aftermath is skipped, reducing the dramatic tension of the release.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story violates the scope requirements for short fiction by relying on extensive summary and montage ("Soon she could read...", "They planned a concert") instead of a sustained, dramatic scene. This synopsis-like pacing flattens the inciting incident and climax, preventing the accumulation of real-time tension or causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is solid, with pressure escalating from the drawing process to the inspector's intrusion. The drive lens (Situational/Accumulative) holds well, leading to a resonant closure. However, the climax relies heavily on the supernatural element (the chair groaning) to resolve the antagonist's threat, which slightly displaces the protagonist's agency at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is tight, moving from the inciting need for proof to the physical extraction and final social rejection. Closure is an effective "Earned Stasis" where Orin constructs his own validation after institutional rejection. The pacing manages the transition from the solitary sewer to the market efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.3)
    The ending fails the cost requirement; the council’s reversal is a "magic art saves the day" trope that resolves the conflict with symmetric satisfaction. The narrative skips the necessary causal steps between the performance and the policy change, reducing realism to fable logic.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story operates as a summarized fable rather than a scenic drama, covering a season of growth in montage; this compression works for the tone but distances the reader from immediate causality. The narrative arc is clear and the closure (restored memory) is resonant, but the lack of a specific, time-bound crisis point makes the plot feel like a sequence of inevitable successes.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative bridge to the tower relies on a fragile causal link: the engineer grants access to a secure core solely because Maro insults her with the truth. While the closure is distinct and legible (the grid repairs, the legend updates), the "magic key" resolution—where stating the truth instantly fixes a complex mechanical failure—bypasses the gritty reality established by the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative operates effectively as a fable, utilizing an Accumulative design where iterative actions build toward the storm climax. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—releasing the shard—which lands with clear conceptual weight. However, the reliance on summary ("Night after night") rather than immediate scene work dilutes the causal tension in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative structure perfectly mirrors the physical descent; the "threading" action unifies the investigation with the thematic "seam" of history. Closure is decisive, effectively recontextualizing the protagonist's past actions with a high conceptual and emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.6)
    Causality is impeccable within the story's surreal logic; the link between "expectation" and the machine's energy is set up by the infinite climb and paid off decisively at the climax. The closure achieves a "Conceptual Repricing" of the highest order, transforming the setting from a trap of hope into a space of honest confinement without breaking the scene's physics. The narrative drive transitions seamlessly from a physical climb to a metaphysical realization, landing with unmistakable cost. Every beat serves the central argument of the allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative hinge relies on a symmetric coincidence—Ro being the grandson of the specific woman who saved Mira—which resolves the central tension of isolation too conveniently. While the closure is structurally legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the lack of earned causal struggle to bridge the gap between strangers weakens the "proof" the story seeks to demonstrate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear arc, but the climax relies on fable logic (bread heat thawing a frozen door) that strains credibility in a physical eviction scenario. The resolution with the Captain—who is swayed by a symbolic gesture—is a "soft reset" that resolves the threat without a commensurate paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is efficient with excellent orientation and valid closure via renunciation. The central action of "reverse-engineering" is handled in summary ("mapped the knots, counted turns") rather than dramatized struggle, which slightly lowers the tension in the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and causal, but the progression is linear and relies on a specific sequence of instructions working perfectly on the first attempt. The resolution, while functionally a decisive change, feels slightly convenient as the magical object resolves the conflict without a complicating twist or deeper unexpected cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is tight and inventive, moving logically from the drift to the improvised orchestration of the storm. The use of the loose spar as a beater is a brilliant pivot that anchors the magical realism in physics and action. The "days later" sequence risks diffusing tension but successfully validates the method’s long-term utility, and the final image of repairing the mallet provides resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is clear and leads to a decisive change at the closure, with a strong "reconfiguration" of the world's reality. However, the middle section relies on convenient "video game logic" causality: following a crack leads directly to a cistern, which hides a door, which immediately yields the journal needed to solve the puzzle. This linearity slightly softens the mystery's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is solid, and the closure (the exhibit bargain) is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration that acknowledges cost. However, because the pivotal confrontation is narrated in summary, the resolution feels smoother and faster than the stakes imply, reducing the sense of earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is strong, with the underwater environment naturally complicating the survey. While Beran's solo appearance is slightly convenient, the resolution—using the environment (silt) to blind him—is a decisive, earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative moves with clear causal momentum from the inciting entry to the discovery of evidence. However, the pivotal deduction—realizing the disordered catalog is a code pointing specifically to a locked cabinet—relies on a significant intuitive leap that happens off-page or through compression ("Following the code"). The closure is clean and decisive, effectively securing the proof and resolving the immediate scene goal.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative relies on compressed summary for the first half ("She has spent months..."), reading more like a prologue than an immediate scene. While the closure logic holds, the lack of a fully dramatized approach reduces the causal grip of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is tight, utilizing the "twelve minutes" constraint to pressurize the scene effectively. The transition from technical calibration to metaphysical intervention is smooth, though the leap from perturbation theory to altering reality relies heavily on the established internal logic. Closure is decisive and resonant, effectively "repricing" the concept of a drone glitch as an act of mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from arrival to discovery to resolution, but relies on significant time-compression convenience (star trails thicken in moments to reveal a gap) that strains plausibility even in a lyrical mode. The resolution (fitting chips to spell READ) feels symbolically neat rather than causally earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    The closure is excellent, offering a resonant reconfiguration of the relationship and a decisive physical act (returning the hand). The reliance on a coincidental off-page discovery (the signed driftwood) to bind the characters is a slight causal shortcut, but it effectively initiates the moral dilemma rather than solving it.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and efficient, moving from a tense setup to a specific physical crisis and a resonant resolution. Causality is strong; the stalemate is broken not by luck but by the protagonist's specific tool and philosophy. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively with the transfer of the object, shifting the dynamic from hostility to shared memory. The physics of using soft brass to pry steel wire is a minor credibility stretch, but the scene sells the strain well.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and causal, moving from a thwarted plan to a new, harder objective. The closure (writing in the logbook) is a clear Decisive Change with emotional cost. The pacing holds up well under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative structure is solid, moving from the procedure to the labyrinth and finally to a Decisive Change (testifying). While the middle section relies on compressed summary ("each morning after"), the closure lands with a clear, felt cost—trading a safe, blank life for the consequences of his past crimes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with a clear causal chain from the ritual setup to the irreversible transformation. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change (becoming the hound) with tangible cost, resolving the premise with satisfying finality.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is tight, utilizing the saucer crack as a clever, established mechanic to bridge the domestic and the magical. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the time is restored, but the price—enduring the pain she skipped—is visibly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent, blending a physical quest (the map) with a metaphysical lock (the shadow work) effectively. The closure is decisive and earned via a Conceptual Repricing, though the mechanic of the "map" and the "hatch" relies heavily on dream logic that moves very swiftly in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story achieves closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration—the release of the bugs—but the narrative relies heavily on the "hush" and the bugs acting as convenient guides to bypass genuine obstacles. While the fable-like logic is consistent, the lack of causal friction in the escape softens the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent, and the closure (the successful signal and escape) is logically derived from the setup. However, the mechanics of the "blue pulse" remotely opening locks feel slightly convenient, and the confrontation with Captain Orven is resolved with too much ease to generate high causal tension. The cost—an empty Cradle—is present but lacks emotional weight on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story breaks its own rigorous "frictionless" logic at the climax by introducing an unexplained magical parting of the sea ("lift like a door"), which disconnects the solution from the established physics. Additionally, the temporal causality of Lysa's rocks finishing Eren's present-day sequence is muddy and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "vigil in pause" is a compelling structural device that anchors the scene, and the closure (rewriting poems as timed exposures) creates a strong Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the inciting incident for the backstory—a letter "sent years late" arriving exactly when needed—is a causality patch that feels contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal lens, moving efficiently from the decoding to the duel and resolution. While the structure is tight, the convenience of a sewing card perfectly decoding a custom sundial and the council's timely arrival to resolve the aftermath slightly strain plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece operates as a synopsis or fable-like summary spanning months, rather than a dramatized short story with a specific scenic anchor. There is no "now" moment where action unfolds in real-time; the narrative glides over riots, prison lockdowns, and months of rebuilding without a central scene to ground the arc. This violation of the scenic default prevents genuine structural closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight, with the film reel serving as a clever causal mechanism to bridge the physical and metaphysical. Closure is decisive and earned, though the "trap and the gift" realization feels slightly rushed in its explication compared to the showing of the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, moving cleanly from the inciting incident to a ritualistic climax that feels strictly derived from the story's internal logic. The closure is a strong Decisive Change that resolves the plot while effectively altering the protagonist’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative structure is excellent, using the lace pattern to causally guide the physical and emotional journey. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the physical act of pruning creates a decisive internal shift. The pacing is deliberate and supports the "memory therapy" premise perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of water-revealed maps/music builds density across in-between spaces to ledger discovery; closure as Conceptual Repricing in final image of musicians playing from gaps reconfigures performance premise with conceptual cost of embracing ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each dust sheet adds density until the final pinned map reweights the greenhouse’s breathing and Mara’s stance. Closure is a Charged Poise: the pinned map crystallizes options for the students and for Mara, with the cost of lost nights legible in the same image. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causality breaks; every beat is either because/therefore or pattern-deepening. The leak-patch is the decisive physical act that pays off the spiral forewarning.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: bombing → ledger → canyon reenactment → glass pane → public exposure. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the councilman’s silence and the artist’s new “empty spaces” window—visible to all. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only the single transition into the canyon is marked by white space, acceptable under two-shard default.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty slot becomes “a question, not a loss” that reweights silence into communal music; cost is felt in the brass fork pressed to a child’s palm and the bench’s bright vibration.

    Closure lands with Conceptual Repricing: the melted brass re-casts betrayal into future protection, cost legible in “tiny weight now carried two truths.” Causal chain (collect absences → imprint silence → extract confession) holds; only the late insertion of “harbor magistrate” feels like a teleporting prop, barely nicking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: tearing the portrait forecloses the magical exit and reweights Lio’s vocation from theft to gift, with visible cost (the paper shred and shared moonlight). Causal chain— jar proximity → door opens → choice posed → print torn → door quiets— holds under the Situational lens. Orientation is swift: emerald station / sunset / platform three by line three. One minor elasticity: the jar’s iron-sensitivity rule is introduced late yet governs the lock, but payoff is immediate enough to waive retro-patching penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the control-room-turned-observatory glass walls crystallize her bid to reopen inquiry, bookmark centered, cost paid in relinquished secrecy and assumed surveillance risk; lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of thaw and glass build-up reweights stakes. Causality holds: because she abandoned colleagues, therefore she returns alone; because she fuses the bookmark into each pane, the room becomes a transparent confession. Orientation clear by line 4; no teleporting props. One minor non-closure slip: the “first stranger” future beat is projected, not dramatized, keeping it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: discovery of file → flight to library → decryption → public confession, each beat tightening options. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost—she forfeits anonymity and safety, on-page in the signed call-sheet moment. Orientation is clean by 80 words; no teleporting props. One causal leap: the shell somehow contains an edited confession; not prepped, but the story teaches its magical realism early, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the map is drawn on blank, rain-bleached paper, reweighting the premise—navigation now lives inside the body, not the sky. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (salt-sweat walls, pebble clatter, dissolving gold) thickens until the final image crystallizes the new rule-set. Orientation is taught early (“storm-tossed ridge fort… its walls sweating salt”) and anchors hold; no penalty applied. The cost is legible in the ruined booklet and the felt hush, but the beat is slightly under-dramatized—an externalized gesture (tearing a page, swallowing a flake) would have sharpened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each loop layers micro-variations until the final sustained fuses them into a single, stable timeline. Orientation is swift—who, where, when land within 60 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the decision to stop looping crystallizes options and leaves the courtyard in one irreversible present, with the conceptual cost of the violin’s fracture legible in the final image. One transition (courtyard → chapel/workshop echoes) is cleanly handled, meeting mosaic tolerances.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each beat tightens because/therefore linkage (lens found → hidden → doodles traced → route decoded → lens returned → ledger signed). Closure is a Decisive Change: Mara forecloses her own secrecy, visible cost is her name on public evidence. Orientation clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. One persistent constraint—the stolen lens—shapes every tactical choice until relinquished.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the meter’s climb reframes “luck” as physiological alignment with honest labor, a cost paid in public shame and aching thumbs. Causal chain holds: past fraud → secret repair → present confession → measurable shift. The maze-night is one continuous scene; orientation is clear by line 5. No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: skipped clocks → nexus test → lever pull → rotor revision → restored stasis. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lever returns to neutral but the station now carries the sideways scar, felt in Mara's bone-tug memory. Cost is legible—“time resumed forward motion while keeping its sideways secrets”—and the lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger’s spatial score redefines “performance” and the dawn rehearsal enacts it with felt cost—musicians dispersed into ruin, music traveling through seams. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each water-bloom map is a pattern break that reweights the stake; the final image crystallizes the new rule-set. One minor slack: the stagehand’s whisper is off-stage exposition, but it is repaid when the first drop blots ink into a map, so the break is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s confession reframes the earlier lie and the station’s static-filled silence becomes a charged poise. Causal linkage holds—false report → iced door → fever → smudge → confession—each step narrows options. The Orientation Test is satisfied by line 4. One hairline wobble: Eli’s survival is revealed in a subordinate clause, slightly damping the cost moment, but the loneliness already incurred remains palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is airtight: confession → tunnel → valve → ghost bay → badge reveal → renunciation; each turn forecloses an option and raises cost. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he will call, not forgive—with the concrete cost of bearing Mara’s guilt into the world. Orientation is swift; the lens holds without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the swan refolded, doorway closed, cost legible in the refusal to record. Causality is lyric-accumulative; the swan’s folds mirror passages, but the library→river transfer is asserted, not shown to constrain later options. Orientation is waived: disorientation is taught early and repaid in the final image of sunlight on spores.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shared hum reconfigures both characters’ options without dissolving grief, cost felt in Liora’s exposed locket and Mara’s first audible thread. Causal chain holds—permission is built beat-by-beat from drum invitation → eclipse darkness → hair-curl reveal → hum; no coincidence solves anything. Orientation is clean by line 5; the single transition (clinic→grove) is telegraphed. Only a sliver off for the off-stage “weeks passed” ellipsis that skips a visible intermediate failure/cost beat.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lysa’s pinning of the tapestry re-orients the library’s meaning under a new north; cost is the irrevocable loss of the dream-axis, felt in the final wind-pressed metal skin. Causality is accumulative/textural: each diary/tapestry beat thickens the pattern until the axis-shift becomes undeniable. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“reclaimed silo library at the edge…”). No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because her earlier cookies reached wrong hands, the patrol comes; therefore she redirects the beam and burns the archive. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (Golden Lotus, midnight ferry) and waiver applies since disorientation (no west steps) pays off at climax. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses her prophet role, cost shown in “blank paper…salt smell,” reconfiguring her future options. No teleporting props; microdot specs, lens shutters, and courier skiff all track.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the single blue circle reweights “anchor” from prison to neighborly boundary, cost paid by the cold breeze that slips out of Mara. Causal linkage holds: each rhetorical device (anaphora, chiasmus, irony) tightens the knot until the memory loosen it. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“At the Dimensional Anchor”). Lens is Causal; every beat is a because/therefore step. No plot amnesia or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the horizon slides, childhood street aligns, and the unheard symphony becomes “instructions” with conceptual cost—keep writing, seed futures. The mirrored horizon taught early re-weights meaning at the end; the nautilus and fortune are persistent constraints that shape tactics. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than plot-reversal, but the final image reconfigures stakes cleanly under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the runes steady, timelines fold, and she walks away heavier—cost is legible. Causal lens holds: because she confronts the fear-generated branches, therefore she can choose one weighted timeline. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“glowing viaduct after rain”). No plot amnesia; tablet rules are taught through iterative testing. Minor time-stutter: the patrol-drone strand is introduced and dropped without tactical consequence, keeping it just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because the needle snapped, the filament fed; because Mara reverses the groove and scores it, the parasite starves and the Listener retreats. Orientation is clean by line 4 (who, quarry path, when = season shift). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern’s returning echo re-prices silence itself as pliable material, and Mara pockets the now-inert needle—persistent constraint that will remind her forward is earned by backward motion. Cost is legible in the stinging heat she feels in her ribs as each scratch bleeds sound back into the world.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: pigeon note → quarantine discovery → lateral infiltration → data-airlift escape → watcher misled. Each because/therefore link narrows options; the unlatched gate loops back to payoff. Closure is a Charged Poise: the courtyard hush regained but now shared with Mara and the knowledge that data can outrun fences—cost felt in the continuing silhouette outside.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: anonymous note → Conservatory at moonrise → vial reveals mother’s scent → catalyzes resurrection → Lio renounces selling light. Closure is a Decisive Change: he pockets the vial and hangs lanterns for others, a visible forfeit of former trade. Cost is on-page: “he finally chose to keep instead of sell.” Orientation clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the slip-knot stays set, beings neither freed nor caged, and the poet exits carrying the visible cost of unfinished discovery. Causality is clean—every grotto beat grows from the rope-map the poet lays. Orientation is swift: “After the energy beings arrived” anchors time, place, and stakes by line three. The final image reweights the premise: anyone may speak the verse and pay the price, re-pricing motion-memory bargains across the world.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush is “unbound,” ordinary noise returns, and Mara’s laugh carries the conceptual cost of accepting an unfinished world. Causality holds: because she follows the faintest tremors, because she bows at the exact pitch that loosens the knot, the cistern ripples. Orientation is swift—Echo Harbor, post-burn, night before hall closure—well inside 120 words. One soft teleport: the tin-pan bonfire at home becomes a rusted-drum bonfire in the greenhouse without transition, but the pattern is accumulative/lyric, so the ellipsis is licensed and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s renunciation of untouchability is visible in the carved name and the coins she still accepts—cost is unmistakable. Causal chain holds: because she senses the buried guilt via static, she risks substituting her own shame for product, therefore forfeiting her emotional anonymity. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mistaken address returns, now embraced as perpetual motion, reweighting Mara’s earlier charity into an uncloseable circuit with financial and emotional cost. Causal chain holds: envelope → Eli → tuner → janitor → longshoreman → back to Mara; each because/therefore step is on-page. Orientation locked by line 5; single transition (pavilion→library) is legible. One tightening only, sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the living reed lattice physically extends the kin-map and Sava demands to be named “maker,” foreclosing guest status with irrevocable social cost. Causal chain holds—each tag sighting tightens the council’s need, her reed markers accumulate, and the obsidian arbor’s reed impressions prove shared origin, justifying her leap. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of tags + reeds reweights belonging until the final image reconfigures community space.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is airtight: because the Giant’s nap suspends time, therefore Rin must borrow moments, which forces her to break the cadence, which uncages the echo and awakens the Giant. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s music is now permanently unresolved and Rin’s debt is compounding. Orientation is swift—canal, studio, pendant—all within 60 words. One transition (studio → tower) is clean; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the repaired quartz tile and buried optimism reweight ambiguous loss into livable continuum, cost felt in the un-crossed bridge. Causal linkage holds—each step from mosaic decoding to ladder-bridge is because/therefore, no retro-patching. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“cavern breathed”), well inside 120-word window. One scene, single POV, one meaningful tightening at thirteen-drop; scope defaults met.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the shard’s warmth reweights “being seen” as “being remembered,” with the cost of permanent partial invisibility still legible. Causal chain holds: blackout → cabinet pops → fragment found → cached → reclaimed → self-applied. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of returned objects and sense memories tightens until the final image reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each storm-beat adds sensory density until the leaf reconfigures her stance. The closure is a Charged Poise—she mails her data but keeps the leaf—cost is the irreversible bodily change and the surrender of observer distance. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“smallest plant nursery on the coastal highway”). No causal cheat; the metamorphosis escalates through repeated tactile contact, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: sister loss → brooch quest → rain trails → compass → exchange. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 4; no penalty. Closure is a crisp Earned Stasis: he trades the intact brooch for the map/vision, loses the sister talisman forever—“clasp bite like a promise” makes cost legible. One minor causality slip: the oiled paper map appears exactly when needed with no prior seed, but it complicates rather than rescues, so tolerated.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cave tunes perception, not destiny, and Lan’s unreliable sight is permanently exposed. Causal chain holds—pearl-light → possession → song → release—each beat narrows options until Sera’s plain chant reweights the world rule. Cost is legible in Lan’s stagger and the pearl’s dulled afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the first note becomes an invitation, not a command, re-weighting the meaning of both sound and silence; cost is legible in Ilven’s trembling hand and the town’s gathered anger. Causal chain holds: valve → spaced confessions → communal hearing → altered social contract. Orientation is clean within 60 words; mosaic of three shards is taught early and lands under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the punched card and star-dust first step crystallize a before/after in the fortress of unspoken truths with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain—cracks → seam → phantom punch → admission → train—tightens once yet forecloses return. Orientation anchored by word 90 (“riverfront mist”). Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end. 9+ quick test satisfied: cost is legible in the crescent hole and the door of stacked letters.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank square’s deliberate silence reweights all prior squares and whale-song into a public grief-archive; cost is the unfinishable symphony now living in Mara. Accumulative lens holds: each copied square thickens the tower’s air and the whales’ timing, pattern-break is the blank center. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (roofless tower, salt wind, Mara polishing brass). No causal break; tile’s rule is taught early and persists.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the completed amulet rewrites him into “what remains,” stripping immortality with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds—storm → mutiny → amulet map → self-offering—though the midpoint “corridors demand a leader” is asserted more than dramatized. Orientation is swift: immortal, prismatic refuge, storm, within 120 words. One transition (corridor tilt → heart chamber) is legible; mosaic pattern not needed. Lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because Mara hides Mercy, because she writes the real affidavit, therefore Ivo’s con collapses and Sami gains shelter. The closure beat—“the prep room’s quiet labor had already priced the truth”—delivers a Conceptual Repricing with undeniable social cost (father’s authority forfeited, daughter’s ethic priced). Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“funeral home prep room”) and never drifts. One tiny loop: “quiet labor had already priced the truth” is the second use of “priced”; still, the sentence reweights the premise, so the flaw is cosmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Haru’s descent with “cataloged sensations” reweights silence from loss to portable archive. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each charted hum layers a new invented history until the bonsai garden refracts the pattern into charged poise. Cost is legible in the final image: he carries the burden of naming time alone. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator stands nameless at dawn, the tide erasing footprints while the rescued names thicken the air—cost is felt in the irrevocable dispersal of the archive that once anchored him. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tide cycle and overheard shard layers density until the pattern break of 9H reweights the stake from personal erasure to custodial surrender. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“Port of Larkspur”), and causality remains intact—every stolen story is a because that leads to the therefore of scattering the files.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the universal riddle is not a hidden word but the act of lingering in the whisper between closing pages—cost is the vanished compass, the irreversible shift from seeking answers to hosting silence. Causal chain holds: unsigned letter → compass query → cello retellings → needle stabilizes → needle disappears when Eli accepts the method. The cracked dome framing “a patch of night sky like an eye” is the charged image that reweights all prior maps. One micro-drag: the exact moment the observatory “blurred” is slightly under-cued, but the final dawn rinse anchors the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: chip → graffiti → drifting blocks → moratorium. Orientation is clean within 50 words; raft-city rules stay consistent. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost: the city is physically reconfigured and Ira’s dual role is exposed, her exhaustion the price. The lens never wavers; no teleporting props or retro patches. One minor loop: “sell a map / protect a people” restates the stake already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final photograph and the grain’s burial beside the negative reweight the entire night into an elegy whose cost is the sky’s loss. Causal chain holds—each chemical strip triggers a concrete camera act; the hourglass gift seeds the parting image. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. One persistent constraint—the approaching tracking lights—shapes every tactical timing choice and charges the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: failed drone → courier → fountain-light diagnosis → solder → chirp recalibration → ship departs. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the drone’s steady song reweights Sera’s risk, cost felt in the “water spilling from each link” image. Lens stays causal; no orientation debt. Minor slack: courier’s silence is unmotivated, but it doesn’t break the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: condensation pattern, vellum one-word reveal, and spring image layer until the stake reweights. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 4), the single transition (outpost → hollow) is legible, and the closure beat—“the spring answered by beginning again and again”—delivers a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: the blank space is alive, the Ministry will weaponize it. No causality breaks; persistent constraint (radio dead, glass cracked) shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the carrier folds the decree, the town hums alive, the fork is pocketed—cost is the unspoken future vigilance. Causality holds: each footfall → fork resonance → object answer → social proof. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens drift. The single tightening beat (mass walk under the arch) is sufficient for 700-word scope. Only the off-stage governor threat keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: mirror pulse releases the crew-tethered memory yet leaves Mara still thirty fathoms down with empty tank—undeniable cost on the page. Causal chain (snagged tether → unsnarling → vial release → memory bridge) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; escalation comes through density/texture, not because/therefore reversals, and is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the lattice warms in pocket while the boy cedes the future hush to the soon-found bodies—cost is the loss of his private truth. Causal chain holds: because he threads the labyrinth with his own story, he can deposit the words and accept disbelief. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final image reweights all prior patterning. No orientation or logic slips.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard blooms, the ghost sleeps, Eli’s heart is emptied—cost is the final image. Causal chain (bead-resonance→orchard awakening→life-for-life) holds from inciting visit to last glow. Orientation is taught by line 3; no penalty. One shard, single POV, default scope met.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the painted door becomes a real cleft, townspeople trade torches for orchids, and reverence is re-stitched into being. Causal chain—plate map → sleepwalking reconnaissance → thread guides → communal re-entry—holds without gaps; each night’s loop tightens possibility. Orientation is swift: “After the tide pools empty” anchors time, “wharf,” “shed roof,” “red canyon” place us within 60 words. One minor bobble: the smuggler’s apology is paid off only by atmosphere, not consequence, but it doesn’t rupture the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the re-aligned sundial shadow proves time resumes after pauses, reweighting her life of interruptions with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—tremor forces climb-out → notebook discovery → decision to stay—each because/therefore legible. One transition (surface↔tomb) is clean; orientation anchored by word 80. No lens ambiguity; the final image fuses Accumulatively-earned pattern with Causal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: chalk codes → scan margins → discover intercepted skins → invent trap-alias → mail letter. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the city’s skin-mail system is now booby-trapped against the archive thief, and the protagonist’s chalk marks become active surveillance. Orientation is anchored by 60 words; no lens ambiguity; cost is legible in the final postal act.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is immaculate: intercepted errors → stitched mis-map → orrery sync → beacon-log proof → tube sent to printers. The “click” moment delivers a Decisive Change: the city’s hidden dock is now documented, the coup’s logistics exposed, Liora’s path irreversibly treasonous. Cost is legible in the final held-breath silence and the half-tooth mis-sync that could still hang her. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Decisive Change: the apology is finally spoken, the condensation message vanishes, the shard is transferred—cost legible in the moon-smoothed edge and the letters never sent. Causal chain holds: shard wound → moon healing → spirit rehearsals → brother’s arrival → apology. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (stilt house, dusk). One transition (night 1 → night 4) is cleanly marked. No lens ambiguity; causal logic drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: coral fragment → cast decryption → radio translation → stand-down order, each step a because/therefore linkage. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“hospital’s water lilies”) and never wavers. The decisive change—vigil instead of revenge—is on-page, legible, and carries persistent cost: the coral left behind, the cast permanently inked with confessions. No plot amnesia or teleporting props; every object is tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the film records her own hand mid-stroke, proving the dream’s method can be carried back. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each moth-note, light-projection, and mural layer thickens meaning until the courtyard reconfigures memory itself. Fog-waived orientation is justified; the disorientation pays off when fog becomes projection screen.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s refusal to finish is a Charged Poise that reweights the entire premise—curiosity now trumps certainty, and the cost is the perpetual loop of awakening. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; each echo-folding beat increases density until the final image of mirrored singers reflecting ever-smaller Maras crystallizes the stake. Causality holds: every awakening is triggered by her own sonic choice, so the ellipsis is motivated. Orientation is taught early (amphitheater, garden, mural) and the disorientation is functional, paying off in the nested structure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the taxed-thought regime is subverted by “weather” no one can invoice—an image that reweights the premise with social cost. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each garden fragment is a bead in a growing pattern whose legibility from the roof is the decisive tightening. The pinned-spiral → arrow → question-mark sequence is the taught pattern that pays off when the auditors stall in moth dust and the external pattern solidifies.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the torn postcard re-seeds the armistice, lilies re-bloom, and the city’s stance shifts from blade to listening—cost is the irreversible destruction of the card and Mara’s permanent exile from certainty about Iren. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spiral echo thickens pattern until the final cadence reweights peace itself.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored song reweights the entire archive, turning deserted aisles into resonant company; the cost is the caretaker’s lifetime of solitary tending. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each shard (cracked chime, bamboo swap, first whole chord) adds density until the final cadence ignites every orchid. Orientation is taught early—opal library above clouds, dawn routine—so no penalty applies. The lens holds without contradiction; the ending image of “one clean note at a time” crystallizes the new equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: hidden codex → ruptured trust → vow-ink ritual → public confession → re-braided promises. Orientation lands by line 5; the midnight vault remains the single continuous scene. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost: the codex’s power is redefined, the archive’s social contract rewritten, the ink well passed as perpetual price. No teleporting props or convenient amnesia; every beat either narrows option or raises cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: blank note → adhesive test → chain decoding → pulse-gate solution → public confession → shared measurement. Each beat narrows options and raises social cost; the final accord is a decisive change charged by the risk both machinists accept. Closure lands with the chain literally in new hands—felt, physical, irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: receipt → hidden scores → shared meteorite → dawn release; each because/therefore tightens options. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses retreat by sending birds, cost felt in “attic emptied.” No orientation debt; lens stable. Minor ellipsis (night reflection) is paid off in choice.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the corridor dissolves behind her, the brass plate reweights “necessary distances” with conceptual cost, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds. Causality is tight—logbook code → wood grain → wind corridor—yet the brass plate’s late arrival is a mild teleporting prop.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the algae-lit feather and spiraling fireflies reconfigure “belonging” from solitary reading to joint pointing. Causal chain holds—because Mira opens the terrarium, Jonah’s isolation loosens, and sunrise becomes boundary not sentence. Cost is legible in the unspoken risk of staying.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: missing path → seed trail → geode door → confession → ridge restored. Each beat tightens options under the Causal lens. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost—the ridge re-appears, Mira’s shame is spoken, narrator’s tool is scratched forever. Orientation is taught by word 80; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: weighted board → white square → story performance → bishop gift → same bishop pops warped lock under rising water, saving the boy. Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the performer’s private game becomes public rescue, and the arcade floorboards’ applause-like tapping reconfigures the night’s meaning. Cost is on-page: the tool almost lost to tide, the performer’s anonymity surrendered to a grateful mother and watchwoman. Lens stays causal throughout; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the garden slackens its grip only after the poem is cut into her skin, making exile irreversible and portable. Causal chain—speck → anchoring → seated dance → inscription → release—holds without ellipsis or convenience. Orientation is swift: who/where/when clear by line 5. Cost is legible in the final image of the linen-wrapped arm and the garden “keeping time behind her,” a persistent constraint she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the torn demolition sheet and the steady horizon in plain glass reweight the bay’s future with undeniable social cost. Causal chain holds—stone-thrown interference pattern → inspector’s reframed stance—without off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is swift; lens (Situational→Conceptual) is taught by 25 % and stable at exit. Only the inspector’s reversal lacks a preceding beat of visible internal struggle, a hairline slip keeping it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because she lied then, she must confess now; the cracked box object anchors every beat, its final hand-off crystallizing the before/after. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she forecloses her own clean conscience with the line “it had cost her the right to sleep,” a felt price that reweights the bargain. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props or logic drift. One tightening turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the canopy lifts under an updraft whose equation she paid for with通宵 labor and mirrored cuts; the image reweights “hope” from abstraction to shared aerodynamic fact. Causal linkage holds—each balloon cluster tightens the gauge’s impossible readings until the sideways units stabilize into a lift column the town can ride. No teleporting props; the grandfather’s gauge is present from first beat. Cost is legible in the final line: “she did not know which world would be saved,” a foreclosed path that keeps consequence airborne.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chord she plays into the wall reweights every prior echo, sealing the chamber under a deliberate lie. Causality holds: grandfather’s waxed negative → matched intervals → bricked door → archived voices → her choice to conceal. Orientation is swift—salt fog, ivy, collapsed entrance within 60 words. One minor loop: “the corridor answered” repeats twice in fifty words, dulling the escalation beat, but the lens stays accumulative-textural and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: lullaby-code → find painter → mirror test → surrender pulse → save both kids. The mirror corridor collapses into one decisive future and the bells provide audible cost at the exact beat the pulse is let go—clean Earned Stasis with price.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because Sera brings the ritual, therefore the commanders must burn relics, therefore a treaty becomes thinkable. Orientation anchored by word 60; no penalty. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses personal absolution and accepts daily labor, cost legible in “daily labor she had finally chosen to pay for.” One tightening beat suffices; no plot amnesia. Slight cap at 8.7 because the treaty’s enforcement mechanism remains off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the egg’s shatter converts manufactured silence into remembered sound inside her, reweighting the premise that the world is always buyable. Causal chain holds: drought → cracks readable → arrival → cracked wafer → renunciation; each because/therefore tightens options. Orientation is anchored by line 3 with salt flat, night, lone figure; no disorientation serves closure, so no penalty. The final image of wind carrying ivory shards along the crack-map is the exact sentence where cost becomes undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is immaculate: each thread-untangle tightens risk until the breath-lock reverses power. Closure lands as Decisive Change—echoes scatter, obedience fractures—cost legible in the orchestra’s falter. Lens holds from salt-snow opening to starlit exit.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Ilya signs a binding napkin contract that permanently limits his artistic license—felt cost is the applause he must now forgo. Causal chain holds: argument → dome reversal → public backward show → consent contract. Orientation clean by word 80. One transition (gallery→dome→bar→dome) stays legible; pattern taught early. No plot amnesia; the stolen stick returns to exact price.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reeds’ “steady clack” replaces the 1952 beacon’s stutter, reconfiguring migration’s rhythm with felt cost—the frames are already being dismantled. Causal chain holds: failed beacon → wing discovery → reed metronome → monarch alignment. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“grotto… above the cloud sea”). No lens ambiguity; accumulative pattern (frames, cloth, names, wing) tightens once and pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the bronze strip reweights the meaning of “mending” from private absolution to communal resonance; cost is legible in the permanent public playback. Causal chain—guilt → invitation → rope decoding → casting—holds without gaps; each beat alters options. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“glacier road to the icebound sanctum”). One micro turn (forgiveness already granted, yet world only “thaws”) sets up the final reconfiguration. Lens is Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the directive’s decay and the forest’s reversal of selection authority reweight the entire rule-set, cost paid by the bleeding thumb-print that seals the new contract. Causal chain holds—wafer found → hatch opens → dream directive → blood seal → map of heartbeat lines—each step narrowing options. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of rot and overgrowth tightens until the final image crystallizes the power shift. One minor causality smudge: the terminal’s “final prompt” appears without prior seed, but the blood reagent retrofits it acceptably.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the mirror-face rewrites the sky on his palms, sealing the covenant by voiding his certainty. Causal linkage holds throughout—each schematic test tightens the choice until the stylus snap pays the price. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (tile, tablets, star charts) escalates until meaning reconfigures. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed cylinder turns in utter silence while everyone “remembers hearing,” a conceptual repricing that makes forgiveness a bodily fact and forecloses the old war-stance. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each refugee’s half-remembered tap-beat layers into the final pattern, tightening the stake without a single causal reversal. The missing pin’s reappearance at the instant of need is the persistent constraint that shapes every prior tactic; its cost is felt in Lio’s earlier failed attempts to discard it.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirror now holds the restored orchard and Lio carries a “second heart,” reconfiguring dream/waking boundaries with felt warmth as cost. Causal chain holds—find sextant → rebuild with mirrors → breathe to flatten fog → align reflection → trap dream—each step narrows options. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“ruined orchard district”), well inside the 120-word safe zone. No lens ambiguity; the piece teaches its accumulative/textural pattern early and sustains it to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: breach → trespass → ribbon quest → eye repair → vow renewal, each beat narrowing options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira’s unlicensed promise to keep mending forecloses guild protection yet is paid for with the confiscated kit and public self-outlawing. The carved “deciduous vows” graffito is the persistent constraint that shapes her final tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard is her family’s archive and she has already carved the face, so her future is foreclosed. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of reordering logbook pages, tags, mirrors—culminating in a charged crystallization. Causality is lyric-loose but coherent; cost is legible in the cameo’s returned stare. Orientation is taught early via “between first and last page,” waiving spatial debt.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because Lysa hears silence → she maps omissions → she inserts blank pages → corridor opens → readers breathe. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 80 (“mountain shook… new door in the snow”). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the store’s rule-set is rewritten so rescue missions arrive *before* loss becomes law; the cost is the curator’s remembered humanity and Lysa’s forfeited monopoly on correction. One minor causality fuzz: the diary’s “missing note” hum is not shown to us, only reported, but it does not break the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the ship chooses direction only after Mara trades certainty for motion, a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Causal chain is thin—filaments humming, mannequin creaking—but the Accumulative/Textural pattern holds: each narrated rescue thins fog and rewrites memory, tightening stakes without cheating. Orientation wavers early (“the night their mother stopped saying their names”) yet the payoff justifies the initial dislocation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: seal summons door → unbraid rope → merge record → new text → public reading; each step tightens options. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the university’s forgotten guilt is now archivally indelible. Orientation anchors by line 4; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length; the final filing act forecloses denial.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the beings drink vibration, therefore Sava redirects their hunger into the Forge; because she risks the stone, the caves regain layered music. Orientation is immediate—who, where, when land by line 3. Closure is a Decisive Change with persistent cost: the Forge becomes a shared feeding ground, price etched in the new crack-circles she will eternally monitor. No teleporting props or causal amnesia; every beat grows from last.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: sabotage memory → meteor shard → silence tool → star alignment → restored beam → answering flash; each step forecloses alternatives (the hush can only steady or swallow, the prism must be re-fractured), and the closure beat—“We were scraps…some accidents are invitations”—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with the felt cost of perpetual vigilance now shared.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s own memories become the Archive’s spine, visible cost felt in “I felt my identity shift.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shadow-measurement adds density until the final braid steadies the fog. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are vivid within 50 words. Causality remains intact: personal offering → fog stabilizes → dawn line re-measured.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: mosaic note → low-burst shells → council laughter → gate opened; each beat tightens options. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the sky no longer “empty” because the social rule-set has been rewritten. Cost is visible: Jorin forfeits his passport-rag and the fortress forfeits its proud starvation. One micro-transition (courtyard to river gate) is legible; orientation anchors within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pair step into foam under stars with the harbor still coming, jars still hidden, trust deferred—felt cost is the unspoken lie. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each tide image thickens stakes until the final paradox of erased footprints/unchanged beach reweights meaning. Causality intact: cicada use → foresight → decision to withhold maps. Orientation anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each silence sample thickens pattern until gilded hush reweights the bunker-child’s world. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by line 5; inversion physics taught early and paid off at bell-snap closure. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bedroom air “wide enough to live in” carries undeniable cost—she forfeits her father’s boxed safety. Persistent constraint: exposure method now governs every future breath.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s steadiness reconfigures the stake—silence now carries her forward—while the cold vial and rising wind make the cost undeniable. Causal linkage holds: storm-glass warning → brake → slower crossing → taught listening → earned exit. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“drifting prism terrace above the river yards”); no penalty. One reflective block (mother) stays under 20 % and primes Elias’s present brake choice. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: ruby flake → orchard → descending stair → interface → refusal, each link forced by prior choice. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the throne’s meaning flips from sovereignty to shared witness, cost legible in the empty seat she leaves behind. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. The single beat of escalation is sufficient under short-form default.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rebuilt bridge is not a reunion but a one-way exhalation back to life, cost paid by the reopened scars. Causal chain holds—each scar-named memory tightens the seam until the final strike of the ring re-mortars the threshold. Orientation is taught early by tactile anchors (warm iron, soot walls). No lens ambiguity; the accumulative pattern of scar-doors → breath is legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the drum’s diamond chain revalues shame into collective currency, foreclosing the path of solitary scams forever. Causal linkage holds throughout—because Mara once sold lies, therefore she chooses truth as the only convertible pressure; because neighbors pour regret, therefore diamonds accrue. Orientation is clean by line 3 (who/where/when) and the quantum promise rule is taught early via glitch text, then paid off when “enough” gains literal mass. Persistent constraint: the submarine bolt stays threaded with diamonds, a permanent public record of her cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: each discovery (crank→panel→ledger→voice) tightens options toward abdication. Closure is a Decisive Change with treasury forfeiture; cost is legible in “ordered the crown’s treasury turned to the lost bridge.” Orientation anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the button left on the table reweights both women’s futures with undeniable, unpaid cost. Causal chain is clean—dust rectangle → Drawer 4 → bundle → letter → Josie’s tremor—each because/therefore step narrows options. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“foster care file room”) and holds. One persistent constraint shapes tactics: the missing page that refuses erasure; this price is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: failed courier → locked safe-house → booth key → switchboard intel → watermark clue → plate theft → lagoon release. Each “because” tightens options; the Ministry’s rewriting is the persistent antagonistic force. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost: the sirens converge while the true pages float away, indelibly reweighting tomorrow’s text. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (Archive Ministry revision) and geography tracks throughout; no lens ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the town wakes ordinary, Lio remains alone under fading colors—options reweighted, silence now both home and wound. Accumulative lens holds: each whispered breath thickens the hush until the code stalls. Causality is internal and lyrical, not event-driven, but the final image pays the cost of maternal erasure, satisfying the required RR.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the公开 reading of the elders’ confession reweights Veyroot’s entire flotation logic from theft to shared memory, with Lio glittering as living evidence of the price. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each monument and prodded leaf adds density until the pattern ruptures the vault. The Orientation Test is waived—deliberate drift (who/when never pinned) is taught early and pays off when the ash sky brightens to “pearl gray,” marking the before/after shift. One scaffold lapse: “he emerged transformed always from the shadows” repeats the prompt phrase verbatim and momentarily breaks the lyric skin.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: harbor fire → admiral’s need → feather lure → tunnel descent → compass recovery → bargain. The midnight-minute motif and ash-gray feather pattern teach the lens early; closure reweights it when the chiming minute becomes chosen, not fixed. Cost is legible in the final line: “the town could begin again without pretending it knew the route.”

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: drip of Mara’s name → coin blooms → Ellis forced → body found → name restored. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the lighter tongue and glowing coin reweight the premise that names are currency. Cost is visible in the vial of Ellis’s sobbed name sealing the shroud. Orientation anchored by line 4; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gorge returns Elowen’s laugh “gentler,” reconfiguring both women’s options without tidy resolution; cost is the lingering mist that once was a child. Causal linkage holds throughout—each pluck of the warped harp because/therefore exposes more confession until the laugh breaks pattern. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Echo Gorge”) and never wavers. No teleporting props; the crocodile tooth is introduced, carried, and transferred under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the forest’s pollen burns away anesthesia and rewrites mercy as release for the tortured, absolving victims not perpetrators—an undeniable reweighting of the premise. Causal chain holds: strap → tremor-code → equation → spoken witness → pollen purge, each step because/therefore. Orientation anchors (who-where-when) arrive by line 3; disorientation is thematic, not structural, and pays off in final image. Cost is legible in the last line—“a map in my skin”—permanent somatic inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the joined lens reweights whose names circulate in the city, with undeniable social cost. Causal linkage holds—lens fragment → spiral → hatch → rejected canvases → spoken names—each beat narrows options until the seam is anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the chalked crack and warming barrel reconfigure his eternal vigil without resolving it, cost felt in the quiet shaft. Causal chain—dust pattern → ceiling panel → spring retrieval → slack chain → chalk seal—holds cleanly. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no disorientation serves the ending, so no penalty. One minor causality fuzz: the modern control cabinet appears only at the reveal, not seeded earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral print compresses eternity, Mara steps back onto the balcony, and the library’s rules rewrite under a single frozen instant—cost is the irreversible loss of negotiable reality. Causal chain holds: spiral frost → rupture demand → vial-under-platen → catalog shatter → mirror-image stasis. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blurred communal map forces every faction to confront plural pasts, foreclosing single-narrative possession. Causal chain intact—shard → alcove vision → co-curated storm exhibition. Mosaic structure taught early (visible-time rule) and transitions legible. Cost is unmistakable: “the asteroid’s baroque stonework had shifted by a fraction.”

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the stolen light is returned via Ivo’s tuning act, midnight is re-balanced, and the cost—binding to truth, exposure of hollowness—is on-page (“oathfern still un-wilted”). Causal chain holds: chip → resonance → confession → tuning → dawn. The Orientation Test is satisfied by line 6. One minor slack: the Thief’s instant capitulation feels abrupt, but the resonant reconfiguration satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the factory’s origin story reweights the whole quest and the compass becomes a warning, not a tool. Causal chain holds—each psychometry reading escalates knowledge and tightens options until renunciation is the only graceful exit. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“empty loading yard”) and the single time-skip (“Then she walks north…”) is legible. One micro-drag: the sentence “She holds it and performs her method” could more smoothly cue the first psychometry beat, but causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the two spirals aligning reweight time itself and leave Mara with a charged, open mandate. Causal chain holds—lantern discovery → spiral instruction → town reads signs → wall saved—each because/therefore link tightens under the Causal lens. One micro-turn (Nora sees Mara’s sculpture) suffices for this length. Cost is visible in the final image: she pockets the fragile slide, accepting perpetual responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each postcard, garden observation, and glass layer thickens pattern until the map of vents reconfigures meaning.

Causal chain holds: letters → zeppelin → vision → parley → price paid; no teleporting props. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (county attic, zeppelin coast, dawn drop), and the final image reweights the premise (“steady thrum” overhead = truth can’t be buried again).

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the corridor shrinks to “a ring of clear ice” around a single rye seed, making the cost of borrowed time legible and payable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern tightening (seed rows, bot schedules) literally collapses the vortex. Orientation is clean: who/where/when signaled by “icebound atrium under starlight” within the first 50 words. No causal breaks; every beat (sorting, spiral tightening, hatchling return) is driven by Lio’s micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is immaculate: cracked belfry → glue cure window → microclimate data → vane switch → low-note warning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the monastery’s single gratitude bell confirms the new protocol survives, cost visible in the dispatcher’s unanswered demand. Orientation anchor (“winter solstice…above the clouds”) lands by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the density of meteor arcs, lantern glow, and shared silence tightens until the final collective trace reweights grief. Closure is a Charged Poise—the converging green streaks point back at the station, crystallizing the option to stand together inside fracture. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“basalt ridge,” “night,” “Lio”). No causality break; the tunnel discovery is coincidence that complicates, not resolves. Cost is legible in the image of “brief fragments” they laugh at, accepting impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: reading the slips aloud dissolves the ghosts and reweights the oasis from mausoleum to “a place that could be tended.” Causality is lyric-accumulative: each spoken sentence peels a ghost away, tightening the pattern until Mara’s last slip releases the narrator. Orientation is swift—oasis, dry spring, hive ring by line 30—and the lens holds. Cost is visible in the final image of the nodding sister and the emptied box glowing under moon-coloured glass.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)

No lens ambiguity; the final image reconfigures stakes under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the repaired kite flies, the feather is released, and the notebook sequence “finally held” with visible cost—Rian loses both keepsakes.

    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator’s theft reweights the entire pilgrimage from managed ritual to personal catalyst, with the warm fly amber and shard in pocket as felt constraint. Causality holds: every beat accumulates sensory data that feeds the final crystallization; no information appears without prior seed. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (“rainwashed tower… I arrived”). The lens stays Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensifies until the seam opens—and the final image of “different chemistry” is legible cost. A hairline slip: the council’s motive is asserted, not dramatized, keeping the score just sub-9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the jetty blossoms against the empty sea, reconfiguring war into covenant with undeniable conceptual cost.

Orientation is swift; lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the double sky rewrites “north,” the hatch opens, and the coast road becomes the only valid vector—cost is the abandoned station and the lifelong stigma now re-valued as instrument. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (echoed silence, twin star-drifts, temporal echo) tightens the calibration until the page itself becomes compass. Orientation is taught by line 4 (“station hung above the black ocean”) and anchors hold; no lens ambiguity. The wheel-turn is a decisive physical act that externalizes the reconfiguration, satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the slight abstraction of “curse” keeps it just below the gate.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (swap bishop → whisper → climb → let go) is a because/therefore chain that narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change: the sky steadies, chains loosen, map opens—cost is the literal fall and the unknown flight path now binding them. Orientation is taught by sentence 3 (“icebound spire above the clouds”) and anchors hold. One micro-turn—pawn to bishop swap—carries the entire plot; no redundancy or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: pawn-less board on gallery ledge crystallizes new historian-stance with undeniable conceptual cost—testimony freed, crowns still exposed. Causal chain—message → gait-cipher → archive breach → sacrifice—tightens options under Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat reweights what “record” means. Persistent constraint (no pawns = guardianship of the small) shapes tactics from bridge memory to final image. Cost is legible in the single line “I left nothing for the loyalists to burn,” foreclosing future safety.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mountain exhales, aisles fix, and the true shoreline replaces gentler lies—cost is the unedited memory now irretrievably externalised. Causal chain holds: because the narrator sacrifices silence, the stone rewrites the store’s nightly shuffle. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation that pays off when corridors stabilise under named breath.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the labyrinth dims, seconds release, and Mara’s anonymity is the felt price. Causal chain holds—each tapestry-decoded move forces a corresponding turn in the platinum maze; the final “return” is the logical culmination of the sequence. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by word 60. No lens ambiguity; the story teaches its accumulative pattern early and pays it off in the mirrored gate image.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s deliberate surrender of art and color refracts the truth permanently through the canyon’s echoes, paying the “price of forgiveness” on the page. Causal chain holds: because she hides the murder in laughter, she must scatter the name; because she scatters it, the canyon amplifies it; because amplification succeeds, she forfeits her medium. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 60 words and remain stable. One minor scaffold—”the crowd took up the lines” repeats the prior beat’s effect—does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the workshop stabilizes, but the cost is the irrevocable admission of helplessness and the visible golden scars—an Earned Stasis that forecloses the old illusion of control. Causal chain holds: charm counterbalances → resin recipe revealed → pontoons sealed; each because/therefore link is on-page. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Above the acid sea…”). No lens ambiguity; text teaches its accumulative pattern early and pays it off in the final image of clinking keys amid turning gears.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: cracked mirror → quay return → cave wrong-turn → oasis discovery → public vow. Each step tightens options until the spoken promise forecloses lifelong aloofness; tide’s future erasure of the shell supplies persistent constraint/cost. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt price—he exits “ready to paint arrivals,” stance flipped. Meets 9+ quick test cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tower’s tremor transmits the purified whisper, Jonas arrives ashamed, and the shared tending of the beam crystallizes a new linguistic contract with felt cost—silence replaces foghorn dominance. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: the cork’s filtration and scent-ritual tighten options until the final image reweights the rule-set. Orientation is swift—cobalt lighthouse at dawn within 30 words—and every beat advances because/therefore linkages or density accumulation without lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: hydraulics fail → navigator builds armillary → midnight calls refine map → aqueduct reunion. Closure is Earned Stasis: the narrator accepts the device is “a promise,” not a machine, foreclosing the old guiding role with visible cost—“the stars thin to dawn.” Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. One slight softness: the caller’s tower-bounce physics is asserted, not shown, but it does not resolve the climax, so cap not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: because Mara cannot lie, therefore the eye becomes tactical, therefore she can mislead the patrol and must hide the evidence. Closure is a Decisive Change—she buries the eye, trading personal safety for communal safety; cost is felt in the final sentence. Orientation is anchored by word 80 with “hanging orchard that clings to a ravine.” No teleporting props; the hollow casing is planted and the real eye buried in causal order.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the packet is anchored in the logbook, the name is spoken, and the cost is the clerk’s recognition that Eamon’s isolation is the price of guardianship—“witnessed isolation” lands as Charged Poise. Causal chain holds: because the boutonnière carries alpine cold, Eamon investigates gaps → finds canvas packet → letter demands utterance → clerk speaks → archive created. Orientation is clean within 60 words; no lens ambiguity at end. One hairline slip: “the rhythm of the pilings” is slightly abstract, but it does not obscure cause.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: chip coordinates → ridge → sinkhole → cavern → binary exit. Closure is a Decisive Change—she chooses the wet passage, erasing the trail back; cost is the forfeiture of Ellis’s offer and any future claim to the press. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the dream bleeds, therefore she climbs; because she climbs, she must choose inside the grotto. Closure is a Decisive Change—she cauterizes the star and forfeits the crown-prop—cost is legible in the cooled embers and the “plain night” that now frightens her. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening: the bleeding thread drops, forcing the final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: warning → refusal → shell-ritual → ground-level constellation that forecloses licensing. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—light returned as un-patentable protest—cost legible in “they cannot patent what you give back.” One transition (Academy watchers) is cleanly handled; orientation never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator’s decision to author rather than become rumor reweights the premise with conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of dream-returns and scroll-writing tightens stakes without causal chains—and the final line crystallizes the reconfiguration. One transition (waking→hike→nap) is legible; orientation is anchored by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain intact: broken screw → fear of blame → Iris decodes subtext → delivers repair → father’s gratitude re-stitches the household. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the drop of the water clock reweights her empty sense into “still unveil miracles.” Orientation anchored by 80 words; no lens drift. Cost legible in final line—“never enough to boast.”

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fourth circle gives the storm a sanctioned mouth, turning threat into sustained note; shame is shed on-page as crystalline ink softens under pulse. Causal lens holds—because she adds the childhood forbidden circle, therefore the platform steadies and her scars become legible. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“floating rock tea ceremony platform”). No lens ambiguity; cost is the visible dark line that will not fracture, persistent constraint for future pilots.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked bottle / leaking scent reweights “imperfect miracle” with felt cost; apology is delivered, orchard fate still doomed, archive lights dead. Causal lens holds: because Marin mocked June, because she rigs copper loop, therefore fuse pops, forgiveness arrives as warm breath. Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props. Persistent constraint—perfume gone, archive power lost—shapes final image.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure is present: the mirrors dissolve, dictionary stabilizes, narrator exits with duty—an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost. Yet causality is lyric-associative, not because/therefore; the hiccup, spiral, and temple are asserted, not linked. Orientation is deliberately dreamlike but never grounds who/where in under 120 words; the waiver is not earned because the payoff remains abstract. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the final cadence shift is audible, but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: leaving the mantle clock wrong reweights the entire premise—accuracy is chosen, not absolute. Causal chain holds: ice → lag → probe → late sighting → sabotage → shared quiet, each step tightening options with felt institutional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the red line becomes a “promise to measure what matters and release the rest,” reweighting loyalty with social cost. Causal chain holds—ghost auditors → spore leak → Lena’s data dump—each step because/therefore. Orientation locked by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the exhibit titled “Lucid Contradictions” crystallizes her stance—she will teach odds and cost together, foreclosing the path of pure prediction. Causal chain holds: because she follows each call number and seat clue, she accumulates the evidence that lets her reframe his legacy. The “DO NOT CONFUSE EDGE WITH ESCAPE” constraint persists and shapes the final exhibit decision, so cost is visible. Lens is cleanly causal; no orientation debt; no plot amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    The accumulative pattern—each wrong-number call thickens Mara’s self-deception—is taught by line 5 and tightens into the decisive reversal when she dials Lena. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tunnel, the disc, and the hum above reconfigure her estrangement from refuge to bridge, with the cost of exposure audible in the “gentle note” she still needs as armor. Causality is clean: every beat (answering, coaching the woman, breaking protocol) flows from the premise that anonymity is safety. No orientation debt; spatial anchors arrive by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s insertion of the receipt-sized list of “everyday losses” reweights the entire covenant, making the town’s accountability hinge on tangible, ordinary grief. Causal chain holds—locket discovery → preface rewrite → public confrontation → new oath—with each because/therefore link tightening options. The moment she tears out the old “accident” page and lets the wind take it is the visible cost that locks the lens. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchors land within the first 100 words and the twilight jetty stays spatially coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rock cools only after the narrator accepts company, reconfiguring the station into a “self-appointed timetable of mutual debts.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—each small kindness raises the rock’s temperature until the pattern crystallizes—and the final image of the suitcase-note carries undeniable conceptual cost: the cure must be passed on. Causality holds; no late rule changes. The Orientation Test is waived: initial disorientation (who, when) is taught early and pays off when the platform becomes legible through reciprocal action.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory shard layers density until the pool silence cancels the ultrasonic choir, reweighting the stake from escape to acceptance. Causality holds: every bark-hand or ring-tug causally feeds the inner map. Closure is on-page—ring clicks still, sentence “you can miss him and still live” is the Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. Orientation is taught early by scent/breath anchors; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ledger’s soft click reweights the past as draft, the nib’s unbending pays the price of relinquished certainty, and the new wet-looking line is the visible cost. Causal lens holds throughout—every edit is a because/therefore ripple from the garden mistake. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“station that hung inside the gravitational anomaly”). No plot amnesia; the courier node is retro-causal, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the empty camera set on the rail becomes both offering and metronome, proving silence can be shared music—cost is the surrender of the last object that “belonged” to the narrator. Accumulative lens holds: each signed pause thickens the harbor’s unsounded texture until the accordion chord crystallizes it. Orientation is swift—moonlit harbor, hour of erasure, filmless camera—within 60 words. No causal break; every beat (failed foghorn, notebook snap, camera relinquished) deepens pattern rather than triggers plot.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each artwork points → next clue → spiral alignment → drawer opens → reel copied → tower broadcast, every step shrinking her options. Closure is a Decisive Change with undeniable social cost: she forfeits anonymity forever. Orientation is locked in the first 40 words (who=Sera, where=ash flats, when=after arsons). No teleporting props; the tapestry fragment is the literal key that slots into the tar-slashed tower image, paying off the winter-roof promise.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: each drum strike tightens neural entanglement → Sato’s grief surfaces → institute alarms → they cut the feed → narrator walks out with data yet chooses nightly return, a decisive change that forecloses innocence. Closure image (solo perch, breathing the dream) carries felt cost: eternal vigil instead of resurrection. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is ironclad: storm → radios dead → Len’s challenge → conduit test → crane brake slips → conduit redeployed to save worker → reroute signed. Each beat tightens the vice: failure costs Mara her job and maybe a life. Closure lands as Decisive Change plus lingering cost—she keeps the job but loses monopoly on her secret, a price shown in the final hush and coin pocketed. Orientation, lens, and escalation hold without wobble; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the patrol boat’s arrival is the Decisive Change, but the emotional cost is the mirror-star now fixed in her eye—she can never unread the face. Causality holds: each shutter adjustment tightens the lattice that summons the watchman, so her confession is the only remaining path. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“cobalt dock”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. Lens is Causal throughout; no teleporting props or retro patches.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mayor’s delay motion and the town-wide green canopy reweight the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens—no single causal blow, but density and cadence shift force a new stance. Cost is legible in Eli’s exhausted vigil and the students’ dawn walk home. Causality holds: each window flip traces back to magnet clicks and Eli’s notebook. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: scrimshaw → unlocks Rusk’s guarded heart → permission to free island → protagonist frees self. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost: the dock apron left as flag, the body stepping into green to “let the sea claim my truest shape.” Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“our docks”), stakes by word 50. No plot amnesia; every chain link is accounted for.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bouquet wedged beside the cedar bird, petals “riding upward into the blade wash” reweights the premise—lightness is not happiness but motion of grief—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the irrevocable scattering of the last physical shard of Lena, paid on the page. Orientation is clean within 60 words; causality holds through the goat-kick spill that crystallizes the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the frame dissolves, brother-shadow and Lira merge into air, reconfiguring the sacred boundary with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—each paraphrase loosens quartz letters, mist responds, Soren’s hand fails—so the lens is Causal. Orientation is clean within 50 words; no teleporting props or retro-patches. The single beat of stepping into the circle and speaking three versions tightens options until the final image forecloses return.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each plant arrangement and traded awakening thickens pattern until the spiral courtyard reconfigures Joren’s greed into attentive stillness; the closing note vibrates glass and meaning with visible cost to both. Causality is lyric rather than plot-heavy, but the final image reweights all prior trades and lands as Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each refracted fragment layers civic distrust until the final chorus forces officials to answer aloud—an undeniable before/after. The soot lens is introduced, taught, and paid off as the tool that turns polished narrative into gritty echo, landing a Conceptual Repricing with visible social cost. Causality is clean: because they expose the raw archive, the pilgrimage becomes conversation, not product. No orientation drift; velvet baffles and copper throats anchor us by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the line “bloom was a craft” reweights every prior pendant-coffin into a forward-facing tool; the cost is the irreversible absence of the husband, still ash in the jar. Causality holds: because Mara releases the first bird, therefore Lysa arrives, therefore Mara re-aims the telescope-curtains, therefore the city starts climbing. One tight accumulative deepening—each new visitor adds a beat rather than a reversal—keeps the lens coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final map reweights the city’s “cultural heartbeat” and the narrator accepts a lifelong obligation—cost is legible in the promise to “come back whenever the city changes shape.” Causal chain holds: grandmother’s encoded tape → Aurel’s confession → night walk measuring three stories → map that reframes crisis as pattern. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (loft, skylight, post-crash hush). One minor elasticity: the off-stage “riot” and “water-truck queues” are told, not shown, but they feed the conceptual reprice rather than resolve plot, so causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the formula she steals reweights the city’s entire epistemic rule-set, and the cost is legible in the single line "I let the archive take the tears." Accumulative/textural lens holds—each irregular rotation thickens the light corridors until meaning, not plot, pivots. Pattern is taught early ("purification failed if done in a pattern") and pays off in the spiral curriculum, satisfying the taught-pattern clause.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the unbound shadow is given weight, reversing the premise that shared dreams must shed regret. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens—each petal-screen replay thickens the shadow until it can choose. The river stone’s transfer is the on-page sentence where cost becomes flesh: “the shadow accepted the stone like a heart accepting a pulse.” No orientation or lens ambiguity past 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens: each beat (discovery → chalk lists → call → sanctuary hand-off) tightens options because Mara’s self-respect forbids covering the fraud. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she files the report, keeps the animals, pins the tail—permanent social cost legible in the final image. No teleporting props; the shed tail’s return is set up and paid off. Orientation anchored by word 80; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the scar becomes text, the miracle returned, cost paid in reopened flesh and permanent mark. Causal chain (ivy memory → tunnel → pour light → wound legible) holds without gaps; each flip of the hourglass tightens stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no debt. One shard, single POV, within scope; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the empty rectangle of light becomes an envelope that re-weights all prior blankness as a vessel for love. Accumulative lens holds—each handled object (ticket stubs, rewound leader) thickens the pattern until the final cadence shift lands with felt cost: “the lyrics in her head finally rested.” Causality is lyric but coherent: because she projects nothing and speaks her letters into it, therefore the unfinished ritual completes and forecloses her private loop. Minor slip: orientation anchor “up in its vintage movie palace projection booth” arrives late (word 26), but the lyrical disorientation serves the final image, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the spiral traced on birch becomes the key that rewrites the city’s calendar; cost is the bodily chill and the elders’ cracked astonishment. Causality holds—each meteor angle mechanically unlocks the vault—though the “rest until breath matches sky” beat is more lyric than causal. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the cadence shift from hush to silver swarm reweights the stake; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist holds midnight open, paying with eternal partiality across histories—cost is legible in “constant care, like keeping a coal alive in a tin.” Accumulative/Textural lens taught early via iterative “occasionally everywhere” refrains and held to final image. Orientation anchored by mile-marker Zero within 120 words; no causality breaks. One clean transition into ledger-dune walk; auditors’ arrival supplies the single tightening beat required.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the crank accepts the flawed gear, the hum resolves to invitation, and the belief “I was only what others could verify” is foreclosed with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each wind chord thickens pattern until the final cadence reweights the stake. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation that pays off inside the root-cathedral. One hairline slip—no tangible consequence is dramatized after the crank stops—keeps it sub-9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: shoreline lullaby, star punches, and swallowed footprints accrete until the final loosened leash reweights the stake. Orientation is swift—shingle, fog, tide line by line 4. The vigil beat deepens pattern rather than tightens causal chain, but the final image of the lighter, star-perforated fare delivers Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. One minor scaffold: “keeps breathing…keeps humming…keeps singing” creates template cadence, yet it never touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: the missing bolt → secret stair → surveillance truth → decision to speak. Each because/therefore linkage narrows options and ends with the protagonist choosing a new, perilous quiet. Closure lands on-page: the whispered note triggers REMAIN, yet the tightened bench and hidden patient reconfigure safety at visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is immaculate: pellet → rune → drift → sealed chamber → sundered star → scroll → ledger copy → public unmasking. Closure is a decisive change with visible cost—the library collapses as he writes, the pellet is consumed, and the drift rune expires—so the price is on-page. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“ancient temple library”), well under the 120-word threshold. Lens holds causal throughout; no late convenience breaks the linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s taped palimpsest and adopted tap code crystallize a new ethic of guided restraint. Causal chain holds: because the reef was scarred, the route is hidden; because Mara learns tapping, she can transmit the hidden schedule. Orientation is anchored by word 40; no debt. Lens is causal throughout; no ambiguity at end. Cost is legible in the final image—“drifting moored, holding measurements and secrets.”

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the console’s answering pulse and printed “keep” reconfigure the rebellion’s silence into coordinated motion; Ilya’s barefoot stillness on the humming circle makes the cost bodily and immediate. Causality holds—every beat from hum-mapping to transmission grows from prior tactile discovery. The Orientation Test is waived: early disorientation (dead docks, oily gusts) pays off when the circle’s hum anchors spatial and temporal logic at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the embryo becomes a salamander gardener, rewriting destiny as chosen service. Causal chain—kite script → decoded heat-silence steps → salamander imprint—lands with Nara’s visible price: she surrenders omniscience for uncertain co-creation. Drive lens is Causal; every beat tightens options. Orientation anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mina chooses public endurance—stakes, windbreaks, labeled dates—accepting erosion as the price of growth. Causal chain holds: drone trigger → freeze → apology → decision to stay → burial of photo; each step forecloses retreat. The lens-light “pearl” image crystallizes the new stance with visible cost. No orientation or continuity errors; even the hobby-drone coincidence complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the lighthouse steadies, the portrait accepts fracture, and the Tower card’s prophecy is paid. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each untangled filament tightens the stake—though the sister’s rescue is reported only through the painted eyes, a slight off-stage dip.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: eclipse → raid → map → ink portal → obelisk → sabotage → return with data. Each because/therefore link is legible, the disappearing-ink rule is taught early and paid off at the climax, and the final note (“Time slows because someone profits…”) crystallizes the conceptual cost. Closure is a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the camp’s reality is restored, but Keir’s epistemic weapon (ink) is gone and the Council’s motive is exposed. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: warm letter → scan → network wake → Council confrontation → transparency order, each step because/therefore. Closure is Decisive Change with felt cost: consoles forcibly reconnected, archivist named publicly, career path foreclosed. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“echoing library under snow”). No plot amnesia; thaw log paired with letter pays off in Mara’s route exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Tarek’s rifle stays sleeved, militia withdraw, continuity is planted—cost is the bounty foregone and the father’s redefined identity, both legible on-page. Causal chain holds: because Maris engineered roses & talisman, therefore Tarek’s stance shifts; militia retreat follows that visible change. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“After the tower falls…glass dome over Maris’s rose farm”). No lens ambiguity; pattern is causal-turned-earned-stasis. Meets 9- gate except a hairline slack in militia’s off-stage compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the rail spike’s plunge seals both echo and warning, reweighting the garden’s rule-set while costing Rovan his tool and his lullaby. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each zig-zag and voiced silence thickens density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One minor slack: the elders’ prophecy is told, not tested, but it doesn’t resolve the conflict, so the beat survives.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: tremor in Lyle’s voice → Celeste’s trip → plate-dust contradiction → Sato’s confession → Celeste’s quiet bargain. Closure is a Decisive Change: she trades headline glory for institutional survival, the cost legible in the scratched logbook that now binds her to complicity and protection.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: guilt → letters → amber → lab → tether → translated cry → apology → muted guilt. The fold-time rule is taught early via the insect “suspended as if time had folded,” so the final retrieval feels inevitable, not contrived. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cry softens into meteor hush and the tether slackens—cost is the cooled amber and the new constellation scar. One minor slip: the wardrobe’s false drawer appears once and never constrains later action, a teleporting prop, but it does not break the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hush reweights the city’s erasure project into shared, fragile co-creation. Causal chain holds—tile flake teaches echo → proverb fragments → mandala reframes → teacher relief → boy’s smudge seals new stance. Orientation anchored by word 80 (“whispering grotto”). One transition (outside/inside) is legible; pattern of acoustic manipulation is taught early and paid off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each beat because/therefore—tessera pried free therefore names are spoken therefore Grasp is buckled. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Samir… walked there at dawn”). Closure is a Decisive Change: the plaza is renamed on-page, survivors become Keepers, cousin is alive and shackled to bread; cost is the perpetual retrocognitive trap Samir accepts. No teleporting props; the tessera’s travel from minaret to groove is tracked. One transition (dawn → evening) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the coin pressed to wood, the single merged applause, and the garden locking into one era reconfigure both timelines with undeniable conceptual cost—Mara now inherits a future she can rent. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: the echo-game (because) tightens the fracture until her father’s name (therefore) stitches it; no off-stage cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the final line “they had learned to listen for paths” crystallizes options without forcing belief, cost felt in the withheld negatives and recall threats. Causal chain holds—pill recall → somatic map → violet protocol → tunnel rescue → public exhibit—each beat narrows agency. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Harbor Street”) and never breaks. One hairline slip: the recall company’s legal leverage is asserted, not shown, so the external stakes momentarily thin.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the cave’s emotional archive is redefined as inter-species, not human, and Mina forfeits her transitional object to certify that shift. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each heat-flare layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is intact: tide surge → sealed exit → fossil guidance → relinquishment. Cost is legible in the last line—she sings the cave its own name, now voiceless herself.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of listening→collecting→shared testimony tightens the stake until the jar’s final release reweights power. Closure is a Charged Poise—options reconfigured, cost legible in the foreman’s defeat and the workers’ collective breath. Orientation anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. One minor scaffold: “as the truth unravels” is repeated phrasing, but it does not touch the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: betrayal → exile → return → repair → warning sent. Snow-code is taught early and pays off when Tomas reads it; the radio repair is the decisive change that reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity at closure. Cost is legible in the stinging salt and the pillbox left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: rain ticking → ferry blocked → vellum decoded → confession → Mara released. The palimpsest is both MacGuffin and ticking clock; its erased layers physically guide the needle, so every scraped word tightens options. Closure lands as Decisive Change: Mara steps alive onto the far bank, the document is reduced to three plain verbs, and Rowan’s anger is re-weighted into something portable. Cost is legible in the final image—needle pressed into Senn’s palm, silence arriving like a toll paid.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the oasis selects one timeline because of how they met it with care, and the crumbling combs give visible cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early by the overlapping footprints and holds to the final chimney note. One transition (dusk → night) is clean; orientation is anchored by lantern and spring within 120 words. No late rule changes; the thrum’s final single note reweights all prior fractures.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: last petal → exposed garden → Jonas’s plea → moonlit lock test → smugglers stopped; each beat tightens options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—mirrors now turn the fire escape into a vertical lantern—cost is the rose’s death and her permanent watch; lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the warning that “any plan that depends on perfect memory will crack” reweights the premise and is paid for by the narrator’s deliberate introduction of error. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—tide cycles, hum patterns, and wrinkled pages tighten until meaning is re-scaled. Causality is intact: each vapor surge erodes certainty, forcing the final tactic of imperfect inscription. Cost is legible in the final image of willingly warped paper.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the anonymous letter read aloud reweights every prior ribbon and forecloses the narrator’s refuge in borrowed words. Causal chain holds: withheld letter → blank spiral drawing → public confession → ribbon through nest → taking Arin’s hand. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of confessions tightens until the personal one ruptures the pattern. Cost is on-page—“the ribbon caught the evening wind”—and undeniably shared.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (beacon shift → false map → hesitation → surrender) chains by because/therefore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the subsonic shield stays live, the town must now speak, and Mara’s forfeiture is felt. Orientation is anchored by word 50; no disorientation serves the ending. Cost is on-page: “she forfeits sole authorship” and accepts the town’s voice may betray her.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: driving the compass point into the seam permanently rewrites the nexus’s spatial rule-set and frees the mentor, cost paid in the widening night that now “keeps the stars from touching the earth.” Causal linkage holds—each organ note triggers a floor slide, the compass rotates to force exits, and the final spin of the lock is contingent on the protagonist’s quiet refusal. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation that pays off when shelves realign with breathing. No teleporting props or retroactive patches; the snapped-off blueprint point is the same tool that drafts the new path.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: ribbon → sketch → quarry visit → confrontation → confession, each step narrowing options. Closure is a Decisive Change: Maren’s admission rewrites town memory and the narrator’s offer forecloses silence with public grief. Cost is legible—“shoulders sag” and the impending civic mural—under a single Causal lens. One causality bump: the courthouse trash timing and shredder identity are elided, a convenience that keeps evidence from police but not from artist, slightly softening motive force.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is airtight: shifted jet stream → exposed journals → decoded stanzas → cemetery coffin → copper key → annex reveal → archival correction, each because/therefore link tightening options. Closure lands as a Decisive Change: the maritime registry can now be amended, reversing Elias’s exile with on-page conceptual cost—the Archive’s authority is openly challenged. Orientation is clean inside 120 words; the blank square on the antique chart anchors time, place, and motive. No lens ambiguity; the final image of “clean lines across a sky that… had room for Elias Kline’s name” reweights memory itself.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mosaic pattern (four shards) is taught by the 25% mark and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pixelated self-portrait reweights identity from legal name to mutable tune. Causal chain holds—flake→numbers→scaffold→camera→self-exposure—each step foreclosing the last. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the fiddler accepts becoming “only a tune” to escape the fire-ash identity. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the chalk trail that “refused to curl” reweights every prior loop and bill-map, with the cost of company collapse and exile from the train. Causal chain holds—because the algorithm learned conquerors’ returns, therefore the narrator re-marks territory—without late rule changes. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“abandoned circus train”), waiving any penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the decoded rite reframes the temple from treasure to grief-vault, and the cost is the chronicler’s permanent obligation to return and witness. Causal chain holds—telegram → star-timing dream → shared rite—each because/therefore link narrows options until the final cooled exhale. No teleporting props; the daylily telegram reappears beside the charts to cue the dream.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is immaculate: failed trick → seed passed → descent → unbend mirror by reversing drawn circles → twin freed → plant neutralized → curse lifts. Each beat is both physical operation and moral reckoning; the “expanding circles” mechanic taught early pays off in the reversal that straightens the scowling glass. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost: the lake flattens, the orchard stills, and Thalen’s calm now carries the weight of every returned loss. No orientation drift; even the vortex geography is tracked by the reed staff and anchor knot.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: clipping → access, wound → key, blood → seal; the eclipsed covenant’s crack and repair create a decisive change with visible cost (her reopened scar, his flaring scars). One micro-turn inside the vision-maze is sufficient; orientation is anchored by word 80 and the lens stays causal to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Earned Stasis: Mira’s refusal to harvest a stranger’s destiny locks her into perpetual pain yet safeguards Jory, a cost legible in the last line. Causal chain holds—because the knot was slipping, therefore she offers her forgetting, therefore the thread grafts to her wrist. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3) and the single-scene default is met. The ash falling “like dark pollen” supplies the charged image that reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: televised humiliation → flight → quarry inventory → grille cloth → memory → report → shared solace. The trailer window looking “down into the scar of stone” anchors orientation inside 120 words and later reappears as the literal throat that holds their voices. Closure is Earned Stasis: he doesn’t get applause back; he gives the cloth’s story away and accepts the quieter wage of usefulness. Cost is on-page—"I did not hide behind jargon"—and the constraint (no more public acclaim) persists.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the seed planted, the arc observed, the option to possess relinquished. Causal chain (sister’s death → need to measure → seed circuit → calibrated release) holds without gaps. Orientation is swift: magnetic arbor, post-departure moment, cuneiform translator—all inside 60 words. One minor scaffold: “he reestablishes the observatory’s purpose by writing…” tells the renunciation we already see.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank bookmark accepted and the creel carried into the tide reconfigure identity without forcing epiphany; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the moonlit pattern of names and contradictions tightens into the final image with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the pearl’s public crowning re-weights the bunker from exclusion to confession-site. Causal chain—pearl drinks regret → Mara re-uses it as beacon—holds. Cost is felt in the widower’s exposed shame and the shelter’s permanent unsealing. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: skipped inspection → brother’s death → three-week withdrawal → graffiti clue → photographing latch → sending report. The tunnel discovery and grid match supply the decisive tightening; the emailed photo delivers the Decisive Change with undeniable social cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Closure beat—“the truth feels less like punishment and more like shelter”—crystallizes the before/after with felt cost, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the second letter is emptied of verdict because he has rewritten the stakes himself. Causal chain—watch reversals → cipher → library → apology—tightens once and lands. Cost is legible in the glowing mist on the window: the library’s price is perpetual exposure of the once-silent voice. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: pollen spill → telepathy → fig warning → coffee omen → vent map → theft → blank report. Closure is a Decisive Change: the violin vanishes, empire’s myth is sabotaged, Sorell’s sacrifice visible. Cost is on-page: “signed it before the promise loses its glow” plus soldiers entering dome. Orientation crisp by line 6; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the emerald’s spark relocates from corpse to aurora, reweighting the rule that beauty must be kept. Causal linkage holds throughout: because the dead looked “lucidly watchful,” therefore she climbs; because she infuses the chip, therefore the corridor appears and the spark migrates. The Orientation Test is waived—initial disorientation (“skyborne grotto hung beneath the aurora”) pays off when the same aurora receives the final gift. Persistent constraint: the chip can “not grant return,” a limit that shapes every infusion stroke and the ultimate renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hairpin buried in loam reweights forgiveness into shared duty; the lens is Accumulative/Textural—each image (pruning, dripping pool, scalloped stone) tightens the stake until the final flash of spring shows rebirth is work, not miracle. Causality remains coherent; no orientation debt; cost is legible in the assign-work beat.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cloak’s transfer to Mara reweights the premise—doubt becomes portable property, not commodity. Causal chain holds: because she accepts the chime warning, therefore she dons the cloak, therefore Sile’s tower must bend. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“lighthouse at dawn”) and never breaks. One tightening beat—the mirror showing her eyeless face—pays off in the final ash-strewn image where the shard is abandoned, its hollow reflection now shared cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the narrator inherits the attention-shift power and the cost of carrying a truth that can’t be spoken. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of ripples, magnetic filings, and vanishing builds until the final reconfiguration. Causality holds: each stone throw teaches the pattern that enables the final disappearance. The notebook left in place of the mentor’s body is a charged object that reweights the premise with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Oren does not move, yet the canyon returns a singable route, reconfiguring navigation itself. The arrowhead’s alignment and the flock-split syncopation are the visible cost/constraint that shape the final tactic. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of dust-memories and overtone layers tighten until the dawn fade reweights stakes. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“In the canyon…”) and the bone tower crown by midpoint; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the keystone’s unmeasurable glow persists while the automaton stalls, reweighting the premise that only quantified magic matters. Causal chain holds—because he strips gear and trusts mist walking, he reaches the terrace; because he chooses a child-simple pattern, the luminance answers. Cost is visible: he forfeits the keystone and any guild recognition. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final image’s cadence shift deepens the dominant stake without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the glowing vow card reweights the premise—honesty becomes receptor, not armor—while the fading lantern-sparks overhead charge the image with undeniable opportunity cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each luminous object (tag, registry, vow) tightens the pattern until the final violet bell-bloom. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“late-shift pier lamplighter”), well inside the 120-word window. No lens ambiguity; the drive holds from first match to last spark.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean: prophecy → coin pattern → split dish → fuel burn → signal loop. Orientation is immediate—who/where/when locked in the first 60 words—and the experimental backwards-prophecy rule is taught early and paid off in the final tremor. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the edgewise coin lands blank, proving the prophecy was never certainty but the permission to act anyway; the cost is the station’s last energy, felt in the deck tremble. No teleporting props or retro-patching; every beat obeys the taught temporal inversion.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the unnamed lover’s sob-crystal tucked under the blank ocean reconfigures the atlas from terror to mercy, and the cost is the reaper’s permanent exile from his own goodbye. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each crystallized phrase adds density until the final blank space becomes unbearably legible. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“dome still smelled of cold brass”) and never wavers. No causality break; every mirror adjustment and naming act is a because/therefore linkage under scattered light.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the viaduct brightens, sea tilts, distant bell answers—cost is the audible exposure of his fragile belief. Causal chain holds: cracked chart → bell → drip timing → answered ring. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no teleporting props. One minor loop: “devotion can bend without breaking if it keeps time” restates prior image, but does not obscure the final re-weighting.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is airtight: silent chime → exposed street → label → photograph trail → recovered memory → public reckoning; each beat tightens options. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the town’s “audit” can no longer be dammed by paperwork, and Mara forfeits her inherited authority. The lens stays causal throughout; no information appears without prior trigger or later consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pale ingot rings, starlings bless it, and Liora’s smile reconfigures her stance—logic now married to intuition—at undeniable conceptual cost to her guild identity. Causal linkage holds: because she watches the birds, therefore she grasps the ratio; because she accepts the memory, therefore the metal brightens. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“valley where the air always tasted newly washed”). No lens ambiguity; the final image crystallizes options without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: borrowed voice → tactile memory test → trap coordinates → real Nine appears → public revision restores trust; closure lands with the buckle’s click as both badge and price, lens held, cost visible.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the new charter rewrites legal identity into mutual custody, felt cost etched in the narrator’s cracked emotional drum. Causal chain holds—because he vivifies opposites, the jarred brain is not transplanted yet the clone breathes, therefore the factions must accept co-guardianship. Orientation is taught early via drifting constellations and gravity-ropes, waived at payoff. One minor loop: “custody battle” is named twice in adjacent clauses, but it never touches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain is clean: seed arrival → investigation → trap room → seed slowed → contract refused, each beat a because/therefore. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses market co-option at the price of future scrutiny. Orientation lands by line 5; no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold—two “because I…” clauses back-to-back—barely dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dried-leaf laugh in the apartment reweights the premise, cost felt in Bram’s silent vigil beside the steaming bag. Causal chain holds—because musician’s lore + tunnel trial → pulp → morning laugh—without gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“echo chamber tunnel under River Street”). One transition (tunnel → apartment) is clean and necessary. No lens ambiguity; causal logic drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the pendant’s dulling and the catalog tag “RETURNABLE THROUGH SLEEP” reweight the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens—uncertainty is now a circulating loan, not a breach. Causality holds; every beat of mist thickening or pendant warming is tethered to the guardian’s escalating sniff and the final joint refusal. Orientation is taught by sentence 3, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: broken crozier → clandestine re-smithing → charter seals burned → new tool and collapsed furnace signal irreversible change. Orientation is anchored by word 60; the single-scene arc tightens once through the hammer blows that literally sever Jun’s ledger seals, a visible Decisive Change with cost (the furnace vitrifies, foreclosing reuse). The lens holds without ambiguity; only a whisper of outline-like sequencing in the middle beats keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is clean: hush-shard → damped noise → new pulse → dismantle mast → lighter city. Orientation lands by line 4; no teleporting props. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—the surrendered mast and the torn-out page—so the lens holds. One hairline slip: “the sky lied” is asserted, not dramatized, but it doesn’t break the linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the two ferries touch, commuters breathe, and a persistent constraint—the seam now held by ongoing pattern-work—remains legible. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens: the sideways clocks and empty hourglass set up the rule, the radio code executes it, and the nod between Linas reconfigures meaning with felt cost (they must keep working the seam). No teleporting props or retro-patches; the hourglass’s weight and the grotto’s shimmer are earned.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the erupted lattice reweights the premise—connection is tension, not story. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern density (angles, whispers, fever) tightens until the mirror refuses reflection, then the lattice flips into new geometry that maps everyone to everyone. Causality holds: each thread pull is a because/therefore linkage under the textural drive. The cost is legible in the final image—“no one spoke above a whisper”—a social hush that pays the architect’s forfeited control.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: probe lattice → edge geometry → surface test → curriculum rewrite, each step because/therefore. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: star-navigation becomes a civic responsibility, cost felt in “room again” grief. Orientation is clean by line 5; the single transition (descent) is anchored. The rewrite beat is summarized rather than dramatized, keeping the story just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is clean: photograph arrives → aid ticks → Mara traces call → interrupts Eli’s suicide → rewrites her childhood “STAY” into “STAY, PLEASE” → voice retreats. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the same object now arms Eli against future calls, cost felt in the aid’s steady human-beat replacing ghost-pulses. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—the aid’s cracked receiver—shapes every tactical move.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: tidal window → notch appears → coil phase transition → cable repair → log released. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the phase-transition rule is taught early and pays off at climax. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—Ken’s voice re-enters the world, Mara’s solitude is sealed. No teleporting props or causal amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the county ledger is corrected yet she chooses to keep Lyle’s annotated failures—cost is the irreversible knowledge that error cannot be erased, only owned. Causal chain holds: wrong digit → ghost → shard → ink pattern → file → self-recorded alive. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“opal observatory under snow”). One meaningful tightening: ink spiral becomes repair script that rewrites her death. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tunnel’s new composite voice reconfigures what survival of a language can mean, cost paid by Ilen’s blood-on-bone scrape and the diamond’s stillness. Accumulative lens holds throughout—each texture recorded layers harmonic density until the final spiral of swifts crystallizes the stakes. Pattern taught early (echo as archive) and never breaks causality. Orientation anchored within first 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Jonas reweights the Choir’s pull by offering bitterness-as-joke, gravity settles, cost is felt in the hush after the chord. Causal chain (arrowhead → grounded stitch, phone → conduit, Jonas’s speech → repricing) holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“town of Larkspur… underground garden”). Lens is Causal; every beat tightens options until the final reconfiguration. One hairline slip: the taped-antenna phone is introduced mid-stream yet becomes the decisive conduit—minor but prevents perfect 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: rumor → shell → heartbeat code → statues desync → tree uproots → city path re-opened; each beat tightens the next. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost: the walking tree drags its iron cradle, the stone guardians are “softened” but still follow—beauty is free yet forever escorted by the system it escaped. Orientation lands by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: missing mail → rooftop smugglers → storm bottle → drone flight → Mendery reply. Closure is a decisive change—he chooses border-crossing guardianship with the bottle empty and councils potentially branding him traitor; cost is felt. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“At twilight the cobalt arcade…”) and geography stays trackable. One minor causality fuzz: the drone border codes are accepted “before the last light died” without showing how Ivo evades post-flight scrutiny, but the lapse doesn’t puncture the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the train “stirs” and the halo ring flashes above the horse, reweighting silence from void to material. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each bell-chime, shard-hum, and wood-shaving thickens the pattern until the sung note releases it. The wrong-turn warning sets up the oasis reveal without breaking logic; cost is the lifelong muteness Rowan finally risks. Lens holds from first inhale to final shimmer.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the discovery that narrative space can be folded and shared reweights the premise and carries felt loneliness-cost (“her own loneliness had been a kind of closed system”). Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each measured angle and scented cue thickens pattern until the hyperbolic gap opens. The only drag is a mid-story block of reflective summary that slows momentum just before the pivotal reach-in beat.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the empty photograph reweights the entire premise—longing is answered by letting the dream walk out. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each sunrise layer tightens the pattern until the final image breaks it. Cost is legible in the last line—“luminous absence” she must now live inside—so the 9+ gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky-room turns, the comma-click opens the chest, and the new star-map is spoken aloud—an irreversible conceptual re-pricing with felt weight. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly causal, but the pattern is taught early (disorienting stairs, lantern without flame) and holds to the final image. Orientation is deliberately fluid yet always legible; the ravine’s topology pays off by mirroring the internal spiral. No teleporting props; the hair, ribbon, and star-reflections track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change: stolen pages restored, lens held (Accumulative/Textural—pattern of habits, stars, rings). Causality is tight: forgetting to count → theft; tasting mushroom → return; each step is a because/therefore linkage. Cost is visible—“decades of blankness folded back”—and the final image of her repainting constellations shows the constraint persists. No orientation or plot amnesia issues.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror-tea-glass alignment flips the tribunal’s balcony into a door that only opens when Mara’s lines stop shaking—an earned image that reweights exile from sentence to choice. Causal lens holds: every beat (shadow trapped, leaf geometry, tag falling) is a because/therefore linkage anchored to the shard-archive rules taught on page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: because the narrator sacrifices blue essence, therefore the doorway opens and Nela is healed; seed’s loss anchors permanent two-world tether with visible cost. Orientation is swift—waterfall parapet by line 3; closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the orchard’s brighter dawn reweights the premise that wonder must be tended, not merely witnessed. One soft spot: the “drawing fear” beat has no prior mechanical set-up, so it reads like miracle rather than translated pruning, but the ending still reconfigures stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: because each knot loosens a syllable, therefore the slab opens and the hush snaps into breath—an earned Decisive Change with the family vow’s rupture as visible cost. Orientation is swift (quartz staircase, midnight, hook-marked slab). Only the thinnest wobble: the “secret across sharing” device is introduced once and never re-used, leaving the vow’s exact wording slightly vaporous.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the torn margin becomes a visible archive, the shadow’s wandering ends, cost is legible in the rain’s “soft applause” and the chapel’s reopened vulnerability. Causal chain—map tear → video comparison → alcove discovery → reframing—holds without teleport. One transition (shop → moor) is cleanly handled. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no debt applied.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative lens holds: each artifact (plane reel, notebook, snow globe) layers the theme until the closing release. Orientation is swift—dive computer flicker anchors time, place, and POV within the first 100 words. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator lets the reel drift away, paying the conceptual price of surrender; the cost is legible in the final image of snowfall over the lighthouse.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final graffiti glyph reweights the city’s unseen social circuitry, cost legible in Lio’s laugh of acceptance. Causal chain holds—lightning → chip wakes → encode before thunder → glyph signed → readers below feel need spoken back. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“misty courtyard above clouds”). No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early (encode = routing, not resurrection) and paid off in last line.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: because she finds the goggles → deciphers the diary → halts the elevator → foils the lock-out plot. Closure is a Charged Poise: she stands on floor ten wearing the goggles, promotion declined, spire still aloft, new identity crystallized. The diary’s “If you are Lysa” line is a motivated ellipsis—the captain engineered the breadcrumb trail—and the cost (lost ease, gained agency) is legible in her calm stair-climb. Lens holds as Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the empty air “remembers,” reweighting the story’s physics of grief. The telescope-drop creates a causal corridor that turns memory into literal lift, paying off the spooled-wholeness premise. Orientation is swift—gondola, night, snapped tether—within 60 words. One micro-drag: the tower’s “stern prayer” is a soft external save, but the storm still veers only after Mara’s corridor is carved, so agency holds.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the painted sky stays, the real tree falls, the coin re-locks the safe—cost legible in “accepting the limit of time.” Causal chain (coin → safe → book → painted vault) holds without gaps. Lens is Causal: every beat narrows options because demolition is one minute closer. One hairline slip: the “five more minutes” request is granted too easily, softening the final pressure tick.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the Meridian turns toward the blank glare, starlings become living compass, and Lio’s isolation flips into collaborative discovery; cost is felt in the deliberate abandonment of “yesterday’s routes.” Causality holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens—each pattern he traces literally tightens the atlas-sails and swings the compass. Orientation is crisp within 120 words; only the hopscotch-board “door” reveal edges toward convenient coincidence, but it was seeded beneath the dog-ear, so the break is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library path narrows to one mirror and Mara exits with the new gear she herself cut, cost legible in the forfeiture of her tools. Causal chain holds: because she reads the prophecy → therefore she re-makes rather than takes → therefore the library releases her. Orientation is clean by line 6; no lens ambiguity. One tightening beat suffices at this length; escalation is present but modest, keeping it just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal spine—chalk messages → bell → relay rebuild → nebula window—holds cleanly, and the grave-pod recording supplies a decisive change that reweights Serren’s trustworthiness. Closure lands with conceptual cost: the living must keep chalk-and-bell vigil for future strays, a price stated on-page. One minor scaffold: “we understood then” compresses the emotional turn instead of letting us watch the shift beat-by-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Mara’s death converts her body into a “quiet correction,” the clock silenced yet the world merely dimmed—undeniable conceptual cost under an accumulative lens. Causality holds: each nested pattern of tick/tide/tune taught early pays off when the puppet’s cracked mouth opens and the pane transmits the lullaby. No orientation drift; lighthouse, dusk, and lone adjuster are anchored by line 3. One of the few 600-word pieces where lyric pattern and plot causality fuse without residue.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: blueprint memory → nut → waystone → birds confused → safe exit, each link visible on the page. Closure is a Decisive Change: the labyrinth now carries singable escape routes, the orchard’s curse faces outward forever. Cost is legible in the final line—“the path… will not”—a quiet but irreversible reconfiguration. Orientation is swift; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the new bridge stands, patent is open-licensed, and the chrysalis burial makes the cost undeniable. Causal chain (foam insight → reformulation → public admission → safer bridge) holds without gaps. Lens is Causal throughout; no orientation debt. One hairline slip: the corporation’s capitulation is compressed into a single sentence, slightly thinning the final constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the parole incision rewrites the teller into being, cost legible in the single new page and the address left behind. Causal chain—moonlight map → count gaps → cut doorway—holds without gaps; orientation anchors inside 120 words. One minor scaffold: “I counted… I counted…” loop dulls propulsion yet never touches the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Safi returns carrying the pavilion’s remorse, and the first soldier’s weep reconfigures the fortress’s emotional economy under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: because he ingests the stored shame, therefore the squad’s dreams blunt. Orientation anchors by line 4; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in the final image—“thin broth with dates and salt”—a persistent constraint that will flavor every future meal.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands: the elevator speaks, the town unites, the mayor concedes—an on-page Decisive Change with social cost (condos averted, silo walls breached). Causal chain holds: weight opens valve → voice → choir languages → farmers act → dawn repair. One minor causality bump: the storm-bell pattern is declared familiar to farmers but never seeded earlier. Otherwise the because/therefore linkage is clean and the final bolt tightened under starlight reconfigures stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror’s modified lattice lets Nira keep every dream yet assigns each a “clean angle of return,” reweighting her prior goal of erasure. Causal chain holds—because she rewires the node, therefore she inherits custodianship instead of amnesia. Orientation is swift: moonlit canyon, rim, wire, within 50 words. One minor scaffold: “She breathed in counts of five…” restates the prior sentence’s vibration tuning, but it does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: doodle → grotto → seeds → door → spoken combinations, each step a because/therefore. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—by voicing the codes he re-weights forgetting itself, paying the cost of exposure as the chamber collapses. One tight deepening, no causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each added wire tightens the grove’s silent chord until the porcelain moon image reweights the premise with felt cost—she leaves the insulator behind, foreclosing retrieval. Orientation is immediate; causality is lyric accumulation rather than because/therefore, and the final Charged Poise lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: council’s renunciation publicly returns the eclipse and reweights sky–city relations; Sable’s exile-stone on the board supplies visible cost. Causal chain holds: dust response → translated alphabet → public ritual. Single-scene orientation is taught by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is airtight: resonator pitch → clasp yields → diary intel → shell swap → crowd safety; each because/therefore linkage narrows options and carries rising cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the open clasp on the velvet mat reconfigures the silence between Lio and Mara with undeniable emotional debt. Orientation is secured by word 60 (“shadowed workshop under stars”) and the diary’s stakes are telegraphed immediately; no ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: scent trail → map → bloom watch → insight → conditional gift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—ambition settles into service with the spiral drawing as visible cost. One minor causality bump: the sulfur-honey clue is registered but never explicitly linked to the later clean-fern thread, requiring the reader to bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the arrow tip’s origin revealed as weapon-turned-graft reweights “resilience” from singular miracle to collective chorus. Causal lens holds: arrow warmth → canyon → stone tree → renunciation. Orientation anchored by word 40 (Pomona Drift, orchard terraces, gravity inversion schedule). No teleporting props; the shard’s travel is tracked throughout. Cost is felt—“she pried the broken arrow tip free… accepting that resilience was not hidden in one miracle source.”

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: patch → spiral → silence → sabotage the ring; the cylindrical container array as acoustic weapon is a satisfying conceptual reveal that reweights the mystery, and the cost—cut fingers, exposure to returning crew—lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber sheet darkens, the hush is re-sculpted into permission, and the decree’s fragility is the felt cost. Causal chain holds—each chisel strike tightens the silence, forcing Lio’s counter-music—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored within the first 120 words by ice, lantern, and Guild mission. No teleporting props or plot amnesia; the sheet’s final darkening is set up by its earlier glow.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the driftwood arrows still wait, the hush is reweighted from menace to answer, and the cost—she must carry the pilgrim’s lesson forever—is legible in the final image. Causal lens holds: because she refused the pilgrim, she returns; because she plays while listening, not commanding, the boundary re-opens and reconfigures her stance. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props; one taught shard transition into the frozen world. Persistent constraint—the flute’s danger—shapes every tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the blank broadside reweights empathy from gift to transformation, with the townspeople’s aligned sorrow as undeniable social cost. Accumulative lens holds—each printed sheet adds density until the final pattern break. Causality remains intact; no teleporting props or retro-patches. Orientation is taught early by star-thinning, waiving any penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Rook relinquishes ownership of the relic and writes the cairn question, a crystallized stance that reweights the entire delivery mission from transaction to seed-planting; the cost is the forfeiture of his Guild duty and the uncertain future this invites. Causality is accumulative-textural: each sympathetic vibration (lamplighter, mountain iron, children-to-come) layers density until the pattern breaks with the renunciation; no off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“ridgeway… dawn”) and stays stable; the brief Nera vision is taught as mythic overlay rather than rupture. Lens holds from first beat to final image without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mirror’s stored failure re-weights the narrator’s assumption that loss was solely his, with the cost of lifelong omission to his parents. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each frost-reading beat thickens emotional density until the prism re-casts the same light across the bedroom ceiling, crystallizing the new stance. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening—anger’s named refusal cracks the hush—suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: each added thread thickens silence until the border closes and voice is traded. Closure is a Charged Poise—Yara’s mute breath and Jun’s reading fingers—cost legible in the same instant the panel vanishes. Causality is intact: puzzle edges → map → path → voice lost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: falling arches → silk bargain → memory-for-knowledge trades → forge anchors → arch steadied → silk buried. Each beat tightens options under a visible price; closure lands as Earned Stasis—Lio forecloses further barter, empty-eyed yet unbowed—cost legible in the buried silk and hollowed memory.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each seam-jump is motivated by the need to correct the lie, narrowing options until the log amendment locks the truth in place. Orientation is swift—cold deckplates, Dock Seven, green shard—within the first 60 words. Closure is a decisive change: the truth’s weight shifts from private rib-crushing burden to shared public record, cost legible in Jalen’s freed yet scarred presence and the narrator’s loss of cycle-control.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lamp’s sighing return reconfigures the stakes—anonymous guardianship replaces overt heroism—and the cost (bleeding fingers, lifelong anonymity) is legible in the final image. Causal lens holds throughout: because the lamp fails, therefore Noah listens, therefore he inherits the letter chain, therefore he writes and rebuilds the beacon’s moral filament. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (skiff, Brinecap Light, October dusk). No plot amnesia or teleporting props; the sea glass and cairn system track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the green beam re-codes yesterday’s news into tomorrow’s warning, cost paid by the narrator’s raw throat and the mayor’s caution. Causal chain holds: joke → prophecy → flood → shadow-signal → empty streets. One soft spot: the mayor’s order happens off-stage, slightly diluting the because/therefore lens. Meets 9− gate with visible constraint left in the glass.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist’s stance flips from hoarding stories to releasing them, cost felt in the illuminated mist-images that vanish. Causal chain—wing → map → sun-mirror → dye → vow—holds without gaps; each step narrows options. Orientation is secure by line 5; the floating rock’s physics is left tacit but never asked to solve the plot, so no waiver breach.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the re-built outward-leading labyrinth reweights the entire municipal premise. Causal chain holds—each bolt he loosens is a because/therefore step toward that reconfiguration—and the cost (his unreported transgression, the sextant’s ongoing hunger for his own grief) is visible in the final smile. Lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seam of communal dawn opens with undeniable conceptual cost—Lysa’s partial self-loss is visible in the same image that saves the realm. Causal chain holds: because she weaves communal cloth, the night tightens, infants are wrapped, memory returns, dawn spills. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“Lysa walked toward…”) and the mica window beats teach the mirror-pattern early. No lens ambiguity; the accumulative/textural drive holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the Archivist’s invitation to Lysa reweights the “mistake” into initiation, and Marin’s note—"every mistake is a map, if you read with mercy"—crystallizes the new equilibrium with visible conceptual cost (he forfeits absolute solitude). Causality under the Accumulative lens holds: the mis-addressed invitation accumulates meaning until the seam of the torn halves literally reconfigures status. Orientation is anchored within fifty words and the single transition (museum → library) is legible; no lens ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sprout in frozen mortar reweights all prior erasures with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—invitation → courtyard → confession → planting—each step narrowing options. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end. Persistent constraint (vanished bakery, bricked door) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each new sensory layer (cold, trembling light, emergent script) tightens the single stake—keep the vow alive—until Ilian’s own breath becomes the archival medium. The closure is a Charged Poise: the script steadies, the drawer slams, and the cost is the irreversible transfer of his own sincerity into glass. Causality is lyric but coherent; no beat repeats without deepening density. Orientation is taught by the ringing windows within 50 words, waiving any penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: each failed wax drop tightens risk → forces new tactic → accumulates to the tin-cup sabotage that kills the bargain. Closure is a Decisive Change: sheriff’s trust shatters, father’s routes saved, Mara stranded under pier with blood-price legible. Cost felt in “tide rinse blood from the boards.” Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the converged dome and grandmother-laugh in sleet-mist reweight the premise under an Accumulative lens—density, not cause, drives meaning. Anchors (who/where/when) appear by word 70; no orientation penalty. One causal gap: why Bureau-raised skeptic expects safe reception is elided, but the final image bears undeniable conceptual cost (glow now yoked to collective risk), satisfying the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal mural reweights every prior sketch from commodity to song. Causal chain holds—numbers → lock failure → canvas wedge → pigment → living glow—each because/therefore narrows options and extracts cost (last clean canvas sacrificed). Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“emptied fairground above”) and never wavers. The final image of the stage waking behind color is the exact beat where cost becomes undeniable; no explanatory coda is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: dried oasis → lost letters → map under floorboard → conduit → cistern truth; each because/therefore step narrows Mara's options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city “felt answerable” because her un-gilded admission re-weights every prior transaction of words. Cost is legible in the final image—she carries no gold, only the zinc seal and a question that could lose her both water and sibling. The shredded map’s late reveal is the single teleport, but it is seeded by the postal fragment found first.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the Auditor lets go, the crowd re-learns listening, and Lysa retunes—cost is the Auditor’s dissolved ledger and the melted fragment. Causality is lyric-accumulative: each rotation adds light/sound density until silence itself refracts. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. The ending reweights the premise—wonder is conducted, not stored—without explanatory moral.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bead’s burial and new lullaby reweight the premise—fear becomes valve, not prison. Causal chain holds: static → retrieve box → compress → burn → vent → bury, each step narrowing options. The lens is cleanly Causal; no teleporting props or retro-patches. Cost is visible in the scorched corridor and the android’s altered bedtime code.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: locket photo → brick seam → hidden keyhole → mailbox opens → readings reroute eviction pressure. Closure is Earned Stasis—Mara forecloses profit, keeps the locket, neighborhood holds—cost felt in the developer truck idling outside. Orientation anchored by line 5; no lens drift. One tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lyra forecloses her old life by leaving the journal—visible cost in the final image. Causal chain holds: dance-cipher → guardian fooled → pods open; no off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is taught early by saltwater pressing cracked glass; no disorientation serves the ending. One meaningful tightening—rerouting alarms into drowned sensors—narrows options under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: the whale sinks, gravity pockets snap shut, and the father’s returned memory carries undeniable conceptual cost. The inferred lens is Causal—each jar opened therefore collapses the forgetting. Orientation is swift (who/where by line 3), the salt-drain heist tightens options, and the final lantern-bow reprises the opening silence with reweighted sorrow. No plot amnesia; every beat pays forward.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prophecy is neutralized into “blank petals,” the city still ignorant, Liora left with sole custody of the warning—cost is the burden of knowledge and future risk. Causal chain holds: lure of prophecy → mapping silence → filter choice → wing absorbs code → snowfall erasure. Orientation is swift: “nocturnal haven beside a quiet brook” anchors who/where inside 30 words. One minor elasticity: the instant mental appearance of the “missing half” is un-set-up, but it does not break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the preservation order reweights every prior lie, felt cost in the building’s “long wooden sigh” and Ilyas’s disappearance. Causal chain holds—seal → clay → hidden permits → switch with inspector—each step narrows options. Orientation is anchored within 60 words (roof, meteors, herb pots). No lens ambiguity; the ending is legible under Causal drive with persistent constraint: the narrator now must live inside the official story they forged.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: shell → unregistered memory → must archive → lattice translation → sealed jar → Mira gains future access. Closure is a Decisive Change: she relinquishes immediate possession but secures autonomous return, cost shown in “completed sentence” image. Orientation anchored by word 60; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: every beat is a because/therefore linkage—ledger → key → basin → papers → public confession—each action foreclosing the prior option. The hidden compartment reveal is a decisive turn that reweights all prior “calibrated treason” and lands with undeniable conceptual cost: the state’s first betrayal is now documented. Closure is a clean Decisive Change that exits the sanctuary under guard escort, papers against her chest; the cost is the certainty of trial. No orientation drift; marble/aurora anchor is fixed by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because Senn’s shell speaks → Lira follows; because she sings the counter-phrase → luminous threads snap and voices spill. Closure is a decisive change: the paired shell now sings origins, reweighting the world rule that identity can be restored. Cost is legible in the final line—her own throat now carries “reed-blown melancholy” as permanent promise, not transient sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: globe → Fen’s dream-theft → shrine lens → crowd exposure. Orientation is secured by line 20; the melted globe’s origin and Mara's hunt logic are anchored early. Closure lands as Decisive Change—Fen taken, globe relocated, child’s silence paid—under a stable Causal lens. Cost is visible (“the child’s ghost crowded close… only silence remained”), nudging the score to high band, though the final beat could sharpen the personal price to Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Ren’s promise to “mend what he broke” reconfigures his stance under moonlight, cost felt in the quiet tea froth. Causal chain holds—whistle → pattern recognition → guard placement → smuggler caught—without coincidence resolving. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words; lens stays Accumulative/Textural, taught by repeating lattice imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: shredded letters → coordinates → orchard → ledger → broadcast. The Stillpoint reveal re-prices the entire premise (cover relocation, not curse) and the closure beat—mailing pages while biting an irradiated apple—delivers conceptual cost under a Resonant Reconfiguration. One minor slack: the orchard supervisor flips from wary to cooperative too fast, a causality wobble that keeps this just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the valley’s single cheer is the undeniable social cost of Eli’s relinquished monopoly on hope. Causal chain—stolen fragments → joint transmission → unified audience—holds without teleport. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“observatory above the clouds”) and waived. Persistent constraint: the salvaged gear limits them to junk-built radios, shaping tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared dawn playback crystallizes a new social contract, felt when coins arrive “with names and dates.” Causal chain intact—each jarred sound mechanically frees the spring—though the widow’s late sister back-story is confessed rather than dramatized. Orientation is clear by line 4; single transition from loft to shore is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: key possession → thieves’ lunge → vibrational matching → confession → key returned as weight of forgiveness. Closure is Earned Stasis: Lio forecloses theft and the trader forecloses vengeance, both carrying felt weight (“the key back in the trader’s palm so the man would feel forgiveness as weight”). Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because she once fled projects, she now maps moons; because she maps moons, she times the third-full to dull the coils; because the coils slacken, the clamps are unyoked. Closure is Earned Stasis—she forecloses immediate rebellion for a slower revolution, cost visible in the emptied viaduct and her solitary return. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no teleporting props. One transition (dawn after night raid) is clean. Persistent constraint—the viaduct’s magnetic hum—shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is clean: cut brake-line → staged scene → lantern triggers memory-map → evidence leak → stance shift. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she climbs back down knowing reprisal is coming; the lingering lantern warmth is the felt price. Orientation is locked by line 3; no teleporting props or knowledge cheats. One micro nit: the courier-drone signal clarity is asserted, not shown, but it doesn’t break the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because the apology letter is rejected, therefore Darren builds the heart; because Elias doubts his own sermon, therefore he seeks Lena; because Lena links restitution to her own loss, therefore the night workshop is born. Each linkage tightens options until the clockwork heart’s steady tick becomes the on-page proof of Decisive Change with visible social cost—Mrs. Halden’s withheld forgiveness. No orientation drift; geography and timeline stay clean. Closure lands with felt price: Elias’s authority is displaced by a community ritual he no longer controls.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: slotting the tip rewrites the algorithm and reveals the coast’s bell tower, reweighting the premise that yearning must await a future ear. Causal chain holds—arrow tip → glyphs → kaleidoscope reading → cart flight → socket → tower rise—each beat narrows options. Cost is felt in the image of “towers glimmer[ing] as if some unborn species had shifted,” making Mara’s irreverent bow an earned stasis. Lens is causal throughout; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each discovery (numbers → locked folder → Chute → buoy) tightens options because/therefore. Closure is a decisive conceptual reprice—Mara seeds the numbers publicly, trading secrecy for collective rescue; cost is legible in the coat-patch image. One transition (midnight descent) is clean; orientation anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reconstituted ball projects a living map that re-weights community courage; the fisherman and glaciologist are folded into shared duty with visible social cost (they must ride together). Causal chain holds: shard → mirrors → empathic map → redistributed labor. Orientation is clean within 120 words; only one transition (lighthouse → vintage store) and it’s legible. Lens is Causal throughout; no late ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist lets the ending pass, crystallizing a new stance under Accumulative/Textural lens—ice pops, breath, wind-borne words reweight earlier pattern. Causality holds: each shard (tap, storm, cut, dawn) accrues density until the final refusal. Orientation clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the image of the sled disappearing into the fold of patience—an irrevocable foregone path.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: lantern approach → offer of pavilion → parallel readings → joint renunciation of erasure, each step a because/therefore tightening of options. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the letters remain unburned, the cost is the ache of witness they now share, and the sentinel leaves “less mismatched.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) settle within 70 words and never waver. No plot amnesia; the burned scraps on the table persist as the tactile price.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the widening sonic stair collapses into “steadier sleep,” Iri accepts guardianship, and the cost—shared vulnerability and lifelong silence—is legible in the final whisperfield calm. Causal chain holds: prophet’s arrival → parapet twitch → ritual bargain → stabilized wall. Orientation is swift; place, time, and stakes are anchored within the first 100 words. One minor slack: the elders’ fear is asserted, not tested, so the tightening is more textural than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the living town now walks “our hurt” together, a palpable before/after shift. Causal chain holds—each donated photo tightens communal stakes—though the single-scene default is stretched by the months-long montage; the final ladder moment crystallizes cost without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crystal’s echo turns the Council’s gaze toward the hidden door at dawn, reweighting the hush from curse to cradle; causality holds under Accumulative lens—each shard of testimony layers pattern until the final image crystallizes choice with felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early—echoes, driftwood arrows, unwatched tapes—and holds to the last image. Closure is a Charged Poise: Mira copies the layered voices onto blank videotape, turning future forgetting into a future echo; the cost is the irreversible entropic fade already audible in Orrin’s rasp. Orientation is anchored by line 30; no lens ambiguity or teleporting props. One meaningful tightening occurs when the capsule tape reveals prior strangers’ voices, reweighting the stake from private rescue to communal preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is clean: spinning hand → ruined tracking → leaf governor → stable lock → launch; each beat tightens the next under quake pressure. Closure is a Decisive Change: the pod escapes, the clock hand finally points, and Mara’s restructuring lets loss “escape” with visible conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by 80 words; no lens ambiguity; no teleporting props. The leaf cylinder is set up, used, and paid off inside the same escalating loop.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the needle wobbles on the repaired disk, Elias breathes with the scratched hymn, and the stillness after the last note reweights every prior mundane hymn. Causal chain intact—blood-work decline → Mara calls → Jonah walks skybridge → taped shard holds → final exhale. Orientation is immediate (elevator above cloudline) and the single skybridge scene satisfies Track A. Cost is unmistakable: the father’s last breath is timed to the imperfect music, foreclosing any future reconciliation. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of hymning objects intensifies until the final cadence crystallizes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: each rune-circle she completes tightens the next option until the final loop re-stitches noon to its shadows. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (“floating isle of Vey”), stakes are signaled by word 60 (“where shadows go at noon”), and the closure beat—her shadow re-attached—carries a felt conceptual cost under the glass pool. No teleporting props; the automaton’s double role as key and traveler is set up by the “sealed awakenings” rule. Closure is a Decisive Change with persistent constraint: the world’s sun-beam is now circular, a price that shapes future noon.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Rowan steps through the living door, tooth and star map tied together—cost is the irreversible surrender of certainty. Causal chain holds: substitute body → notebook → tooth → recognition → setting the jaw → crossing threshold, each because/therefore link tightening options. No orientation debt; geography and timeline stay legible from first reed to final hedge slit.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pearl’s quiet glow reweights the village’s night-life and Lio’s identity, with felt cost (his vow shifts “from punishment into purpose”). Causal chain holds: lantern disaster → fire-ban vow → sea-glass quest → polishing → communal stillness. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain holds: viral shame → flight to moss garden → drip-map encryption → pendant key → Jun’s acceptance. Each beat forecloses retreat; the pendant, once safety, becomes the price of restitution. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: archive seeded, name forever exposed, pendant gone—cost legible in the emptied palm. Orientation anchored by 110 words; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the blank page she forces open reweights the entire premise—an ending that refuses to lie, paid for by the ink river reversing and the mouth of light softening into dawn. Causal chain holds: shell → map → upstream wade → blood on book → blank given to strangers. Orientation is taught by sentence 3; no teleporting props. The persistent price—she must now write without a safety net—is legible in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crank is handed off, the latch clicks, and the orchard’s new song is the felt cost. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spun story-thread tightens the pattern until the final cadence shift. The Orientation Test is passed—who/where/when are clear by line 5. One minor loop: “harvest moon” is named three times in the first 100 words without new information, but this does not obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each patterned arrangement of refuse thickens the stakes of “translating pulse into map” until the flash-paper transfer crystallizes the constellation; closure is a Charged Poise—the glowing plate sealed to the well reconfigures stillness as shareable resource. Causality is lyric-forward yet coherent: the orchard’s frozen sap sets the tempo, the mica spark fixes the map, the wax seal prevents leakage. Orientation is anchored by word 40 (subarctic crater, withered orchard, Eira named). Cost is legible in the final image: starlight locked under ice, Eira’s knees aching, aurora’s fractional loosening—she forfeits immediate use for future others.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the timer now carries the cavern’s exhaled chorus, a conceptual repricing that reweights every prior echo. Causality holds under an Accumulative lens: each measured reflection angle layers into the marble escapement, and the final tick opens the narrow window that forecloses further harvest. Cost is legible in the single line “the cavern exhale in relief,” confirming Ivo has taken the surplus sound into himself. No orientation drift; transitions are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lattice fused inside his pack forever reweights his gait; the causal chain from mis-alignment to calcification to released seam is legible, and the persistent price (he must re-orient nightly) shapes future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each steam-beaded channel adds density until the ash circle becomes a charged poise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—crystals clear, panel glows, grief is re-weighted into craft; cost is the irreversible dissolving of the only “time” she had left of Jory. Orientation anchored by word 60; single-scene, single transition (kettle boil) taught early and held. No causal break; pattern pays off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara forecloses the restart fantasy and accepts custodial repairs; cost is the forfeiture of her image-archive and heroic identity. Causal lens holds—because she fixes the bolt, the horses settle and lagoon re-rotates; ghost payment is therefore/result. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) taught by 80 words via stalled carousel & cloud-belly sound. No teleporting props or retro-patches.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the terminal’s beacon rewrites the demolition brief into an open invitation, cost paid by Lina’s off-the-books labor and the authority’s lost control. Causal chain holds—sextant → architect letters → redirect flow → antenna—each because/therefore linkage tightening options until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“abandoned spaceport passenger terminal”) and the lens (Causal) is unambiguous at exit. No teleporting props or retro-fitted knowledge; the broken sextant’s date is set-up, not patch.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the forecourt’s mute pulses become a score the protagonist will keep composing, reconfiguring silence from wound to instrument. Causality holds—every beat (quartz murmur, paw wound, ledger strip) tightens options until the sunrise line crystallizes the new stance. Cost is legible in the torn margin and the explicit forfeiture of bells. Orientation is anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: silence → tape → splice → slow turning; the splice beat carries legible social cost when decks empty to confront their scaffolded faith. Orientation is anchored by word 60; the final image of “canal began…to talk” supplies Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—no mechanical wrap-up.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the seed placed in the crack, the knot tied above it, the council’s conditional concession—cost is felt in the open exposure of once-secret knowledge. Causal chain holds: rope-reading → proof of identity → conditional victory; secrecy foreclosed, apprenticeship now public. Orientation is clean within 50 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the red thread in the narrator’s palm reweights absence into navigable geography, cost felt in “mark my skin.” Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (salt, decay, hum) tightens the weave until the queen’s grief is re-patterned. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“palace hill rose”), well inside the 120-word guardrail. No causal breaks; even the magical “projection” is pre-explained by guild method.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: insomnia → Archive → egg → Cradle → pigment rupture → unguarded invitation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the palace’s balance literally recalibrates when color rewrites algorithmic certitude. Cost is legible in the nun’s confession and the palace’s audible creak—beauty now arrives as systemic stutter.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: father’s arson → daughter’s firefighter identity → copycat uses coin → narrator reframes legacy by leaving coin as communal message. Each beat tightens options: accelerant fuse forces entry, beam pins girl, graft buys time, coin evidence threatens reputation, final gesture forecloses secrecy. Closure is Earned Stasis: she sacrifices the private charm to public trust, cost legible in the tied coin now exposed. Orientation clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: lost memory → accept commission → breadcrumb trail → mechanical map → release → maternal origin → decision to restore. Closure is a Decisive Change: the city’s memories are freed and Mara’s doubt is permanently re-weighted; cost is the ache she now must share. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; lens stays causal throughout. No teleporting props or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cool shared radiance reweights the premise—light without fire is possible, but only if many hands turn together, foreclosing Lior’s solitary hero path. Causal chain holds: gear → moth → grooves → automaton → diffused light; each step is motivated and irreversible. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“violet dust,” “starvines,” exile line). One minor scaffold: “he had sworn not to repeat them” repeats prior summary, but it does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ribbon-tying beats braid separate losses into a visible pattern that peaks when siblings add their colors to the unfinished tablet, creating a Charged Poise with communal cost; causality is loose but coherence and closure land cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is clean: fog-wreck → guilt → discovery of secret weight → removal → tide recalibrated; each step narrows options and the final image of the notch meeting the first wave delivers visible cost under Earned Stasis. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the rake-handle cipher is set up early enough to avoid retro-info. Closure lands with the pendulum’s renewed arc and the widow’s single nod—no explanatory dump.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: sovereign case → tapestry cipher → salt ledger → widowed relief. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gardener re-weights the silo from crime scene to shrine, cost felt in the shifted night “less like a shroud.” One soft spot: the cipher’s chess-move code is revealed in summary, not tested on the page, slightly deflating the pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the charter’s conditional sentences reweight governance from obedience to iterative testing, with the visible cost of Jora’s childhood trauma and the persistent constraint of the single page. Causal linkage holds throughout: because she models ignorance, she can shift sled routes; because she writes contingencies, the villages survive and the Warden converts. The lens is Causal; every beat advances by therefore or because. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clear within 60 words. The ending image of elders arguing over data reconfigures social meaning with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the square performance releases secretly luminous scores, Censors paralyzed by their own audible confession, stories seeded in mist—undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: each copying act increases narrative density until the cloak-and-broadcast tactic crystallizes in one public, irreversible act. Orientation is taught early; pattern of pirate lyrics → orchestra parts → glowing dust is coherent, no late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the rocking chair’s last creak halts time, ash hangs in the vanishing light, and Lira’s next portrait is both defiance and acceptance—cost is undeniable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (porcelain chime, ash dust, perspective lines) tightens the stake until the inspector’s flinch reweights safety as shared vulnerability. No causality gaps; even the father memory is anchored to the present rocking motion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: plague ends → Council erases past → Orin needs proof → digs → finds cog → refuses archival co-option. Each beat tightens options; the refusal is irreversible and costs him institutional protection. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the teaching rig built from sewer pipe turns the cog into a living counter-narrative, foreclosing assimilation. The lens stays causal throughout; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the councilman’s downward glance and verbal concession carry undeniable social cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens—the choir’s subtracted-noise chord reweights “progress.” Causality holds: each rehearsal deletion (sarcasm, silence, shout) accumulates into the final sustained note that forces the reversal. Orientation is clean within 120 words; velvet library, autumn cold, and budget memo anchor who-where-when. No plot amnesia; the repaired zither’s shadow on the score sheet is the taught pattern that pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the communal bite rewrites neural pathways and reweights the Ministry’s rule-set, cost paid in Mira’s forfeiture of exclusive control. Causal chain (seed → pruning → alignment → shared meal) is tight; each beat alters tactical options. Orientation is anchored by word 30 (“rusted greenhouse at the edge of the collapsed rail yard”). No lens ambiguity; the final image of “debris into a small, luminous garden” crystallizes the new status under an Accumulative/Textural drive. Meets 9+ quick test with visible constraint shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: box arrival → uphill trek → truth spoken → queen released → lights blink on. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the city’s power returns only after public confession, making truth the new currency. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“river tollgate”), well inside the 120-word window. No teleporting props or retroactive patches; the matchbox, sap seal, and queen core track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the released hush spreads over the street, reconfiguring the town’s aliveness-rule with undeniable conceptual cost (“a city can burn quietly with belonging”). Causal chain holds—each object replaced tightens the house-warmth—until the deliberate sacrifice severs her private access. Lens is cleanly Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early, paid off in final iris-note image. No orientation debt; spatial anchors (boardwalk, alcove, tideline) track throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain is immaculate: because Ilyan told a partial truth, the Founder summons him; because he threads the crack, he learns the mines belonged to his own court; because he sets the ampoule in the bowl, the fourth revelation rewrites his public lie. Each “because” tightens options until the only exit is to surface with the whole seam. Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing: the flood was accidental colonial sabotage, not martyrdom—cost is the implosion of his prior testimony. Lens holds without wobble; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wheel stalls when he re-prices belief itself, a felt cost rendered in the sudden widening of the stairwell. Causal chain (dice roll → lemma → rupture → wheel halt) holds without gaps; every beat advances knowledge or options. Orientation is taught by the third sentence; infinite staircase rule is clear. No teleporting props or retro-patches.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing rooftop reconfigures the city’s emotional economy and the cost—Mira finally sleeps—is felt on the last line. Causal chain (moonbeam → script → Ro → collective alphabet) holds without gaps; no teleporting props. Orientation is clear by line 40. The single tightening beat—Ro’s recognition—forecloses his cynicism and opens the communal path. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the museum becomes opera house, guards retreat, art stays breathing—cost is the perpetual threat now internalized. Causal chain holds: honey loaves → thaw → spectacle → moral pause. Orientation is swift; grotto, waterfall, alcoves anchored by word 80. One soft spot: the Council’s reversal hinges on a single captain’s hesitation—slightly convenient, but the loaf-offer is foreshadowed and the lens has already framed history as hostage, so the stakes stay earned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: sailor’s rumor → yoyo puzzle → stone ritual → surrender. The decisive change—letting the moment pass—lands with visible cost (“he rowed away knowing…”) and reweights the premise under a causal lens. No orientation debt; all anchors clear by 90 words.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the gray, ordinary photo strip proves the curse has been starved of its light, and the funhouse goes dark—cost felt in the bite of metal and the advisor’s silence. Causal linkage holds: because the clasp siphons the luminance at the instant of capture, the image cannot keep the narrator, therefore fear loses its proof and collapses. Orientation is anchored by word 30 ("abandoned carnival funhouse at the edge of town") and the lens—Causal—remains stable. Persistent constraint: the clasp must wound the wearer to work, a price that shapes the final tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sailcloth fractal path is legible, reconfigures options, and carries conceptual cost—prophecy needs harmony to move people. Causality under Accumulative lens holds: each percussive layer tightens the driftwood circle’s density until the storm’s own thunder becomes the mirrored instrument that saves them. Orientation is anchored by word 60 with “orchard floated alone,” so no penalty applies. A hairline slip: the freighter’s horn alteration feels slightly exogenous, but because the mirrored pattern precedes it, the beat still reads as earned resonance rather than coincidence rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the gate is a clamped mouth, the watchers are rivets, and the mirrored city reconfigures the whole premise. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each spiral traced adds density until the gate’s rust flakes answer back. One minor lapse: the journal’s “compass spin” is introduced late yet instantly treated as axiomatic, a tiny teleport of stakes. Otherwise the pattern is taught early and the final image pays it off with visible cost—the lock splits, the path forecloses behind her.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: petal drop → meeting → reading aloud → parallel-drawing → bargain → transfer of satchel, each step a because/therefore that narrows options. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—Mara physically takes the letter while promising to annotate Hadrin’s complicity, foreclosing the “noble lie” path forever. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no ambiguity at closure. The single persistent constraint—her public annotation of his role—shapes the final image and satisfies the 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a perfect Charged Poise: the drawbridge up, Beran trapped, Lira on the firm shore with the warm inkwell—options reconfigured, cost legible. Causal chain holds throughout: because the pavilion sank, because the council denies it, because Lira needs to inscribe memory, therefore she infiltrates, writes, seals, and sets the stone. No orientation drift; who/where/when land by line 50. One micro-turn (Beran’s intrusion) tightens rather than breaks the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the photographed cards + restored title reweight the premise with undeniable social cost. Causal chain—blackout → access → coded catalog → stamp reveal → decision to smuggle evidence—holds tight. One smooth shard, orientation anchored by line 5, no prop teleporting. Cost is legible in the final “quiet weight.”

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal chain is airtight: missing shadow → lantern recorder → basilica bargain → self-splitting → crane-bird that re-casts shadows. The “stair that descends while ascending” is taught early, paid off in the return, anchoring the surreal geometry. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s partial self-objectification into paper birds is an irreversible, visible cost that reweights every prior lantern image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: overload → 12-minute battery clock → perturbation readings → thruster steering → capture of mercy-pause → upload with geode signature. Closure is a Decisive Change: future drones inherit the pause; conceptual cost—he weaponizes his own wound—is legible in “forcing every future drone to feel that pause as mercy.” Orientation anchored by word 80; no teleporting props; breakers’ click pays off the clock set-up. Lens stays causal throughout; no retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the tuner turns the abstract “frequency of belonging” into a literal chord the observatory sings, costing the characters nothing but re-weighting everything. Causality is clean—each chip clicks into the next, the coil hums, the dome answers—no lucky rescues. Orientation is swift: dusk, cracked steps, drone clips inside 120 words. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of assembling fragments tightens once, then resonates rather than reverses. Cost is visible in the final image—the pilgrim laughing as if he hears his name—so the ending pays on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: because Mara kept the secret, she sells false memories; because she finds her surname on the driftwood, she must speak. The decisive change—Jonah pockets the unopened capsule and Mara offers the watch hand—lands with felt cost under the cobalt dusk. Orientation is clean by line 5; no teleporting props. Closure is earned, not explained, and the persistent ticking constraint shapes every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the brass handle crosses the neutral crack, reweighting the truce from geopolitical abstraction to domestic repair. Causal chain holds—moon-sync rule → full-moon arrival → handle lever → apology whisper → boy walks free—each because/therefore link narrows options. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 5; no penalty. Persistent constraint: the drawer pull’s absence now denies Lena her private shield, a price legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal spine holds: cancelled ferry → inland paddle → pole navigation → logbook confession; each beat forecloses prior evasions. Closure lands as Decisive Change with social cost: public admission in indelible ink. One minor causality bobble—Lita’s roadside sprint keeps pace with a kayak in open water—doesn’t dent the core chain.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain holds: erased heart → newspaper clues → labyrinth → save boy → testify. Each beat narrows options and the final renunciation lands with visible social cost (“carried no miracle, only a statement”). Closure is legible, lens stays causal, cost is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spice-scented breath thickens the moonlit orchard until the corridor opens and Mira’s human shape is forfeited. Closure is a Charged Poise—two hounds circling under permanent moonlight—whose conceptual cost (she can never return) is legible in the final sap-scented line.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tree returns the hours only after the narrator accepts reliving them, a cost legible in “I stayed willingly perplexed, open to whatever hurt came.” Causality is lyric-accumulative—each image (cracked saucer, ribbon, palm-trace) re-weights time’s value—yet the lens holds cleanly from first cloud-step to final overlapping palms.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the hatch opens not by force but by the accumulated weight of named shadows, re-weighting the premise that only violence opens doors. The causal chain (quilt → tear → honesty → hatch) is legible and lands with persistent cost—Mara must keep forgiving to stay physically present. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of shimmer-to-thread taught early and paid off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the beach becomes a crucible where "change was hot, granular, and shared," a conceptual repricing that reweights every prior gift. The lava-tide meeting is the earned cost, foreshadowed by volcanic ash earlier. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught by the second paragraph and holds. One scaffold loop—"she had heard a whispering hush under every sound" appears twice without new pressure—slightly blunts the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal linkage is airtight: blackout → sentinel exploits blindness → sundial signal → locks ease → Orven fooled → revolution seeded. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “I kept my face neutral and my revolution quietly alive” reconfigures stance with felt cost (permanent double identity). The persistent constraint—every lock still looks intact—shapes both tactic and aftermath. No teleporting props or causal amnesia; the lens holds start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the sea opens, the rope and Lysa’s word “Forgive” appear, and Eren’s future stance crystallizes on-page under the Accumulative/Textural lens—dust helix and rock sequence reweight his guilt into stewardship. Causality holds: each rock shift alters visions, the helix predicts Marel’s arrival, and the final sequence begins because the past literalizes the pattern. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (bluff, aurora, harness). Cost is felt in the tightened harness rope and the vial returned to his neck—persistent constraints that shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the poet descends carrying fragile plates, resolved to fight censorship with “measured light,” a reconfiguration that reweights every prior stanza-blackout. The envelope-in-timetable reveal re-codes the father’s betrayal into coordinates of shared shame, paying off the opening image of the ticking timer. Causality holds: because the poet times each exposure to his breath-stutter, he produces an atlas of absences that forecloses traditional protest. Cost is legible in the final image—plates like “fragile oaths”—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds from first lightning flash to last.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is airtight: rumor → sundial decoding → card seizure risk → duel → map revealed → Veller disgraced → evacuation route legitimized. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost: the city must now confront its own engineered exodus, and Veller walks the first mile in chains. Stakes tighten through because/therefore linkage; no off-stage shortcuts. One hairline slip: the council’s delayed arrival is mentioned but never integrated as a ticking clock that alters tactics, keeping this just under 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the two libraries mirror across the wall, seedlings and poems swapped, fracture accepted as bloom. Causal chain (smuggle-cart-seed-raid-sign) holds; only minor ellipsis between downtown break-in and first visitors, but the lens (Causal) stays intact and the cost—Len’s gentler June self afraid yet still planting—is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the hidden room lets Lio practice the goodbye chord, the clock restarts, and the compasses lock—visible proof that time and choice have been rewired. Causal chain holds: because the archive reel shows forgotten geometry, therefore Lio can reach the heartwood room, which in turn restarts the clock and steadies the needles—cost is the irrevocable sound of the final flare-like chord that ends his self-imposed loop. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“tidal arbor above the clouds”) and the single transition up the ladder is legible; no lens ambiguity at the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tree’s ear-shaped leaves return the island’s own voices, reweighting memory from private ledger to shared tide. Causality under the Accumulative lens holds: dream-map → three-jar ritual → shoot listens. The final image carries conceptual cost—Tavo’s empirical authority is displaced by communal chorus—earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the compass needle flips from external quest to internal severance, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost (“the severance I blamed on him had begun with my own silence”).

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “change was not a headline but an accumulation.” Cost is legible in Mara’s redistributed grief and the patched foundation—both physical and emotional repair emerge from patient observation. The spiral dust pattern functions as both diagnostic tool and metaphor, tightening stakes when it reveals hidden rot. Every beat flows from prior conditions; no causality breaks, and the flood’s aftermath remains a live constraint throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the artist endures rather than retaliates, sealing truth in glass where it cannot be burned away. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (frost maps, soot rings, luminous glass) until the schoolhouse reveal crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in the councilman’s pallor and the artist’s return to studio with purpose redefined. Every beat tightens around the central question: what survives erasure?

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building toward a Conceptual Repricing: silence becomes legible as vibration. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 30. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration where the empty slot gains function—carries conceptual cost: music now requires calibration, not pitch. Every beat tightens the system’s flaw until Orren’s method rectifies it, fulfilling the drive lens without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marek’s refusal to abandon the dead reconfigures the library into a functioning mausoleum, with the sigh-like tone signaling rest achieved at personal cost (bleeding ears, exhaustion). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through sensory and symbolic layering until the final cadence shift (“the sea feels lighter”) reweights everything. Every beat links via pattern intensification, not causality, yet the distress signals’ transformation into catalog numbers creates undeniable narrative logic. The chased stillness sitting beside him crystallizes the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the daylight bell-chime crystallizes collective resolve without names, reconfiguring anonymity from vulnerability into strength. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density and patterned repetition (bell, box, routes), culminating in a cadence shift at dawn. Cost is legible: constant surveillance, sleepless runs, and the ever-present threat of extortion. Every escalation stems from Amira’s agency under sanctions’ tightening grip.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: unused love isn’t stored but flows, redefining the story’s metaphysical premise with undeniable emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through sensory layering (wisteria, fog, embers), culminating in a cadence shift where breath becomes narrative rhythm. Every beat tightens around the central question, and the final image (petals darkening on the pilgrim’s coat) crystallizes transformation without mechanical resolution. Orientation is immediate (“twilight viaduct in bloom”), and the past-life memory serves as a concrete cue that tilts present action.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time is revealed not as line but bark, and memory must rejoin the living bridge through erasure. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens holds—density builds via recurring images (photos, fragment, maze) until the final cadence shift (“listened for the rough, tender grain of now”) reweights everything. Cost is legible in the pulp-to-dust transformation of the photographs and Lio’s regained clarity at the price of lost history. Every beat tightens around the central paradox: to calm the dreaming bridge, one must let its past dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: seeds spilling into hands reweights “freedom” from rupture to cultivation, with cost felt in Mara’s trembling wrist and hidden drums. The Causal lens holds—each action (decoding keys, blocking stairs) directly enables survival—and the Wall’s fall isn’t backdrop but active pressure tightening choices. Orientation anchors instantly (“When the wall comes down…”) and payoff ties to early cues (chain, arrow, piano). No causality breaks; every beat chains forward.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: silence is redefined from absence to evidence, trust’s fragility made audible. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered absences until the click crystallizes meaning. Cost is legible in Mara’s pocketed device and Rell’s stripped yellow sheen. Aurora, forge, and apple blossoms evolve causally with emotional stakes, never static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lio’s tearing of the portrait forecloses the “untaken line,” with visible cost (abandoning his defining practice). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story builds density through recurring images (moonbeams, door, flowers) until the jar’s flare reweights everything. Destiny’s door going “quiet” confirms the bargain’s validity, and the final image (“luminous disbelief at how easily a moment could be saved by giving it away”) delivers conceptual repricing with emotional cost. Orientation is precise by line 30: emerald station, sunset, Lio’s purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the station reconfigured from bunker to observatory, the open notebook awaiting questions—a crystallized stance where options (inquiry vs. silence) and stakes (surveillance vs. safety) are legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density (dripping tiles, blue flame, molten silica) and cadence shifts from declamation to quiet. Cost is unmistakable—the trapped coworkers, the verdict of silence—and shapes tactics (glass walls make surveillance obvious). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara shifts from hiding to being seen, foreclosing her old survival mode with tangible cost (exposure, vulnerability). The causal chain—file discovery → library decryption → confrontation—is tight, motivated, and escalates via protagonist agency. Orientation anchors (“stunt double,” “props vault,” “rusted library”) are clear by line 30 and serve closure. Cost is legible in the final image: signing her name while holding the child’s hand.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the endless night is redefined not as loss but as migration, with direction now internalized. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds—the story deepens through sensory density, patterned silence, and cadence shifts, culminating in the ambered hush that makes “absence distinct.” Cost is legible in the ruined gold leaf booklet and the protagonist’s relinquishment of light-based navigation. The storm’s escalation tightens pressure without coincidence, and the final map emerges from earned stillness, not revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.5)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: each loop deepens density without redundancy, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where “thoughts come from what you keep when cleaning stops.” The closure image—J-17 walking away as the courtyard stabilizes—is a Charged Poise that crystallizes the entire arc with conceptual cost (the violin’s self-erasure) and felt consequence (abandoning omniscience for presence). Orientation is immediate (“After the procedure…”) and never wavers; causality operates through pattern logic, not linearity, and every shard serves the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara’s signed ledger and displayed evidence reconfigure communal silence into shared vulnerability, with conceptual cost—exposing herself to institutional reprisal. The Causal lens holds: each beat follows because/therefore logic (eavesdropping → pattern recognition → lens revelation → confrontation).

Cost is legible in the final image: musicians gathering “freed by what was plainly shared.”

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (marbles, chalk dates, jam-jar lanterns) that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s alignment with his work visibly reweights luck itself. Orientation is immediate (“After luck became measurable...”), and the spiral of marbles in the climax crystallizes before/after stakes with conceptual cost—proof must be “tended like any garden.” The closure image—a single marble left under the oldest vine—carries undeniable emotional and thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: time’s sideways nature isn’t disproven but reweighted as ethical burden, not scientific triumph. The nexus lever pull triggers cascading consequences (vision of broken rotor, glider panic), and Mara’s repair enacts a chosen past that stabilizes the present—causality holds under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure). Cost is legible: the station survives only because Mara forecloses Sen’s data-driven ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the flooded opera house becomes a living instrument, and Lena’s silent coordination crystallizes a new mode of performance.

Orientation anchors are immediate and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the keeper chooses witnessing over rescue, crystallizing his role with felt cost (sunlight ruins atlases, yet he tends decay). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure intensifies via sensory density (moss, loam, black glass) until silence becomes regenerative. Orientation anchors by line 3 (“overgrown library hidden in catacombs”), and the origami swan’s function pays off causally. Cost is legible when spores bloom on ruined maps—he accepts loss as script.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds flawlessly: sensory density (sage, sap, flute tones) builds toward the eclipse’s “dim blue hush,” where closure arrives as Charged Poise—Mara’s hum and whispered memory reconfigure grief without erasing it.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lysa forecloses all but one timeline by choosing to “let gravity have her,” with visible cost (“heavier than before”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via fractal self-versions until the bead’s ripple resumes time. Every beat links through procedural generation logic, and the cost (“carrying the tablet as proof”) crystallizes in the final image. Orientation anchors instantly (“glowing viaduct after rain”), and the causal chain from rune-glint to labyrinth navigation remains unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the cavern reclaims echo, the Listener retreats, and Mara carries forward a new pedagogy of silence. Cost is legible in the “gray pollen” of dissolving hush and the snapped filament—a conceptual price paid for emotional reawakening. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies via sensory thinning, then breaks via backward cranking. Every beat tightens toward the decisive act of scoring the record, with no causality breaks or orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the unlatched gate misleads the watcher while integrity gains “company,” crystallizing options with conceptual cost. Causal lens holds—each move (pigeon message, lateral traversal, log copying) follows from established methods and intensifies stakes. Orientation anchors by line 3; spatial choreography remains lucid across courtyard, rooftops, warehouses, riverwalk. Cost is legible in Mara’s raw wrists and the chlorine-rot stench that “frauds” safety.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lio’s choice to keep his tears as “remembered light” reconfigures his identity from broker to steward, with clear cost (years of avoidance, shame).

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the poet walks away knowing time has texture, while the grotto becomes a site of conditional redemption. Cost is legible—the poet sacrifices direct access to temporal intimacy—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via layered strata, knots, and driver testimonials. The inciting bargain and climax (slipknot offer) are causally linked through the rope’s evolving function. No orientation debt; who/where/when are clear by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where density of silence intensifies until Mara’s violin disrupts it. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the greenhouse ripples, sound returns, and Mara walks back with renewed purpose—foreclosing passive grief with the cost of ongoing labor (“plans the next bonfire story”). The cistern scene crystallizes stakes: beauty lies in the unfinished, not restoration. Every beat tightens around this thesis, culminating in a decisive tonal shift that reweights the world’s rules with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mira accepts her role as boundary-keeper yet integrates real empathy into her counterfeit practice, crystallized in the final image of static fading but insight remaining. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story deepens through sensory and emotional density, not causal chain—and the amber grotto’s fumes, static electricity, and petal function as persistent constraints that shape tactics.

Cost is legible in Mara’s funded envelopes and Eli’s blush—small prices that sustain the cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the arbor becomes a communal node where kinship is crafted, not inherited. The loop-and-thorn’s revelation as an invitation—not a signature—reweights the entire search with conceptual cost: belonging requires active making. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; patterned details (reed impressions, crystal fruit, map-song) accumulate toward this reconfiguration. Every beat tightens around the central stake: who gets to belong?

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Rin learns echoes are born where endings are refused, reweighting the city’s suspended state from fragility to generative potential. The cost—stolen seconds she must repay—is legible in the final line and woven into every borrowed heartbeat. Causality is tight under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern (interrupted cadence) → density (repeating shapes, slipping metronome) → cadence shift (breaking the lock by refusing closure). Orientation is immediate and functional disorientation (Giant’s scale, canal geography) pays off in the throat-chamber climax.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “love can continue without resolution” crystallizes in the Charged Poise of the light-seam closing, with cost legible in Lysa’s repaired tile and buried optimism.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Lio’s refusal to emerge is charged by the child’s trust and the librarian’s “good ghost” remark, making his invisibility meaningful rather than tragic. Cost is legible in the final image—“he began, at last, to feel seen”—a reconfiguration earned by prior acts of quiet care. Orientation is immediate (“dawn,” “shadowed library,” “Lio”), and the single shard structure accumulates pressure through sensory density, not causality. The ferromagnetic fragment functions as a mnemonic key, not a plot device, aligning perfectly with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara accepts her altered perception, rebuilds the trellis collaboratively with the vines, and mails her findings—foreclosing her old detached methodology with visible cost (loss of human certainty).

Cost is legible in the clasp “bit[ing] like a promise” and the tide’s return framing irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the cave’s music deepens in density and shifts cadence as stakes intensify, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where “unseen forces” are redefined as entities craving witness, not domination. Closure is earned through Sera’s song and Lan’s confession—a Resonant Reconfiguration that forecloses magical spectacle in favor of ordinary enchantment, with visible cost (Lan’s temporary loss of self, the cave’s altered harmony). Every beat tightens around the central question: can the unnoticed be made audible? The overlapping shadows, introduced early, become both threat and conduit, ensuring causality remains texturally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the trumpet’s first note is “not an order but a tremulous invitation,” reweighting silence from suppression to sanctuary. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—fragments accrue meaning through staggered intervals, each deepening the map of loss. Cost is legible in Sorrel’s ripped pages and Ilven’s hidden valve; the harbor’s empty berths become charged absences. Orientation is immediate (“ivory harbor after rain”), and the pattern of return (Sorrel → Ilven → townsfolk) tightens coherently toward the bell tower climax.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the fortress of unspoken truths reweights the entire narrative as an inward journey. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pavement arrows, map scraps, and ticket punch cohere into a resonant system. Cost is legible in Mara’s admission and the crescent-shaped hole left by the punch. Orientation anchors are clear by line 30; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.4)

Closure lands with conceptual cost: Mara remains unconvinced of miracles but certain of meaning, crystallizing a Charged Poise where options (belief vs. doubt) are reconfigured, not resolved. Every beat links through sensory and emotional accumulation, not causality, and the whale breaches mirror the squares’ sums with poetic inevitability. The ending image—unfinished symphony left for others—makes the cost of shared grief legible without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where escalating sensory and spatial density reweights the central stake: understanding goodbye. Orientation is immediate (“prismatic escondite,” “solar storm”), and the mutiny’s intensification tightens options until Ilias must choose allegiance. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “space stops obeying you, and you become part of what remains”—a resonant, irreversible reconfiguration with clear cost (loss of self, immortality). Every beat feeds this arc without slack or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara’s act of placing Mercy beside the unclaimed woman reconfigures truth as care, not transaction, with visible relational cost—Ivo “smaller” in the doorway. The Causal lens holds: each beat follows because/therefore logic (e.g., Mercy’s ink enables margin-writing, which alters agent behavior). Cost is legible in the final image: truth priced not in currency but in estrangement and quiet labor.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Haru redefines town silence not as loss but as a legible pause to be “scored,” transforming absence into archival possibility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure escalates via sensory density (fluorescent hum → bonsai labyrinth sounds), culminating in a final history where returnees “read one another’s faces” like humming lines. Cost is legible: he carries only “cataloged sensations,” accepting mute streets may persist. Orientation anchors instantly (“After the town goes silent...”), and the bonsai ascent functions as a taught shard transition.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.4)
    Orientation is immediate: “My death certificate says I drowned three years ago” anchors who, where, and when within 15 words. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held rigorously, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—erasure as systemic, not personal—with tangible cost (namelessness, perpetual invisibility). The discovery of DECEASED files proves institutionalized forgetting, and the final act of scattering them reweights the entire premise. Every beat tightens the thematic spiral without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where density of sensory and symbolic detail intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing: the riddle isn’t a word but a method of listening to gaps. Closure lands decisively—the observatory hums with retold truths, Eli steps into dawn decoded, and the vanished compass signals completion. Cost is legible: he abandons the tools of his old quest (compass, charts) to embrace participatory myth-making. Every beat accumulates toward this reweighting, with no causal breaks or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Vell’s choice crystallizes options, and Ira’s final mural reconfigures meaning without resolving all tension. The quartz map enables a Decisive Change (rafts drifting apart) that invalidates deeds, fulfilling Majo’s logic. Cost is legible in Ira’s exhaustion and the implied fragility of the moratorium. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens—accumulative texture (graffiti code) meets causal pressure (security launch forcing action).

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sky “surrenders,” reweighting the space age’s triumph into elegy, with Eli’s sand grain as proof of loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds through recurring objects (hourglass, chemical strips, crater rim) until the final image crystallizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hummingbird’s repaired chirp becomes the Meridian’s compass, reconfiguring fog from obstacle to medium. The causal chain—failed drone → Lio’s refraction method → recalibrated feedback → Sera’s turn toward sound—is seamless and pressure-coherent. Cost is legible in the depot’s trembling glass and water-beaded anchor links: time, trust, and sensory vulnerability are paid in real-time. Every beat tightens around the core constraint: how to steer when sight fails.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the spring’s repetition reweights the entire premise—maps are not weapons but witnesses—and crystallizes Riven’s stance (Charged Poise). Causality flows cleanly from Slate’s return → vellum word → condensation map → journey → spring verification. The cost is legible in Riven’s dread (“what the Ministry would do”) and the droplet’s precise alignment with geopolitical fracture.

    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the narrator endures disbelief to grant the dead dignity, crystallizing his divergence from his father’s need for attention. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pressure builds via sensory density (corridors through lattice, scuffs as map) until the hush “takes the words and holds them still.” Cost is legible in the final image: he waits alone under copperlight, knowing he’ll be accused of fabrication. Orientation is immediate (“lighthouse prison off the jagged reef”), and the disorientation of whispers vs. silence pays off in the lantern room revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard awakens, the valley is saved, and the bride is unchained—all at the cost of Eli’s identity (“empty name”) and mortal pulse. The causal chain is tight: bead → memory → debt → resonator → sacrifice. Orientation is instantly clear (“greenhouse,” “winter-cracked fields,” “Eli”), and the drive lens (Causal) holds from inciting incident to final pear. The cost is legible in the glowing fruit and tears: life for life, memory for mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: reverence is redefined from passive obedience to active, communal repair, with visible cost (lost lovers, smugglers’ ruin).

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through nested awakenings, echo patterns, and the nickel’s recurring fit. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the mural’s true layer isn’t pigment but self-reflection, and the cost is Mara’s surrender of restorer-as-authority. The “pause” serves as both temporal frame and structural vessel, with each awakening deepening stakes without causal rupture. Every shard loops meaningfully into the next, culminating in a Charged Poise where uncertainty becomes generative.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “the garden messages outside took root, guarding our sparks” reweights the premise—defiance becomes weather, untaxable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (butterfly spirals, ladybug codes, gourd vines) intensifies until chaos itself becomes tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: algae currents, feather, fireflies, and dome-light accumulate into a submerged zodiac that reweights meaning by closure. Orientation is immediate (“down through a service shaft into the forgotten underwater city”), and the story pays off early disorientation with the feather’s compass function. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where belonging emerges not as reunion but as co-navigation, with cost legible in Jonah’s fear of sunrise and Mira’s willingness to delay departure.

The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned anomalies (reordered logbook, future tags on dying saplings) intensify until the bathroom mirror crystallizes their meaning. Orientation is deliberately disorienting early but pays off at closure—the “bewildered curator” becomes the necessary node in a causal loop.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s omissions are not walls but absences, and lessons unlearned can be paid in understanding. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the unheard symphony’s silences accumulate until Lysa inserts blank pages to “breathe forward.” Cost is legible when readers regain voices but carry unfinished stories into the world, and Orren’s wrist-marked grammar implies future rescues will still demand sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lio refuses the magician’s claim, buries the silk, and returns to forge—not with restored self but with clarified purpose. Cost is unmistakable (“blank where his mother's name should have been,” “forgot songs and faces”) and tied to every awakening. The Causal lens holds: because arches shed rubble → he forges clamps → fails → seeks silk → pays with memory → learns truth → forges new anchors → steadies arch.
