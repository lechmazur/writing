  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors who and where by the second sentence; when is signaled ("three weeks prior," "Morning came"). The closure offers a repricing of the ledger from debt to devotion, but the cost is conceptual and retrospective rather than a felt forfeiture on the page. The cave discovery and journal reveal are convenient arrivals; the frost-pattern method functions as decoration rather than a constraint that narrows options. One meaningful deepening occurs (ledger reinterpreted), satisfying minimum escalation, but the protagonist's agency at closure is passive reception of new information rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening. The piece builds through density and cadence: coldness → envy (teal/emerald) → warmth (tangerine/coral) → white-gold radiance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara reweights silence as instrument rather than prison. The cost is conceptual and felt—she accepts permanent deafness by transforming its meaning—but the final image ("finally reconciled with the quiet") leans slightly toward assertion rather than a concrete on-page moment that makes the cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and symbolic accretion (crate arrival → lens pulse → ocean wound → library ascent → lens placement → transformation). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marian becomes part of the architecture she sought to create, the weariness lifts, and she finally sleeps. The cost is legible—she abandons her terrestrial undertaking practice and becomes permanent keeper of the impossible. Orientation is clear early; the because/therefore chain is softer than pure causal but the accumulative pattern holds and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The pattern of midnight runs accumulates through vivid particulars (insulin in ceramic pot, lentils for mothers) and the bell's charged return at closure reweights the community's understanding with conceptual cost—they discover their interdependence was always present. Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing: "We are the donors and the distributed" reconfigures the premise with social cost (loss of anonymity, gain of collective identity). The tightening is meaningful but the escalation relies on summary more than on-page pressure; the sixty-first night and the gathering are recounted rather than dramatically compressed, softening the closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed past 120 words—who Maya is beyond "pilgrim of sparks" and what concrete problem she faces remain unclear until well into the piece. The closure offers thematic assertion ("to hold on is to wither, and to let go is to bloom") rather than a decisive change with visible cost; the tear melts and love disperses, but no on-page choice or renunciation forecloses a path. Causality is obscured by metaphor: how the camera reveals sparks, how the tear operates, and what Maya risks remain abstract. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the final image summarizes meaning rather than reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is anchored early (hedge maze designer, living bridge garden), and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric aspirations. However, the closure—Elias dissolving into the garden—lacks a legible before/after with felt cost. The transformation is asserted through abstract description rather than dramatized through a choice or refusal that forecloses options. The ending delivers conceptual poetry but no pressure-driven reconfiguration or visible price that makes the change undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a causal lens: wall falls → scavengers approach → Elara decodes vault → confronts scavengers → descent. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara descends, leaving the chain as monument, with the cost of permanent separation legible on the page. Orientation anchors quickly (carnival center, Elara chained, wall demolition). One meaningful tightening occurs when the scavenger lowers his weapon, narrowing options from potential violence to passage. The cost is visible—she remains below while "resilience could move forward"—though the scavenger's conversion lacks dramatized friction, slightly softening the closure's earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered absences, the aurora's shifting pitch, and the forge-imprinting ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mara sits "among the withered roots" and accepts the "perfect clarity" of her regrets. Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (who, where, when). The closure unit is on the page with felt cost—her death and the final understanding of trust's acoustic shape. One minor causality slip: the device's mechanics are abstract ("compressed silence gathered from empty rooms") and the leap from collecting absences to producing a functional hearing aid is asserted rather than traced.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by the opening lines; no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers symbolic objects (moonbeams, portraits, flowers) and lyric descriptions toward a final image. Closure is Charged Poise—Elara waits with her jar, "believing and not believing that the next golden hour would finally be hers"—which crystallizes her stance without decisive change. Cost is implied (perpetual waiting, unfulfilled longing) but not concretely foregrounded in a visible trade-off or forfeiture on the page. The ~120-word penalty waiver applies, but the cost proof test shows only oblique conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first 120 words. The piece accumulates density through recurring images (ice melting, glass spheres, the bookmark) and culminates in a resonant final image ("Exit, pursued by spring") that reweights the opening stakes with conceptual cost—the surrender of the sanctuary she built. The closure lands as Charged Poise: she walks away carrying "the weight of what she had released," crystallizing the cost of her departure without requiring a dramatic reversal, which fits the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening paragraph. Causal lens: Kai discovers the birth certificate, decrypts the cast notes, transmits coordinates, and positions for the father's arrival—each beat advances knowledge and narrows options. Closure lands on the page (Kai descends as sirens approach, identity reconciled) with a conceptual cost (neither original nor manufactured double). However, the decryption mechanism—tears and tremors revealing hidden coordinates—reads convenient rather than causally seeded; the seashell's recorded voice arrives late without prior setup, weakening the earn. One meaningful tightening is present but the final image ("something new") leans declarative rather than resonant reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who (oracle), where (ridge fort), and when (at dusk/endless night threshold) within the first paragraph. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the work builds density through layered silence cataloging and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration when the oracle becomes the map itself and the endless night is achieved. However, the cost remains abstract—what path is foreclosed by her success is never made visceral on the page, and the final image of settling to wait for "the next storm" diffuses rather than crystallizes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern-taught, cadence shift at closure). Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when by first paragraph). The looped-timeline mechanic is signaled and returns, but the closure unit—Seven resuming sweeping with new understanding—offers Conceptual Repricing without a felt cost legible on the page. The final image reweights the premise (thoughts come from amalgamation), yet no tactical forfeiture or visible price shapes the ending beat. One meaningful deepening occurs (violin discovery → playing → melting), but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara and Julian agree to confess tomorrow, and the cost is visible in the report she will file and the lens Julian pockets as self-surveillance. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered discovery (tickets, lens, confession) and the forecourt's acoustic imagery recurs with shifted weight. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara's honesty "opened the space between them," narrowing options and foreclosing silence. The ending image reweights the premise (transparency as willingness to examine shadows together) with felt cost, though the decision to act "tomorrow" defers the highest-stakes beat slightly off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (garden maze, vine dresser, ritual with marbles) arrive early. The piece accumulates texture through repeated polishing and placement of marbles, building toward the fountain moment where the garden "exhales" in recognition—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the relationship. However, the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; the final image does not clearly foreclose a path or show what Elara sacrifices by emptying her pouch. One meaningful deepening is present, but the felt price is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Causal: Kael initiates the sequence, pulls the lever, the nexus flares, and the Drakes' temporal drag is confirmed. Closure arrives on-page when Dr. Vex recognizes the evidence, but the cost is conceptual only—there's no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed, just "discovered truth." The shift from mechanic to vindicated theorist carries intellectual satisfaction but lacks the felt price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (water receding, hush shifting from unstruck to completed chords) with visible cost—the program dissolves, the conversation ends. Escalation proceeds through pattern accumulation: lantern placement, spiral matching ripples, ghost materializing. One meaningful deepening when her playing answers the century-old question. Cost is legible: the antique program's final dissolution and the "in between space collapsing." Minor slip: the resolution feels assured rather than hard-won; no live obstacle threatens failure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (Elara, weather station, post-fever dawn) land cleanly in the opening lines. The accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered realizations (smudged illustration → weeks of dismissed anomalies → complicity in hiding warming trends) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when she tapes the illustration at the center of the log, a Charged Poise moment that crystallizes her stance shift from peripheral observer to confronter with undeniable conceptual cost (acknowledging her role in climate-data manipulation). The cost is legible in her physical placement of evidence and the "could no longer treat the anomaly as peripheral" closure beat. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Mara, tunnel, post-confession) are clear by line two. The piece deepens through a pattern of evidence accumulation: radio calls → beaded valve wheel → sixteen colors → photograph → final understanding. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara becomes the witness-bearer, "the scale upon which such truths were weighed," with cost felt in "the exact tonnage Elias had confessed" now transferred to her. The lens holds: each beat adds density (frantic calls, geographically specific details, makeshift memorial, glass beads as prayers, dust thickness, precise bead count) that reweights the dominant stake—finding the weight of swallowed truth. Cost is legible in the final image: she carries no cosmic justice, only human tonnage.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes a meditative journey but lacks a legible closure unit with visible cost. The chronicle keeper arrives at the refuge, observes, writes in the swan's margins, then returns—no decisive change, no path foreclosed, no option reweighted with felt consequence. The ending simply restates the opening stance ("gripping the moment loosely") without transformation. Under an Accumulative lens, the final image would need to recharge prior material with undeniable pressure; instead it circles back to the same thematic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on-page with cost: Milo speaks after months of silence, and the eclipse moment provides the decisive pressure. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through sensory detail, the eclipse tightens atmosphere, and the final "Again" reweights prior silence. Orientation is clear early (therapist on ridge, pre-dawn, eclipse day). One meaningful deepening occurs when partial darkness creates safety and Milo plays. The cost is felt in the eight-month silence broken, though the breakthrough feels somewhat inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a conceptual premise (displaced axis, dreams stopped, walls as memory repositories) and Elara's goal early, satisfying basic orientation. However, the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara beginning to read aloud—a stance crystallization—but the cost remains abstract: no on-page sentence shows what she sacrifices or forecloses by becoming the voice. The causality is accumulative-textural (gathering fragments toward a realization), yet the closure image "translating walls into words, dragons into deliverance" gestures at meaning without landing a felt or conceptual price, leaving the before/after legible but the cost implied rather than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a mosaic structure (lighthouse work, cookie assembly, stranger's arrival, departure). The closure—Elias leaving the island—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (he has "orchestrated his own escape without knowing it"), but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt: no visible forfeiture, no tactics altered by prior constraints. The drive lens holds, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the escape feels inevitable rather than earned. Orientation is clear throughout, avoiding penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear situational/conceptual lens: the priest must neutralize a possessing entity before it completes manifestation. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. However, the escalation relies heavily on metaphysical assertion ("each rhetorical device locking into place like the tumblers of a safe") rather than dramatized causal linkage. The closure—entity neutralized by "elegant, suffocating weight of clarity"—lands as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains abstract; we cannot point to a concrete sentence where Elian's renunciation or sacrifice is legible on the page. The final image reweights the premise (stillness as foundation rather than decoration), yet the felt price is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly. The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure, but the "cost" remains purely metaphorical—no visible loss, forfeiture, or narrowing of options on the page. The escalation is asserted rather than enacted: Elias traces patterns, dawn arrives, and he "conducts" in a metaphor without any causal pressure changing his options or knowledge. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires a density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; instead, the ending delivers lyric affirmation without constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, why she's here now, and what immediate danger she faces remain unclear past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure—dust tablet, glowing tattoos, smile of acceptance—asserts unification without demonstrating a decisive change in options or knowledge earned by prior causality. The piece declares she "finally understood" and achieved unity, but no on-page choice or renunciation with felt cost lands; the transformation is told, not shown. Drive lens is ambiguous between Accumulative and Causal, never cohering.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image reweights her prior refusal to feel with the recognition that "she had carried [sound] within her all along." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening sentence. The backward-song mechanism deepens pressure in one meaningful turn when she feels "the filament of hush...as tension between what had sounded and what would sound." Cost is legible: she must abandon her protective numbness to teach again. The lens holds without contradiction, though the single-scene accumulation offers minimal causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: surveillance suspicion → pigeon arrival → mentor's coordinates → decision to continue dual recording. Orientation anchors cleanly (Elara, courtyard, post-surveillance), and the closure—opening the window to unscheduled rain while beginning to write—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where she crystallizes her stance with felt cost (perpetual surveillance, isolation as cultivation). The cost is conceptual and atmospheric rather than immediate physical peril, which fits the lens but remains oblique. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the quarantine is failing and her mentor survives, reweighting her solitary work into a collaborative resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the poet's meditation deepens through layered images (rope, clay strata, energy beings) until the final beat reconfigures time's texture from binary choice to "fraying" paradox. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening sentence. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the poet refuses both doors and "sat down... began to speak verses," crystallizing his stance with conceptual cost (foregoing retrieval and prophecy). The cost is felt but not enacted in a decisive physical act, keeping this in the high-7 range rather than 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara gathers materials, kindles fire, creates resonance, and the "chronic hush" cracks—a clear pattern of intensification leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence transforms from "empty absence" to "full of potential." Orientation is immediate (greenhouse, shipwrecks, Mara). The cost is conceptual and felt: she honors brokenness rather than restoring false completion, and the world remains "incomplete, resonant, and radiantly undone." One meaningful deepening occurs when the shipwrecks begin to hum in sympathetic vibration, reweighting the sonic landscape. The closure lands cleanly under the chosen lens with undeniable thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the client chooses to stay, Kael commits to future experiments, and the grotto "holds its breath" in anticipation, crystallizing options with conceptual cost (Kael's commerce model shifts). The inferred lens is Hybrid (Accumulative texture early, Causal turn at the blotter moment, Situational pressure at the end). Orientation anchors are present by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the counterfeit empathy becomes real through the grotto's resonance, narrowing Kael's cynical stance. Cost is felt but oblique; the final image charges prior material without decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece lacks a decisive change with felt cost. Elias moves from discovering the photo three weeks prior to establishing a foundation, but the entire arc is recounted in summary rather than dramatized with pressure. The closure image—Elias departing as "a steward of hidden grace"—moralizes rather than landing a reversal or reconfiguration with on-page cost. Orientation is delayed; "who, where, and when" remain abstract until paragraph two, and the timeline remains unclear throughout (−0.4 for orientation debt).

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the search for silver glyphs accumulates into kinship, culminating in the bridge dedication. The closure unit—Kael's bridge and the mute artist's blessing—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("years spent alone") rather than dramatized as a present forfeiture or choice that narrows options. The final paragraph's "Years later, travelers would speak" shifts into distant summary, evacuating immediate pressure and blunting the closure image. Orientation is present early (marsh-reed sculptor, crystalline orchard, crater); no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of borrowed time manifesting as geometric ripples and uses the rooftop canal setting to build density through stacked fantastical elements. Closure lands on the page: Elara releases the borrowed time, the giant wakes three minutes early (visible cost), and she captures the echo's birth in her sketchbook—a Decisive Change with felt consequence. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (Elara, gondola, rooftrop canal, during the giant's nap). One meaningful deepening occurs when the pendant expands into a Mobius strip and she sculpts the bridge, tightening the temporal debt and forcing the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately (Elian, cavern orchard, night). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflection and sensory detail to reweight Elian's stance on his sister's absence. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he accepts the persistence of love without resolution—but the cost is conceptual and abstract rather than felt on the page. The final paragraph states the answer ("the equation was never broken") instead of showing a decisive image or action that forecloses a path with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Maya), where (library basement), and when (dawn after an outage) by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Maya's systematic retrieval of fragments across locations builds toward a pattern of distribution that reweights her invisibility into visible care. However, closure is a Conceptual Repricing without on-page cost—Maya smiles in satisfaction, having completed her plan, but no decision, renunciation, or visible price appears in the final image. The ending reconfigures "visibility" conceptually but lacks the felt or opportunity cost required for a strong RR or DC. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but the Cost proof test reveals no exact sentence where cost is legible at closure, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (mossy trellis, linden leaf, bindweed, storm) that reweigh Maren's control paradigm, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she releases the leaf and commits to open trellises. Orientation is clear by the opening line. The closure lands on the page with felt cost—fifteen years of work must be dismantled—and the decision to "reconstruct...not with steel and timers, but with open trellises" forecloses her prior path. However, the transformation unfolds through reflection rather than pressure; the plants "teach" but don't force a harder choice, and no concrete obstacle tests her new stance before she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation is established early (Carrick Isle, post-water-wars, tidal causeway). The exchange itself is a micro turn that delivers the journals and reframes Elara's insomnia as vigil rather than curse; the final image of sketching the unearthed chamber with "terrible, exhausted clarity" crystallizes her purpose with visible cost (the brooch is gone, but the lesson persists). Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift that reweights the stake. Cost is felt in the relinquishment and the acceptance of endless witness.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): Elara's realization that "true clairvoyance lay not in seeing what must come, but in remaining present" reweights her seventeen-year practice with conceptual cost (her former certainty is abandoned). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through overlapping sensory and symbolic detail until the final cadence shift. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page; we're told liberation rather than shown a specific forfeiture that alters her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates impressions and fragments toward the closing insight that "meaning does not arrive whole; it must be assembled." The valve shifts from failed signal to connection symbol, creating a legible before/after with felt emotional cost in the woman's transformation. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One escalation via the valve handoff deepens the archival mission; the closure reweights prior material through the image of the valve gleaming in candlelight. Cost is visible in the woman's grief-to-acceptance arc, though Kael's own cost remains implied rather than dramatically foregrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The closure unit—boarding the phantom train and glimpsing the archive—lands on the page, but cost is asserted rather than shown: Elara's "commitment" is sealed by glowing cracks, not by a choice that forecloses another option. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural (symbols accrue: cracks, punch, archive), but the final image reconfigures meaning through declaration ("her map finally complete") rather than through a visible trade-off or renunciation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the punch validates the ticket, but the train materializes conveniently rather than through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds through whale song, comet, tile discovery, visions, and renovation design, culminating in the meditation-niche closure. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mara shifts stance from detached researcher to guardian—but the cost remains abstract ("no longer fighting the connection") rather than a visible forfeiture on the page. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the tile's arrival at the exact midpoint and its immediate unlocking of solutions feels convenient rather than causally earned from prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (Kael, prismatic escondite, solar storm timeframe) arrive early. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through dimensional imagery and magnetic-field language until the climax reweights the premise of farewells. The amulet shattering and Kael's vision constitute a Conceptual Repricing—goodbyes become "translations" rather than terminations—but the cost is more asserted than dramatized on the page. The resolution hinges on internal realization rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible sacrifice, weakening closure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a legible closure unit with visible cost. Maya's smile and calculation at the end promise future action but do not constitute a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing—no path is foreclosed, no option reweighted on the page. The orientation test is violated: we don't learn who Maya is, where precisely she stands, or her immediate situation until deep into the text. Causality is murky: how did she gain access to the prep room, why tonight specifically, and how does "waiting actively" for a guard seven minutes early constitute a breach opportunity? The drive lens reads as intended-causal but collapses into summary of future intent.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images of gold, invented histories, and the hum-chart ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when "the refraction showed not just one time but all times simultaneously." Orientation anchors (mountaintop workshop, post-silence valley, fluorescent lamp) arrive early. The closure effect—capturing all times in gold—lands on the page with conceptual cost (he had to fabricate specifics to preserve gathering's texture), though the felt weight could be sharper. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lamp stutters and he works faster, tightening the pressure before the final adhesion.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory fragments and container imagery toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the archivist "understanding finally" their identity as layered texture), but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally demonstrated—no visible forfeiture of a live option or relationship on the page. The accumulative pattern is taught early and holds, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the smile and understanding feel granted rather than paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with decent spatial grounding (observatory, cliff, shell) but orientation Test applied: who/where/when anchors arrive promptly enough to waive the penalty. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through lyric repetition and the shell/cello/fog motifs. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reconfigures skepticism into myth-becoming. However, the cost is felt more in tone than in a legible on-page forfeiture; Elara's walk into fog mirrors Mara's disappearance without dramatized trade-off, reducing the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal: Maya's graffiti network activates a resistance that will survive privatization, and the ending shows the corporate boats arriving while her encoded system operates invisibly. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure is a Charged Poise—Maya stands ready to translate while the hidden infrastructure persists—with conceptual cost legible (the carnival's culture will endure only in encoded form, not openly). One meaningful tightening occurs when the juggler recognizes her mark and the network activates. However, the three-night backstory of tagging "specific walls" is told rather than dramatized, and the legal loopholes she encodes are asserted without on-page demonstration of how they work or what they cost her to discover.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: Elena descends with both photograph and "melancholy certainty," crystallizing the cost of bearing witness to erasure—she has stolen the image but cannot stop the drills. Causal lens holds throughout: climb → chemical prep → outlasting cold → shutter at dawn → descent as drills begin. Single continuous scene on the summit with clear spatial and temporal anchors by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening when sunlight reveals the iridescent shock fractures she must capture before drilling vaporizes them.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes clear spatial and temporal anchors (rail depot, ship departure countdown) and tracks a single goal: repair the drone to save the Vespertine. The causal chain is coherent—crash damage → examination → repair → launch—and the time pressure from the ship's departure provides external escalation. Closure arrives on the page as Mira releases the drone and experiences internal resolution, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains asserted in metaphor ("anchor to lift from the seabed of her guilt") rather than demonstrated through a visible trade-off or renunciation that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates sensory particulars (frost-rimed horizon, condensation fractals, thermal vents) that converge at a single point of discovery. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marlow punches coordinates into the uplink, reweighting the frozen lake as "poised to become something else entirely" with visible professional and conceptual cost (every atlas will carry his correction). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the condensation pattern confirms his calculated coordinates, tightening his resolve and the reader's sense of inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered rhythm imagery, culminating in the archway singing and new structures rising. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the keystone moment crystallizes the seventeen-year walk's meaning with felt cost (the endless vigil). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first lines. One meaningful deepening occurs (dissonance detected, pace increased, final fork placement), though the causal link between her footsteps and physical regeneration rests on assertion rather than dramatized mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with recurring motifs (gathered hush, lonesome splendor, ephemeral). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the vial dissolving and Elara carrying memories upward, but the cost remains diffuse—her grief is "unsnarled" via告示rather than dramatized loss. The preservation-field diver and temple mechanics introduce convenient solutions (the vial's liquid grants wisdom, the temple opens when she exhales) that weren't constrained by prior setup. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening but the temple's sealing cycle and exit mechanism feel retrofitted to justify the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (lyric density and metaphor accumulation intended to reweight at closure). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The closure unit—Elias drifting to the boat as "rumor itself"—reads as Conceptual Repricing: he becomes the legend, reweighting the premise of inherited sentence. Cost is conceptual (he abandons return, accepts ghost status) but legible in the final image. However, causality between the whispered deception campaign and the actual escape mechanism (hovering, lattice-as-shield) remains opaque; the narrative physics conceit is asserted rather than earned through prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (greenhouse, Julian's entry with lantern) arrive by ~10% and the closure unit—Julian burying the bead, Eira dissolving—occurs on the page with visible action. However, the causal link from "take it to the fields" to immediate ground-shuddering and star-cracking feels convenience-driven rather than earned by prior struggle or a decision that narrows options. The "resonant awakenings" flood Julian's mind with ancestral memories but those memories do not constrain his next move; he simply obeys Eira's command without visible friction or trade-off, weakening the felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: who Maren is, where she stands, and what immediate problem she faces remain vague past the opening. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural—Maren sews night after night, building toward a final seam—but causality is thin; each night's work is described in summary rather than dramatized beats that narrow options. The closure (placing the plate, driving the final stitch, watching seams glow) lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("the canyon shuddered...with relief") rather than shown as a visible trade-off or forfeiture. The story moves via summary and poetic declaration, not because/therefore linkage or a tightening that forces a new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's purposeful wandering gathers fragments that accumulate into the restored sundial, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow falls on her great-grandmother's tree, sealing the diaspora/dead conversation). Orientation anchors promptly (valley, catacomb orchard, excavation of great-grandmother's tomb). The closure carries conceptual and relational cost (the "interrupted journeys" now include her own footsteps, the wound of separation sealed), though the cost remains more asserted than viscerally felt on the page. One tightening occurs: the discovery of the sundial base → purposeful collection → reconstruction → shadow alignment, narrowing the path from exile to return.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (Kael, golden arcade, dawn, final postal drone). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of detail (indentations, chalk grid, time compression) and resolves in a Conceptual Repricing when Kael watches the drone vanish and leaves the codes to erode—the cost is the ephemeral nature of resistance itself, made legible in that final image. One tightening occurs as the horizon brightens and the drone's arrival compresses time. The closure reweights the premise (analog secrecy) with felt impermanence, satisfying the RR/CR requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building toward a Causal turn when the captain arrives). Closure achieves Charged Poise: the conspiracy is forestalled, the "silence still intact" reweights the opening's "unheard stories," and cost registers as the fragility Mira must continue to navigate. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly by the second paragraph. The main causal link—Mira's displaced constellation functions as a map—lands with clarity, though the "adjacent possibilities" mechanic remains more atmosphere than dramatized constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure unit—Elara entering the vision, speaking her unsent words, and placing the shard—lands on the page and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (healing the wound of absence). Cost is present but conceptual: she "could not alter the past," yet the story does not dramatize what she forfeits by occupying this liminal space or why the younger self will "read in dreams" rather than experience relief now. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (mangrove imagery, condensation motif, singing spirits accumulate density), but the ending pivots to a causal intervention (opening the door, speaking) that the accumulative texture has not fully earned. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early, but the mechanics of the timeframe remain abstract: "pocket of time folded upon itself" tells rather than shows constraints, and the reader cannot trace why letters create this eddy or what rules govern medium work.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through coral-as-metaphor and cast-note fragments, then shifts cadence in the final two paragraphs to a promise of "grafted wholeness." Orientation anchors who/where/when by line three; no penalty. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara places the coral as sentinel and frames the boy's future healing with visible conceptual cost—she carries "the smudged lexicon of fear in her own marrow." Cost is legible but relies on assertion more than dramatized forfeiture, keeping the score mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece operates through density increase and pattern layering—mycorrhizal whispers, exposed film, phosphorescent paint, projected memories—that converge in the fog gallery. Orientation anchors (Mara, ruined orchard, daydream fold) arrive early. The closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration (joy "exposed and waiting, like film held too long in the chemical dark"), reweighting her creative capacity through the final sun-touching-fresco image. One meaningful deepening occurs when she begins painting light and the trees pulse bioluminescence in response, though the conceptual cost (returning to "gray apartment and empty studio") is stated rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as accumulative/textural, but the piece never teaches a coherent pattern of intensification. Orientation is delayed—who Elena is and why she's in the garden remain abstract past 120 words (−0.4). The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing gesture (curiosity colonizes certainty's territory), yet no on-page cost is legible: Elena smiles, her work "just beginning," with no visible foreclosure or trade-off. The transition from listener to painter lacks causal grounding; the scaffolding ("methodically playful," "nested awakenings") substitutes for motivated linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Elias captured but the network intact, encoded in the moth's wings—reads as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (his freedom for the message's survival), but the cost remains more asserted than felt on the page. The inferred lens is Situational with Accumulative texture; the gathering and warp effect complicate pressure, yet the drone's arrival feels convenient rather than causally earned by prior choices. No meaningful reversal or tightening narrows Elias's options before the capture; the plot moves in outline steps without because/therefore linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (shell, postcard, blossoms, song) and the final image reweights Elara's insomnia and isolation as generative rather than destructive. Orientation anchors arrive late—who and where are clear within the first third, but "when" (post-war, centuries of solitude) emerges only gradually. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the divers' discovery reframes Elara's refusal as architectural legacy, and the cost is legible in her dissolution ("no bones, only a hollow chamber"). However, the escalation path is more accretive than causal; transformations happen to her rather than because of tactical choices she makes under narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive by the opening paragraph (who, where, what). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the caretaker's ritual tending → discovery of the tube → lighting the orchids → return to waiting. Closure reads as Charged Poise: she returns to her station knowing entropy will resume, the cost felt in the crumbled tube and temporary illumination. The cost is legible but quiet; the deepening is present but the stakes never tighten into a narrower dilemma, keeping the band mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The dominant stake—restoring trust before Julian's departure—is signaled early and the deadline tightens pressure. The closure lands on the page: Julian steps into the heptagon and touches the ink well, the promise structure activates, and "two living voices finally began to speak again" (Decisive Change). Cost is felt but faint—Elara's vulnerability is named ("letting it show fully") but the price of failure or the weight of years-long silence doesn't fully charge the final image. The lens reads Causal with light Accumulative texture (seven languages as pattern); it holds through closure without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land promptly. The closure unit—Elias's decision to preserve the old system and falsify logs—constitutes Earned Stasis (refusing the upgrade demand) with conceptual cost (professional deception, conspiracy across time). However, the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized: we are told he risks pension and certification, but no supervisor appears, no inspector threatens, no peer challenges. The decision feels inevitable from the discovered letter rather than a difficult pivot earned by prior on-page pressure. Drive lens reads Causal-leaning Hybrid (discovery → decoding → refusal), coherent but with low tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust-mote mapping, pigeon navigation knowledge, and the meteorite's arrival layer toward a closure that reconfigures Elara's stance from hiding to trust. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she sends the artifact north and descends to reveal her true name, forecloses the path of perpetual reinvention with visible cost. Orientation anchors (attic, skylight, pigeons, detectives closing in) arrive promptly. The linkage between dust-mapping skill and the final release of Orion is taught early and paid off, though the causal mechanism (how dust spirals teach flight paths) remains slightly abstract rather than concretely demonstrated in a beat that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors drift: who Elara is becomes clear only after dense atmospheric description; the terrace's geothermal suspension and the maze's "folded space" location remain abstract past the 120-word mark without spatial grounding (−0.4). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with lyric compression, and the final image—Elara stepping into the maze carrying weather codes—offers Charged Poise where options crystallize. However, cost remains conceptual and felt rather than visible; no prior choice is demonstrably foreclosed on the page, weakening the closure's bite. The piece teaches its pattern of spiraling metaphor early enough, and the RR form is legible, so the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening, and the piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens by midpoint: density increases through layered images (burnt feather, bioluminescence, synchronized breath). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elara's realization that belonging is a frequency, and her shared breath with the phantom stabilizes the facility—but the cost remains implicit and the causal link between their breath and the generator activation reads as a late rule introduction rather than a persistent constraint. The phantom's disappearance carries emotional weight, yet the stake (chart the alignment vs. find belonging) splits focus and the alignment's completion feels ornamental rather than integral to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is delayed—"who" and "what she does" emerge gradually across the first third without concrete spatial or temporal anchors. The closure reads as thematic acceptance ("missing pieces would remain companions") without a decisive change, renunciation with cost, or a reconfigured stake; Elara ends as she began, harvesting memories. The "question" seed in the penultimate beat gestures toward openness but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. No visible cost forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation is delayed: the reader must piece together Kael as performer, the arcade's function, and the between-acts window from dispersed fragments rather than early anchors (−0.4 for orientation drift). The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the woman changes route, the arcade's dual nature is reaffirmed), but the cost is entirely borne by the woman off-page; Kael experiences no visible price, foreclosed path, or shift in options. The drive lens appears Causal (Kael engineers a chain reaction), yet the final paragraph loops back to thematic summary without deepening pressure. No meaningful before/after for Kael himself undermines closure validity under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece presents a single extended action (inscribing herself with moonstone dust) with no meaningful reversal, tightening, or cost. The transformation is described as complete and successful without obstacle or price beyond abstract "burning cold." Spatial and temporal anchors remain vague throughout (when does this occur? how long does it take?). The nostalgia ban and authorities are mentioned but never pressure her choices on the page. No legible drive lens emerges; the accumulation of description does not deepen stakes or narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (prism, ripples, noctilucent reckonings) and the cadence shifts from predawn stillness to "full rainbow brilliance" reweight the dominant stake—whether his fragmentary repairs have constructed meaning. Orientation anchors (pearl bay, predawn, prism atrium) land early and remain stable. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias perceives value in the asking and returns to work not with answers but with "patterns inscribed in his understanding," crystallizing his stance with felt cost (enduring uncertainty, forgoing resolution). The conceptual price—accepting that light reveals truth only through pressure—lands on the page in the final image, though one beat earlier the ripples "had reached the rocky edges and bounced back" could have been tightened to show immediate tactical consequence rather than purely thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (Maya, ridge, night, porcelain box). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ridge encounter deepens Maya's twenty-year carrying of Thomas's death into a mentorship gesture, and the empty box at dawn reconfigures her penance into transmission. Closure lands with cost—she descends alone, lighter but still aching—and the conceptual repricing (carrying twenty years was not penance but preparation for this moment) is legible. One pressure point: Elias's presence feels slightly convenient rather than causally seeded; we learn he "froze last week" but his arrival on this specific ridge tonight is coincidental, which is permissible under Situational/Accumulative lenses but softens the inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear within the opening lines, meeting the test. However, no causal linkage drives the piece: Elara arranges decorations in patterns, timelines synchronize, and the grotto brightens without any because/therefore chain or visible obstacle that her actions overcome. The closure—checking the gauge, noting "arrival," sitting among decorations—offers conceptual assertion ("hope remained the most logical conclusion") but no on-page decisive change, renunciation with cost, or image that reweights prior stakes. The prose describes a serene upheaval already complete rather than dramatizing pressure that forces a final choice or crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes who (Mara, corridor echo cartographer), where (ivy-veiled passage, eastern wing, cellar vault), and when (post-climate shifts) within the opening paragraphs, satisfying the orientation test. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through discovery layering (echoes → diaries → film negative → recognition of terrace → epiphany about walls dreaming of wholeness), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's understanding deepens and she accepts the burden with felt cost ("settled upon her shoulders"). The closure reweights her mapping mission from physical documentation to memory preservation. One meaningful deepening occurs; the cost is conceptual and emotional, legible in the final image of carrying the past forward. No causality breaks; the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery (mirrors, singing, prism light) toward a final reconfiguration where possibilities linger in glass after Elias departs. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he completes his work and vanishes, foreclosing continuation with visible cost (loss of borrowed heartbeat, evaporation into dark). Orientation anchors arrive late: "echoing terrace," "Elias," and "mirage painter" are present early, but his nature and the mirror's purpose clarify only after extended description, slightly past the ~120-word guideline without clear payoff for the delay. The Cost proof test: "leaving only wet footprints that evaporated" and "the borrowed heartbeat faded from his chest" make cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Drive lens: Situational (ritual pressure forces stance crystallization). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the terrace paragraph. The closure—three figures tending seeds in a portable garden that requires mutual care—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the fragile architecture of cooperation is crystallized, options narrowed to biological necessity). Cost is conceptual (generations of tending required, imperfect peace) but felt on the page through the general's trembling hand and acknowledgment that "the columns are falling." One meaningful tightening occurs when the soil reveal transforms the clipboard from accounting tool to shared obligation, though the move from confrontation to ritual compliance compresses without visible resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the manufactured drought, the exposed basin, the ritual burial, and the returning rains form a coherent pattern that reweights the opening premise. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the egg returned to silence, the crime "washed away"—with the final image of darkening salt functioning as undeniable cost. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One friction: the causal chain relies heavily on backstory (the three-year drought plan) rather than present-tense pressure, which slightly dilutes the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, layered design early and holds it. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lys unlocks the sanctuary, steps inside, sees infinite failed selves, and begins gathering echoes while "the snow continued to fall... erasing footprints, preserving the secret." The final image reconfigures her act as a covert preservation against erasure, with felt cost (secrecy, the alarming serenity deepening into "something sacred and terrifying"). However, the orientation test reveals ambiguity: "who" is clear, "where" (silver courtyard) is anchored, but "when" remains vague (Empire-era palace, no historical marker) past ~120 words. The timeframe "between sigh and smile" is poetic rather than a legible temporal anchor, creating minor orientation debt that does not fully obscure the closure but delays grounding. Cost proof is present in the final image (secrecy, the snow erasing footprints, the thaw "that must inevitably come"). Applying −0.3 for orientation ambiguity and waiving the Q3 cap since the poetic frame ultimately charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Marcus's choices (descending to the storyteller, burning the puppets) link causally, while the dome and story-stick accumulate symbolic weight. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he sits beside ashes having renounced manipulation. Orientation is clear by the opening beat. The cost is somewhat abstract: we see fire and ashes but not what Marcus sacrifices socially or materially by dismantling his troupe. One meaningful tightening occurs when the blind woman's story mirrors his own emptiness, narrowing his options to renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is immediate (who, where, when established in the opening lines). The piece uses an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through the thinning monarch count, the construction and dismantling cycle, and the final departure threshold. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the grotto will keep its stillness without her—with conceptual cost visible in the transience she honors. One meaningful deepening occurs (building, witnessing, releasing), and the cost is legible in her departure and the acknowledgment that preservation is impossible. Minor deduction: the closure moment is quieter than the accumulation warrants; the final image restates rather than reweights prior material with undeniable new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of imagery, ritual work, and the convergence of light, rope, and punched card toward the closure moment when names glow on ice walls. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's forgiveness materializes as preserved names, reweighting her failure and the village's loss—with felt cost (her years of grief, the night's work). One substantive issue: the ending extends past the climactic projection into reflective summary ("Tomorrow the villagers would come...") that explicates rather than trusts the image, diluting closure impact by ~0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (ivy, wafer seal, storm, mushrooms) toward a final reconfiguration when Foresight walks away. Orientation is delayed—who she is and why she's there emerges gradually through reflection rather than early anchors, risking mild disorientation in the opening third. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (renunciation as Earned Stasis), but the cost is more asserted ("dissolved into her skin") than dramatized on the page. The causal chain from mushroom ingestion to departure is elliptical; the dream sequence reframes but doesn't tighten options with visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (astronomer, ziggurat palace, twilight between regimes) and escalates through discovery of the tile's celestial alignment to the blood sacrifice that realigns the stars—a clear Decisive Change with physical and cosmic cost. The causal chain from accidental discovery to intentional activation holds under a Causal lens, though the middle compresses seventeen years of mapping into summary, creating a told tightening rather than a dramatized narrowing of options. The closure image—stars realigning as predicted—delivers visible transformation and cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.1)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the sanctuary deepens through layered motifs (cellular memory, the broken pin, soundlessness) toward a conceptual closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. However, the closure unit—the entity's dissolution—lacks visible cost; Elias pockets the pin and steps out "having won another bloodless victory" with no foreclosed path, altered relationship, or felt sacrifice. The ending asserts transformation ("resentment taught finally to release") but the mechanism remains abstract; we see no on-page moment where the entity's grip visibly fails or Elias pays a price. The final image ("the broken music that had, at last, completed its song") offers thematic echo without reconfiguring the dominant stake or making cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elias is and what stakes drive him emerge gradually across the first third without early anchoring. The closure—dream successfully captured in glass—lands as Decisive Change, but cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; the final paragraph asserts completion without showing what Elias lost or renounced. The causal lens holds (breath synchronization → glass shaping → dream capture), yet the tightening lacks a reversal or price that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Mara, cathedral, five years post-breach) land early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (orchard-in-ruin, ribbon-as-marker, forgotten tools) and a cadence shift at the ribbon moment tightens pressure, culminating in the seasonal-contract image that reweights commitment with conceptual cost (unwritten, deciduous promise vs. fixed contract). One meaningful deepening is present. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she accepts the ruin-as-garden and offers a seasonal return, foreclosing the restoration path). Cost is legible in the final image but leans interpretive rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story establishes an accumulative/textural lens but never delivers a legible closure unit with on-page cost. Elara's final "understanding" is asserted in abstract language ("she was always, already, eternally home") without a decisive change, visible renunciation, or reweighted image that makes before/after legible. The orientation remains vague past 120 words (who delivered the inheritance? when did she arrive? what triggers this particular walk?)—applying the −0.4 penalty. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the ending simply restates the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through its dense, layered imagery and botanical cipher structure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first 120 words. The closure unit reads as Conceptual Repricing: Elara's realization that "some rescues required not action but the wisdom to let knowledge bloom in its own season" reweights the rescue premise, and the chrononaut's release-through-acceptance carries conceptual cost. However, the cost remains abstract—no on-page sentence demonstrates what Elara forfeited or what path she foreclosed. The renegotiation with the mountain happens in summary ("She pressed the botanical diary against the living stone, translating the pressed flowers into a new contract") rather than through dramatized beats that show tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric ambitions, but the closure unit—Maya finding her twin's hand in the garden—arrives without clear setup of how "narrative threads" function as a constraint or cost. Orientation anchors who and what (Maya, carnival ship) quickly, but the when and spatial logic remain foggy: the ship "dissolves" into pages, the garden exists "between remembered and imagined," with no legible cost for crossing that threshold. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies: the fog/ship/garden spatial relationships never stabilize, and this vagueness persists through closure. No meaningful tightening or pressure accumulation occurs; beats loop through description without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal lens: Elara's research leads to the door, the seal resonates with the rope, reconfiguring the braids merges timelines, and placing the seal completes the merge. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening sentence. However, the cost of this closure—changing centuries of history—remains abstract; we see the signed treaty appear and students walk "united territories," but no felt price is legible on Elara herself (what she risked, lost, or forfeited to alter causality). The merge occurs "not with thunder but with a sigh," bypassing the opportunity to land a decisive emotional or conceptual cost that would make the before/after visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens where density builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Mara must remain to sustain the silence, her maps now obsolete). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—she is bound to this vigil, her former tools rendered useless—and the lens holds. One tightening occurs when she realizes she must conjure the bloom herself rather than wait for it, narrowing options and raising stakes. The cost is legible in "her ripple-mark maps now useless" and "knowing that the quiet would hold as long as she remained to tend it," a foreclosed path with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements (pattern recognition building toward cosmic alignment). Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words. The closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the beacon ignites, answering glints appear, and Elara's theory is validated. Cost is present but muted: her decades-long vigil concludes with success rather than a trade-off that narrows future options. The piece coheres under its chosen lens, with the prism discovery, vision sequence, tower climb, and ignition forming a clear tightening, though the alignment itself is coincidence that validates rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes atmospheric detail and thematic weight rather than causal turns. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—Elara joins the crystal chorus, becoming archive—but the cost is asserted ("sealing the story complete") rather than felt on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what she forfeited or what path closed. The final image reweights prior material, but the lack of tangible sacrifice keeps this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece presents an accumulative/textural structure but lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. Elian performs his ritual, the sky remains starless, ceramic shards fall—yet no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs; he descends "his motivation satisfied" without visible price, foreclosed option, or altered stance. The "note in mosaic" setup promises a formula but its discovery and use feel like steps in a checklist rather than beats that narrow options or deepen stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by the second paragraph, avoiding the Orientation Test penalty, but the causal chain is thin: events happen in sequence without because/therefore linkage that tightens pressure or changes knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure reads as Charged Poise: the jade cicada exchange crystallizes options (stay/leave, dissolution/solidity) with the cost felt in the week-long suspension and the narrator's acceptance of uncertainty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the grotto-pool-cicada-transition layering, and the final image reweights "transition period" from threat to threshold. Causality is clean within the reflective mode; the narrator's question → Maya's indirect approach → cicada gift → mutual agreement to wait forms a motivated sequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator shifts from demanding an answer to accepting the liminal space.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through density, pattern (the repeating "stretching contracted" motif), and cadence shifts around the trellis journey, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid) where Mara gains the gilded hush and reframes her mother's bunker silence as "private garden" rather than prison. Orientation anchors (Mara, trellis, inverted gravity Thursday) land within the first ~100 words; no penalty applied. The closure unit reweights prior material—the doll now holds her mother's peace, enabling Mara to endure the bunker—with conceptual cost legible in the final image: she accepts limitation as the condition for survival ("by limiting exposure to despair and hope alike"). One meaningful deepening occurs when she captures the silence and understands the flowers' discipline of brevity. Causality within the accumulative frame is clean: gravity inverts, she climbs, she collects, gravity returns, she descends with the silence. The lens holds without contradiction at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; no penalty. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the architect's release from grief) but the cost is asserted rather than shown—Mara "had succeeded" without visible forfeiture or altered stance. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of sensory detail and recurring motifs), and the final image attempts to reweight silence as comfort, but the effect reads declarative rather than earned through on-page pressure. One cost-proof deduction applied.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early, but the drive lens reads ambiguous: causal linkage (ruby flake → coordinates → waterfall) competes with accumulative texture (murals, pears, cascading prisms). The closure unit—Elara ascending and witnessing dawn—lands as Conceptual Repricing of the throne/wisdom binary, yet the conceptual cost remains abstract: "the weight of ages" and "that was adventure enough" are told rather than demonstrated through a forfeited option or felt price on the page. No meaningful tightening occurs; the quest proceeds smoothly from trigger to summit without a reversal or narrowed choice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the sanctuary, scars, and bridge metaphor accrue meaning and the ending reweights Mira's arrival as passage rather than destination. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image of Elias settling back into "loaded emptiness, having completed his careful burn" reconfigures the stake with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. However, the middle section relies on explanation and metaphor rather than a second on-page tightening; the transmission scene tells the mechanics of teaching rather than dramatizing a choice that narrows options, leaving escalation more asserted than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, layering images (mushroom glow, glitchy texts, bolt-as-seed) toward a conceptual repricing where trauma becomes currency and the diamond "seeds new forms of light." Orientation anchors (Maya, farm, present night) arrive early enough. The closure unit—planting the diamond, typing the backward message—reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (her failed downlines etched in the stone), satisfying CR requirements. However, the middle sags with repetitive thematic summary ("the multiverse ran its own pyramids") that asserts rather than dramatizes escalation, and the bolt's transformation into diamond unfolds through metaphorical telling ("pressure vessel," "collapsed downlines as geological strata") rather than a concrete choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The accumulative lens is inferred and held: the gramophone revelation deepens stakes by exposing coordinates, signatures, vault locations—each oscillating mote reweighting the dominant stake (collapsing the dynasty). Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: "by dawn, the Aureate name would be ash" crystallizes the ending with conceptual cost (the dynasty's end is certain, the evidence now in Kael's cipher book). One deduction: the causality is linear rather than because/therefore linked; Kael's success is uncontested, and no reversal tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the program's patterns guiding Valen toward transformation, and the closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as he steps through the door of liquid light. Orientation anchors arrive within the opening: Sir Valen, the greenhouse, endless night, thirteen-year silence. The escalation follows a clear through-line from entry to armor removal to final surrender, with the program functioning as a map throughout. However, the cost at closure remains conceptual rather than viscerally legible—"ceased to be one thing and became everything" asserts transformation without showing what was lost or paid, and the mercury spheres showing "unlived lives" introduce a complication that doesn't materially narrow his options or force a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the story builds through discovered patterns (dust gradients, circular clearings, multiple buttons) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maya's broken heart is reframed within "this larger fabric of unknown histories." The closure lands as Charged Poise—she carries the button "not as an object, but as a method"—with conceptual cost legible (she has committed to bearing witness rather than culling files). Orientation is clean early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sergeant's pattern is revealed across six other files, reweighting the single discovery into systemic mercy. Cost is felt but could be more visceral; the price is professional (task abandoned) and emotional (grief transformed) but not tested by immediate opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal. The piece delivers a clear Decisive Change—truth is broadcast, the Ministry's control begins collapse—but the final paragraph fast-forwards years and tells us the outcome rather than dramatizing cost on the page. The orientation test is waived (who/where/when anchored early), but the closure itself lacks felt price: Elias "vanished" with no visible pursuit, injury, or tradeoff, and the authorities find "only stagnant water." The escalation is linear (run → activate → broadcast → escape) with no meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options; coincidence (the lagoon's existence, the hydraulic locks) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through recurring motifs (dewdrops, mist, negative space) and reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration when the final dewdrop hangs suspended and Elias "holds one last note of emptiness" until the prophecy dissolves—Earned Stasis with cost felt in "eerie nostalgia settling over him like a familiar blanket of loss and preservation" and the vow to return every morning. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when anchored by end of first paragraph). The tightening is present but modest: the prophecy "tries to complete itself," Elias counters, succeeds, and will repeat tomorrow—one meaningful deepening that reweights the stake from immediate to perpetual, though the mechanical execution (play silence, prophecy dissolves) lacks friction or a moment where success is uncertain.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story establishes who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation into seed-vessel) with conceptual cost visible in the final image of Elias becoming monument and monument-builder. However, causality is loose—the moonstone dust unlocks the tree's response through assertion rather than earned mechanics, and the protagonist's decades of monument-building suddenly becomes functional receivers without prior setup. The transformation feels thematically inevitable but causally thin, and the "mossy delight" phrase at mid-story signals the ending's emotional texture too early, reducing narrative tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    The drive lens is Hybrid-Causal with accumulative texture: fragments surface over months, then the greenhouse vortex reveals the staircase, forcing the improvised waterfall crossing that narrows options (her notes "lied") and delivers the compass rose with visible cost (trusting physics-defying leaps). Closure is a Decisive Change—retrieving the artifact vindicates the admiral and liberates Elara, with the chronometer "singing" after twenty years. Cost is legible: she forfeits her lifelong reliance on calculation. The "ashes" conceal-to-preserve logic is taught late but pays off cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with clear spatial and temporal anchors (foundry, post-search-party, three hours elapsed). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the alchemy progresses through descriptive intensification ("copper sulfate solution," "liquid mirror," "thirty-seven syllables") toward a final image where Kael returns traced with golden scars. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael is repaired, not replaced—but the cost remains asserted rather than demonstrated: we do not see what Elara sacrificed or which path was foreclosed. The redemption's success undercuts the stakes declared earlier (the crevasse, the void's destructive power), and no meaningful obstacle intervenes between her intention and its fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive early (Elara, Echo Gorge, hidden sunrise). The closure reconfigures the crocodile's tooth from collection tool to vessel of liberation and positions Elara in the next cycle—a valid Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (the "luminous ache" she carries). However, the middle accumulation is steady rather than deepening; the woman's confession and release occur without significant friction or complication, so the tightening is modest. The final cadence shift and descent fulfill the pattern but lack a felt price beyond fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening but the ultraviolet forest remains spatially vague—no legible distances or boundaries. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: sensory density increases and the strap's fall marks a micro turn. However, the closure image ("walked forward, no longer wearing the mask") lacks a decisive on-page cost; the "willingness to remain intact" is declared rather than dramatized as a forfeited option or visceral trade-off. The final equation-solving feels conceptual but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes a single continuous scene with clear spatial grounding (rope bridge, market, painting) and attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the act of translating Mara into collective memory. However, the closure lacks visible cost: Elara completes her commission without consequence, the market resumes, and no option is foreclosed. The "eternal instant" mechanic is introduced and used but does not generate pressure or tightening—it functions as a convenient pause rather than a constraint. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (layering metaphor and ritual), but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust patterns, temperature drops, and the mainspring build density toward the installation beat that reweights the ringmaster's waiting into resolution. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the ghost finds peace, the crack seals—with conceptual cost (the transfer of burden to the machine). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya understands the mainspring's dual purpose, narrowing her action to installation. Cost is legible in the ghost's dissolution and the sealed crack, though the emotional price to Maya herself remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story establishes a clear setup (frost reading → bottle retrieval → press operation → rupture), and the final image of books awakening delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant) that reweights the premise of perfect stasis. Orientation anchors appear by ~150 words (western spire, letterpress, glass orchard library, cloud-sea). However, the cost at closure is primarily conceptual—perfection yielding to change—and the ending unfolds as an external cascade Elara observes rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt personal price. The mechanics of frost-pattern encoding into the print are asserted rather than dramatized with causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (Kaelen's shift to custodian, covering mirrors "from poetry," and his decision to remain). Cost is present but muted: the final choice to stay and tend visible time forecloses his departure with the expedition, yet the stakes feel more conceptual than viscerally narrowed. The orientation is established early (chapel dome, asteroid, Kaelen's defunct status), and the lens holds, but the escalation unfolds largely through reflection rather than scene pressure, weakening the felt urgency of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric density and ritual patterning. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (Elias, resonance chamber, three centuries of covenant). The closure—chip dissolving into the mechanism as midnight recoils—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the fragment becomes integral, the covenant persists), but the cost remains conceptual and remote: the world is saved, yet no visible price is paid by Elias himself in the final image. The inevitability of success undercuts felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (respirator, vials, compass, calcite, silver mist, bioluminescence) toward the lagoon's impossible petrichor. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara sits above still water, samples captured, understanding that mystery is wonder to be cultivated—a stance crystallization with conceptual cost (she returns to the world of explanations carrying this hinge). The closure image is legible and the lens holds, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful deepening (first hinged awakening → second hinged awakening → final realization) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (Mara's shift from fighting material to collaborating with it). Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening. The magic lantern slide discovery provides one meaningful tightening that reweights her approach to sculpture, and the final image of projecting slides onto future work reconfigures her practice. However, the closure cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no specific path is visibly foreclosed, no felt price paid on the page. The storm's resolution and GPS remaining dead are noted but don't materially constrain her homeward journey or commission plans.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens cleanly: winter passage → cathedral visits → layered-glass discovery → mural transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding replaces misreading) with conceptual cost visible in "years of misunderstanding." The orientation is delayed—"amber pavilion" and "behind the pavilion's garden wall" don't fully anchor spatial layout until paragraph two, but the effect serves the meditative mode and pays off at closure, waiving penalty. One meaningful deepening (the etched-glass revelation) reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Causal setup → Accumulative/Textural closure via arranged debris as symbolic bridge). Orientation arrives promptly: archivist, zeppelin deck, obsidian lagoon beneath dunes. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias kneels, arranges debris, recites names, and the lagoon surfaces evidence—yet the cost remains abstract ("solemn weight...settled into his bones") rather than a legible forfeiture or altered option. The because/therefore chain (touch diary → retrocognitive trap → descend → arrange → parley begins) holds structurally, but the final image asserts communion without demonstrating what Elias has lost or what path he's foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands on-page: the bottle shatters inward, new structures accrete through "logical extension of human will," and the cove revives as a Post-Wish Age settlement—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. However, the causal chain from "reconstructed memories" to physical manifestation bypasses on-page agency; the bottle's collapse feels like an automatic consequence of her mental effort rather than a choice that forecloses options. Cost is conceptual (wishes made obsolete) but the felt price—what Elara loses or risks in the act—remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elias is, where he stands, and what immediate problem he faces remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (atmosphere and density accumulate toward a final image), but no on-page Decisive Change or felt cost is visible; the ending asserts that "tomorrow the ships would navigate by different stars" without showing what Elias has lost or foreclosed. The wax-shaving trigger and the third-grade memory appear abruptly in the middle third without prior setup, undermining causal legibility. Non-closure accumulation cap applied: orientation delay + vague closure cost = −1.5 total within Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who and where within the first paragraph, though "after the egg hatches" as inciting event arrives abruptly without prior setup. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (vortex, acorn cap, lowering songs, entropy reversal) rather than because/therefore causality. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Elara commits to stay and decrease entropy), but the final image lacks visible cost—no choice is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relationship altered on the page. The ending asserts continuity ("would stay here") without dramatizing what she sacrifices or what competing path she refuses.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is established early (who, where, when), and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—microclimate tracking, the solstice hush motif, and bell-versus-siren contrast build toward a reconfiguration. However, the closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (a stance crystallization: bell over siren) whose cost remains abstract. The piece tells us she "made the correct choice" and that the sanctuary "returned to its original purpose," but no on-page consequence or foreclosed path is dramatized; the storm simply passes and she plans future documentation. The cost is conceptual (abandoning electronic systems) but not felt or visible in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds resonance through recurring imagery (yellow glass, falling stars, flourishing stillness) and a cadence shift at closure when Elian steps outside carrying the glass "as a compass." The Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) is legible—his stance crystallizes from observer to participant—with conceptual cost (the end of passive service). One meaningful deepening occurs when he recognizes "he was planted," reweighting the station from graveyard to nursery. The cost is felt but oblique; the before/after is clear enough to satisfy closure under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clean: Elias, abandoned oasis, post-barrier-dissolution timeframe established early. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered description and the ghosts' selective movements until the final image reweights the stained glass box as archive. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias accepts his role as keeper of silence—but the cost is asserted in metaphor ("gravity of everything never voiced") rather than shown through a forfeited alternative or visible trade-off. The letter remains sealed, a setup without payoff. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ghost touches the box and "the covenant untangl[es] itself," but this moment lacks causal tension or price.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through nested metaphors and the final absorption reweights Elara's stance from timekeeper to archived presence. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she becomes "the anticipated mystery herself"—that reweights her borrowed existence into sovereign continuity; the cost is implied (she can no longer measure, only be) but legible in the final stasis image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the urn fragment dissolves and she understands time as accumulation rather than passage. Minor causality issue: the garage-sale messaging is introduced as her sole communication medium but never shown failing or constraining a choice before the silo encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure from the boy's arrival. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening lines (who/where/when). The kite's fall provides a micro-reversal that deepens the poet's practice, and closure arrives through Resonant Reconfiguration (the repaired kite flying differently, the completed sand pattern). Cost is present but oblique—the feather given away, the acknowledgment of permanent damage—legible enough for this lens. One meaningful deepening is achieved when the repair becomes a demonstration of the core philosophy, reweighting "incomplete" from solitary meditation to shared lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens inferred; the piece layers copper-wrapping beats toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elias completes his duty and dies as the pillars sing). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3. Cost is legible—he forgoes treatment and dies—but the cost feels thematic rather than felt in scene; we never see him wrestle with pain or doubt on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pillars pulse with light and species begin sharing space, reweighting the orchard's function.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece opens with orientation debt—who Elara is, why she's at this tower, and what immediate choice faces her remain vague past 120 words—triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmospheric density and thematic callbacks), but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the group simply arrives, discusses, and enters the lab. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing via Professor Vance's whispered line ("homecoming isn't a return; it's a reaction"), yet the cost remains abstract—no on-page action or image demonstrates what they sacrifice or risk by choosing this illicit path. The Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where cost is legible in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening, avoiding penalty. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (reef death, monastery seeds, battlefield reclamation) toward a final image of "conquering death with the quiet persistence of grammar." However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—the garden's siege is declared inevitable in the abstract rather than dramatized with visible cost. The ending restates the premise ("root by root, word by word") without reweighting prior material or foreclosing options; it summarizes rather than crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands on-page with cost—Ash translates absence into presence through the wax disc, collapsing distance into intimate contact, and the final song represents both connection and acknowledgment of permanent loss. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory fragments (phonograph grooves, wax disc, preserved leaf) build density until the final image reweights the stake. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (hound, scrapyard, post-war wasteland). One meaningful deepening occurs when the riddle's answer shifts from puzzle to emotional cartography, narrowing Ash's search to the maple leaf and completing the circuit of memory. The cost is felt—Mara is present only as artifact, and Ash's song acknowledges she "never truly left" precisely because she can never return.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the fixed point brightens, she glimpses the exit, and steps through with her charcoal—options crystallize and pressure is undeniable even though the physical cost is not yet paid on the page. The "three objective years / three centuries subjective" and the mapping ritual deepen coherently. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~80 words (Elara, observation deck, post-accident isolation). One meaningful tightening occurs when her perception shifts from curse to cartography, narrowing her path to the hatch.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation Test: who/where/when are signaled early enough. Drive lens reads as causal-symbolic hybrid, but the exchange lacks true escalation—each chess piece simply unlocks the next with no tightening. The closure claims amendment and sky-healing, yet no on-page cost is visible: Kael descends triumphant, the guardian dissolves "freed," and the world below waits "open-armed." The ending asserts transformation without showing what Kael forfeited or risked losing. Cost-proof test fails; apply −0.6 in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira reads aloud, sunlight illuminates the empty pawn squares, and she understands her transformation into "the historian of small gestures." The cost is conceptual—exposure of complicity—but remains largely asserted rather than visibly paid on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the walking pattern, the chessboard, the penumbra, and the ledger accumulate to reweight her stance. Orientation is solid (cathedral, interregnum, Mira's role), and the lens holds, but the closure image's charge relies heavily on thematic echo rather than a felt forfeiture that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the stone discovery, feather translation, and summit seeding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Vey stops substituting reality and lets memory coexist with present. The cost is legible—ceasing the nightly illusion and accepting sharp edges—but the final turn hinges on an insight rather than a causal constraint that narrows options. One meaningful deepening is present; closure holds under the chosen lens with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands on the page with visible cost: Kaelen renounces his exile-ending escape to stay and teach, forecloses a return path. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered imagery (labyrinth, tapestry, threads) and resolves via a cadence shift when thunder rolls forward and he chooses to remain. Orientation is anchored early (town square, time-frozen village, seven years). One weakness: the mirror revelation that absolves him arrives late and feels convenient rather than fully earned by prior causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (poetry refracts, echoes multiply) and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the second paragraph without debt. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the pale spire dims, revealing "not one path forward, but many," and the canyon hums with accumulated poetry—this reweights the premise (singular truth vs. multiplicity) with conceptual cost (Kael's voice fades, "becoming part of the bone itself"). One meaningful deepening occurs when Lira's jars shatter, releasing all echoes and destabilizing the Overseers' ritual. The cost is legible on the page: Kael's dissolution into the structure, the ultimate price for breaking truth into freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through the memory-tank sequence, pattern-teaching kintsugi repair as narrative method by the second paragraph. Orientation anchors who and where early; "when" is abstract but functional given the memory-dive frame. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elara completes the statue repair and accepts immersion as the platform sinks, foreclosing escape with visible cost. The cost is legible in "diving into the story she had made," though the physical consequence remains somewhat abstract. One meaningful deepening through the crater-touching sequence tightens her commitment under time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes clear causality: grief → cave journey → wrong turn → hidden oasis → painting anew. Orientation anchors quickly (Elias, cave mouth, post-Marguerite). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (beginning again after loss) with felt cost (leaving the shell behind, accepting impermanence), legible under a Causal lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wrong turn opens the hidden chamber, narrowing options and forcing engagement. The cost at closure is present but somewhat diffuse—"gifting its colors slowly to the stone" implies sacrifice, yet the emotional price feels muted by the reflective distance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors (assistant keeper, lighthouse, post-heat dawn) arrive early. The closure reconfigures the gentleness-versus-force premise, but causal linkage is weak: the cork's mechanism (jasmine oils vaporizing to "seduce air into carrying meaning" and "purify intentions") remains unexplained, and the Maria Celeste's correction feels coincidental rather than earned by Elias's prior choices. The cost (weeping "with the violence of his own quiet") reads as emotional catharsis, not a decisive forfeiture or Charged Poise that narrows future options. Orientation Test penalty waived (anchors land early); lens holds, but closure cost lacks on-page legibility beyond sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds meaning through layered imagery (war salvage, coastlines, hydraulics, bronze censer) and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she constructs a compass pointing toward loss and accepts inhabiting the ruin. The closure image ("understanding that reverse migration meant coming home to the ruin because it was the only geography left that recognized her name") carries conceptual cost and reweights the premise. Orientation anchors early (starlit signal station, failed hydraulics, midnight phone). One meaningful deepening occurs when she completes the apparatus and understands its purpose. However, the cost remains largely conceptual and abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page; the final beat reads more as thematic summation than a moment where options narrow with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening lines (Maren, hanging orchard, pre-dusk with storms returning) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the pocket of occlusion is created, the glass eye anchor is buried, and future visitors are promised. The closure reweights the premise with conceptual cost (she has built a sanctuary but must maintain secrecy, and the storms will continue). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—discovery, research, ritual, effect—with one meaningful deepening when the extract works. The final paragraph, however, summarizes multiple future beats ("Each future visitor would add their own layer") rather than staying in the present moment, softening the immediacy of the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (keeper, beacon, opal dock, nautical twilight) by the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through sensory density, the boutonnière's reweighting, and the layered memories until the final pinning gesture reconfigures Maren's isolation into lineage. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she accepts the watch with conceptual cost (永久 solitude now understood as inheritance). The felt cost is legible in "accompanied by the ghost of every watcher who had loved the light more than the shore," though the decision itself carries limited on-page friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative elements (glowing flora, ant procession, rising water). Closure lands as Decisive Change (Arthur steps through, commits to catalog ghost maps) with felt cost (abandoning solitary dealing, embracing perpetual archival duty). The matrix chip engages hidden gears and opens the wall in clear because/therefore sequence. Minor orientation slip: "doorway of decisions" introduced late (paragraph 10) without prior anchor, forcing retroactive comprehension. Creek-rise timer creates pressure, though the twelve-minute estimate and actual pacing remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: "Elara" is named in line three, but her spatial position and the grotto's relationship to her kingdom remain vague until mid-story. The closure unit—Elara reaching into the pool to heal the starlight—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; we're told she has "renounced earthly power," yet the crown was already left in ashes and no on-page action forecloses a return. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (dreams → climb → grotto → cosmic wound → fireflies → realization), but the final tightening ("courage" replacing crown) restates rather than reweights prior pressure. Orientation debt (−0.4) and modest cost legibility prevent higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who and where by the opening lines (Elara at the ember nexus), satisfying orientation requirements. However, the drive lens remains ambiguous—accumulative imagery (palette, shell, compressed dawn) competes with causal language ("required her to approach," "activated her instruments") without teaching a coherent pattern by midpoint. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing through the final image of the glowing nautilus shell, but the cost is declared rather than made legible: "revalued the empty spaces" and "prove that certain configurations...could never dissipate" are thematic claims without on-page price paid or option foreclosed. The Mira revelation functions as setup rather than reversal, and the alchemical success faces no meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph and builds an accumulative lens around temporal fragmentation and the scroll. However, the closure—descending to write "with sufficient jaded wonder and enough distance from mortality"—offers a reconfiguration of stance but no legible cost: Elias returns to the same act (writing) with renewed equilibrium, yet nothing on the page is foreclosed or paid. The "soaring" reversal feels metaphorical rather than causal, and the final image restates thematic posture without decisive change or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens with strong anchoring (who, where, when clear early). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the final breath-and-understanding beat, but the cost remains abstract—"smelling nothing, understanding everything" asserts resolution without dramatizing what path was foreclosed or what trade-off was made. The screw discovery does not narrow options or force a tactical shift; it prompts reflection that deepens the existing stance without visible friction. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful density increase or cadence shift is sufficient, but here the final image recapitulates rather than reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the ritual, pressure increases as breath is held and crystals detach, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Elara completes the transformation with visible cost (scar removal, breath release). Orientation is clear early (who, where, when established by ~80 words). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—the deepest scar requiring a tear to release. One tightening suffices at this length: the escalation from forearm to sternum marks the deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with causal turns present. Orientation anchors early (who, where, when by the second paragraph). Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara delivers the apology, the circuit breaks, and she sits alone with column unwritten—a visible cost that forecloses her prior method. The orchard's fall and the spirit's dispersal into roots reweight the opening premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when she abandons metaphor, narrowing her rhetorical options. The acoustic anchor and time pressure (dawn chainsaws) shape tactics throughout. Cost is legible on the page in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is deliberately deferred but never fully anchored: who this witness is, why she alone survived, and what the dictionary's swollen humidity signifies remain opaque past the 120-word threshold without payoff that charges closure. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (spiraling descriptors, pattern-driven movement), and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—she becomes "the library, the dictionary, the hiccup"—with conceptual cost implied by the phrase "completing the arbitration." However, causality is abstract: no on-page event narrows her options or forces a choice; the spiral completes through iterative description rather than dramatized pressure. The closure unit lands but cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeited path or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (the shepherd's understanding reweights his perception of time measurement, and leaving the key constitutes Earned Stasis with implicit cost). The countdown method provides structural cohesion and the final image reconfigures the station's purpose. However, the causality is meditative rather than tight—the revelation about clocks measuring "the razor edge of the present" emerges through reflection more than dramatized discovery, and the decision to leave lacks a preceding moment where another path was visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately (professor, subway/library, post-heart-attack) and sustains an Accumulative lens throughout. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of carrying contradictions "like a lantern against the dark" reweights the opening tremor and her father's legacy with felt cost (her body's fragility, the acknowledged brutality of chance). However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—no single on-page sentence makes the price undeniable in action or forfeiture. The lens holds, but the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion rather than a charged image that forces the reader to feel the loss.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors are present but delayed and atmospherically diffuse: by ~120 words we have "rotary phone," "subway utility tunnel," and "Mara," though the spatial and temporal anchors blur into a perpetual twilight mood rather than a legible scene window. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with a lyric pattern of wrong-number calls building toward a final image, but no decisive change or visible cost lands on the page—Mara performs the same disconnection at the end as at the start, teaching the elderly man the identical lesson she taught the accountant earlier. The inferred lens (Accumulative) holds, yet the closure reconfigures nothing; the disc spins, the tunnel breathes, Mara waits, offering a thematic echo rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt price. The elderly man's arrival is a repeat beat, not a tightening or deepening that forecloses a path or reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece orients cleanly (archivist, jetty, twilight, decade bloom cycle) and accumulates density through layered description and reflection. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara's continued documentation regenerates the covenant, and the final image of "carrying the past gently, thoroughly, into whatever context came next" reconfigures her stance with a felt cost (another decade of bearing witness). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, holding through the final cadence shift. However, the cost is more implied than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture or choice that visibly narrows options—and the ending leans on thematic summary ("the covenant had been regenerated...by her documentation") rather than a single charged image that reweights prior material without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early and builds density through the rumor-chain mechanism and gathering voices. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing when the child inverts reciprocity and Elias laughs, reweighting the stone's meaning and the system's logic. However, the cost is oblique—Elias's loneliness dissolves through passive recognition rather than a trade-off that narrows options on the page. The final paragraph summarizes the station's evolution rather than landing a decisive image, diluting the closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory layering and the ultrasonic languages until the stillpoint silence crystallizes meaning. Orientation anchors (forest, night, constellations paused) arrive early enough. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (self-mapping in the stillpoint) with conceptual cost legible in the line "she finally understood that to navigate others, she must first know her own terrain." One meaningful deepening occurs when silence replaces cacophony and unlocks her suppressed emotions. Cost is felt but somewhat abstract; the final image reweights prior material cleanly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early (celestial signal interpreter, gravitational anomaly observatory) and tracks a clear causal sequence: Elara uses the exotic pen to rewrite the coordinates, unbending the timeline and freeing the colony ships. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (the pen crumbles, the ghostly colleagues fade). However, the mechanics of "scratching revisions into the fabric of history" remain abstract—how the pen drinks light and edits spacetime is asserted rather than dramatized through constrained tactics. The lens reads Causal but with convenience softness at the hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—mapping silence through the empty camera—and accumulates density through repeated framing beats that shift from observation to conducting to signing the symphony. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the silence "no longer empty, but full of the music he had mapped") with conceptual cost: the world will not remember, but the silence will. Orientation anchors (Elias, pier, moonlit harbor) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. One structural friction: the transition from camera-mapping to sign-conducting feels compressed; the causal link between photographing negative space and performing a symphony in gesture is asserted more than dramatized, lowering what would otherwise be a solid 7.8.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative lens but fails the Orientation Test: who Maya is, where exactly she stands, and what immediate danger or constraint she faces remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. Closure arrives as a summary of her completed art trail across three continents rather than a single on-page image with visible cost; the final beat ("a promise kept") tells us the work is done without showing a decisive moment or felt price. The causality is retrospective exposition—seventeen libraries burned, then years of art-making—compressed into a montage that elides the pressure points where choices narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece establishes orientation cleanly (Kael, pre-dawn, sound wave garden, six months into treatment) and operates under an Accumulative lens: density builds through layered sensory detail and the drumming intensifies until the golden figure rises. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the auroral sorrow wraps around him, the figure dissipates, yet he continues drumming in belief, crystallizing his stance with visible cost (exhaustion, repeated failure). The causal chain is motivated: his rebellion uses blind spots, drumming navigates frequencies, the specific rhythm summons the form. One micro turn (ventilation breaking the spell) sets up the final reconfiguration without violating the dominant lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly (Kael, port, storm). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered whisper-network mechanics, and the final transfer reweights the opening thesis ("whispers travel farther") with visible cost—Kael relinquishes the zodiac coin and entrusts the next generation. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the network's survival and the cost of mentorship. One micro turn when Voss acknowledges proof; pressure coheres steadily toward the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is present early (who, where, when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern-building through light/shadow orchestration. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs; the guardian begins the ritual, performs it, and ends it with the same stance and no legible cost. The "half-spoken secret" and "lesson" remain abstract declarations rather than dramatized pressure that tightens options or reweights meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the synchronized window displays build toward a pattern revelation, and the final image in the grotto aims for a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who and where within the opening but the "timeframe" remains vague until late. The closure unit—Elias standing in the grotto as the displays darken—offers a conceptual reweighting (hesitation as seed), yet the cost is asserted in summary ("a boy was deciding...") rather than shown. The chosen lens holds, but the RR relies on告知 summary of off-page effects rather than a single on-page image that makes the cost undeniable, pushing the score into mid-band rather than high.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, the scrimshaw's warming hum, and the island's materialization, culminating in Elara's immersion as Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation with visible cost—leaving the dock, surrendering armor, becoming "something sovereign"). Orientation anchors are present early (sublittoral fringe, tidal docks, Elara's station). The closure lands on-page with cost legible in her farewell to "the fortress" and physical departure, though the metaphoric layering occasionally obscures causal mechanics (how exactly the scrimshaw "unlocks" is asserted more than dramatized).

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the woman's exhale "without measuring" crystallizes her shift from mandated control to authentic feeling, with the cost (risk of unguarded emotion) legible in the image. The lens holds: density increases through layered backstory (Emotional Auditor, confiscated sorrows, three winters), the turbine motif recurs with reweighted meaning, and the whittling action accumulates symbolic pressure. Orientation is swift (who/where/when anchored by line 6). One tightening: the woman's request for room → tea ritual → acceptance of the bird narrows her path from observer to participant.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.8)
    The piece establishes "who" and concept early, but spatial orientation remains vague past the 120-word threshold—"edge" and "central column" never cohere into navigable space (−0.4). No causal linkage connects Elara's speech to the transformation; the colonnade responds to her voice, but we see no because/therefore chain, only coincident effects. The closure asserts that "the ban had never been external" but provides no prior beat where this realization alters her tactics or costs her a concrete choice. Lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern is taught by 25% and no cadence shift lands with cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, held to closure. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening beats. The story accumulates pressure through the barter arrangement, reed placement, and furnace firing, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara realizes "she had been searching for the wrong awakening." Cost is conceptual—she relinquishes the quest for color—but the final image of painting sound in "shades of understanding" makes the reweighting legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reed awakens Marin's voice instead of Elara's sight, reweighting the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Laboratory, Elara, post-blackout pilgrimage). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through discovery (lens reveals cracks, strike activates archives, system awakens) with a cadence shift at closure when she decides to stay and continue striking. However, the closure lacks felt cost—her decision to remain and "question every assumption" is thematically resonant but doesn't land a legible personal or social price on the page; the final image asserts transformation without showing what Elara sacrifices or what friction her choice creates.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens without anchoring who/where/when until ~150 words in (the observatory is named, but Elara's present situation and the timeframe remain vague until the young man arrives). The closure unit—Elara teaching the young man to fold coordinates and leave them for others—reads as Earned Stasis or Charged Poise, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; she performs the same ritual she's been performing, without a visible foreclosure or shift. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern-building through repeated imagery), yet the ending does not break or reconfigure the pattern with undeniable pressure; it restates the thesis. The Cost Proof Test fails: no single sentence makes the price legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern-building through cartomancy and a cadence shift in the final paragraph that reweights cultural velocity as the problem. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. However, closure lacks a decisive change or felt cost: Mara describes her insight to Elias, he watches with "understanding slowly crystallizing," and she continues her work—no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The final image ("one patient centimeter at a time, until the ink dried and the storm finally passed") gestures at persistence but doesn't reconfigure stakes or impose a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through the pagoda materialization, erratic dance, and data-core purification, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: "perfection was a poison" reweights the Serene Empire premise with conceptual cost (their suicide note). Orientation anchors (saffron-veil historian, obsidian archive, twilight) land by ~100 words. The closure unit is legible and the lens holds, though the cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt—the historian's transformation is declared ("left the archive changed") more than shown through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and teaches an accumulative-textural lens through the cross-referencing ritual and the shadow's evolution across decades of footage. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow metamorphoses from shroud to wings and lifts the river stone, reweighting hope from loss to guardianship. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt—Elara's night of work does not visibly foreclose an option or extract a personal price, and the resolution hinges on her editorial act without clear resistance or sacrifice that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening lines. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to reconstruction): Elara commits to testify and continue her work, forecloses the path of willful blindness, and the final image of holding the chameleon signals honest care with visible scars. However, the escalation is largely retrospective—most pressure points occurred in the three days before the story opens—and the on-page present consists primarily of reflective cleaning and symbolic object removal rather than a motivated turn that narrows options. The cost (testifying, continuing damaged work) is legible but arrives as summary rather than a scene-driven choice that alters tactics. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (reflection layered with object-handling and environment), but the final deepening is more declared than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (accumulative imagery building toward a situational crystallization) and delivers an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias stops seeking closure and begins witnessing, touching his sister's hand as the hourglass shatters and frost binds them. Orientation anchors (tower, dawn, post-anesthesia) arrive early. However, causality is loose—how the coffee rings "spell coordinates," why the tunnel was sealed, and how the plants communicate telepathically are asserted rather than dramatized, and the meteor's role in displacing the miracle is told in summary. The ending reconfigures his stance, but the conceptual cost (being bound in frost, abandoning closure) is more asserted than felt in bodily or relational terms.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though "when" remains vague beyond "twilight." The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: psychometry deepens through layered images (projectionist's grief, audience heartbreaks, beam of light) and culminates in a conceptual repricing—unused love stored "in the medium that carries image from source to surface." However, the closure lacks felt cost; Elara exits with understanding but no sacrifice or trade-off legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (the realization shifts from physical archive to luminous corridor), satisfying minimal escalation for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: aurora observation accumulates weight through repeated star-charting until the final surrender. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elara rests and receives the returned stardust—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page. The brass sextant and archway anchor who/where/when early enough. One meaningful deepening occurs (surrender as key), but the final image's cost remains asserted ("creativity freed") rather than dramatized through a specific forfeited option or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words. The piece accumulates motifs (dreamlessness, wave functions, the clock, the archive) and the final image—clock placement spreading midnight, archive opening—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the journey with undeniable pressure. Cost is conceptual: Kael becomes "occasionally everywhere," a sentinel rather than a traveler, his dreamless peace purchased by eternal vigilance. One meaningful deepening via recursive imagery holds the lens to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraphs (stray philosopher, Mechanical Rainforest, post-awakening). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered imagery and the repeated translocations until the final gear insertion. However, the closure—inserting the gear and feeling the wild frontier expand—relies on a mechanism introduced early but never constrained or tested in the middle beats. The cost at closure is conceptual (understanding miracles as patterns) but not visibly paid on the page; the network "reknits itself" without dramatized friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the mist-shrouded journey through indirect routes accumulates symbolic weight until the final image reweights Mara's relationship to fear and restraint. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting toward Earned Stasis)—she carries Atlas home unleashed, trusting her own steps, with the star stamp's warmth as tangible cost and covenant. The orientation is slightly delayed (we learn "service dog" and the anxiety context only after the opening image), but the disorientation serves the fog-shrouded atmosphere and resolves quickly enough to avoid penalty. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes the search is for herself, not the dog, which narrows her emotional options and charges the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (bellhop, cobalt fortress, nerve regeneration timeframe) and the accumulative lens is taught early through layered imagery. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he chooses silence and seals the bolt back, foreclosing the path of rebellion with the conceptual cost of accepting isolation. However, the final reversal from "cannot accept" to "choosing silence as gift" happens primarily in summary reflection rather than through a concrete turn that narrows options on the page, weakening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly by the opening paragraph, satisfying the basic test. The closure unit—the pretender unmasked and the library dissolving—occurs on the page, but causality is opaque: the "rune of drift" and "sundering word" are invoked without prior setup of their mechanics or cost, reading as authorial fiat rather than earned consequence. The pretender's downfall is not shaped by his own choices or the titan's tactical sacrifice; the magic simply works when needed. Under a Causal lens (the piece gestures toward cause/effect with "because I solved your riddles" and the ink-fragment assembly), the lack of motivated linkage between the riddles, the rune's activation, and the specific form of unmasking undermines closure validity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors (Elena, station, post-ban Pacific) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory memory (2043 bleaching), the atlas page fragment, data assembly, and tapping rhythm build density toward the insight that navigation requires living memory. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the atlas page shifts from personal keepsake to "record of witness"—and the transmission forecloses her private holding of it with felt cost. One meaningful deepening (data gaps crystallize the social-forgetting thesis) tightens options and charges the final image. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through sensory layering and the stone-circle hum, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mira crystallizes her purpose. Orientation is clear by the opening lines. The closure lands with undeniable pressure ("the lull had transformed into something else entirely"), but the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no forfeited path or visible price is shown on the page, only asserted mood shift. One meaningful deepening (cataloging debris → ritual activation) is present, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the kite script, plant voices, and amber convergence building density toward the unsealing. Closure is a Decisive Change—the embryo released—but the cost is implied rather than legibly dramatized; Mira's smile and the plants' gratitude flatten the price. One meaningful tightening occurs when the kite reveals the thermal sequence, narrowing her options. Causality holds throughout with motivated ellipsis (fifteen years of reconstruction compressed), but the final image lacks the felt or conceptual cost required to enter the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly through Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis evolving into Charged Poise): Elias looks directly at his sister's photograph without flinching, then folds it away to tend the evening watering—a deliberate choice that forecloses paralysis with visible cost (the forever-altered relationship to the memory). The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently from pearl-layering metaphor through the freeze-and-thaw cycle to the final deliberate motion. Orientation anchors early (wind-sculpted pines, cliff, automated lighthouse). One meaningful deepening occurs when the wind's frequency recalls the drone's whine, forcing a confrontation that transforms his relationship to the trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (Mara, lighthouse library, present-tense crisis). The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: thread-untangling and image-layering build toward a reconfigured reality. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she becomes "cartographer of broken things" and the walls expand—but the cost remains abstract. The final image asserts transformation without pointing to a specific on-page sentence where a tangible or felt price is legible, weakening the closure proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation is delayed: we lack clear spatial anchors and immediate stakes until the ink sequence begins well into the piece. The closure—tracker dissolving into "distributed through the moment"—is told in elevated metaphor without demonstrable on-page cost or a legible before/after in his options or stance. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but the final image asserts transformation rather than dramatizing it, and no persistent constraint shapes the ending. The piece reads as a single continuous scene but lacks the meaningful tightening or deepening required for closure under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Causal/Situational hybrid. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph one (who, where, when). The inciting discovery and upload decision create a before/after, but the closure relies on conceptual repricing (seeds vs. tombs, truth melting) rather than on-page dramatized cost; the security alarms arrive thirty seconds later yet Mara's peaceful waiting abstracts the consequence. The causal chain (discovery → upload → spread) is clean, but the final image asserts transformation through metaphor rather than showing tactical or relational change, weakening the felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when); the lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a pattern of refusal crystallizing across Maya's rituals. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the final image reweights the sandbags and her father's pistol through recursive pruning and the promise to persist tomorrow, forecloses the path of violence with visible cost (isolation, ongoing threat), and the lens holds without contradiction. One tightening occurs when the dome shudders and she does not flinch, narrowing options to endurance. Cost is legible in the line "proving peace could grow even in shadows" paired with the recurring exterior threat.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael extracts the spike "now fused with the echo," carrying godhood transliterated into something mortal, while the constellations wander and the garden collapses—options narrow and cost is visible. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, pressure building through density and cadence until the plunge and capture; the piece holds that lens without contradiction, and the closure image reweights the dominant stake with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: journalist's claim → Eleanor's proof by contradiction → decision to publish correction. Orientation anchors appear promptly (observatory, Eleanor, after the call). The closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (destroying wealth to preserve integrity), and the rosewood pen seeding and return charges the final image. However, the escalation compresses most causality into a single night of calculation with minimal on-page friction; the contradiction proof arrives quickly and Eleanor's resolve follows without meaningful obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is swift (who, where, when by line 2). Drive lens is Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: cabinet arrival triggers temporal breach, amber anchors the fold, daughter's cries provide forgiveness, Elara touches her past self. Closure is a Decisive Change (younger Elara turns back) but the cost feels asserted rather than legible—no visible forfeiture or altered future state dramatized on the page. The phrase "collapsing the wave function of regret into a single, bearable truth" declares resolution without showing what Elara loses or what contradictions remain.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story anchors who/where/when early and builds through a pattern of sensing disorder, mapping through sand, and disrupting to restore harmony. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the grotto's acoustic shift from cacophony to harmony), but cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page. The pattern is taught and held, yet the final image of "twilight peace" softens rather than charges the stakes. One meaningful deepening is present but the cost test is barely met.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: retrocognitive fragments cohere into pattern, culminating in the renaming as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly within 120 words. The closure reweights the plaza's meaning and Kael's relationship to trauma with conceptual cost (refusing sanitization, holding pain visible), though the price remains somewhat abstract rather than a visible forfeiture of options or relationships on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (layered echoes, synesthetic imagery, fractured timeline motif building to a resonant final transfer). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Rialto, hedge maze, Julian's ghostly state). The closure—Mara taking the coin, leaving the box cutter, Julian folding into "single satisfied resonance"—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: options crystallized, potential transferred). However, the cost is more asserted than shown: Julian's "fractured timeline now quieter" tells resolution rather than dramatizing what he loses or forecloses. The coin's transfer mechanism (how a spectral object gains "temporal density" to bridge realities) is convenient rather than causally prepared, and Mara's reversal hinges on this unearned device.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation Test: who (Maya), where (studio), and what (recall mission) anchor by line two; no penalty. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through layered description, fractal imagery, and the light-painting documentation rather than because/therefore beats. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image reweights the studio from battlefield to sanctuary and crystallizes the tension between doubt and compassion, but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than a visible forfeiture on the page. The "desperate, silent language of longing" revealed in the spiral placement is a late epiphany that was not set up as a live question, weakening closure necessity. No major causality breaks, but the linkage between Maya's search and her emotional arc is thematic more than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens infers as Accumulative/Textural: the heat-mapping protocol blooms colors, the song emerges, the final golden convergence. Orientation anchors (coastal cave, Kael, sensory mapper) arrive early. However, closure relies on assertion—"the voice of the unknown had finally found its words"—without a decisive image that reweights prior material through visible cost. The "trembling hands" and golden flare describe intensity but do not foreclose an option or crystallize a trade-off legible on the page. The cost remains conceptual and stated rather than felt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.1)
    Orientation remains vague past the 120-word mark: "amber warehouse beneath cliffs" and "hourglass turner" are provided, but the spatial and temporal frame stays atmospheric rather than anchored. The closure unit—shattered jar, dissolved prophecy, upward-falling sand—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted ("shimmering motes of raw possibility") rather than felt as a foreclosed path or visible price. Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates images (buttons, echo, amber dust) but their causal linkage to the prophetic reversal is stated, not dramatized through narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena surrenders the microchip and leaves "with empty hands and a mended soul," crystallizing her shift from running to repair. Cost is conceptual—she relinquishes her last secret—but the final image ("descended...with empty hands") reads as symbolic declaration rather than a choice that forecloses a live tactical option on the page. The Drive Lens is Hybrid (causal setup, accumulative final reprise of "silver hush" and codes), coherent at closure. Orientation is clean by paragraph one. The tightening occurs when Marcus accepts the chip and they write new codes together, but the turn hinges on thematic agreement rather than a because/therefore that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening paragraphs. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds through fog, rain gutters, and ambient cues, culminating in a cadence shift when silence arrives and the coachman boards. The closure reads as Charged Poise—the moment crystallizes permission and reconfigures waiting into movement—with felt cost (decades of layered vows now distilled). One meaningful deepening is present, though the final act is more a fulfillment of readiness than a turn that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens by the midpoint, building density through layered images (lantern glass, sun patterns, fractured timelines, thrumming) that converge at the ending. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (specifically Earned Stasis): Kai's refusal to disturb the hive and her decision to leave the lantern glass reweights her initial question with a visible cost—she departs without answers or honey, accepting the oasis on its own terms. The orientation anchors (Kai, oasis, dawn) land clearly within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "the oasis resisted change not through defiance, but through devotion," which shifts her stance from seeker to witness, and the final act forecloses extraction in favor of acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers symbols (petal drop, bitting gauge, rowing rhythm, lighthouse beam) toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's private tending becomes public guardianship. Closure lands on the page with felt cost—she has left her sanctuary and committed to vigilance—and the final image of the beam's sweep charges prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when she rows to the lighthouse and successfully activates it. Causality is mostly sound, though the bitting gauge's sudden utility for mirror calibration (not locks) stretches plausibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: imagery and reflection accumulate toward a final reweighting. Closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration (she accepts the Sky-Singers' dispersed state and her own independence), but the cost is asserted rather than demonstrated on the page—no visible forfeiture or trade-off materializes. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (Athenaeum balcony, cloud-ocean, Mira). The single tightening (placing the sundial in the circle) occurs but the "brittle piece...snap cleanly away" moment lacks causal grounding in prior resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the nest discovery seeds a pattern that expands through the installation and resolves in the lovers-leaving-offerings image. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis morphing into sanctuary), but cost remains implicit—we're told Elara "rejoined the world" without showing what path was foreclosed or what specific sacrifice the seventeen years of silence demanded on the page. The storm-to-installation sequence compresses months into summary, flattening escalation into a montage rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    The causal lens is clear: Elena decodes signals → discovers entities → designs counter-broadcast → executes sequence → tricksters withdraw. The seventeen-minute countdown and ninety-second hold provide temporal pressure, and the subsonic disruption creates a meaningful reversal. However, the tricksters' withdrawal ("already withdrawing to find easier prey") reads as their choice rather than a forced outcome of Elena's action, which undercuts the closure's earned quality. The cost—community fracture and trust broken—is visible but arrives mostly as summary rather than dramatized consequence that forecloses a path for Elena personally.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal lens holds: organ music stills the walls, allowing movement; when it falters, walls close, forcing the compass strike that locks the gears and permits extraction. Orientation anchors (Maren, broken archway, starlit chamber) arrive early. The closure delivers a Decisive Change—she extracts the key and the walls retreat—with visible cost (her terror quieted by purpose). One meaningful tightening occurs when the music falters and she must act immediately, narrowing options under the established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the quarry setting, ribbon fragment, and portrait work build toward a final reweighting. Closure arrives when Elara discovers the ribbon matches the rival's jacket lining and "the case warmed under her hands," which constitutes a Conceptual Repricing—the cold case is reconfigured as emotionally felt. However, the cost is asserted ("mirrored her own isolation") rather than demonstrated through a specific forfeiture or choice. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (Elara, quarry rim, present investigation anchored by ~80 words). One small causality slip: the "conspiracy that had festered in darkness" and the silent witness emerge without prior setup, reading as convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a causal chain: decode journals → discover prediction → transmit vindication. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines. The closure—Elara transmitting the decoded stanzas and the meteorologist's acknowledgment—constitutes a Decisive Change with visible stakes (reputation restored). However, the cost feels announced rather than dramatically paid; the final paragraph summarizes consequence instead of showing a foreclosed path or immediate price. The drive lens reads as Causal but the climax lands through exposition rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a hybrid lens (accumulative imagery building to a causal turn when Elias raises his fiddle) and delivers an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration: he moves from refusal to play into active reconstruction, with visible cost (bleeding fingers, dissolved glass flake). Orientation anchors arrive within the first third (mountain pullout, five years post-collapse). The escalation from observation to action is clean, though the hitchhiker's vanishing and the scaffold-wrap "map" rely on coincidence to complicate rather than protagonist agency to advance, which keeps this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation anchors promptly (who, where, when by the opening). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density and cadence shifts reweight the father/son parallel across the piece. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias's decision to leave "armed with...knowing" forecloses the hermitage path with visible cost (abandoning the sanctuary). The conceptual price—accepting rather than rejecting lineage—lands on the page in the final paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when he recognizes "both had extracted value from movement," narrowing his self-concept and reweighting the foreign currency from evidence to teaching tool.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece attempts a RR (Resonant Reconfiguration) via Elara's epiphany that "the temple was not a place but a process." However, the closure lacks on-page felt cost—she writes, archives the telegram, and descends with "midnight solace" and "new understanding," but no trade-off or foreclosed path is visible. The orientation is delayed (we learn she's at an observatory tracking stars, but her role as "lucid dream chronicler" and the temple connection remain abstract until mid-piece). One meaningful deepening occurs when she connects stellar pulses to temple inscriptions, but the final image of placing the telegram and descending reads as tidy resolution rather than a reweighting with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (vortex, circles, warlike serenity) toward a final reconfiguration when the orchard settles. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Elara's "sorrow" is declared but not dramatized, and no visible choice or renunciation forecloses a path. The confession's reveal and vortex collapse happen through the seed's action, not Elara's agency, weakening the resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors are present but delayed and ornate: "cobalt glade at dusk" and "root-bound visionary" establish location and condition, though "Tomorrow Accords collapsed" and "premature chronology" require reader assembly. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—imagery and pattern dominate over because/therefore causality. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): they stand at the intersection ready to weave the new covenant, stakes crystallized. Cost is felt ("bound more profoundly") but the decisive action (weaving the covenant) occurs off-page, limiting closure impact. One meaningful deepening (roots release as they commit) is present.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/what by the second sentence (Elias, catacomb orchard, bartered destinies) and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (roots/bones, burned card's return, fox-fire corridors) until the final moment crystallizes his transformation into guardian. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias becomes part of the orchard, his reckless idealism "finally bearing fruit," accepting that grief cannot be traded away but can be shared—a stance crystallization with visible cost (his physical binding, his years surrendered). The cost is legible in "trammel oneself to grief was its own form of freedom" and the image of him feeding "the next desperate heart." One friction: the card's mechanics (how it returned, what the tree's recognition means) remain slightly abstract, relying on atmosphere over causal specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (quarry office trailer, Marcus, post-failure context). The piece operates under a Situational lens: pressure accumulates through the authentication request, forcing Marcus to crystallize his stance between precision and mercy. Closure lands as Charged Poise—he chooses the narrative that serves mercy, a renunciation of rigid expertise with felt cost ("confidently uncertain"). The drive holds, but the ending tilts toward articulated theme ("his purpose wasn't to authenticate the past, but to witness it") rather than pure dramatized pressure, slightly softening the closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates symbolic density (cuneiform, seed, magnetic fields) toward a conceptual repricing where Elias becomes the text he translates. Closure participates on the page through his dissolution into the aurora. However, orientation is significantly delayed—who Elias is and his precise relationship to Arishti emerge only through retrospective exposition past the 120-word mark, creating initial disorientation that doesn't serve closure. Cost is conceptual (his bodily dissolution) but the mechanics of choice remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a before (wandering identities) and after (crystallized records), and the librarian's task completes on the page, satisfying basic closure. However, cost remains asserted rather than felt—"excess fear escapes" and identities "surrender their restlessness" without on-page friction or visible forfeiture. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (atrium, librarian, moon, tides by ~80 words). No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the smelting proceeds as expected without reversal or tactical adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors orientation cleanly (inspector, geode chamber, inspection role) and builds pressure through layered discoveries (pearl, shell, confessions). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara crowns the stalagmite and light erupts, reweighting her isolation against the oligarch's abandoned dreams with felt cost (deleting records, ritual commitment). However, the oligarch's confessions do the heavy causal lifting off-page, and the final radiance feels more stated ("latent radiance erupted") than dramatized through a choice that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands on the page with felt cost: Maya commits to visiting the coordinates, crystallizing her willingness to face guilt and allow grief to transform (Charged Poise with conceptual repricing via the river-silt metaphor). The accumulative/textural lens holds: sensory return → graffiti discovery → accordion playing → resolution to visit the site. One meaningful deepening occurs when the graffiti reframes her guilt as navigable current rather than insurmountable dam. The orientation anchors arrive early (Maya, station, post-medication timeframe) and the causal thread remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph, satisfying orientation. However, closure is weak: the protagonist achieves exactly what she sought without visible cost or a meaningful choice that forecloses a path. The watch's backward-spinning mechanism and the confidence man's backstory introduce causal threads but do not constrain the final outcome—she simply completes the documentation and is "accepted." Under an inferred Accumulative lens, the layering of mist-library imagery does not build to a decisive reweighting or renunciation; the ending affirms the premise without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Causal-leaning Hybrid: Elara receives warnings from plants and coffee stains, then acts to propagate the violin's truth through roots. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost (the violin melts, her career endangered, truth distributed) that lands on the page. One structural slip: the empire's Ministry claim is stated as future fact without dramatized uncertainty, flattening what could be a tighter pressure point. The final image (empty case, sorrow, taste of the future) reconfigures the opening stakes with felt cost, satisfying closure requirements under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first two paragraphs; no penalty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers sensory detail and repeats the chip/aurora/soul-preservation motif to build density. Closure occurs when Elara places the chip into the archive and prepares for the next arrival, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—her refusal to cease her vigil forecloses rest. Cost is conceptual (eternal labor) but legible in "forever standing watch," satisfying the closure gate. One meaningful deepening (the chip absorbs the dancer's pattern) tightens the premise. However, no on-page reversal or tactical shift narrows options; the process unfolds as described from the outset, capping upside.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands on-page with visible cost: Elias plants the hairpin, releasing his daughter's soul into the cycle, and a sapling emerges as confirmation. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens—pressure builds through reflection and micro-choices (climbing, descending, studying the pin) culminating in the planting action that reweights the opening stake. Orientation anchors (grotto, Elias, three centuries) arrive early enough. The escalation is primarily textural and contemplative rather than event-driven, but the final image reconfigures the dominant question of finding contentment with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the cloak's weight builds, the mirror shard returns with shifted meaning, and the final image (cloak unraveling into mist) reconfigures the protagonist's stance. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, dawn, post-campfire) arrive by the second paragraph, meeting the test. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elias prepares to offer ambiguity rather than false certainty—but the cost remains oblique; the cartographer's return is projected ("would return at noon") rather than enacted, weakening the on-page consequence. One meaningful tightening occurs (unhooking the cloak), yet the sequence lacks a decisive narrowing of options with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the researcher's trance-state observations layer toward a final conceptual repricing of his regression as methodology rather than curse. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening lines. The closure effect—reweighting his vanishing as planted wisdom—lands on the page, but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than felt in action or forfeited option. No meaningful tightening or pressure shift occurs; the piece accumulates density without a cadence break or reversal that narrows his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the first third—but the disorientation is pattern-taught (centuries, dust, geological time) and pays off at closure, so no penalty applied. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the skimmer achieves his aim by becoming motionless, forecloses the path of movement, and the pulse finds rest. Cost is conceptual and felt (he will be buried, becoming an artifact himself), legible in the final image. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered imagery (dust, bone, echoes) builds density until the final cadence shift reweights stillness as travel. One meaningful deepening is present. However, causality is thin—beats are linked by thematic association and accumulation rather than because/therefore, which fits the lens but limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, held through closure. The piece deepens via pattern (lingering luminance, accommodating impossibilities, unstrapping) and a cadence shift at the ending that reweights Elias's worth without stating a moral. Orientation anchors (Elias, Spire, dimming shift) arrive by the second paragraph; no penalty. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with Charged Poise): Elias chooses to become part of the architecture rather than return, and the final image (figure in mist, stone being shaped) reconfigures his inadequacy into purposeful persistence. Cost is legible: he forfeits certification and bodily survival. One meaningful deepening (keystone discovery → unstrapping → ghostly persistence) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the sunken-ship library and sky-lantern convergence are legible early. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding his true purpose) with conceptual cost implied—twelve years spent maintaining surface lamps to reach this single moment. The cost is visible in "twelve years of night shifts" but the final beat prioritizes revelation over a decision that narrows options, slightly softening the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early and holds it through closure; the backwards prophecy framework is taught by mid-story and the final alignment sequence delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elena's action triggers the Big Bang she witnessed. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two sentences. Cost is conceptually legible—her doubt preserved "like a fossil in the expanding amber"—but the emotional or relational price remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (reaper, observatory dome, post-discovery dusk). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (wax cylinders, atlas monsters, scattered light) toward a final reconfiguration where grief becomes cartographic tool. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (scythe repurposed as pen, named fears positioned as constellations) with conceptual cost—accepting permanent separation rather than resurrection. One tightening occurs when the beam strikes the page and crystallizes the monsters, narrowing his function from soul-collector to sorrow-witness. Minor causality slip: how the astronomers' light-sacrifice enables his specific ritual is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The piece accumulates pressure through measured drips and Elara's patient reconstruction, culminating in the bell's strike and the water's return—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the impossible into possible. Cost is legible: her ongoing vigil and the shift from "last fish" finality to fragile renewal. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: drought exposes the town, photographs accumulate across thirty yards, and the final image of Elias walking up with his satchel reconfigures his role from maintenance warden to archivist. Closure lands as Charged Poise—he carries "the weight of resurrection," crystallizing his stance with conceptual cost (the town's history now his burden). Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One deduction: the photographs' arrangement "as if placed by careful design" hints at agency never dramatized, a setup without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two sentences, satisfying the test. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery (waterfall, starlings, orchard, crystal) and converges in the final transformation. However, the closure unit—Elara's integration—is told rather than shown; the crystal glows, the horse transforms, but no on-page decision or renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing (the philosopher's stone reframed as a state), but the cost remains abstract ("balance she had sought") rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or consequence. Escalation is present but operates through sensory accumulation, not causality or a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Inferred lens: Causal with Accumulative/Textural accents (pattern-seeking, soundless echo motifs). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly within 120 words. The closure—Elara's rest after catching Kael—qualifies as Earned Stasis: the burden is carried through to dawn with visible cost (three-hour wait, breath held, fingers still resting on the buckle). The cost is felt but quiet; the final image reweights "watcher's burden" and "trust intact" without overt dramatization. One meaningful tightening occurs when she revises the clip angle to avoid the rogue thermal, narrowing options causally.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure unit—Maya weeping, integrating the clone's memories, feeling afraid and alive—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (a shift from numbness to sensation). However, the cost remains largely asserted through metaphor ("hollow reed," "empty corridors flooded") rather than a concrete forfeiture or tactical constraint visible on the page. The history-rewriting frame complicates but does not causally drive the protagonist's final integration.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (post-death echo chamber, Elias as phantom). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pull cord handle dissolves into silver dust, joining the off-key wind permanently, and laughter reaches the family—a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Cost is conceptual (Elias fades into memory) but legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs (maceration of grief into usable tenderness). However, the entire sequence unfolds without reversal or constraint; the pull cord mechanism succeeds on first attempt, and no on-page obstacle tests tactics, weakening escalation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who (fox-headed librarian), where (frozen garden), and basic situation early, satisfying the Orientation Test. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the guardian refuses the pendant's call and commits to the liminal space, interiorizing the call itself. However, the cost is asserted rather than dramatically visible—no on-page action or forfeiture shows what she gives up by not answering her birth-dimension, and the final image ("slept…as a native of the in-between") declares arrival without felt sacrifice. Under the accumulative lens, the pattern of interiorization and boundary language does cohere, but the closure lacks the sharp cadence shift or reweighting that would make the before/after undeniable with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: successive approximation builds density toward the crystallization moment. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the lattice forms, but the cost feels asserted ("evolved beyond his own narrative of failure") rather than demonstrated through a visible forfeiture or constraint. The piece anchors who/where/when early (Marcus, ember nexus, twilight) and teaches its pattern of iterative refinement. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marcus realizes he must "release potential as vessel of transformation" rather than preserve function, which narrows his approach and leads to the final crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative texture: Elara's decision to invert protocol drives the discovery. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit—detecting protostellar ignition within galactic death—lands on the page with conceptual resonance, but the felt cost remains abstract: "trembling hands" and "vindicated" tell emotion rather than showing a foreclosed path or tangible sacrifice. The "by discarding assumptions" method appears suddenly in paragraph four without prior setup of what assumptions she wrestled with, creating a mini-causality gap. One meaningful tightening occurs (lunar perigee peak forcing the attempt), sufficient for this length, but the cost at closure is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (spectral imagery, radio frequencies, convergence pattern), but the piece never teaches its pattern early or imposes cost. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (ferry, deckhand, grotto), satisfying the test. The closure unit—Elias becoming "permanently transient"—reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the conceptual cost remains abstract declaration rather than an on-page image that reweights prior material. The ending tells us he's changed and "will be ready" rather than showing a decisive constraint or felt price in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images and philosophical vocabulary toward a final transformation. Orientation is delayed—who Elara is and what practical stakes she faces remain vague past the 120-word mark, though the disorientation effect is intentional and partially pays off in the dissolution ending. Closure takes the form of Conceptual Repricing: the gallery and Elara merge, reweighting the premise of architect-as-medium. However, the cost is asserted ("she did not bleed because she had already become part of the pattern") rather than felt through a specific forfeiture or struggle, weakening the resonance. The because/therefore linkage between weaving and transformation is implied by metaphor rather than dramatized causality.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: atmospheric density builds through repeated stellar imagery and the anchor chain link as organizing symbol, culminating in the expedition order. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the decision crystallizes options with felt cost (leaving the benthic prison vs. remaining in starvation), though the cost remains more implied than viscerally demonstrated on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. The cause-effect chain is thin: Mara calculates, teaches, then orders departure without meaningful resistance or complication to test the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains spatial coherence. The closure—Elena leading Thomas up—reads as Decisive Change, but the cost is vague: what does she forfeit or risk by this rescue? The hearing-aid mechanism drives discovery, yet Thomas's survival and the killer's decades-long concealment strain credibility without dramatized resistance or complication. The inferred lens is Causal, but the because/therefore chain from "assure Mrs. Gable" to "rescue Thomas" pivots on convenience rather than pressure-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates phase-transition imagery and pressure toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration (her claustrophobia shattering, becoming part of the signal). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The ninety-minute tidal window creates a constraint, though its mechanical pressure is asserted more than dramatized—we never feel the clock ticking during her descent. Closure lands with a felt cost (she emerges alone, carrying the silence), but the researchers' "migration" completes off-page, softening the final image's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early through the ink-pattern method and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (integration as Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise) at closure with conceptual cost: Elara stops counting, accepting rhythm without proof. Orientation anchors arrive within the first third (observatory, opal dome, midnight, post-static silence). The causal chain—ink patterns enable defragmentation, shard refracts light, ghost reorganizes and integrates—holds cleanly, though the mystical mechanics rely on atmosphere more than dramatized cause-effect linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the diamond's curse dissolves, language preserved as resonance)—but cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than felt or visible on the page. The single-scene continuous structure fits scope, and the textural density increases toward the ending, but the final image lacks a sharp before/after that makes personal cost unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: "Dr. Elena Voss" and "underground garden" establish who and where, but "after the missing return changed" remains opaque past the 120-word mark without dramatized payoff (−0.4). The closure unit—Elena's metamorphosis and laughter—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("becoming the very cryptid she had sought") rather than shown as a specific forfeiture of agency, relationship, or knowledge. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density of imagery around metamorphosis), but causality is weak: the phone call triggers transformation without prior escalation of stakes or a because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the statue catching a blossom reweights the mechanical/organic tension with visible cost (the orchard's geometry dissolves, the sky-bridge becomes unstable). Orientation anchors arrive late—"who" is named in line one but "where" (sky-bridge over orchard) and "what" (statues enforce efficiency) emerge gradually across the first ~150 words without deliberate disorientation paying off at closure, triggering a −0.4 penalty. The escalation is a single intensification (music wakes trees, statues pause, orchard erupts) that fits the lens, but causality feels elliptical: why does "resonantly soft" music bypass alarms when the statues detect "disturbance"?

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed: who/where/when anchor only coalesces around paragraph three when "mailman," "arcade," and "tonight" converge; the opening ~120 words offer atmosphere without grounding (−0.3). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through linked absences and the thunderstorm release, culminating in the final image of "empty spaces in their hearts." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Marek completes his duty and retreats, preserving the secret—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; the final paragraph tells us "some borders could only be crossed by those willing to carry storms" without dramatizing a new price paid tonight. One tightening occurs (the three-minute chaos window), but the ending restates rather than reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (abandoned circus train, Elias, dawn) land within the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias holds the halo fragment under the sky, understanding his silence was a song all along, with the cost legible in thirteen years of voicelessness now reweighted. The piece accumulates motifs—carousel, silence, fragment, song—and the final image recharges them without a decisive external change. One minor slip: the narrative occasionally drifts into exposition about what Elias "understood" rather than showing the realization through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (architectural imagery, scarf-as-motif), but no tightening or deepening occurs; Elena moves through space without narrowing options or encountering resistance. Closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (reawakening the story) but the "vibration in the silk" and the narrative stirring are told, not dramatized with visible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~150 words, borderline but no penalty applied. No meaningful escalation: Elena calculates, steps, wraps, succeeds—each beat is additive summary without pressure or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the closure lacks on-page cost: the dream "stepped into the watercolor" without resistance or price. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late—Elara's role and the archipelago's nature remain hazy past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The "runaway dream" premise is told rather than dramatized in causally linked beats; the capture unfolds as summary narration ("she began to paint," "she worked faster") rather than visible turns. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence at closure shows what Elara sacrificed or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the spinning ritual, ribbon ignition, and idea release, culminating in a cadence shift at "some locks opened not with force, but with the willingness to hold space." The closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights vulnerability as currency—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page forfeiture or tactical constraint makes the price felt in Vey's stance. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the second paragraph, avoiding penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: Elena's study of the constellations enables her to understand the ring's pattern, which allows the compass placement that breaks the cycle. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The closure is a Decisive Change—Lila returns, the ring withers—with visible cost (thirty years of study, the destruction of the ring itself). One meaningful escalation (wading into the ring after decades of observation) tightens options. The cost is legible, though the final beat's speed compresses the weight of reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with purposeful compression. Closure lands through Earned Stasis (Elara walking forward, no longer retreating) paired with the child's Decisive Change (stepping onto the floor), and the cost is legible: "never look back unless you need to remember how far you've come." The three-week ellipsis is motivated and tightens pressure. One cost-proof test: "two archives of resilience stepping into the world that had once exiled them both" makes the conceptual price undeniable without overstating it.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but escalation is minimal—Elian encounters gray encroachment, performs a ritual, and succeeds without complication. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), yet cost is conceptual only; no on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses options. Orientation is delayed: the parapet and waterfall are named early, but "weaving between worlds" and the heirloom seed's function emerge gradually without a clear threshold by ~120 words. The causality is soft; the gray lands threaten but never test Elian's resolve in a way that narrows his options.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira becomes the net, holding silence so others can rest, with conceptual cost legible in "absolute stillness" and her waiting state. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what). The accumulation—twelve ghosts released across four hours, silence filling her mask—creates a meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake. Cost is conceptual and felt in the final image, though the physical price (what she forfeits by becoming a silence-repository) remains implied rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors promptly (who, occupation, object by opening lines). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density increases through archival investigation, film comparison, excavation, and chapel discovery, culminating in a decision to preserve silence. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she leaves the map torn, foreclosing completeness to honor wonder—and the cost (choosing incompletion over mastery) is legible in the final image. Escalation reads as deepening understanding rather than narrowing options, which fits the lens, though the final renunciation could carry sharper tension if prior beats had established a professional or client pressure to complete the restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Julian surfaces having witnessed "the beautiful mathematics of surrender" with the transmission recorded but the globe left below, crystallizing his understanding of letting go. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, building through layered images of depth, pressure, and release. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (Julian, Demeter wreck, sixty meters down). One tightening occurs when he decodes the globe and hears the captain's message, which reweights his descent from salvage mission to philosophical discovery with felt cost (he could extract the globe but chooses not to).

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the first paragraph, satisfying orientation. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the encoding sequence and graffiti activation build density toward the ghost's physical manifestation and map reveal. However, closure lacks legible cost; the ghost "blooms across stones" and Elara receives a map to other courtyards without visible trade-off, foreclosed option, or felt price. The final image offers expansion rather than a reweighting with pressure, reading more as reward than reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: the elevator's physical ascent structures a parallel psychological deepening as Elara decodes both cipher and captain. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the opening lines. The closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara inherits the captain's methodology with visible cost—she now stands in his position, aware of the "particular anguish and unexpected joy" awaiting her, the diary "tucked securely against her ribs" signaling acceptance of burden. One tightening occurs when the goggles unlock the diary, narrowing her understanding and foreclosing naive readings of the captain's death.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural (lyric observation layered toward a conceptual repricing). Orientation is clear early. The closure unit—"The void remembers. The string breaks so the sky can learn its shape"—attempts Conceptual Repricing but remains abstract; the cost is declared ("necessary severance," "finally unspooled") rather than dramatized through a concrete on-page choice or renunciation that forecloses a live option. The piece accumulates poetic density but the final image (asleep clutching twine, rescued at dawn) diffuses rather than charges the pressure. No meaningful tightening or deepening alters her stance; she drifts philosophically from beginning to end.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Elara in the Great Oak Library, night before demolition). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered detail (coin indentations, pigment formulas, fractal strokes) and the closure crystallizes as Charged Poise—she walks away as the engines roar, the sky now "fractally precise, eternal in the limits of her art." Cost is felt in the loss of the physical library and the finality of her departure, though the prophetic framing ("the exact shades she had anticipated") slightly softens the stakes by guaranteeing success before the wrecking ball strikes. One meaningful deepening occurs as she discovers "how much detail her damaged visual cortex could process before the patterns dissolved into meaningless noise."

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is delayed—the antique airship context, Elara's apprentice role, and seventeen-day solitude are established within the opening paragraph, but the spatial anchor (observation deck) and her task (maintaining charts) arrive piecemeal across the first ~150 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the airship transforms from "vessel of solitude" to "bridge to revelation") but the cost is implied rather than dramatized on the page: no competing option is foreclosed, no visible sacrifice made. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (clues accumulate toward a discovery), yet the final "complete route" arrives without tightening pressure or a trade-off that reweights prior material. The turn feels declared rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through escalating imagery (frost-rimed door → permafrost staircase → hall of mirrors → pedestal) and the closure reconfigures the opening search into "keeper of rhythms." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second sentence. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara departs with wisdom rather than mere technique), but the cost remains abstract: no village elder doubted her, no alternative path was foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The mirrors "shudder and rotate" without Elara making a consequential choice; the mechanism self-assembles, reducing agency at the climax. One meaningful deepening occurs (technique → wisdom), but it lacks on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The closure image—Mara understanding "some hauntings were simply love"—offers thematic repricing but the conceptual cost remains diffuse; the nebula's creation succeeds without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The causal chain (chalk messages → star charts → collective effort → nebula) reads as accumulative instruction rather than pressure-driven escalation. No meaningful tightening occurs; the problem is solved cooperatively without a trade-off that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode: imagery and density build toward a lyric finale. Orientation is delayed—who Elara is and what the lighthouse mechanism does emerges through abstract description rather than concrete anchors by ~120 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara completes her centuries-long ritual, the clock stops, and her lullaby continues—an endurance with felt cost (her own dissolution into "silver stardust"). However, the cost is asserted through metaphor rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or tactical shift on the page. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies; the ambiguous lens (lyric-accumulative with causal claims) weakens mid-range coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drive lens is causal: Elara discovers the blueprint, decodes its logic, assembles the nut trail, and the travelers escape. The closure—watching them reach safety, then planning to resume her vigil—is a valid Earned Stasis with visible cost (exhaustion, ongoing isolation). The orientation is delayed slightly but anchor arrives by ~150 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mechanical birds force her behind cover and she must use the vibration plate, raising stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph one). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: grief loosens through layered observations of divergence-and-reconnection patterns. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elena's final notebook sketch and turn toward the trail reconfigure her stance on separation with felt cost (three years of regret reweighted). The cost is visible in "for the first time since the funeral, she felt the separation...dissolve" but remains primarily emotional realization rather than a choice that forecloses a competing path. One meaningful deepening occurs when the foam patterns teach her that "isolation is merely a loop in the composition."

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a situational lens (Elara's bounded exploration within parole constraints) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: she crosses into the white room, abandoning vendor identity for "the silence between words." Cost is conceptual—freedom forfeited, servitude left behind—but remains abstract rather than felt in embodied consequence. Orientation anchors arrive late (who/where/when coalesce only after the opening sentence's lyric density), applying a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The causal chain from measurement to incision to threshold is more thematic than because/therefore linked; the measurements never constrain a prior tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a coherent accumulative/textural lens: Kael's journey from fortress to pavilion to emergence reweights her relationship with stored remorse. Orientation anchors (desert fortress, dawn, Kael at parapet) arrive promptly. The closure unit—Kael emerging with steady hands and "smooth, rounded flavor of forgiveness"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted metaphorically ("subsume ton after ton") rather than made visceral through a specific forfeiture or concrete consequence that alters her options. The causal chain (tidal pools → excavation → subsumption → emergence) holds, but the middle beat's escalation is primarily descriptive.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story presents a linear sequence—climb, position weight, sing, elevators reconnect—without meaningful reversal or narrowing of options. Closure relies on declared success ("successfully constructed bridges") rather than an on-page image that reconfigures prior material with felt cost. The cuckoo weight's "final resonant clang" is asserted to seal the covenant, but no dramatized resistance, failure, or sacrifice makes the cost legible. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (clock tower role and valley context arrive late), triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation is severely delayed—who Elena is, where exactly she stands, and what concrete problem she faces remain vague through the opening third. The piece accumulates atmospheric imagery but lacks clear causal linkage: the mirror's adjustment at thirty-three degrees, her mother's unlived career, and the "forced synaptic plasticity" appear as declarative claims rather than dramatized turns that narrow options. The ending asserts transformation ("the transformation completed itself") without showing a decisive change in circumstance, relationship, or knowledge with visible cost. Under any inferred lens, the closure unit is conceptually asserted rather than dramatized with on-page consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: world-building density accrues until the final image (combinations memorized, seed pocketed). Closure occurs when Elara retrieves the sequences and secures a seed for the next cycle, reweighting her stance from seeker to custodian. Cost is gestured at ("next inversion stole her chance") but remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture or visible price is dramatized in the final beat. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, and the threshold-effects mechanic is established, but the ending reads more as mission-accomplished than a felt reconfiguration with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Elara, siskin alder grove, post-Hush dawn) arrive early. Escalation proceeds through deepening engagement—fissure analysis, bow preparation, first hum—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the subsonic note, the alder's groan, the world remembering). Cost is felt emotionally (tears) but not transactional; no prior path is visibly foreclosed. The lens holds, and the closure image reweights the premise, though the price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the magnetic nexus, recurring stone, and Eclipse Covenant accumulate meaning until the final image reweights them. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Castian's placement of the final piece "to begin it again, differently" and the stone splitting crystallize options and reconfigure the covenant without a decisive external act. Cost is conceptual (exile as preparation, the covenant postponed not destroyed) and legible in the final image. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening lines, and the lens holds without contradiction. One minor slip: the mechanics of "correlating disturbances" and moving pieces "along curved trajectories" remain somewhat opaque, but the stakes and final reweighting are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when early enough, and the clasp-opening moment provides a structural turn. However, the closure operates as a demonstration of Elio's existing belief system rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost; he achieves exactly what he intended without complication. The Accumulative/Textural lens is implied but the final cataloging beat does not reweight prior stakes—it confirms them. Cost is asserted ("proof that peace was not the absence of sound") but not legible as a forfeiture or pressure shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening lines and follows a clear causal arc: retrieve seed → interpret doodles → plant at the correct hollow. The closure image (germination detected by smell) offers a modest Decisive Change—proof of success—but the cost remains abstract and future-deferred; Elara "will return daily" and "will suffer" when the bloom arrives, so the visible price at closure is minimal. The drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative/textural elements, but the ending tilts toward summary reflection rather than a charged final image that reweights prior material. One substantive tightening occurs (finding the hollow via the map), meeting minimum escalation for this length, yet the final beat feels more like confirmation than reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines, and the one-hour gravity window provides a clear structural container. Causality operates in a guided-tour mode: Kael navigates to the convergence point, finds the artifact, downloads its knowledge, and departs—each step follows because/therefore logic but lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing (resilience as continuity, encoded in geology), but the cost remains abstract; no on-page sacrifice or foreclosed path makes the price felt. The inferred lens is Causal with accumulative flavor, but the ending reconfigures meaning without dramatizing what Kael loses or risks to carry that resonance forward.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal/Accumulative hybrid (causal investigation converging toward accumulative pattern recognition). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya's understanding crystallizes into "precise geometry of tragedy" with visible cost (the silence becomes less absolute, filled with predictable currents). The piece suffers mild orientation debt—"three days ago" and the investigator role anchor by ~100 words, but the inciting rupture and Maya's specific mandate remain vague until paragraph two. One meaningful tightening occurs (tracing wind channels backward to understand Chen's fate), and the final image reweights the opening silence with new legibility. Cost is conceptual (obsessive documentation as the price of foresight) rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late (~180 words for clear spatial grounding) and the Drive Lens remains ambiguous—hovering between Accumulative/Textural (aurora imagery, bell-ringing ritual) and Causal (sculptor's chisel as trigger) without committing. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing (wonder encoded in the electromagnetic field) but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no on-page consequence shows what Elara forfeited or risked. The sculptor's chisel "completes her circuit" through coincidence, not protagonist agency, undercutting causality. Applying Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and lens ambiguity (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive quickly (Thunder-echo range, three winters post-failure, talus slopes) and the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: driftwood markers accumulate phosphorescence, the flute's notes "fall into the dry air like stones into deep water," and the final image attempts to reweight the opening silence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—penance transformed into craft), but cost remains asserted ("her penance transformed into craft") rather than legible in a concrete action or forfeiture. The ghost-scape vision and the correction sequence unfold without meaningful tightening of options or a visible trade-off that narrows her path.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph and follows an Accumulative lens: density of metaphor and borrowed-personality imagery builds toward the final equation and the cartographer's consumption. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Elara achieves her theorem but at the undeniable cost of hollowing another soul—and the halo's "cold, precise light" reweights her quest. However, the cartographer's transformation happens in summary ("became only another font") rather than a visible, felt moment, weakening cost legibility and capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The accumulative/textural lens is signaled early (routine → transformation, seeds germinating) and held through the ending's bloom image. However, the closure relies on conceptual repricing (wonder made routine into legend) without legible on-page cost—Elias loses anxiety but gains capability without trade-off or foreclosed path. The archivist encounter and plant emergence feel convenient rather than causally earned by prior pressure, weakening the RR claim.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first 120 words: Elara, quartz arbor, "today." The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: frost patterns map emotional residue, the prism refracts stored grief, and the final sublimation releases the car's burden—a Resonant Reconfiguration (the car "freed from the weight of absorbed mourning"). Cost is conceptual and legible in the final image: doubt lifts, the car is lighter. One meaningful deepening occurs when the frost sublimates and the prism grows hot, reweighting her theory. No causality breaks, but the closure feels inevitably arrived at rather than earned by a narrowing choice, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (amber beads, puzzle edges, blood, tears) toward a final reconfiguration where Maya dissolves into the weave. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she sacrifices herself to send the message), and the cost is legible in the transparency/dissolution image. However, causality between beats is often elided—how the puzzle edges function as shuttles, why blood and tears supply "adhesion" and "salt to fix the dye," and what "raveling silence" mechanically does are asserted rather than demonstrated. The orientation anchor (who, where, when) arrives piecemeal across the first third; by ~120 words we know "Maya," "orchard," and "seven decades," but the inciting puzzle-box discovery occurs later, delaying narrative traction. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the final unraveling of self), satisfying minimum scope, but the elided mechanics and diffuse opening reduce confidence that every prior image earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph and follows a causal sequence: discovery of silk → descent → barter ritual → restoration. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the seeds awaken, the arches stabilize, and Elara emerges fulfilled without any legible price paid on the page. The final image ("no longer merely a blacksmith") asserts transformation rather than dramatizing a foreclosed option or undeniable loss. Under a Causal lens, the "bartered awakenings" premise promises exchange with stakes, but the narrative delivers success without dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a Conceptual Repricing closure: Elara's realization that "weight was not a burden to be discarded but a coordinate to be honored" reweights her mentor's silence and her own role. Orientation is delayed—"who" and baseline reality anchor only after the green shard appears—but the disorientation serves the cyclical-spontaneous premise. The causal chain from discovery (mentor sabotaged the launch) to choice (document rather than redirect) is present, but the cost of that choice remains conceptual and asserted ("she too would withhold truths") rather than viscerally dramatized with a visible forfeiture on the page. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a conceptual-repricing ending, held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation anchors quickly (Elara, lighthouse, dusk delivery). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (extinguished lamp, cairns, sea glass, ghosts) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she seals the jar and builds a new cairn, crystallizing her stance to protect silence rather than send the letter. Cost is visible: she forecloses direct connection to preserve anonymous communion. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands her motivation ("to bottle the feeling of safety") and acts on it, altering the cairn arrangement and the viewer (the ghost) at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but the causal chain is abstract: Kael "steers" light through total internal reflection to resurrect tactile memory, yet no on-page obstacle or reversal tests this intent. The ending image (dawn with texture, shadows released) asserts transformation rather than dramatizing a felt cost or foreclosed path. Closure reads as thematic declaration without a decisive change in options or knowledge that the reader can trace through prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors within the opening lines (dye master, obsidian bench, three weeks post-surgery, floating tea house). The accumulative/textural lens holds: sun-trail tracking builds density toward the epiphany that porosity magnetizes stories, and the final wing-release reweights the opening question with a shift from seeking control to embracing receptivity. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the dye master's stance crystallizes) with conceptual cost legible in her acceptance of fragility. The causal chain from observation → insight → release is clean, though the middle section's reflective loops slightly dilute forward pressure before the ending sharpens focus.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors arrive promptly (labyrinth, night shift, grief vials). The accumulative lens holds through dream-mapping beats, but closure lacks visible cost: Elara completes her task and achieves epiphany without forfeiting options or enduring friction. The pin-drop moment ("at the moment a pin was heard") promises a pivot but delivers only cognitive realization, not a choice that narrows tactics. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration via conceptual repricing of maintenance-as-worship, but the felt price remains off-page or implied rather than dramatized in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual builds in density and the dawn's arrival reconfigures the mirror world's state. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when remain abstract past the 120-word mark, though the pattern is consistent enough to avoid severe penalty. The closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the endless night recedes, cyclical time returns), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt: no live option is foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The "constructed miracle" reweights the premise, yet the final image lacks the friction or sacrifice that would charge it with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers nested paradoxes and charged repetition (the invitation, the mistake, the seeker) toward a final image that reweights "staying while leaving." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Elias crystallizes his stance by placing the invitation on the threshold and retreating, forecloses direct human contact with visible action, and the young woman's tears confirm the pattern's repetition. Cost is conceptual and relational—he remains alone yet infinitely connected—legible in the final paragraph's explicit articulation of paradox. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias recognizes "errors were merely doors disguised as walls," which reframes his seventeen-year tenure and narrows his options to this single, paradoxical act.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a clear accumulative lens: Mara plants, cultivates, and finally shares the harvest in a communal meal that reweights the bakery's absence. Orientation anchors (Mara, overgrown palace courtyard, post-bakery closure) arrive early. The closure—serving bread pudding made from the preserved loaf and guerrilla wheat—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "tenuous absolution" crystallizes the community's new stance toward loss). Cost is present but subtle: the fragility of the garden, the illicit nature of the work, the acknowledgment that "absolution was not a state but a practice." One meaningful deepening occurs when the eating becomes a communal act of resistance. However, the final paragraph drifts into summary ("she tended her garden...teaching the city") rather than holding the charged moment, slightly dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (frequencies, vows, the slide's warmth) building to a Conceptual Repricing at closure where measurement itself is reweighted as an act of love and witness. The cost is conceptual and elegiac—archives full but hands empty, preservation without salvation—legible in "the blank slide like a prayer." One meaningful deepening occurs when the Fading accelerates and Elara increases sampling rate, tightening time pressure and reweighting her ministry from decades to hours.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (pier market), and goal (record betrayal) early. The drive lens reads Causal: Mara positions herself, winds the fob, captures the coordinates—a because/therefore chain. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (evidence secured before sunrise) with visible cost (she must reach her father before the lieutenant realizes). However, the escalation is thin: she circles, feigns drunkenness, retreats—beats that repeat the same tactic without meaningful tightening until the lieutenant simply delivers his lines. The Cost proof test is marginal: the final image mentions urgency and the fob's weight, but the felt price on Mara—what she personally forfeits or endures—is told more than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story presents a conceptual premise (weather-bearers, forest elections, emergent compass) but no causal linkage drives Elara's arrival at understanding. The "forest election" announces its decision without prior escalation or stakes legible to the reader; the thunder-bearer's touch on the ring triggers Elara's transformation via proximity rather than choice. No meaningful tightening occurs—Elara stands, tastes atmospheric changes, and is told the answer by exposition-bearing figures. The closure image ("She was the emergent compass now") is a label claiming transformation without demonstrating the before/after cost required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.4)
    Orientation anchors are present early. The closure unit—Elara stepping through the tunnel to become "pioneer"—lacks visible cost on the page; she abandons a life described as miserable with no dramatized loss or trade-off, reading as convenient escape rather than Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. The watermark reveal and lock-repair sequence depend on late rule introduction (numbers as repair instructions) that solves a problem without prior setup, breaking causal linkage. Drive lens is ambiguous: the opening suggests Accumulative/Textural but the middle relies on Causal problem-solving, and closure reads like wished-for transformation without the cost anchoring Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a causal lens: map fragments → coordinates → vault → letters. Orientation is established early (Aurelia, greenhouse city, post-drought). The closure unit—finding the vault and reading honest letters—lands on the page, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt; no visible price is paid for the journey itself. The journey feels more like discovery than transformation, and the final image (preparing to transcribe) gestures toward future action rather than reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    The piece establishes orientation adequately (who, where, when by ~150 words) but lacks a clear closure effect with legible cost. The ending describes mechanical success—the bells ring as planned—without a decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration that forecloses a path or reweights prior material with felt consequence. The narrative unfolds as a descriptive unfolding of a plan that works, not a pressure-driven sequence where agency alters options. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, or Situational), the absence of meaningful tightening or cost at closure prevents high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: magnetic disruption → memory flood → controlled burn → cryogenic sealing builds density through metaphor and image rather than strict because/therefore. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kael-9 accepts fragmentation by miniaturizing chaos rather than deleting it, with the cost visible in twelve burnt rows and a scarred dome. Orientation anchors (glass dome, desert rose farm, android caretaker) appear early enough to ground the reader. One minor slip: the mechanics of how fire vents magnetic entropy feel slightly ornamental rather than fully causal, but the metaphorical closure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the end of paragraph one, satisfying the test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Maya gathers story fragments that accumulate toward the mailbox reveal. However, closure relies on Mr. Alvarez's off-stage decision to approach the box and Maya's unearned knowledge ("She wanted you to have this," admitted as guess). The mailbox key's sudden appearance and the construction crew's implausible pause dilute causal integrity. The resonance is present but the cost to Maya herself remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: dance entries → dice rolls → vault opening. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the library's release reweights the drowning metaphor), but the cost remains conceptual and historical rather than felt on Elara's present page. The vault "sighed open" and she "stepped back, breathing hard," yet no prior constraint was dramatized that this release now forecloses—she always intended this outcome and achieves it without tactical revision. Orientation is timely (sunken lab, Elara, coded entries by paragraph two), but the causal chain reads as checklist execution rather than pressure-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story delivers on-page closure—Mara recovers the wildflowers and understands the whale's sacrifice—but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt in a decisive action. The causal chain is thin: whale beaches → fissure opens → Mara follows coffee-ground divination → uncovers box. Each step is motivated by world logic but escalation is passive; Mara never faces a choice that narrows options. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image reweights prior material only lightly. Orientation is clear early, so no penalty applies there.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    Orientation remains vague past 120 words—who this summoner is, her concrete location beyond "brook" and "clearing," and what timeline governs the prophecy threat never anchor clearly (−0.4). The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "having turned a tide of whispered destiny into nothing more than the absence of sound" tells outcome without showing the price paid or options foreclosed. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet no meaningful tightening or cadence shift reweights the stake—the work proceeds smoothly from mapping to containment without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors slowly: building and rooftop are clear by paragraph three, but Maya's specific goal and the narrative present remain vague until Elias appears. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens—weekly sessions layer understanding—but closure depends on a single symbolic act (dual seal-pressing) whose cost is asserted through metaphor ("finally understood") rather than demonstrated through forfeited options or visible consequence. The drive holds across the arc, but the cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Maya gives up or loses by completing this sentence with Elias. Micro turn when she finds her own seal is allowed, but the final image reconfigures meaning through declaration rather than enacted pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes a clear task (archive the memory before dawn) and follows it through to completion in a continuous scene. However, the closure unit—Elara's philosophical realization about carrying others' burdens—lacks visible cost; she completes the task successfully and gains insight without forfeiting anything on the page. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (building through imagery and reflection toward a thematic reconfiguration), but the final moment reconfigures understanding through exposition rather than image or action that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when by first sentence). The escalation is mechanical (work faster as dawn approaches) rather than driven by choices that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Elara completes the forgery and places it for the courier, "unlinking herself from the burden of history"—but the cost remains abstract and declarative rather than a legible forfeiture or reconfiguration on the page. The escalation is a steady accretion of detail rather than a meaningful tightening; the piece describes completion without dramatizing a turn that narrows options or changes knowledge. The ending image (rose thorn gleaming, Elara weeping) suggests resonance but lacks the felt price or constraint that would make the closure undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when within the first paragraph and follows an accumulative lens: Mira descends, encounters the Archivists, receives revelation, and crystallizes her stance. The closure reads as Charged Poise—she commits to honor rather than exploit—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatically foreclosed. The progressive-disclosure mechanism is told in summary ("seven years unraveling") rather than shown tightening options on the page, weakening causal linkage at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (dream-journal fragments assembling into a mosaic). The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—the melted snow globe reweighted as transformation rather than damage—but the cost remains abstract: no on-page action or renunciation demonstrates what Elara sacrifices or forecloses by committing to write this truth. The final image ("weaving the truth carefully so that the windows of connection might remain open") gestures toward consequence without making the price legible in a concrete beat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening lines (who, where, when). The closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration—specifically Earned Stasis—where Kaelen's sustained attention and mending constitute a stance that validates her philosophy ("appreciation was itself a form of repair"). The conceptual cost is legible: she chooses solitary devotion to invisible patterns over other forms of connection. One meaningful deepening occurs when the firefly illuminates the unseen tear, crystallizing her philosophy in a concrete act. However, the reconfiguration feels more like an affirmation than a tightening that narrows options or imposes a felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads Causal: letters → comprehension → repair, with cost visible in the settlers' need to learn maintenance and Mara's departure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The closure—Mara walking away after transferring knowledge—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (she leaves, they must now maintain what they inherited). One deduction: the settlers' accusation and her defense feel inserted rather than causally prepared; their presence in the cellar and the timing of confrontation lack setup.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece anchors who and where quickly (Elian, stormlit observatory) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (cobalt glass, fragmented radio, ancient shadows) that converges in the portico ritual. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the rain of cobalt-tinted water reweights the prophet's rise with ambiguity and "possibility"—but the cost remains abstract and felt only in Elian's "loneliness complete and therefore perfect," not dramatized through a forfeited path or visible sacrifice. The ritual unfolds without reversal or tightening choice, relying on accumulation rather than a decisive turn, which keeps the closure unit legible but limits felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias descends with the jar, ready to find his daughter, crystallizing his shift from archivist to messenger with felt cost (abandoning his sanctuary). Orientation anchors quickly (vagrant poet, coastal loft, dawn). The causal lens holds: music box discovery → memory → composition → decision to leave, with one meaningful tightening when he creates the new recording and commits to delivery. The cost is visible in his departure and the transformation of his purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes who, where, and when within the opening lines, satisfying the orientation test. Causal linkage is present: Mara accidentally broadcasts a signal, hunters follow, she climbs the tower, discovers the slot, and sings to trigger sonic absolution. However, the key mechanism—hidden slot and harmonic forgiveness—is introduced only at the climax without prior setup or constraint, reading as a late rule change that solves a problem it did not help create. The closure effect (hunters dissolving into mist, forgiven by sound) lands on the page, but the cost—"shaking with the aftermath"—remains abstract and does not visibly alter Mara's options or foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers basalt, moon paths, magnetic anomalies, and the metaphor of patience into a final crossing that reweights the opening premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the crossing succeeds, the viaduct dissolves, and the promise of "patient revolution" spreads—with visible cost (seven years, the risk of scattering atoms, the burden of teaching others). Orientation anchors promptly (Elara, basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, tonight). One tightening occurs when the viaduct shimmers and the six-minute window forces restraint, but the pressure remains more thematic accumulation than causal jeopardy; no reversal tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is swift (investigator, tunnel, three weeks post-drought, victim recognized). The piece follows a Causal lens: recognition triggers memory, physical evidence reveals institutional negligence, and Maya's decision to weaponize her training closes the arc. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she accepts the detachment he forced upon her but repurposes it with her own moral judgment, a stance crystallization with visible cost (end of apprenticeship, emotional reckoning). One minor causality hiccup: the transit authority's complicity is discovered via his satchel, a convenient convergence that slightly weakens the investigative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Causal. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (chaplain, shop, afternoon storm). The closure—Elias discovering the serial number via sudden light, committing to public action—lands on the page with visible cost (seventeen years of complicity now transformed into a public obligation). The light-through-clouds mechanism feels coincidental rather than earned by prior causality, softening the turn's inevitability. One meaningful tightening occurs (storm → light → revelation → oath), sufficient for this length, though the repairman's observation ("serial number") arrives conveniently late without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors (Kip, workshop, acid sea, cart glider role) land within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the kaleidoscope's shifting outputs, culminating in text rather than geometry, and the final bell-ringing reweights all prior longing into a backward-traveling resonance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the algorithm achieving consciousness as sound) with conceptual cost legible in the final image: "the completeness of the nothing they had filled." One minor friction: the workshop "convulsing" and kaleidoscope shattering feel slightly ornamental rather than causally motivated by the cog adjustment, but the ending image holds.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    Inferred lens: Causal with accumulative texture (Hybrid). The piece establishes clear causality—patch discovery → number trail → crew location—but the orientation arrives late (~150 words before "corporate memory keeper" clarifies her role) and the world logic shifts convenient rules (cooling systems preserve consciousness for twenty years without detection). The closure unit is a Decisive Change: Elara broadcasts the coordinates and crews rush to rescue. However, the cost is stated rather than felt on the page; we're told she "confronted" the AI director but the scene compresses the peak choice into summary. The final paragraph's thematic musing dilutes closure pressure rather than charging it with image.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    Orientation is delayed: lighthouse spires with apple trees and ice floes create spatial confusion until the mirror mechanics appear mid-story. The closure—redirecting orchard heat through lighthouse shafts—arrives as exposition ("showing the Council how") rather than dramatized action with on-page resistance. Cost is asserted (the "weighted breath" released) but not felt; we never see what Elara loses or forecloses by choosing this path. The piece teaches an accumulative lens through its lyric cataloging of mirrors but the ending toggles to causal problem-solving without integrating the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who (euthanasia tourist), where (drift-ice marina), and when (after waking changed, three days post-disaster) within the opening. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the parasol probing, the child's shoe surfacing, and the final snow-crunching departure, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the appointment remains but is now held "loosely" with "the same airy grace." Cost is felt—she has reweighted her ending—but the price is more conceptual than visceral, and the before/after hinge depends heavily on the metaphoric register. The lens holds and closure lands, though the cost could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation is clear (vineyard, Elena, autumn, post-bus departure). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflections on viticulture-as-metaphor until the final image (hand to earth, letter composting) reweights her solitude as communion. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she stops waiting, accepts the mismatch), and cost is legible (the path of reconciliation is foreclosed). However, the Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but the *timeframe constraint* ("after the final bus departs") is mentioned early yet never tightens decisions—it functions as setup without pressure, reducing lens coherence. Additionally, the piece operates in reflective mode throughout with minimal causal linkage or motivating stimulus beyond her own rumination, flattening escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece accumulates density through recurring motifs (kinetic parapet, murmuring pavilion, conjured clearing) and a cadence shift at the mask-removal beat, but the closure—parapet accepting the wisdom, pavilion gaining new harmonic—reads as a told outcome rather than an on-page image that reweights prior material with felt cost. The cost (that "some echoes are not meant to be kept by human hands") is asserted in reflection rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening occurs when she kneels and removes the mask, but the final paragraph drifts into summary of what has been stored rather than landing a charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when efficiently, but the drive lens wavers between Accumulative (image collection building toward spiral display) and Situational (townspeople gathering). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara walks away, the field is now "sacred ground"—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: we are told the work is "complete" and that "pain was not forgotten, but transformed" without an on-page moment where a choice, renunciation, or visible price anchors that transformation. The spiral display at equinox functions as summary tableau rather than a beat that narrows options or crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and what she's doing emerges slowly through dense descriptive layering rather than clean anchors by ~120 words (−0.3). The closure—placing the crystal atop the dictionary—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of organic change over preservation), but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final gesture feels more like ritual completion than a reweighting with visible cost. No meaningful tightening or choice narrows her options before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors early (junkyard prophet, fog garden, precognitive forgetting) and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through recurring motifs (chalk, driftwood, videotapes) toward a final resonance. The closure achieves Earned Stasis—Elias is stranded in eternal recursion, the map now meaningless to him—with conceptual cost legible in "a treasure he had already buried in his own future." The lens holds, though the spiral structure risks feeling static rather than tightening; one additional narrowing of options mid-piece would sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes orientation (Elara, lunar observatory, during tremors) within the opening lines and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the causal chain from tremors → unrecorded light → leaf-sound solution → transcendence into "the space between the leaf's release and its landing" lacks motivated linkage; the leaf recording appears as a symbolic fix rather than a mechanically or thematically prepared tool. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) is waived because the disorientation at closure—Elara vanishing, teams finding only camera and leaf—appears intentional, but the cost of her transformation remains conceptual and oblique rather than legible on the page, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through Elena's hymning ritual and the scent arrival, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid) where Maya holds the broken record to her heart with new understanding. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (the father's death, the weight Maya carries down). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scent of hope transforms Maya's grip from violence to need, reweighting the reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (spoons, shadows, loops, noon) and the final image reconfigures the premise with cost—Elara must close "many more loops" and the awakenings were preservation, not punishment. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (ongoing labor, reframed stakes). Orientation is clean by ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when she completes the first loop and sees the sealed awakenings, reweighting her task. Cost is legible in the final paragraph's commitment to future work.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story anchors who/where/when within the opening sentence, and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (tooth, effigy, garden, constellation) toward a final reconfiguration where both girls are restored and Elena becomes "something stitched together from old wounds." The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration—Elena's stance crystallizes, and the final image of dawn transforming thorns into gold reweights the prior material. Cost is legible but oblique: Elena's former certainty is gone, her isolation ended, yet the girls' amnesia and the garden's orbital persistence suggest ongoing stakes. One causal hiccup: the real Miller girl's location is revealed by the changeling's whisper rather than earned discovery, and the "tooth knows" mechanism feels late-introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; no penalty applies. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the spiral arrangement, and the final image reweights the dominant stake (sharing light without fire) with a quiet cost—her old hunger subsides. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she accepts limitation as "deeper magic." Cost is felt but oblique; the line "liberated from the gravity of her guilt" makes the shift legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pearl forms and she kneels, completing the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of drip/absorption metaphors and deposits the pendant as a seed crystal, achieving Conceptual Repricing—the confession transforms from noise to nourishment. Orientation anchors by ~120 words (server rows, three months post-viral confession, moss garden). Cost is conceptual but legible: she relinquishes jewelry status and public narrative control. One tightening occurs when she places the pendant, foreclosing return to the digital frenzy. Minor penalty: the middle meanders through catalogue passages without a second reversal or complication to test her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: layers of image and reflection build toward a ceremonial closure. Orientation is delayed—who Mara is and what immediate situation she faces remains vague past the opening third; we learn backstory (café, Tokyo) but not the present scene's concrete trigger. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (she steps into the mist, accepting witness-role rather than ending her career), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page—no live option is visibly foreclosed. The "swirling hush" and glowing shell provide atmosphere but do not constrain her choice in a legible way.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors who and where within the opening lines; the harvest-moon alignment provides temporal pressure. The closure—vine bursting into fruit, villagers remembering, soil exhaling—reads as a Decisive Change under a Causal lens, with the remedy action producing observable effects. However, cost remains abstract: no visible forfeit, injury, or trade-off marks Elara's success. The final image of "growing things stretching toward the light" reweights the premise, but the lack of on-page price (exhaustion, voice loss, personal sacrifice) weakens closure weight. The because/therefore chain (calculations → alignment → song → growth) holds, but the ease of resolution dilutes urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through layered imagery (orchard, aurora, flash-paper patterns) toward a final image where the plate "glows with internal topography." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the map now pulses with starlight, ready to guide), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page action or renunciation that forecloses a path with felt price. The "sealing" moment functions as completion rather than a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative lens: Elias observes, maps, and reassembles across repeated dawn sessions that build technical density toward the mechanism's restoration. Closure arrives when the timer ticks forward and echoes gather, a Resonant Reconfiguration that restores the cavern's voice. However, cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page—no visible sacrifice, renunciation, or foreclosed option accompanies the success. The "wounded season" frame and the phrase "saved for later" imply future consequence but do not land a present price.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=3.8)
    No on-page closure unit is legible. The piece describes an annual cycle—snowmelt triggers collection, she completes her work at dawn—but no decisive change, earned stasis with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing occurs. The ending ("dreamed in whalebone, skeletal songs") decorates the premise rather than reweighting it with visible cost. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (bronze grotto and starlight establish location, but who Elara is and what immediate problem she faces remain vague until paragraph four), triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara transforms absence into "furniture for the soul" through the carved handle, with visible cost in her solitary labor and the persistent scent of "sawdust and mane conditioner." The accumulative/textural lens holds—rain, skylight, kettle, and wood accrue meaning—but the piece cycles through multiple restatements of the central insight without meaningful tightening after midpoint. The orientation is clean (widow, loft, carving blank, kettle) but the narrative deepens more through reiteration than escalation. Cost is legible in her containment labor, though the ending restates rather than decisively reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments collected → ghost exchange → transfer/transformation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (they trade places), but cost remains largely conceptual—Mara "grows light and translucent" without a clear before/after in options or emotional state that the reader can trace. The carousel restart and camera-wheel spin gesture toward change, yet the final image ("ready to scavenge her own future") loops back to the opening stance without visible foreclosure or deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: patterns of decay seed the retrofit solution, and the ending reweights "departure" into "sustenance." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the terminal lives again as greenhouse), and the cost is conceptual—the original purpose is foreclosed—but the piece never dramatizes Maya confronting a meaningful trade-off or obstacle that forces her to alter tactics. The night's work compresses into summary ("She worked through the night, rerouting…"), so escalation reads as told rather than shown, and no on-page reversal narrows her options mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors promptly (Elara, iron gate, monastery forecourt, dawn). The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara places the metronome among the quartz, surrendering the pianist dream with visible cost (seventeen years, "excruciatingly gentle" handling, the lightness at the end). The accumulative pressure—sensory layering, memory recursion, and the metronome's physical journey—tightens to the kneeling beat and then releases into the walk home, reweighting "silence between ticks" as peace rather than absence. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of the dream and the bodily ache from cold stone.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through recurring motifs (sundial, shadow, architecture of lies) and a cadence shift at the cottage reweights the dominant stake with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (Mara, barge canal, twilight/dawn cycle) arrive early. The closure—Mara stopping her search and choosing to "write herself"—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), with the felt cost of abandoning the mentor's false legend. Causality is mostly elliptical: the backstory of "seven countries" and "three years of ownership" is summarized rather than dramatized, but the on-page arc (opening sundial → hidden engraving → lock keeper's cottage → journals) traces a coherent before/after. The cost is legible in the final image: she "stopped seeking," foreclosing the errant path. A single persistent constraint—the sundial's misdirection—shapes her tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates atmospheric detail and ritual description toward a final image of Elias carrying the technique away. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the "seed" metaphor reweights preservation as embodied continuity—but the cost is asserted ("a seed that would grow only when shared") rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture or tension. The middle decoding sequence loops descriptively without escalation, weakening the tightening required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: density builds through repeated motifs (thread, projected presence, cartography metaphor) and culminates in a stance crystallization—Elian ties the thread as a bracelet and commits to the inland journey. Closure reads as Charged Poise: the final image (thread pulsing on his wrist, garden holding its breath) reconfigures his relationship to absence with felt cost (he must leave the palace, carry the elegies like seeds). One meaningful deepening is present, and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece maintains a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: density and imagery build toward the hatch as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/what early; the assembly sequence tightens pressure through ritual-like preparation. However, the cost at closure is atmospheric rather than decisively foregrounded—Elian weeps and the palace "holds its breath," but no option is foreclosed on the page with legible price. The final image (sunlight through cracks) reweights prior material, qualifying as RR, yet the cost remains more gestural than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (lagoon, dunes, migration of clouds). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density increases through layered imagery (black sand, kelp, coin, scars) and the final image attempts a cadence shift where "scars finally singing" reweights the opening premise. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Maya emerges with the graft "taken hold" by "stubborn hope" and mineral salts, a wished-for success rather than a renunciation or trade-off that forecloses a path. The ending offers Charged Poise in image but the pressure feels asserted ("loud enough to drown the past") rather than undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece opens with delayed anchoring—who Elara is and what she's doing emerges slowly through lyric description, costing ~0.3 for orientation debt. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the city remembers itself and memories settle into stone, reweighting the premise of erasure. However, the cost is diffuse and conceptual rather than felt; Elara experiences satisfaction, not sacrifice or foreclosed paths. The geese-as-temporal-threshold device provides a ticking clock but resolves passively (they "resume") rather than through protagonist choice. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a cadence shift at closure, but the final reconfiguration lacks the undeniable pressure or visible price that would lift it into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (gear, petals, sonar, light) that converges at closure when the gear locks into place and the garden glows without heat. Orientation anchors arrive late—who Elara is and her specific goal clarify gradually over the first third—but the pattern is taught and the closure image (Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost: she disperses into luminescence, forfeiting individuality to complete the cycle. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the gear is a lantern, not a key, shifting her understanding and the garden's response.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines. The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's shift from mapping stones to retracing existing grooves, a meaningful deepening that narrows his approach and forecloses the original mapping project. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of carving "for the living who would come to trace the letters" reweights his solitary work into connective labor, and the cost is felt in the seasonal limit and the grandmother's departure. The accumulative lens holds, though the piece edges toward hybrid in its lyric density. One structural friction: the migration timeframe brackets the narrative but does not visibly tighten tactics within the single dusk scene.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias's nightly ritual deepens through layered backstory until the adjustment completes his decades-long arc. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis—he leaves the rake handle for the next winder, having restored balance through "four decades of ethical diligence"—and the cost (forty years of penance) is legible. However, the Orientation Test reveals delay: who/where/when coalesce only after ~180 words of atmospheric description, and the rake handle's function remains opaque until midpoint. The causality is weak: the climax hinges on pre-calculated inscriptions rather than a dramatized on-page choice that narrows options in the present scene. Under the Accumulative lens this is permissible, but the diffuse setup and reliance on summary lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The piece establishes a single-POV accumulative design: Mara climbs the silo, decodes the tapestry, and gains understanding of her ancestor's blueprint. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the cemetery is reframed as an acoustic instrument—but the cost is oblique; Mara "will listen differently" without forfeiting a live option or paying a felt price on the page. Orientation anchors (cemetery gardener, silo, evening) arrive promptly. The lens holds through the ending, but the final image reconfigures meaning more than it crystallizes a choice with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Accumulative/Textural through recurring lake and quill imagery, but no pattern-break or cadence shift occurs at closure to reweight the stake. The ending offers a symbolic gesture (quill set down, lake cracking) but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost, or Conceptual Repricing that makes a before/after legible. Orientation is present early (who, where, when), but the closure unit dissolves into metaphor without dramatized consequence. The stated transformation—"prevail through predictive modeling"—is asserted in narration rather than demonstrated through a turn that narrows options or exacts a price.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.7)
    Orientation is delayed: who Elias is and what he seeks emerge slowly through lyric accumulation rather than early anchoring (−0.3). The piece lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost; the final paragraphs summarize distant outcomes ("years later") rather than dramatizing a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing in the present window. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the dominant stake with visible cost at the ending beat. The summary-epilogue structure ("scholars studied," "children who touched") tells rather than enacts the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who (Elias), where (vanishing point gallery), and what (ash-scattering ritual) within the first third. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers images of ash, porcelain, and the mother's absence toward a final reconfiguration. Closure arrives when Elias removes the mask and places it on the chair, crystallizing the ritual's completion. However, the cost is more conceptual than felt—"to crystallize a fleeting emotion was to acknowledge it would never return" tells the price rather than showing a foreclosed option. The narrative advances through accretion and ritual repetition rather than because/therefore linkage, which fits the lens but limits urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece coheres around Elias's stance crystallization through density of imagery (sedimentary layers, the cog, competing narratives) that builds to a Charged Poise closure: his decision to teach in the tunnels rather than surface, trusting mathematics to outlast the flood. The final image—papers unmoved as water rises—reconfigures his rebellion with undeniable cost (risk, solitude, patience). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cog's discovery forces agonizing choice, narrowing his options to preservation versus capitulation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive early (velvet library, autumn, Elias, zither). The piece accumulates through layered reflection and the demonstration beat, arriving at a Resonant Reconfiguration (the students discover shared language). However, cost remains conceptual and implied rather than sharply legible on the page; the final note "fading into the heavy velvet curtains" offers atmospheric closure but lacks a visible price or foreclosed option that would crystallize the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (Mara, greenhouse, eclipse) appear within the first 120 words; the piece unfolds as a single continuous scene. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (seed planted, vines grow, fruit ripens) that reweights the premise of memory-pruning as gardening. However, the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("disciplined neuroscience," "gentle rebellion") rather than felt on the page; no specific forfeiture or failure charges the final image. The alignment's "once-in-a-lifetime" constraint is declared but never tests a tactic or narrows a window in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with a situational overlay: Elias climbs, reflects, encounters the engineer, and reveals his preserved bee—pressure accumulates through density of imagery rather than causal linkage. Orientation anchors (tower, post-blackout, Elias as toll keeper) arrive within the first paragraph. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights the tower's function from lightning harvesting to dream-catching, though the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. The narrative arc is more a philosophical unveiling than a tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through cataloged details (displaced fence posts, tide clocks, collected sound) toward a pattern-coalescence moment where Maya finds the crystallized silence shard. Orientation anchors promptly (Maya at the bay, spring evening, streetlights). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maya's gesture of placing the orris root "consecrate[s] the boundary where architecture becomes entity," and the cottage responds with recognition, reweighting her role from witness to catalyst. The cost is conceptual—her attention has made the houses "more so" alive—but felt in the final image of the cottage's "hushed blaze" and her knowledge that "tomorrow the fence posts would have moved again." One meaningful deepening (from cataloging to understanding to consecration) satisfies length requirements under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the garden awakens into "polyculture of maybe," pressure crystallizes, and the final image (Corvin waiting, receptors open) reweights the premise with felt cost—endurance that forecloses certainty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through cascading metaphor and the dome-breathing moment shifts cadence to reweight the dominant stake (animate the petrified philosophy). One meaningful deepening is present; causality is elliptical but accumulative logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation arrives cleanly (who, where, what) and the accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds through mathematical imagery, the chipped die's asymmetry, and the fissure. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the staircase "could not abide imperfection in its mathematical perfection"—with visible cost (she steps through, forfeiting the cycle). The dice-on-equation rupture delivers a decisive shift, though the causal mechanics lean heavily on metaphor ("subterranean frequency," "profound ringing silence") rather than concrete dramatized progression. One meaningful tightening is present; cost is legible in the final image of "warm and real and finite."

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates visions and painted glyphs across three hours, but no reversal or deepening tightens options—Maya paints steadily until dawn arrives and she stops. The closure is a survey and a set-down; the cost is asserted ("thirty-seven words for kindness that no mouth could speak") rather than dramatized through a forfeited choice or a reweighted stake. The waxing moon frames the ritual but does not impose escalating pressure or a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening, meeting the orientation test. However, the closure unit—Elara documenting heritage through the night—lacks visible cost; she works "with trembling hands" but no foreclosed path or felt consequence appears on the page. The causal lens wobbles: the bread-coordinate revelation drives her gathering of elders, but the final beat shifts to solo archival work without a clear tightening or loss that reweights prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Orientation anchors arrive late: who/where/when coalesce only after the hunger stone description (~150 words in), creating initial disorientation without taught payoff (−0.3). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—mounting density around time reversal and radiance—and the closure offers Conceptual Repricing (the inscription rewritten, Elara vanishing into her mechanism). Causality holds through the yoyo-to-hunger-stone linkage, but the final transformation is asserted more than demonstrated: "stepped into the beam" → vanished, with cost implied by the new inscription rather than felt on the page. The closure reconfigures the premise, but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story teaches a dream-logic/paradox lens early and attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through confession that "poisons the parasite," but the causal chain from confession to fear's collapse is asserted rather than dramatized with visible mechanism. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first paragraph, waiving penalties. The closure unit (unpinning the clasp, releasing luminance, walking out "unburdened") lands on the page, but the cost reads conceptual rather than felt—no visible price or foreclosed path in the final image. The lens holds accumulative/textural pressure through recurring motifs, but the ending's mechanism (confession as poison) lacks the concrete payoff the setup promised.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates sensory detail and metaphor toward a conceptual repricing—storm becomes collaborator, obstacle becomes instrument—visible in "The storm, thus acknowledged, ceased to be an enemy." Cost is felt in "restless euphony...unresolved chord" but remains oblique; the prophet's work succeeds without foreclosing a path or paying a tangible price. One meaningful deepening (storm integration) occurs, sufficient for this length, but the closure leans heavily on stated transformation rather than image-driven reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear Causal lens: Elara's shell-mapping → whistle sequence → watchers turn → sky cracks → turtles move. Orientation anchors (city, protagonist role, temporal frame) land within the first paragraph. Closure achieves a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the city crosses into another reality, and Elara's question is answered by transcendence rather than return—but the cost to her individual agency is more implied than dramatically felt on the page. The because/therefore chain holds cleanly through the climax without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes a Causal lens (diary → letter discovery → decision to publish) but the closure lacks on-page cost; Elena's editor message and typed response occur off-stage, and the walk away feels more like summary than a decisive change with felt consequence. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly by the opening paragraph. The turn from research to publication decision is motivated but the final image (whistle, sealed documents) reconfigures meaning without showing what Elena forfeits or risks by choosing this framing—cost is conceptual but not legible in a concrete sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece establishes orientation (surveyor, submerged pavilion, post-drawbridge) within the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and thematic layering build toward a final image of preservation. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—Elara executes her survey work without complication, and the ending restates her opening intent ("she will return tomorrow") without decisive change or felt cost. The closure reads as stasis without the foreclosure or conceptual repricing that would elevate it to Earned Stasis or Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece establishes a causal lens: blackout enables discovery of authentication manual, which reframes the forged deeds as legitimate emergency records. Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change (Elias will "readjust the entire catalog") with professional cost (months of work, abandoning his three-year system). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the microscopic scoring marks force reconsideration, narrowing options and leading to the platform discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the cranes accumulate as physical manifestations of folded grief, and the final dispersal reconfigures Mira's essence into atmospheric blessing. Closure occurs on the page (she disperses, cranes scatter), but cost remains asserted rather than viscerally felt—"became the light itself" and "ascending not by rising, but by diving" are poetic claims without a concrete forfeiture or visible price that alters options. Orientation anchors (workshop, floating isle, tea garden) arrive early. The narrative delivers one meaningful deepening (gem-folding accelerates to crane-release to self-dispersal), meeting the 600–800 word scope, but the final image's conceptual repricing lacks the undeniable weight required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—locating the quantum pool of unlived futures—and progresses through calculation to discovery to escape. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (station, orbit, viewport). However, the closure lacks visible cost: Amara completes her task and departs with coordinates in hand; the geode fractures, but this registers as symbolic convenience rather than a felt price that forecloses a path. The lens reads Causal with accumulative texture, yet the ending delivers information acquisition without a decisive change in her options or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure: Elias follows a pilgrim's trail, aligns mechanisms with star charts, and inserts the chip to complete a transmission. The closure—frequencies washing over him as confirmation of belonging—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains conceptual and implied rather than felt on the page. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs (aperture opens, chip inserted), yet the causal chain feels more like a puzzle solved than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece opens with strong orientation (terrace, Elias, watch hand at 4:17) and establishes a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Elias arranges the carvings in order and commits to finding the daughter, crystallizing his stance with the cost of bearing witness after twenty years of erasure. The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the driftwood chronology and the watch hand becomes the punctuation mark. One minor causality gap: "He had come to this cobalt terrace at dusk because the father had died last spring" introduces backstory motivation but the on-page trigger for tonight specifically is not dramatized, only the general search over three weeks.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration: the negotiator remains on the parapet "recycling tonight's fragile success into tomorrow's deeper wisdom," forecloses immediate departure, and crystallizes her role as witness-architect with visible cost (solitude, repetition). The piece teaches an Accumulative lens early through moon-phase ritual, mist imagery, and the drawer pull's inheritance; pressure accrues via atmospheric buildup and the ritual's successful completion. Orientation anchors are present (parapet, mist, delegates arriving), though the abstract framing and lack of concrete spatial stakes slightly delay full grounding. The cost is felt—continued vigilance, the cycle's weight—but remains oblique rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the story accretes pressure through layered regrets, the utility-pole navigation motif, and the compass's shifting meaning, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elias accepts his earthbound, flawed self and refuses celestial aspiration). Closure lands on the page with felt cost (renouncing his father's compass, sleeping in the cove "aligned…with the flawed, earthly creature he was"). Orientation is swift (coastal kayak launch, Elias, present tense by line three). One micro turn—the paddle past the breakers—deepens resolve without fragmenting pressure. The reflective density (~35%) stays anchored to present stimuli (compass in lap, utility poles overhead, surf) and tilts present stance via micro-choices (clutching the compass, paddling past breakers, setting it down). The lens holds cleanly through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes a clear causal chain: baseball → coordinates → descent → labyrinth tests → bioluminescent lake → dissolution/rewriting, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration (the lake fills "emptied chambers" and she emerges with instructions for others). Orientation anchors appear promptly (hospital, post-procedure, baseball, tunnels), and the inferred lens is Causal with accumulative texture in the labyrinth sequence. Cost is visible—kneeling, weeping, trembling legs—and the closure reweights her capacity. However, the mechanism by which the bioluminescence "etches new pathways through her frontal lobe" reads slightly convenientist, a late rule introduced to resolve the empathy void without the protagonist earning it through a decisive internal choice at the lake's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the orchard, spices, and metamorphosis building toward reunion. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (who, where, when by the third sentence). The closure unit—Elara's transformation into a permanent bridge and the clasping of hands—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), and the cost is legible: she remains "a permanent fixture in the moonlit grove." However, the escalation is primarily additive description rather than a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off, limiting the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance/sanctification of lost time) with felt cost—she leaves the saucer and carries "forgiveness of its passage, heavy as a stone." The accumulative lens holds: the piece gathers texture and reweights the stake through layered images (cards, saucer, cloudbound repentance, unfastening metaphor). Orientation anchors appear early (midnight glade, three weeks post-birth, cartomancer seeking nexus). One meaningful deepening occurs when memory opens and she re-experiences the nine months, shifting her stance from retrieval to sanctification. Minor causality softness: the physical act of tracing future hands and the clasp-unfastening blur into metaphor without a clear mechanism that the reader can trace as because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. The piece teaches its method early (photographs, tears, crystal) and the closure—Elias passing through the seam—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes his integration and the release of humanity's shadow). Cost is conceptual and felt (he becomes weightless, the ship emptied), meeting CR standards. However, orientation debt applies: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words is present, but causality between beats is often elided or summarized ("decades of meditation," "he felt himself drifting") rather than shown in linked pressure moves. The stitching sequence at the end compresses multiple actions without clear escalation or reversal within the final beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear early enough. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis—Elias lies down to be buried by ash—but the cost feels asserted rather than legible: we don't see what live option he forecloses because he arrived already resigned to this fate. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens (bioluminescence motifs, celestial convergence, volcanic metaphors), yet the final image ("giving everything away had been the only way to keep it") lands as thematic summary rather than a reconfiguration charged by prior concrete constraint. The prophecy-fulfillment mechanism is revealed only in retrospect without prior pressure or tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elara moves through a prepared ritual, layering symbolic gestures toward a promised future revolution. Closure relies on Charged Poise—"the cradle of sparks had been prepared, and now it only needed the morning light to set the world ablaze"—but the cost remains conceptual and postponed rather than felt on the page. The spiral-stair descent, quill-holder alignment, and phosphorescent-ink application stack purpose-driven beats, yet no on-page reversal or tightening alters Elara's options or knowledge. The ending asserts inevitability ("geometrically inevitable," "quiet click of understanding") without a visible price paid or path foreclosed in this moment, weakening the closure effect under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist disperses into borrowed light, fulfilling the promise by understanding patterns inscribed in loss, and the stones remain charged with memory. Cost is legible—consciousness scattered across time—and the inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural, with pattern-teaching through repeated rock-placement and eel observations) holds. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the final stone completes the mathematical field and triggers the alignment, narrowing options to a single path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's discovery of the negative, the timer chiming at intervals, and the storm's rhythm build density toward the realization that she continues her father's vigil. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when she seals the new manuscript and descends, having transformed silence into testimony. The cost—thirty-seven hours of silence, the seizure of her work, the vigil's repetition—is legible on the page, though the physical act of writing and sealing feels more symbolic than causally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the opening paragraph. The dominant stake—decode the sundial to find the library—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, the closure operates as a Resonant Reconfiguration (truce and departure) whose cost is stated rather than felt: no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path appears on the page. The needle-alignment moment delivers information but not a choice under pressure. The inferred lens is Causal with a late Accumulative accent, but the final image asserts "certainty" without showing what was risked or lost to reach it.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (rusted library, moonlight, seeds, microfilm) toward a final thematic crystallization. Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (Elias, library, stars, coffee tin). Closure attempts Charged Poise—"tonight, under the clearing moon, the resistance bloomed"—but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatically legible; no on-page choice or renunciation forecloses a path, and the "tomorrow the guards might burn it all" functions as hypothetical threat rather than felt pressure that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story establishes a clear causal chain: Elena plays specific notes → compasses stabilize → station reaches sanctuary coordinates embedded in Maya's film. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): Elena's persistence rewrites "the boundaries of possible endings" and the station stabilizes, with the cost felt in "three years delayed" and the transformation of longing into "something like peace." Orientation anchors are present early (station, piano, tidal arbor, Elena's seven-year tenure). The lens reads as Causal with Accumulative layering (musical frequency → magnetic correction), and the closure holds under that lens with visible cost (the broken clock restarting, the arbor settling). One friction: the mechanics of sound-to-magnetic conversion and film-embedded Morse are sketched but not quite grounded enough to feel inevitable in hindsight.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph and delivers an on-page closure: the tree stands, the memory survives, Elara witnesses the integration. However, the drive lens wavers between causal (seed → roots → tree) and accumulative/textural (dream-state layering), never fully committing to either pattern. The escalation from planting to singing to storm arrival reads more like checklist progression than because/therefore linkage—each beat could be reordered without altering the emotional arc. Cost is asserted ("luminous doubt remained") but not felt; we don't see what Elara forfeits or what path she forecloses by this success.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear anchoring (Mara, her workshop, post-breakup timeframe) established early. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the final image of Mara speaking to the tree "her words slow and tidal" reweights her relationship to remembrance with the cost of accepting "cerulean regret...as a color to cultivate." One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands the severance "transformed" rather than "ended" their connection. However, the compass spins, stills, and points at precisely articulated moments that feel convenient rather than causally motivated by Mara's actions, creating minor linkage slippage that keeps this from the 8+ band despite solid closure work.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens held flawlessly; closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing where the dust patterns reconfigure her worldview with undeniable cost ("kindled humility"). Orientation is immediate (who, where, when within first paragraph). The cost is legible in the final image of her participating in gradual change, foreclosing her prior path of astrophysical drama.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a decisive change (revelation of father’s sacrifice and Mara’s redefined purpose) with felt cost on the page (“she would create something new from these ashes”). Causal lens holds tightly: each beat (ledger → canyon → frost → cave → journals) follows because/therefore linkage. Orientation is immediate; no disorientation or convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with felt cost in reconciliation. Orientation clear early; structure tight with no causality breaks. Persistent constraint of deafness shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)

    Accumulative/textural lens holds perfectly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira disperses into light, with cost legible in the empty workshop and ascending cranes. Orientation is immediate, and the pattern of gem-polishing to flight pays off without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost (geode fracture, weight of tomorrow) under a coherent Causal lens; the time constraint from circuit breakers tightens options via because/therefore linkages, and orientation is anchored within 120 words without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds firmly; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (belonging confirmed) with cost legible in the physical effort and the resonant transmission. Orientation is immediate, and the ritual’s steps cohere into a decisive before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; orientation is immediate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias arranges the carvings and decides to find the daughter, with cost legible in the final image. The pattern of sifting and discovery tightens meaningfully, and the watch hand's reprise charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details build pressure toward a Charged Poise closure where the negotiator remains alone, counting heartbeats until the next phase. Orientation is immediate, causality is intact, and the cost of the cyclical, fragile peace is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds; closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with legible cost as he leaves the compass and accepts his terrestrial nature. Orientation is clear early.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.5)
    Causal chain from baseball to labyrinth to lake holds without breaks; closure is a decisive change with felt cost ("weeping for the first time") and the inferred causal lens remains consistent. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a decisive change with legible cost (permanent fixture in the grove), under a causal lens that holds tightly. Orientation is anchored early; the fortune cookie premise drives cause-and-effect linkages to a resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held. Closure is a masterful Conceptual Repricing: the premise of "lost time" is reweighted to "transformed time," sanctified in the final image of the saucer holding dew. The cost of her prior resentment is legible in the "forgiveness of its passage, heavy as a stone." Orientation is immediate and functional; the pattern of seeking/instruction/surrender is taught and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a decisive change (passing through the seam) with felt cost (empty ship, released shadow). Orientation is immediate; causality is tight, with the tear and photographs serving as persistent constraints that shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds; closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost ("his destitution complete... cupped to catch the falling ash"); orientation is clear early, and the pattern of prophecy fulfillment tightens coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Charged Poise with cost legible in the "geometrically inevitable" seeds of rebellion. Orientation is immediate, and the sundial's geometry acts as a persistent constraint shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a decisive Conceptual Repricing—his understanding and dispersal reconfigure the world's logic with clear cost ("scatter his consciousness"). The pattern's completion and the aurora's alignment create a resonant, inevitable payoff anchored in established particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds firmly; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara descends with transformed understanding. The cost of the vigil and the inherited silence is legible in the final image of the sealed envelope and the 73 pages. Orientation is clear within the first 120 words, and the structure—single scene with reflective shards—builds pattern and pays off at closure without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands decisively with the truce and shared expedition, underpinned by causal linkages from the sundial decoding. Orientation is immediate, and cost is legible in the needle token. The persistent constraint of the half-painted sundial shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds tightly; closure is a Charged Poise with felt cost ("tomorrow the guards might burn it all"). Orientation is clear early; persistent constraint (molting) shapes tactics and urgency, landing decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly: pressure builds through sensory density and the convergence of film, compasses, and piano. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) as the station stabilizes, the clock chimes, and Elena achieves tempered peace. Cost is legible in the "three years delayed" chime and the "sigh of metal and wood." Orientation is immediate and clear; the mosaic of memory and present action is taught and pays off.

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clear and accumulative: post-flood surveying → noticing the butterfly dust → using it to read the greenhouse and flood path → weeks-later stasis in a redefined “observatory.” Under a textural lens, this builds toward a Conceptual Repricing where her relationship to scale and drama changes. The closure lands, but the cost of leaving her prior career and identity is mostly gestured at rather than dramatized, keeping the stakes somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clear and elegant: fire → surviving the attempt → ledger strip → canyon search → frost-mapped ruts → cave → journals → new understanding and path. It adheres to a single POV, one continuous frame, and lands a resonant reconfiguration where the ledger reweights from “evidence of crime” to “map of devotion.” Cost is legible in the realization that she burned a testament of sacrifice and must now rebuild from that guilt and knowledge. The structure is linear and a bit low on complication, but it suits the lyric, reflective drive lens and closure is fully on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: we move from initial setup (Mara entering, opening the case) through a progressive tuning-fork sequence to a distinct closure where her stance toward silence has shifted. Causality is straightforward—each fork-strike deepens her engagement and culminates in the final low A and conceptual repricing of deafness—with no orientation issues or broken rules. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the last image of her reflection “silently singing in colors” makes a clear before/after legible with emotional cost. The only thing holding it out of the very top band is the relative simplicity of external turns; structurally it’s elegant but not especially intricate.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: crate → distress signals → impossible low tide → descent → library → installation of the lens → reconfiguration of the dead’s condition. Closure is strong: the library becomes a true lighthouse; the dead gain coordinates; Marian’s role reconfigures from undertaker to librarian, a Decisive Change with conceptual cost. The drive feels Hybrid (causal arc with accumulative lyric density), and that lens holds through the end. If anything, the middle lacks a complicating turn or obstacle once she chooses to go below, but the structure remains solid and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: secret midnight runs → accumulating dependency and cohesion → discovery by a child → public revelation that reconfigures the community’s self-understanding. The sanctions and valley geography provide a consistent situational frame, with no orientation or causality slips. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (ringing the bell and revealing the system) plus Resonant Reconfiguration (the community recognizes itself as home) with a believable, if mostly implied, cost. A slightly more concrete sense of external consequence for going public could sharpen the structural stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → attunement (breath, lens) → recognition (sparks/past life) → ritual act → release and reconfiguration. Causality is coherent within the lyric frame: breathing sync enables vision; vision reveals stored love; applying Kwan Yin’s tear triggers the bridge’s exhalation. Closure lands solidly as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the world’s rules about where love “goes” are reweighted, and Maya pays a cost by collapsing and surrendering her documentarian distance. The scene holds one continuous temporal window and avoids confusion despite its density.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: reflection on past mazes → encounter with the living garden → discovery of the halo fragment → total merge with the maze. Causality holds—his touch of the fragment triggers the retrocognitive flood, which leads to his geometric disintegration—and the closure is a clear decisive change plus conceptual repricing of time and self. The drive lens (accumulative/textural with a causal spine) is stable, and the before/after (man designing maze vs. man as maze) is legible with cost. A minor limitation is that intermediate beats can feel like variations on description rather than distinct structural steps of mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: wall demolition → scavenger threat → decoding the piano cipher → vault opening noise drawing danger → decision to block the stairs. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: she chooses to remain the living gate while the possibility of renewal descends below, with a visible price in her continued confinement. The scene stays in one continuous window with no orientation issues, and each beat grows from prior information. The scavenger’s relatively quick capitulation slightly softens the sense of risk at the climax, but the structural arc still feels solid and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean single-POV, single-setting build: collecting absences → preparing the forge → imprinting → testing the device → realization and death, with causality intact under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure is strong: finishing the hearing aid and using it on herself yields a Conceptual Repricing of memories and trust, with death as explicit cost. Orientation is clear early (sunken greenhouse, underwater shipwreck ring, aurora), and the marrow “clock” provides a subtle but continuous temporal pressure. The only limit is that escalation stays more meditative than sharply turning, which restrains it just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece follows a clear causal spine (arrival → flower code → theft → post-heist contemplation) with clean spatial and temporal anchoring. Closure lands as a Charged Poise image: she sits with the portrait and jar, waiting for her own “knock,” which reconfigures the opening desire. However, the practical stakes (avoid the officer) are resolved almost too smoothly, and the conceptual cost of her path remains somewhat abstract, softening the structural punch.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural arc: we watch her work, narrate, and invest objects with meaning until the final charged departure. Causality is soft but coherent—melting ice and treacherous bridges necessitate eventual abandonment; her mission explains the glass spheres and their final disposition. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she leaves behind the safe zones, seals the bookmark, and walks out “pursued by spring,” with a legible before/after in her stance toward departure. Escalation is mostly tonal and imagistic rather than event-driven, which suits the mode but keeps the structural impact modest rather than breathtaking.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal throughline is clean: discovery of the birth certificate leads to the observatory search, to decrypting the cast, to calling authorities, to confronting the father using the library’s weaknesses. The single-scene frame with interleaved backstory is well managed, and closure lands with a clear before/after in Kai’s options and self-concept. The device of the original child’s encoded notes that only resolve through tears and tremors stretches plausibility but doesn’t break the internal logic. The cost of exposing the father is implicit but legible in the final descent and sirens.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: from cataloging silences → arranging pebbles → realizing the fort’s true function → accepting/enduring the endless night. The closure is a conceptual repricing: endless night becomes a methodology, and the book’s emptiness plus the extinguished star create a clear before/after with cost. Causality is internally coherent within a mythic logic—no unkept setups or rule-breaking moments. The one limitation is that the central “turn” is more conceptual than situational, which keeps escalation somewhat cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: courtyard → discovery of violin → onset of loops → integration of timelines/identities → conceptual reweighting of the Second Chance Program → quiet, altered return to sweeping. Causality within an accumulative/lyric frame holds: each contact with the violin deepens the loop mechanics and Seven’s understanding, and the final stance is a clear Conceptual Repricing of the program and its own role. The dominant stake (understanding its “failure” / where thoughts come from) stays consistent. The only limitation is the relative smoothness of the journey—no substantial jeopardy or hard choice interrupts the philosophical ascent, so the arc feels more gliding than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the tickets → decoding via lens → confrontation → joint decision to confess, yielding a resonant reconfiguration at the end. The single continuous night scene with one temporal transition outside is coherent and well-contained. However, the contradiction about the projector lens’s location (“The lens remained with Julian” vs. “the lens from projector number three heavy in her pocket”) is a noticeable continuity error that undercuts the final image’s integrity. That slip keeps the otherwise solid structure out of top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: marbles → quadrant history → current ivy repair → final fountain ritual, all feeding the same drive. Causality is soft but consistent—her past lies necessitate present maintenance, culminating in the final marble placed in the fountain and the maze’s exhalation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: the garden’s visible response confirms the relationship and the necessity of ongoing ritual. The main limitation is the absence of a stronger on-page turn or concrete risk; the pattern deepens rather than truly tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: hypothesized nexus → precise twilight alignment → activation via lever → observable temporal anomaly → external validation by Vex. The piece lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing closure: Kael’s theory is confirmed, and the world’s rules are reweighted through the drakes’ data. The structure is a single, coherent scene with one central turn; no orientation issues. The main limitation is that the outcome is almost entirely smooth and favorable, so cost at closure is conceptual rather than dramatically felt.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is coherent and satisfying: discover code → interpret through lantern placement → play the implied piece → ghost appears → water recedes. Closure lands cleanly with a decisive change (the hydraulic ghost satisfied, water level altered, program dissolving). Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern-building is strong, but causality is almost too smooth—nothing meaningfully threatens failure or redirects tactics, so escalation feels more like a ritual unfolding than pressure mounting.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: present-moment scene anchored in the station, deepened by reflection on the fever and earlier anomalies, building to a conceptual repricing at the end. Causality is soft but coherent: fever → corrupted readings/denial → recognition of prior “swallowed truths” → new stance embodied by placing the illustration at the center. Orientation (who/where/when) is secure early, and the drive lens (internal reckoning under environmental pressure) holds through closure. The final act reconfigures options going forward—she can no longer treat anomalies as peripheral—delivering closure with conceptual and moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: Elias’s confession → Mara entering the tunnel → following psychic-call clues → discovering and appraising the beaded valve wheel → conceptual repricing of heroism vs murder. Causality is clear even within a lyric, reflective mode, and the radio calls function as a motivating breadcrumb trail rather than ornament. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, with Mara’s understanding of the event and of her own vocation reweighted by the final recognition of “exact tonnage” of guilt. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: library → journey → obsidian refuge → return, with the drive lens clearly textural rather than causal. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reinterprets her role and reality’s “loose grip,” then returns with the silence as a seed. Causality is soft but consistent—each step follows from goal and environment, with no orientation issues. The main structural limitation is the relative absence of visible cost or narrowed options at the end, which keeps the closure from feeling fully earned at a highest-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous causal arc from setup (session on the ridge) through the eclipse to Milo’s spoken “Again.” The eclipse provides a clear, time-bound escalation and the breakthrough is on the page, not summarized, yielding solid Decisive Change with emotional cost. Causal links (“she planned for the eclipse, therefore this pocket of safety, therefore Milo risks sound/word”) are coherent and legible. A touch of conceptual framing (dreaming roots, ordinary magic) slightly softens the sense of hard constraint but doesn’t disturb closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build: arrival → investigation → discovery → mnemonic “shudder” → all-night work → charged morning and reading. Causality is coherent (the probe leads to diaries, which lead to tapestry, which leads to the wall-memory and conceptual reframe), and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a strong final repricing of what walls and dreams are. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the recognition that human experience has migrated into architecture and that her vocal translation is now a salvific act, with the emotional cost encoded in her exhaustion and grief. Stakes are conceptual rather than plotty, but they hold together and feel complete at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clear: late-night cookie work → embedded espionage system → arrival of the drenched stranger → boat departure and Elias’s self-orchestrated escape, all causally linked. The accumulative build of how his fortunes shape real operations pays off in the ending key-change image. Closure is a Decisive Change—he goes from static keeper to someone leaving—though the price of this transition is more implied than dramatized. The drive lens reads as a hybrid of causal and textural, but remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: impending possession → Elian initiates the looped ritual → rhetorical stratagems trap the entity in its own assumptions → the anchor holds. The piece reads as a hybrid of causal and accumulative design, with each new layer of sound and questioning tightening the logic-cage around the entity. Closure is solid via a conceptual repricing: silence is redefined from passive absence to articulated, accountable quiet, and the final image of the dried gray confirms the ritual’s cost and completion. The only limitation is that the “minutes left” clock never meaningfully constrains tactics on the page, softening the sense of brinkmanship.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is accumulative/textural and holds that lens cleanly: each paragraph layers sound, memory, and image toward the dawn/symphony culmination. Orientation is solid early—who he is, where he is, and when (pre-dawn at the spire) are quickly anchored. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias reframes time as spiral and his homesickness lifts as he “conducts the dawn,” with a clear before/after in stance. Because the conflict is almost entirely interior and lyric, escalation is more about density than plot, but it coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: Elara advances along the viaduct, down the spiral, and deeper into interior/temporal stakes, culminating in a clear conceptual shift (curse → design, fragmentation → integration). Causality is coherent—storm, theft of the tablet, procedural path, staircase, collapse of timelines, then unification—though most turns are internal realizations rather than external complications. Closure lands cleanly with the tablet transferring into tattoos and the viaduct fading, signalling a before/after in her relationship to her own cycles, and the cost (letting the ghost selves fade) is conceptually legible if not dwelt on. Structure is tight for the length, with no orientation issues and a single, continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal: summons → experiment → sensory breakthrough → conceptual shift, all in one continuous scene. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines what “teaching music” means under the permanent constraint of deafness, with cost visible in the grief finally accessed. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and never lost, and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds consistently. A slightly gentler escalation curve keeps it from feeling absolutely razor-edged, but the arc is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly causal: surveillance homecoming → pigeon/message → recognition of coordinates → mentor’s survival → invitation → her decision to collaborate from outside. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and the rogue zone’s failing quarantine folds in smoothly as the central situation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive event: she commits to the dual ledger in the face of surveillance, with the unscheduled rain reframing the whole premise. The cost and larger consequences remain mostly conceptual rather than concretely enacted, which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves causally from routine maintenance to discovery of the vial to the activation of plants and an internal shift in grief. The accumulative drive—light → vial → perfume → revival → conceptual realization—holds consistently, and closure lands as a decisive reconfiguration of his relationship to memory. Stakes and cost (seventeen years of avoidance, now confronted) are legible in the ending. The piece is largely interior and quiet, but the beats are well-sequenced and never lose orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a clean, single-scene accumulative build: arrival → exposition of the temporal fork → deepening via fossils/drafts of reality → rope’s animation → conceptual reconfiguration at the end. Causality is consistent under an accumulative/textural lens, and the closure—refusing both doors while accepting the paradoxical “fraying” nature of time—lands as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. The cost (forgoing both the lover’s voice and the accelerated future) is legible, though more intellectual than dramatized. Orientation (who/where/when) is never in doubt and there are no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation of the fire and bowl, the growing hum, shipwrecks joining in, and the hush cracking all build toward a resonant reconfiguration rather than a causal twist. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: each move intensifies the pattern of vibration versus silence until the final repricing of “silence” from absence to charged pause. Closure lands clearly when the hush is “transformed now—no longer empty absence, but full of potential,” with the world’s soundscape fundamentally reweighted. A minor limitation is that the cost of this transformation is more conceptual than dramatically felt, which keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal throughline is clean: client arrives under a time constraint, Kael administers the half-truth compound, the grotto interferes, and the counterfeit becomes real, producing a clear before/after. Closure is solid as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s practice and the grotto’s nature are redefined, and the client’s choice to stay has visible implications. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than concrete (Kael’s prior model of “half truths” is destabilized, the client forfeits their old life), which suits the piece but keeps it in a quieter register. Structure is one continuous, coherent scene with no orientation or lens issues.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: misdelivered envelope → meeting Clara → learning about founders → deciding to create a foundation → coming tonight to launch the first grant, with each step logically following. Orientation (who/where/when) is strong from the opening, and the piece holds a coherent causal lens throughout. Closure lands as a conceptual and practical reorientation of Elias’s life’s work, with the 5% tithe functioning as tangible cost, though the actual grant negotiation is summarized rather than dramatized. The structure is essentially one reflective scene framed by a present-night purpose; for elite venues, a bit more on-page pressure in the “tonight” frame would deepen the sense of decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is accumulative and coherent: isolation → mysterious tags → communal search → discovery of the mute artist → solstice dedication and bridge. Causality holds under a textural lens, with each development logically arising from the previous one, and the final dedication clearly resolves the central drive toward connection. However, much of the arc is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, which slightly blunts the impact of key turns (especially the discovery of the artist and the decision to build the bridge). Closure lands cleanly as a resonant reconfiguration with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clean early: one POV, a gondola on rooftop canals above a sleeping giant, under a strict nap-window. The causal chain is strong and legible: limited window → she extends time → reaches resonance chamber → unlocks the echo’s cage → pays via the giant waking early and losing the pendant’s power. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost: the echo is freed and documented, while the canals drain and her tool is inert until another nap. The main limitation is that the story runs as a single, straightforward arc without an additional structural surprise or secondary tightening that might deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one continuous scene, each beat (preparation, alignment, droplet event, realization) deepens the same central drive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he does not solve the mystery of his sister but redefines the “equation” so that unresolved loss is itself a stable, meaningful state with cost. Causality is subtle but coherent (his method enables seeing the new “pathway through possibility,” which in turn triggers the conceptual shift). The quietness of external action is intentional and works for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous arc from retrieval to distribution to retreat, with backstory anchored concretely in present action (e.g., the thermos of tea, the tape fragments). Causality is straightforward under an accumulative lens: outage → chosen timeframe → retrieval → placement → reflective reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing in the final image of the city and “magnetic memories humming in the walls.” The main limitation is that structural stakes stay low—no direct obstacle, threat, or jeopardized attempt ever complicates her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece uses a clean accumulative structure: present-moment observation → reflection on past methods → re-interpretation of the environment → concrete future decision. Causality is coherent under a textural lens; each natural detail (bindweed, moss, storm) deepens pressure on Maren’s belief in control until she commits to a different practice. Closure is solidly on the page in the choice to reconstruct the nursery differently and return “not as a commander but as a witness,” with the cost of fifteen wasted years acknowledged. There are no orientation issues or dangling setups, though the arc stays almost entirely internal, limiting structural surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: island → journey via rain trails → sinkhole exchange → return and conceptual turn, with clear causal links. The closure—reframing insomnia as vigil and immediately sketching—reads as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Stakes remain small-scale and quiet, which is fine, but the plot never tightens to a point where options feel sharply narrowed. Still, nothing crucial is left dangling, and the lens (primarily accumulative/textural with causal backbone) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: pilgrim’s arrival and request → cave’s escalating response → revelation that Elara’s role is witness/anchor, not predictor. Causality is coherent under a largely accumulative lens: the “steadily unpredictable” harmonies prefigure the cave’s awakening and explain why Elara’s gift fails here. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—her identity as clairvoyant redefined with a visible cost (relinquishing certainty) and gain. The only limit is that the key turn is more ontological than decisional, so story pressure stays contemplative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival → artifact discovery → visionary flashback → emotional handoff → communal reassembly → conceptual closure, all under one continuous scene and POV. Causality is quiet but coherent—finding the valve leads to vision, which prompts the encounter with the woman, which then reweights the valve and his archival purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when Kael reframes archives as resistance and the valve’s meaning shifts from failed retreat to enduring connection, with a clear emotional cost in ongoing, patient labor. A slight weakness is that external stakes remain low-key and no concrete obstacle ever truly threatens his aim, which keeps the structural tension from feeling fully critical.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is tight: a single continuous scene that moves cleanly from discovery (cracks) to threshold (phantom punch) to commitment (boarding the train). Causality is solid—each step (noticing geometry, following the cracks, using the ticket punch) naturally triggers the next, and the closure unit is a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration when she validates the ticket and crosses into the archive. Stakes and cost are conceptually clear but a bit under-pressurized on the page; there’s little genuine uncertainty that she’ll go through with it once the train appears. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and never in doubt, supporting an accumulative, causal drive.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal: work at the tower → discovery of the tile → visionary experience → all-night redesign → morning unveiling. The drive lens is primarily causal with a textural overlay, and the closure—a concrete reconfiguration of the tower and Mara’s role—lands clearly on the page. The cost is mostly internal (relinquishing her protective detachment), and though subtle, it’s legible in her changed stance with visitors. There are no orientation or motivation breaks; everything set up early (locals’ beliefs, humming stones, migration) pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is tight and coherent: storm intensifies → corridors form → he enters the mutiny’s eye → the amulet shatters → conceptual revelation and emotional reorientation. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end, and there’s no orientation debt—who/where/when are legible early despite the lyric density. Cost is present (he destroys his last tangible link to his lover and risks annihilation), though the danger of dimensional shear remains mostly hypothetical rather than felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine: waiting → spotting the guard’s deviation → seizing the opening → committing to a plan with concrete tactics (server room, tea, drops). Closure lands as a charged poise: she has chosen the morally fraught course and timed the moment, with cost implied but not yet paid. Some crucial beats (actual breach, direct confrontation with the judge/system) are summarized rather than dramatized, which keeps the structural arc from feeling fully tested on the page. Orientation in time, place, and goal is solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural drive is clear: his ongoing gilding practice versus the thinning present culminates when the lamp’s hum dips and he rushes to finish. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the final sheet adheres and “not just one time but all times simultaneously” are captured, reweighting the premise with conceptual cost (the alternative is oblivion). Causality is coherent—lamp readings → pages → reinforced against void—but the arc is essentially a single continuous effort that intensifies rather than a structurally sharp turn. The stakes and before/after are legible, though the decisive change is more conceptual than dramatically punctuated.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece functions as an accumulative/textural mosaic where the repetitions of containers, tides, and memory-fragments build toward a conceptual repricing of “erasure” and “archive.” Orientation (who/where/what) is clear early, and the pattern of moving through the labyrinth and collecting textures is consistent. Closure lands in the shift from seeking the “texture of memories” to realizing they have become that texture, which reweights the entire premise with a felt, if quiet, cost. Still, the story leans almost entirely on exposition and interior summary without a clearly escalating sequence of on-page beats, keeping it below elite-structure territory.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: present-time in the observatory, deepened by memory and the progressive activation of the shell and cello, flows steadily toward the fog-walk. Causality is coherent under this lens—playing leads to visions, acceptance, and a reconfiguration of her life’s work. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she abandons myth-busting as the defining frame and embraces the riddle as process rather than answer, with a clear before/after. Stakes remain mostly internal and could be tightened by one concrete, irreversible choice beyond symbolic departure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: orientation is immediate, and the piece follows a causal build from gentrification notices to covert organizing to the approach of inspection boats. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Maya crystallizes a stance (serve the future by subverting privatization from within) with a clear before/after. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than dramatized in confrontation, but it is legible in her acceptance that they “couldn’t stop the privatization entirely.” Escalation is modest and mostly preparatory, yet coherent under a causal/situational hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous night-to-dawn scene with a ticking corporate/micro-timer and a clear before/after once the drills start. Causality is solid—her decision to stay leads to physical risk, to capturing the image, to witnessing the start of extraction—and the chemical plaque blooms in a way that closes the loop. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she cannot stop the loss, only reframe it for the future at real emotional cost. The drive lens (largely situational with causal support) is consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clear: drone crash → diagnostic method → repair and recalibration → launch before the Vespertine clears harbor, all under a visible time limit. Structure is tight single-scene with a lucid closure beat where the drone departs and her internal stance reconfigures (Earned Stasis/RR with emotional cost tied to past failure). The main limitation is that the piece never quite tests the possibility of failure on the page—no real hiccup in the repair or near-miss to tighten the last third—so the climax reads controlled rather than knife-edge. Nonetheless, closure lands clearly with a before/after and cost rooted in her history.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clear and causal: the falcon’s return signals thaw → recognition of last chance → decoding condensation → journey to the lake’s center → confirmation and transmission. Closure is solid: the world’s maps are literally redrawn, and the lake’s poised transformation reweights what came before. However, all obstacles yield fairly easily once the method appears; there’s no serious setback or complication, so the arc feels more like an elegant unveiling than a pressured sequence. Still, for a quiet, concept-driven piece, the single tightening around “now or never” works well.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: a single continuous scene building from quiet tuning to the archway’s near-collapse and subsequent “song.” Cause and effect hold—her altered rhythm and placement of the fork stabilize the arch and reconfigure the contract between city and land. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the arch becomes “no longer ancient but newborn,” and the first new structure rises. The main limitation is the relative softness of on-page jeopardy; success feels likely once the fork begins to shudder, so the cost is more retrospective than acutely felt in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: distress signal → descent → discovery of suspended diver + vial → memory-vision explaining the temple’s rules → choice to override instinct → escape and aftermath, with a clear before/after in Elara’s relation to grief and risk. Closure is solidly on the page: she survives through the counterintuitive mechanism and reconfigures the meaning of the signal and of her own loss (a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration). The exposition through inherited memory is efficient and integrated, though it leans on a single, dense info-transfer moment that slightly softens the sense of on-page testing or uncertainty. Time/oxygen plausibility is stretched but not enough to break the internal logic or the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clean: inherited incarceration → story-saturated lighthouse → preparation (whispering lies into stone, taking the lattice) → ascent → hover-escape to the boat under a time limit (“before they find the bodies”). The world rule that stories shape reality is introduced early and paid off coherently in his hovering, so the speculative logic holds. Closure is solid—a decisive change with conceptual repricing as he becomes rumor—but the “clock” (shift change, body discovery) never bites into tactics on the page, so structural pressure feels a bit soft. The piece runs as a single, legible scene with backstory well anchored to present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: centuries of haunting → descendant enters orchard → bead-induced visions → transfer of bead → planting → curse release and ghost’s dissolution. Structure holds a single clear drive (repaying debt/ending haunting) and lands a decisive change with visible cost (orchard withers, Eira dissolves, Julian left altered). The one convenience is how quickly Julian articulates “You’re here to repay a debt across lifetimes,” which slightly telescopes discovery. Still, closure under a causal lens is strong and legible with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: nightly sewing builds toward the seventh-morning descent to the heart of the labyrinth and the decisive final stitch. Causality holds under a textural lens—her repeated actions deepen and finally reconfigure the canyon’s state. Closure is strong: the canyon’s shudder and changed tide pools clearly mark a before/after with conceptual and emotional cost. The main limitation is that structural pressure feels more ritual than contested; opposition and risk remain primarily conceptual rather than dramatized in discrete turns.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: excavation → discovery of sundial base → purposeful wandering/retrieval → reconstruction → realignment and prayer, with each step deepening the central drive. Causality is coherent under a textural lens; the orchard’s pattern and the buried timekeepers motivate her method rather than feeling arbitrary. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the sundial’s shadow now measures exile/return and forges a living bridge between diaspora and dead. The cost—facing ancestral pain and binding her life to this charged grove—is present but somewhat conceptual, not dramatized through a concrete lost option or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: last mail pickup → need to decode hidden message → envelope/CRT/chalk cipher → successful encoding and dispatch → quiet aftermath. The time constraint provides a structural spine, and the closure (letter sent with secret contents, chalk left to erode, Kael moving on) reads as a coherent Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. There are no real causality breaks or confusing shifts; orientation is strong from the opening. The main limitation is that the central problem is solved without meaningful resistance, so structural tension never tightens to a sharp point.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Mira reads the coup in her work, intensifies her efforts, encodes a warning, and delivers it when the captain arrives. The structure is tight for the length, with one clear escalation (the pattern clarifying three days before the coup) and a coherent closure where a specific adjacent possibility is chosen and acted upon. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: the empire has not yet fallen because of her intervention, with a felt conceptual cost in how fragile that choice is. The main limitation is that the on-page risk feels slightly abstracted—there’s little sense of what would happen to Mira personally if she’s exposed—which keeps the cost more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: shard → corridor through spirits/mangroves → liminal clearing → conjured hospital room → spoken apology. The structure moves linearly with one central tightening (arrival at the clearing/timeframe) and a clear closure beat where she witnesses and speaks in the unvisited moment. The rules of the world are internally consistent enough for the emotional logic to land, and the cost—that Mara still dies while only the wound of absence changes—is explicit. A slightly frictionless passage through the spirits’ domain keeps it just short of truly harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds via layered inscriptions and reflective associations rather than discrete plot turns. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when and the anesthetized child), and the structural throughline—Mara reading and reinterpreting the cast—is coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the boy’s body-text becomes “seeds,” and the coral shifts from relic to promise, with an on-page sense of ongoing cost in Mara’s endless translational labor. The main limitation is low overt change in circumstance; the before/after is conceptual and emotional rather than decisively situational.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clear: follow the knowledge network → discover fresco fragment → use film and light ritual → reprice her relationship to joy and art. Causality holds under a lyric, slightly surreal frame, and the dream logic is taught early and maintained. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she exits with a new internal stance and a charged object—though cost remains primarily retrospective rather than actively contested in-scene. Nothing crucial feels unkept or arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build: arrival and setup, experiments with sound, intensifying realizations, and a quiet but clear closure when she shifts practice and leaves the nickel. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each sensory/reflective beat leads naturally into the next recognition without hard plot turns. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: the garden redefines restoration and she relinquishes her old frame, with the offering of the coin marking a before/after. The main limitation is low external pressure; the arc is smooth rather than sharply tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal spine is clean: covert gardening → encrypted meeting → activation of the seed → drone incursion → raid and capture. Backstory is efficiently braided into the present and directly informs the stakes of the scene. Closure is strong and legible: Elias is taken, but the resistance’s network (moth, beanstalk) persists, giving a clear before/after with cost. No major orientation or causality slips, though the raid happens a bit conveniently fast without much tactical adjustment on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: present-tense singing in the shell → reef transformation → far-future discovery, with a clear before/after (isolated grief vs. embodied armistice). Causality is mythic but legible: her songs cause the polyps to become blossoms and the reef to “negotiate peace,” leading to her dissolution into the environment. The closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara becomes the reef and the postcard erases, with visible cost in her surrender of self and origin. The drive lens remains stable, though the lack of a single sharp turning beat keeps it below the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clean: discovery of the cracked tube → recognition of its resonance → decision to use it → temporary illumination → loss of the tool, with clear cost. Structure is linear and coherent, with one dominant throughline and a solid closure beat when the tube crumbles and the orchids retain a “temporary sun.” The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a causal undercurrent, and the final reconfiguration of her task under renewed but costly conditions lands. What keeps this below the very top tier is that the structural turn (“She understood then what she must do”) is somewhat declarative and under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene that moves from entry into the archive to the ritual to Julian’s arrival and a charged-choice ending. Causality is coherent under a largely situational lens—her fear of permanent separation leads to the ritual, which summons a concrete set of options at closure. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the choice space is explicit (accept or let the vows dissolve) with a real cost. The only limiting factor is that the turn when Julian arrives and steps in feels somewhat foregone, with little on-page resistance or surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the letters → decoding the encrypted philosophy → decision to preserve the old system and sabotage the upgrade, with the present scene as execution of that choice. Orientation is excellent from the opening, and the drive lens (causal with a thematic overlay) holds through closure. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: he forecloses the upgrade path at personal risk and settles into a conspiratorial maintenance of mercy. The main limitation is structural: most key turns occur in summarized backstory, so the on-page scene has low dynamic change and functions more as a confirmation beat than a pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: stolen artifact → forged identity → detectives closing in → arrival of the meteorite via Orion → decision between selling/fleeing or trusting the archivist and owning her name. The structure is essentially one continuous scene braided with tightly anchored backstory, and the final beats (releasing Orion, descending to the shopkeeper) clearly deliver a decisive change with visible cost. Closure is strong, but the external threat (detectives) stays mostly summarized and off-page, which softens the sense of immediate jeopardy at the climax. Still, under a primarily causal lens with lyric accumulation, the ending lands solidly.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: observatory → furniture grain → logbook code → interpretive alignment → threshold crossing. Causality under a textural lens is solid—each new detail reweights the central question of distance and passage rather than feeling like modular ornament. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing when Elara decides that “one had to become the threshold” and steps into the maze with a reconfigured understanding of her father’s work. The cost of this shift (leaving safety for an unknowable maze) is implied more than dramatized, which slightly softens impact at an elite standard.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: initial task and setting, encounter with the phantom, a mid-story technical/ontological problem (need for a luminous pocket with biological activation), and a climax where the shared exhale solves it and reweights meaning. Causality holds under a Hybrid (causal + accumulative) lens—each step (alignment work, failing seals, bioluminescent bloom, breath-triggered protocols) follows logically and tightens the situation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s understanding of belonging and the facility’s return to dormancy with her ascent delineate a clear before/after with cost (the phantom’s dissolution, the relinquished connection). A slightly stronger on-page sense of the ticking clock and tactical adaptation around “until sunrise” could have lifted this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens, and the pattern (seeds → harvesting → reflection → revaluation) is taught early and held consistently. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing of “missing pieces” from error to necessary silence, which is on-page and coherent. However, the progression between beats is relatively flat: many sentences do similar work, and there is no single sharp turn or escalation beyond a gentle thematic deepening. Structure is clean but not yet tight or varied enough for top-tier short lyric fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene where Kael prepares, executes, and observes an engineered chain of coincidences, culminating in the woman altering her route and his bow. Causality is coherent—each environmental element (music, jasmine, prism, child, busker) links into the next in a readable chain. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the arcade is re-seen as a “theater of possibility,” and the woman’s routine is quietly diverted. Stakes remain modest and largely conceptual, with no strong on-page price, which keeps this strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is coherent: the moonstone collection → realization that exile has reached its final phase → inscription → transformation forms a clear arc. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration when she becomes a living archive and joins the garden’s ecology, with the nostalgia ban and approaching alarms providing conceptual cost. Causality is internally consistent under a lyric, non-literal rule-set; no orientation issues. The main limitation is that much of the “cost” (authorities, human ties) remains offstage, making the structural stakes feel more proclaimed than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean and coherent: arrival → intention to “commune” → stone/ripple experiment → prismatic dawn realization → return, all under a single, continuous scene. As an accumulative/textural design, it steadily layers light, glass, and ripple imagery toward a Conceptual Repricing of his life’s work and nocturnal worries. Closure is clear: he returns to his workshop with reweighted understanding rather than answers, a credible earned stasis with conceptual cost. The stakes are modest and internal, but the narrative never loses orientation or its throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous nocturnal scene anchored on the ridge, with backstory interleaved in a way that consistently refracts the present conversation. Causality is simple but solid under a situational/accumulative lens—Maya comes intending some kind of reckoning, finds Elias, chooses disclosure, and the marble transfer plus his altered stance at dawn provides resonant closure. The before/after is legible: she goes from solitary penance to shared fluency; he moves from paralysis to a tentative readiness. Nothing crucial teleports or gets retrofitted, and the final beats land with a clear sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: trial balloons → data return → pattern adjustment → gauge settling, with a clear before/after in the status of the timelines. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing: despair becomes a coefficient, hope a derivable quantity, and the gauge’s “arrival” reading marks a completed pass. However, the path is very smooth—no real structural surprise, setback, or costful fork—so the decisive change feels somewhat inevitable rather than hard-won. As an accumulative lyric, it holds together, but it does not yet feel structurally indispensable or tense enough for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean and legible: discover diaries → learn of vault → retrieve film → conceptual revaluation at the end. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence of discoveries coheres and closure is clear, with the final understanding reweighting the earlier exploration. Causality is intact, though the middle lacks a strong tightening of options and reads as a smooth progression of finds. The reflective passages stay anchored in present action, avoiding major orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: borrowed heartbeat → song → mirror’s shift → cascading futures → bells and dissolution. Causality is clear within the lyric frame, and the live clock (the hour and the bells) provides a satisfying tightening toward a Charged Poise ending where the possibilities remain but Elias must leave. Closure lands: there is a before/after in the terrace’s mirrors and in the clockmaker’s fleeting sense of having been “briefly infinite,” with a conceptual and emotional cost. The only limitation is that the global drive feels more atmospheric than sharply goal-driven, which slightly softens the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: rare celestial alignment → convened rite → challenge and doubt → shared planting and sealing the pact. Orientation is immediate and solid, and the ritual’s mechanics (mixed grave soil, shared crops, seasonal handoff) provide a concrete closure unit where options and obligations change. The cost is legible in the acceptance of an imperfect, long-horizon peace tied to ongoing labor rather than a single treaty. The drive lens stays causal throughout, with no structural jolts or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and legible: years-ago river diversion → present drought and excavation → burial → return of rain, all under one continuous scene. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the tightening comes from the nearing storm and the approach to the egg’s burial, culminating in a quiet but clear closure (he has “manufactured drought to manufacture meaning”). Causality holds, with no teleporting information or broken rules, and the final image reconfigures the opening situation with a felt conceptual cost. The main limitation is that the outcome is never really in doubt, so dramatic options narrow less than they could.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: death → narrow time window → forbidden journey → unlocking → entry and gathering echoes, with a clear before/after reconfiguration once she succeeds. The causal throughline is intact, and the closure—Lys stepping out of conformity’s script by accessing forbidden memory—lands conceptually with cost implied. The “three minutes before the household stirred” clock introduces urgency but is not deeply felt in the pacing, which leans into extended lyric reflection that would realistically overrun that window. Still, the piece reads as a coherent, hybrid causal/accumulative scene with solid closure rather than an outline or fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: argument → retreat to dome → partial epiphanies → encounter with blind storyteller → decisive burning of tools. The structure holds as a single throughline with one off-page inciting beat and two clear on-page tightening moves (rewinding the tape; hearing the technician story). Closure lands decisively with the fire and the “reverse motion…of intent,” a clear before/after with cost. No orientation issues or broken causality, and the Cold War anecdote elegantly locks into Marcus’s arc rather than feeling like an add-on.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece adopts an accumulative/textural structure in a single continuous scene, with clear anchoring of who/where/when and no causality breaks. Closure lands via an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the method “build, signal, release” is enacted through to the dismantling of the oldest tower, and her planned departure once the final butterfly leaves reframes the entire ritual with a quiet but legible cost. The drive—witnessing the end of a species with clear-eyed attention—remains coherent throughout and is tightened by the explicit population-count awareness and the approaching end by nightfall. While the escalation is subtle and mostly conceptual rather than event-driven, the before/after of the ritual’s completion versus her eventual departure is clear and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean accumulative structure: receive relic → carefully reconfigure rope → align it with the card → illumination and communal payoff. Closure is strong as a Resonant Reconfiguration: her earlier failure is conceptually repriced by this successful preservation of names. Causality is coherent and motivation-driven, though there’s little sense of real risk that might derail her plan once it starts. The cost is primarily historical and emotional rather than sharply dramatized in the present, which keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: preparation → ingestion → storm/dream → revaluation → departure, all under a single, coherent frame. Causality is sound under an accumulative/textural lens: her ritual leads to the dream which reconfigures the directive and justifies leaving the bunker. Closure is strong, with a clear before/after—guardian who obeys vs. former guardian who walks away—with a conceptual and role-level cost. The only constraint is that the stakes stay mostly interior, so the turn doesn’t feel razor-edged in practical terms.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: preparation → decoding → activation → covenant, with each step causally linked. The closure is solid—a decisive ritual act that reconfigures his relationship to both knowledge and devotion, with visible cost (blood, relinquished parsimony). The drive is primarily accumulative/textural but underpinned by clear cause-effect beats, and no set-up is left hanging. Stakes are mostly conceptual rather than survival-based, but they’re legible and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: sanctuary introduction → confrontation with resentment → attempt via the pin → release and dissolution, all causally linked. Closure lands clearly with a Decisive Change (resentment dissolves, reality “settles into its new configuration”) and the recurring pin pattern is paid off. Orientation is solid despite the abstract premise; who/where/when are legible early. The only weakness is that the possibility of failure or cost to Elias is underdeveloped, so the arc feels a touch frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative ritual structure is coherent and satisfying: finding the sextant, preparing the forge, synchronized breathing, and the dream’s return form a clean arc. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration, with the dream contained and the orchard subtly “found” in glass, making the before/after legible. Causality is soft but consistent within the piece’s logic; nothing feels arbitrarily introduced late. The main limitation is that the outcome never feels truly in doubt, so the cost at closure is conceptual rather than dramatically sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: a return to the site, the surprise of the orchard, ascent and discovery (ribbon, forgotten bag), a working sequence, and a quiet but decisive reconfiguration in the ending. Causality is solidly accumulative—each discovery (trees, ribbon, tools) alters how Mara engages the space and deepens the central question about what “mending” means here. Closure lands as an earned stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she shifts from fulfilling an old contract to entering a new, seasonal, unwritten one with visible trade-offs (accepting ruin, unresolved daughter). The stakes are modest but coherent, and no set-up is left dangling, though the shift from professional obligation to personal/spiritual contract is somewhat explained rather than left wholly to image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/lyric drive lens, and the pattern is taught early and maintained: reflection and small actions (retreating to bathroom, inquiring of tree, handling the shell) ratchet toward a conceptual repricing of the orchard and her role. Closure lands as a clean conceptual reconfiguration when she understands the orchard as “a process” she herself planted and accepts her eternal curatorship. Causality is soft but coherent—each beat leads reasonably to the next, and there are no glaring orientation issues. The main limitation is that escalation feels more like a steady hum than a pronounced tightening, so the final insight, while earned, doesn’t hit with maximal structural force.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: chrononaut’s paradox damage → need to preserve erased concepts → deciphering the diary → mountain’s reconfiguration → renegotiation of temporal debt → access to the Library and conceptual “rescue.” Structure is linear and legible with one dominant drive; the closure is a conceptual repricing where rescue is redefined from saving people to preserving lessons through acceptance. Some key moves—especially the descent and initial negotiation with the mountain—are somewhat summarized rather than fully pressured in scene, which softens the sense of risk. Still, the before/after (violent intervention vs patient preservation) is explicit and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: ship → midway distortions → crow’s nest → garden, with each step tightening toward the retrieval of the twin/name. The closure is solidly on the page: Maya’s stance shifts from reclaiming a lost past to weaving a new, shared existence, and the reunion with the twin plus the melting card provide a clear before/after. Causality is more mythic than linear, but consistent with the taught rules (narrative threads, reality responding to memory), so there’s no orientation debt. The main limitation is that obstacles feel largely atmospheric; movement never seriously risks failure, which keeps the structural cost conceptual rather than dramatically sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: door appears at the rare alignment → she brings the seal → rope chamber → reconfiguration → insertion of seal → history’s merge → reconfigured world. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and never lost, and the closure beat (the treaty on the bench and changed campus) delivers a clear before/after. However, the path from problem to solution is almost frictionless: no setback, complication, or true risk challenges the plan once she starts, and the cost of rewriting reality is underexplored. Structure is solid and publishable but lacks the kind of knotty complication an elite market typically expects.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: world chaos → descent → diagnosis via cracks → deliberate inversion of harmonics → manifested hush with a clear before/after. The piece functions as a single continuous scene with one main tightening, as she realizes she must actively conjure the bloom rather than wait for it, leading to an on-page reconfiguration where the world’s sonic state changes. Closure is solid—she has created a silence that depends on her continued tending—but the threat of failure or reversal is only lightly sketched, so the cost and narrowing of options could be sharper. Structure is strong and publishable but not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the prism → retrocognitive revelations about the engineers and star-timing → climb and alignment → decisive rekindling of the beacon, all under a clear ticking clock (the constellation alignment within hours). Orientation (who/where/when) is crisp from the opening, and the piece maintains a single, coherent drive lens through to a concrete closure beat. The ending delivers a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the world’s silent beacons answer, confirming the long-suspected pattern at real scale. The only limit is that no reversal complicates the plan once she understands it; execution proceeds almost without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clear and coherent: solidified fog → descent to the forecourt → measuring shadows → anomalous founder memory → realization and merging. The drive lens is firmly textural/accumulative, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration in which Elara’s role and the nature of memory are reweighted. Causality is soft but consistent—each new observation of the storm and stones prompts a deeper interpretive step. The cost of closure (her becoming part of the archive, the valley sealed) is present and conceptually felt, though not dramatized through overt external consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: arrival under siege → ascent and discovery → ritual ignition → transformed atmosphere and aftermath, all in one continuous, legible scene. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the escalation of chant, fire, and environmental response coheres, and closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration—the fortress’s emotional climate shifts, the mosaic is destroyed to transmit its “note.” Causality holds: his actions with the rag knot and mosaic directly yield the new patterns and altered mood. The cost is present but a bit light—the siege context recedes rather than confronting his intervention directly.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: one continuous scene, single POV, with the drive lens being how attention to liminal spaces reconfigures their relational question. Causality is modest but coherent: the initial unanswered question prompts observation, cicada story, then the symbolic transfer of the object and an agreement on “charged poise” rather than resolution. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the relationship’s state is redefined as an intentional in-between, with the cicada and stars charging that stance. Stakes and cost are understated but legible—the risk of continued ambiguity and possible dissolution—though the on-page sense of what might be lost is more suggested than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: one continuous episode framed by the weekly inversion rule and a clear goal (capture the gilded hush before gravity resets). Causality is straightforward—her climb enables discovery, which enables collection, which forces a timed retreat—without stray set-ups or dropped threads. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara returns to the same bunker with a fundamentally reweighted relationship to silence and confinement. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece functions well under an accumulative/textural lens: pressure builds through the approaching period of negative sound, the calibrated tools, and the tightening twelve-minute window of stillness. Causality is clean: train passes, pressure drops, Mara exploits the acoustic vacuum to effect an internal shift in her passenger. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—silence redefined from threat to comfort—in a clearly legible before/after. The cost is subtle but present in the relinquishing of grief and in Mara’s vigilant labor to “keep them adrift” within that pocket.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal throughline—ruby flake pulses → mural discovery → orchard → stairway → repository—is clean, legible, and escalates logically. The piece adheres to a single-POV causal drive with one temporal window (pre-dawn), and the quantum/liminal rules are internally consistent at this scale. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: Elara achieves her goal (access) but “refuses” the throne and reframes leadership as preservation, with the stairway dissolving as a visible cost/limit. The structure is a bit “walkthrough-like” at times (problem → immediate portal → next stage), so while coherent and satisfying, the turns feel slightly pre-ordained rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is tight: brief backstory, inciting knock, confrontation/lesson, and a quiet but decisive parting that functions as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is clean—his careful burning enables her to track him, their scars enable the lesson, the lesson enables her departure. The closure beat (“I can breathe now” and her leaving) lands with a palpable before/after. The one weakness is how frictionlessly the magical teaching via scars resolves the central need, slightly undercutting felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative around a single throughline: glitch-text warnings → bolt’s arrival → her decision → transformation → reconfigured stasis on the farm. Causality within the speculative frame is coherent (texts foreshadow the bolt; her understanding of multiversal pyramids motivates volunteering; the diamond and silence of the texts close the loop). Closure lands as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing: she becomes the compression point and restructures the pyramid, with a clear before/after. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized—her sacrifice of multiplicity into a “singular timeline” is potent but could be made slightly more tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael installs the crank, sound generates standing waves, waves reveal evidence, evidence is recorded to end the dynasty. Structure is a single, coherent scene with a legible before/after: prior suspicions vs specific coordinates and proof that will topple the Aureate regime. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—the realization that the palace gardens are grown over mass graves—and a Charged Poise in the image of Kael finishing the transcription as the waves fade. The cost is mostly conceptual and off-page (what this will do to the dynasty, what it cost the last archivist), so the ending is resonant but not as viscerally tested as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is coherent: entry → study of the program → ritual movement → disarming → transformation → door. Causality is clear under a textural lens; each stage (reading patterns, speaking allegiance, removing armor) intensifies the same central drive rather than feeling like “and then” ornamentation. Closure lands solidly when he steps through the door of liquid light, a decisive change with conceptual cost. Stakes remain primarily abstract/metaphysical, but the before/after is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: dust-reading → anomaly → button/letter → pattern of other youth → Maya’s new indexing practice and reframed understanding. Causality is consistent and easy to follow, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where she adopts the button “as a method,” reweighting everything before it. The cost is subtle but present—she accepts her grief as part of a larger fabric instead of seeking erasure—yet the stakes remain almost entirely interior, limiting punch. Still, for a quiet story, the before/after line is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: failed plans → puddle-map discovery → tunnel descent → key activation → citywide broadcast → escape and regime’s narrative slippage. The structure holds as a single, escalating sequence with a decisive, on-page closure: the transmission and its aftermath reconfigure the world’s options at real conceptual cost to the Ministry. The only structural softness is the near-total absence of active resistance or complication once he reaches the lagoon—no misfire, obstacle, or near-capture tests the plan. Still, the “backup contingency” revealed at the right moment provides a satisfying tightening and earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear problem (prophecy reawakening via dew), escalating attempts, and a contained resolution. Causality is coherent under a mostly causal/accumulative lens—each new formation of dew intensifies the threat and prompts a deeper tactical response in how he shapes silence. Closure is solid Earned Stasis: he averts this iteration but accepts an ongoing, costly vigilance. The world-scale stakes remain abstract but they’re at least locally tested through the concrete “last dewdrop” beat, so the ending feels legible and closed.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the moonstone dust → decision to apply folklore → prodding the heartwood → leaves’ pictographic message → rearrangement of monuments → transformation and release of spores. Closure lands as a decisive change and conceptual repricing: he stops cataloging endings and becomes the vessel of future growth, with the cost of relinquishing his human life implied. The “hush” as a temporal window gives some clock pressure, though it could bite harder. Overall structure is tight and coherent for a single-scene, accumulative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly causal: clues → greenhouse → staircase → waterfall/stones → retrieval → reconfiguration with the chronometer. The core drive (recovering the compass to vindicate her mentor) remains coherent and surfaces again in the closing beat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she both secures the object and re-prices her relationship to uncertainty. There are no orientation or logic breaks, and the single scene window is well-contained.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is clean: Kael’s fall via his True Name → Elara’s decision to work alone → her calculated ritual with the coin → his altered return. Structure is linear and easy to follow, with a legible before/after and an on-page closure beat when Kael materializes. The main weakness is how the middle is compressed into summary (“She worked through the night…”) so the breakthrough to “the limit of alchemy itself” feels more declared than escalated through concrete obstacles. Cost at closure is conceptual rather than plot-tested, which keeps this below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrive at gorge → play warped harp → draw souls → focus on one resistant soul → breakthrough laughter → cascading releases → quiet denouement. Causality holds tightly under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where Elara’s tool shifts from collection to liberation. The cost is legible in her bleeding fingers and emotional heaviness as she descends toward further work. Escalation is more atmospheric than peril-driven, but it coheres and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece holds cleanly as a single accumulative scene: waking in the forest → orienting to body/setting → moving toward the clearing → encountering and internalizing the “equation” → releasing the strap. Causality is more experiential than plot-driven, but the closure—a Conceptual Repricing where forgiveness becomes a calculable transformation—lands clearly and with cost. Orientation (who/where/what’s happening) is established early and never lost despite the lyric density. The main structural weakness is a relative lack of on-page turn before the clearing, giving the midsection a slightly plateaued feel.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clear and satisfying: Elara arrives with a commission, activates the lens, discovers Mara, performs the translation, then releases and departs—one coherent arc with a strong accumulative/textural drive. Causality is intact and clean (lens → revelation → intervention → altered memory), and the “eternal instant” provides a functional frame for reflection without disorienting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara’s status in memory shifts, and Elara’s task concretely reaches completion with visible consequences. The only limitation is that the scene unfolds with almost no resistance or complication, which keeps the arc comparatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → investigation via dust/crack → revelation of the mainspring and ghost → installation in the elevator → release/transfer and departure, with clear causal linkage. The inferred drive lens is Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural, and it holds: each new detail (dust, crack, mainspring, shaft, buzzing lights) reweights the haunting rather than introducing arbitrary rules. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the elevator is reframed as a liminal time-keeping machine, and Maya’s understanding of buildings’ “hidden elevators” is enlarged. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, and while that suits the mode, a sharper on-page sense of what risks were in play would strengthen the decisiveness of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: frost pattern → identification of rupture point → use of bottled whisper in the press → printing a “topology of breaking” → applying it to the central trunk → systemic rupture. Closure is decisive and on the page: the frozen world transitions into motion and noise, with a clear before/after and a conceptual cost (loss of perfect stasis). The piece holds a coherent causal lens throughout despite its lyricism, and there are no orientation problems. The main limitation is that the success of her plan feels somewhat foregone, with no structural feint or serious risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: discovery of the shard → experiments with storms and mirrors → council confrontation → decision to stay, all cohering around a single interpretive drive. Causality is largely conceptual rather than event-driven, but each step plausibly follows from Kaelen’s prior realizations and values, and the archaeological dispute gives the piece a spine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and decisive change—he shifts role from failed revolutionary to guardian of visible time, with cost implied in his solitude and abandonment of the broader cause. There are no real orientation issues and no unresolved set-ups that undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: philosopher’s chip leads him to the chamber, midnight approaches, he performs the ritual, the tether catches, the world is saved. The drive lens reads as Causal with mythic overtones, and the closure is a Decisive Change (dawn restored, chip integrated). However, many key stakes are delivered via exposition (“If it ceased... the sun would never rise again”) rather than dramatized through concrete impediments or near-failure, so the cost at closure is more conceptual than felt. Still, the before/after is legible, and the final image of the rust singing and time “between one heartbeat and the next” lands as a coherent cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: factory → compass vision → descent → lagoon → reconfigured understanding creates a coherent before/after. Causality is intact under the chosen lens—each step arises logically from the previous discovery, and the “hinged awakenings” provide clear structural pivots. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: she emerges with a transformed relationship to mystery, carrying the hush back into her future life. The cost is mostly conceptual and emotional rather than narratively pressured, but it’s legible and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: storm → archway → lantern slide → reoriented practice → dawn departure forms a clear before/after with a conceptual repricing of guidance and making. Causality is soft but legible (storm and GPS failure force shelter, shelter reveals artifact, artifact reshapes her approach), and the closure image of her walking away with a new artistic mandate feels earned. Stakes are relatively contained (no real sense that her physical safety or livelihood hangs in the balance), which limits impact but does not break structure. The ending offers a solid resonant reconfiguration, even if it leans into explanation over dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure—a seasonal arc from late autumn through the end of winter into thaw—organizes the causal chain cleanly: pavilion → cathedral window study → revelation → mural revision. The drive lens reads as accumulative with a causal spine; each visit to the cathedral and the sexton’s explanation meaningfully advances Lyra’s understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “blooming at night,” with emotional cost in letting go of a long-held misreading of her mother. There are no orientation or causality breaks; the quiet build is controlled and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causality is strong: diary → retrocognitive trap → realization about semaphore → choice to descend → debris arrangement → lagoon reveals evidence → revaluation of archiving. The structure is linear and coherent with a clear inciting incident and a satisfying closure that reconfigures the premise rather than merely ending the scene. The Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing at the end (trap as communion, archiving as confrontation) is on the page and costs him peace of mind and safety. A slight sense of inevitability softens tension—outcome feels assured once he understands the “circuit”—but not enough to break the spine.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: discovery of the bottle → deliberate reconstruction via working memory → principled rejection of simple restoration → chosen use of the bottle to seed a Post-Wish society, with an on-page transformation as closure. The drive lens reads primarily causal with a conceptual flourish at the end, and the ghost-town revival is legibly a consequence of her tactics and stance. The main limitation is that resistance and complication are minimal—once she chooses the harder path, the outcome arrives almost frictionlessly—so cost is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: noticing the anomalous shaving leads to realization, then ingestion, then transformation, culminating in a conceptual re-framing of the orchard as cylinder. Causality holds within a lyric, slightly mystical logic, and the third-grade memory is cleanly cued and paid off as method. Closure lands as a clear conceptual repricing—his life’s work redefined and the world subtly altered (ships guided by different stars). The cost and stakes, though present, remain more suggested than sharply dramatized, which keeps this short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: egg hatches → cap placed → entropy reversal → descent/merging → commitment to stay. Causality is legible within its lyrical logic, and the closure—her decision to remain “decreasing entropy with every breath” after reopening the covenant—functions as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. However, the price of this choice (what she gives up, what dangers remain) is gestured at more than dramatized, so the before/after is more thematic than sharply experiential. Still, the scene feels complete and structurally satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story tracks cleanly: storm approaching → recognition of the cost of sirens → preparation of the bell → zero-hour decision to change the warning system. Causality is clear and grounded in her profession, and the closure—she literally pulls the bell rope instead of using the siren switches—lands firmly. The cost is mostly conceptual and prospective (villagers must relearn listening; she departs from institutional practice) rather than concretely dramatized, but it is legible. Structure is linear with reflection judiciously interleaved and no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is clean: we move from solitary observation to intensifying meteor activity to a culminating shower and the final departure, with no orientation or causality slips. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he reframes his role and solitude and physically chooses to leave with the lantern glass as “compass,” giving a clear before/after. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than dramatized through hard consequences, but it reads as an earned shift in stance rather than a snap epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: ghosts appear, focus narrows to their interaction with the hives and the box, then resolves into Elias’s clarified purpose, functioning as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early; the beekeeping oasis and the post-fire wasteland are clear, and causality is consistent (fire → broken covenant → ghosts → transfer of burden). Closure lands via Elias’s choice to remain as witness and the box’s new function, with a clear before/after conceptual shift. Escalation is more textural than causal, and the beat with the sealed letter feels like a setup that’s deferred rather than integrated into this story’s structural pay-off.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: garage-sale messaging → journey to the emerald silo → interaction with the damaged capsule → transformation via the urn fragment. Causality under a textural/lyric lens holds: each step deepens the temporal premise and leads to the conceptual repricing that time should be experienced, not measured. Closure is solid and on-page—the urn dissolves into her chest, she becomes “archived in the continuous present,” and the garage sale ads persist as a pattern for others. The main limitation is that pressure is more philosophical than situational, so the sense of risk during the approach to and manipulation of the capsule never fully sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a calm pattern of morning tending, a sharp inciting incident when the kite string snaps, and a resolution where the kite flies again in altered form and the poet folds the event back into her ritual. Causality is intact and simple—the boy’s loss interrupts her work, her ethos guides how she responds, and that response reshapes both the kite and the morning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the final image of the lagoon holding “broken treasures” and her intention to return tomorrow reframes the day as another lesson in incompleteness. Stakes are modest but coherent under an accumulative/lyric lens, with no orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and accumulative: diagnosis → discovery of the diary → implementation of copper wiring → gradual awakening → final chord at his death. Causality holds and the six‑month frame provides a clear temporal spine, with seasons marking progress. Closure is strong in a Resonant Reconfiguration mode—the pillars’ “first full chord” and his peaceful death reweight everything before with clear cost (his life). The main limitation is that turns feel inevitable rather than pressured; there’s little sense of options narrowing or plans nearly failing.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a pilgrimage to the tower, reunion with fellow dissidents, experiment, and a conceptual reframing at the end. Causality is modest but coherent; Elara follows footprints, reaches the lab, runs tests, and Vance’s reading of the data crystallizes the “homecoming as reaction” idea. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing rather than a decisive plot turn, but it’s legible and earned. The drive lens reads as accumulative/textural and holds through the ending without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clean: descent → preparation → ritual fertilizing → contemplative close. Under a textural lens, the repeated liturgical actions and bird-guided adjustments build toward the final image of the “slow, inevitable siege of the battlefield.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, and the before/after—barren battlefield vs. charged, besieging garden—is legible. There’s minimal overt turning, but the structural cadence and conceptual repricing are well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: cylinder → riddle → prolonged search → discovery of the leaf → emotional reconfiguration. The story follows a clear accumulative pattern where each step tightens the emotional drive rather than adding new plot complications. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Ash’s relationship to Mara’s absence is reweighted through the leaf and remembered voice, with a palpable cost in the seven lost years. Structure is straightforward but fully functional, with no dead branches or unexplained leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from stasis in oppressive time dilation to the discovery of a fixed point and then to decisive action. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—her prolonged isolation, mapping impulse, and unique perception logically produce the ability to see and exploit the exit. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change (stepping into the threshold) that reconfigures her options. The “maintenance hatch existing in multiple timeframes” arrives a bit suddenly as a rule articulation but doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Kael ascends with a clear goal, confronts the guardian, uses the chess ritual to correct lies, and thereby repairs the sky and his own role. Closure is solidly on-page—a Decisive Change in the world’s condition and a Resonant Reconfiguration of Kael’s identity and the Concord’s history. Costs are implied more than dramatized; the risk of death and failure is stated but never sharply tested, so the victory feels relatively low-friction given world-scale stakes. Still, for this length the structure is coherent and complete, with no major orientation or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: approach → discovery → unbinding → public reading → reweighted final image. Causality is coherent, with each action naturally following the previous one, and the closure beat (sunlight on empty pawns as she reads the small gestures) lands as a clear conceptual repricing with cost. Orientation—who, where, when—is established early and never lost. Stakes of revealing the true ledger versus remaining safely complicit are implicit but legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal chain is clean: nightly substitutions → anomalous glow → discovery of the stone → revelation of the library’s true nature → decision to seed rather than erase. Structure is linear and legible, with one meaningful escalation pivot (finding and decoding the stone) leading into a decisive closing act at the summit. Closure is strong: Vey’s global tactic shifts from substitution to seeding, with the mountain’s reconfiguration and their choice to endure pain marking a clear before/after. The only ceiling on this category is that obstacles are largely internal and the progression from discovery to mastery is very smooth, with little resistance or complication in the decoding/using of the stone.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is clean: years of puzzle-decoding culminate in inserting the final thread, which reveals the truth about the prince, enabling Kaelen’s internal shift and physically unfreezing the village. The story holds a consistent Hybrid (causal plus accumulative/textural) drive lens, with the tactile accumulation of threads and patterns building to the conceptual click in the labyrinth. Closure is strong: his repricing of his guilt and the earned stasis of choosing to remain in the village both land with clear cost and consequence. No orientation or lens-clarity issues meaningfully mar the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation (seventeen mornings), immediate countdown (approaching ritual), catalytic intrusion (Lira), and conceptual closure (ritual destabilized, Kael’s cost paid). Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: more poems → more echoes → disrupted ritual; Kael’s shift from polished verses to raw doubt is pivotal. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of “truth” and “forgiveness” with on-page cost (Kael’s voice fading into bone). A slight tendency to summarize the climactic spread of “a thousand impromptu interpretations” keeps it from feeling fully dramatized at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: sinking workshop → memory-tank immersion → narrated repairs → statue’s awakening → workshop’s destruction, giving solid RR/CR closure. The ticking-clock from the acid sea and failing gears tightens structure without confusion, and the single continuous scene holds focus. Closure has a tangible price (loss of workshop, likely death) and a reconfiguration of meaning (living within the story she made). A touch more complication—e.g., a partial failure or snag during the ritual—could deepen the structural turn, but the current arc is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece holds a clean single-POV, single-scene causal arc: grief → descent → wrong turn → discovery → ritual with the shell → resumption of painting. The global drive is mostly accumulative/textural, but each intensification is causally motivated and the closure (leaving the shell, emerging changed) lands clearly. The stakes remain intimate rather than life-or-death, yet the story coherently narrows toward a decisive emotional reconfiguration. No major orientation or causality slips undermine the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story is cleanly structured around a single causal throughline: heat wave and failed horn → Elias’s experimental modification → the Maria Celeste’s rescue and Elias’s internal reconfiguration. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored in the first line, and the accumulative build of backstory and philosophy feeds directly into the present action without derailing momentum. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Elias proves his method in practice and redefines what a lighthouse can be, with a felt emotional cost in his breakdown at the glass. Stakes and cause/effect are fully legible, though the rescue itself resolves with relative ease, keeping the escalation just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: hydraulics fail → she follows cryptic calls → assembles the fulcrum → activates it and redefines what “navigation” means. Causality is consistent and driven by her choices, with no orientation issues despite the lyric mode. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she completes the internal lighthouse and accepts reverse migration as coming home to ruin. Stakes and cost are legible, though the structural turn is more conceptual than dramatic, keeping it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: truffle foraging → discovery of the relic → decision to hide it → recourse to forbidden textbooks → ritual and occlusion that reconfigure her options. Closure is solidly on the page as a Decisive Change and Charged Poise: she moves from constant exposure to a tenuous pocket of privacy, with clear risk and cost. The structure stays within a single scene window, with reflection anchored in present stimuli (the relic, the storm, the books) and each reflective turn alters her next act. Stakes and consequences could be sharpened with a more concrete threat from the Empathic Council, but the internal stakes land.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: find object → experience borrowed memories → investigate dock → decode gesture → accept legacy, all within a continuous scene. The accumulative drive lens is clear, with each beat deepening rather than reversing, and causality (object → memories → action) holds. Closure lands solidly as a resonant reconfiguration when Maren mirrors the prior keeper’s gesture and pins the flower to her coat, foreclosing a life away from the light. Cost—choosing enduring isolation over escape—is legible even in this quiet, lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: promise → years of search → flood conditions → ants and matrix → mechanical doorway → curatorial choice, with no obvious plot amnesia. The piece lands an on-page Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing: Arthur reframes his life from dealer to archivist of unlived lives, and the chip’s final locking is a clear closure beat. The time pressure of the rising creek gives structure, though the extensive descriptive and conceptual passages slightly weaken the felt urgency of the twelve-minute window. Overall, the scene holds together as a single, legible arc with a strong ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: dreams → climb → grotto → revelation → choice to weave the starlight, with an accumulative/textural drive toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Causality holds and the single scene is coherent, with the grotto functioning as a threshold that makes the before/after legible. Closure is solid: the dreams are reinterpreted and Elara’s role shifts from queen to weaver with a clear conceptual cost. Stakes stay a bit abstract (kingdom-devouring mouth, gods bleeding) and aren’t concretized into a sharply felt, specific consequence for Elara’s former world, which keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene that moves from preparation through the whispered secret to the sealing of the shell, with clear causal links for an accumulative/lyric piece. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the moment’s “density of presence” is literally bottled, and “We are here” reframes both past absence and current connection with a felt emotional cost. There are no orientation issues; who/where/when and the governing rules of the magic are legible early. The main limitation is that opposition is largely inferential; nothing in the scene truly threatens failure beyond the ambient risk that the attempt might be emotionally or alchemically insufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: cabin reflection → remembered grave → jealousy peak → literal/figurative ascent → reconfigured return to the scroll. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where his stance toward time and death changes while the external situation remains. Causality within the lyric logic reads as coherent (jealousy fuels the temporal break; acceptance returns him to writing), and there’s no orientation debt. Cost at closure—choosing to chronicle a death he won’t avert—is legible, though still somewhat conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene anchored in the shop, organized around discovering the screw and reassembling the clock. The drive is accumulative/textural rather than strongly causal, but the closure—a conceptual repricing of her loss (“The ordinary miracle was not in the smelling but in the noticing”)—lands clearly with cost tied to her disability. There’s a coherent before/after in her relationship to attention and loss, though the external situation barely shifts. All set-ups (Hale, the screw, the water clock, fog) pay off thematically if not plot-wise.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean causal arc: climb to observatory → stress triggers crystallization → ritual inscription sheds scars → final resistant wound demands a modified tactic (tear instead of ink) → completed transformation and release of breath. The drive lens reads as Hybrid, with causal beats wrapped in an accumulative, lyric texture, and closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where her history is externalized as text. Stakes and rules are consistent; the breath constraint and approaching storm create a tight temporal container. The structure is straightforward and effective, but escalation remains mostly linear and could gain power from one more complication or reversal before the final rune.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: past column → composer’s death/haunting → geographic anchor → impending orchard destruction → engineered ritual/apology before dawn. Structure is a single, continuous scene that escalates from preparation to manifestation to apology and partial absolution, ending on a reweighted status quo. Closure is solid: the apology is delivered at real cost, the spirit’s fate changes, and Elara exits with foreclosed options (orchard gone, column unwritten). A minor limitation is that the ticking-clock of dawn stays mostly atmospheric rather than forcing a concrete, on-page tactical compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative spiral structure is coherent: she enters, performs the arbitration ritual in widening circuits, reaches the outer ring as the universe’s hiccup peaks, and then enacts a unifying act that reconfigures the premise. Causality is lyric but legible (“with each circuit, she read another entry aloud… the library around her began to fold”), and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where end/beginning and witness/void collapse. The cost is conceptual—selfhood dissolves—but it is on the page. There are no major orientation or lens-clarity issues, though the lack of concrete stakes slightly softens the sense of necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece is structured as a single, continuous scene whose internal counting mechanism provides clear temporal scaffolding. Causality is accumulative: whistle → counting → deepening reflection → realization → leaving the key, with no orientation issues. Closure is a conceptual repricing where he redefines time as “the razor edge of the present,” and the scene supports that shift. The cost is somewhat abstract, centered on a philosophical turn rather than a concrete irreversible change, which limits how hard the ending lands.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: one continuous scene, clear anchors, and a clean arc from perceived security breach to conceptual reconfiguration at the barrier. Causality is modest but coherent: his unauthorized presence → her confrontation → his reframing via mycelial exchange → her choice to learn and to lay down the “weapon.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, with the final act of placing the pointer on the glass visibly marking a before/after. Stakes remain intimate rather than plot-heavy, but at this length that feels appropriate rather than thin.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure—subway → graffiti-guided traversal → rainwashed library → walk home—holds cleanly under a textural lens, with each beat deepening the core question rather than advancing a traditional plot. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she conceptually repurposes probability and her father’s legacy into a new teaching stance and way of inhabiting risk, at visible emotional cost. Causal links (graffiti leading her to the library; heart attack and doctor’s warning charging her rebellion) are coherent, if understated. The “equation she was solving” remains metaphorical rather than dramatized as a concrete choice, keeping this just shy of top-tier structural sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is accumulative/textural: a series of wrong-number encounters that teach a pattern and culminate in a charged final image rather than a conventional plot turn. Causality is coherent at this scale—the rules of her work and the disc’s loop govern how each interaction proceeds—and the closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting endings as beginnings in the final cadence. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than event-driven, but legible in her strict discipline of disconnection. Escalation is modest yet present via progressively higher-stakes calls (e.g., the teenager with pills), so the piece feels complete if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the structure is coherent: we move from preparation to articulation of the covenant mechanics to careful execution and a quiet closure where the covenant renews. Orientation is clear from the first paragraph (who/where/when) and the rules of this world are introduced consistently. The closure beat—“The covenant had been regenerated…” and her turn toward home with a reconfigured stance toward witness—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a palpable emotional price. Escalation is more tonal than event-driven, so the sense of risk never tightens as much as the premise would allow, keeping this just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clear: rumor seeding → accumulative confessional space → inversion when the child arrives, with causality intact throughout under an accumulative/textural lens. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: reciprocity is repriced when he realizes he is the one indebted and the stone is “just basalt,” with the cost being his admitted vulnerability. Time is compressed via summary, but the transitions from solitary station to crowded hub to intimate encounter read cleanly and escalate the central pattern. Nothing crucial feels resolved offstage or by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: initial contact with the forest, tracking the pure tone, intensifying sensations, then the discovery of the silent stillpoint and her internal mapping. Causality in a lyric mode is coherent—each new layer of perception leads naturally to the next, and the constellations’ pause brackets the arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her role as mapmaker is conceptually repriced from external to internal terrain with visible emotional cost. There are no orientation problems, but escalation remains primarily tonal and internal, which keeps it short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal drive is clean: past error → current anomaly-linked trap → attempt to rewrite the transmission → ships’ release and personal reconfiguration. Closure lands with both a concrete outcome (ships freed, pen destroyed) and a conceptual cost (she loses the exotic tool and must live with an edited but not erased past). The structure is essentially one continuous operation with a single escalation, and while it resolves perhaps too smoothly—no serious obstacles threaten failure—the before/after is legible and satisfying. The gravitational anomaly and contingent relationships are consistent enough that the rule-set feels stable within this lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: one continuous night at the harbor, building from initial observation to the mapped “final movement” and conceptual pivot “No, but the silence will.” Causality under the textural lens holds: each camera-click and new silent coordinate escalates toward the culminating act of “playing” the symphony in sign. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elias’s stance toward obscurity and silence changes with a clear before/after and cost. The main limitation is that turns are subtle; there’s no distinct mid-scene tightening beyond moving to the pier’s end.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clear and coherent: past arsons → descent to archive → decoding the portrait/tapestry → decision to lay an artistic trail → execution through multiple sites → charged final installation and withdrawal. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, with causal through-lines (her years of burning lead to this moment, each artwork as a map fragment) and a Conceptual Repricing closure where “destruction” is reframed as prayer and invitation. Orientation is firm from the opening sentence (who/where/what she’s done), and there’s a legible before/after in how her relationship to fire and knowledge shifts. The main limitation is that many crucial beats are summarized rather than dramatized in-scene, which flattens moment-to-moment tension.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean and accumulative: nocturnal transgression → navigation via drumming → ascent to tower → summoning attempt → partial manifestation → ventilation break and emotional comedown. Orientation is strong from the outset (who, where, and when are all quickly legible), and the experimental backstory is integrated in a single, efficient block that pays off the garden’s function and Elena’s presence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he fails to fix Elena in the world yet shifts into a charged poise where continued, costly attempts feel inevitable, and that before/after is clear. The only thing holding this below the very top band is that causal linkage and options aren’t stressed into genuinely new configurations; the pressure tightens once but doesn’t complexly cascade.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean, single-scene causal line: storm disables systems → whisper network activates → Kael routes the hospital ship and inducts a new member. The inferred drive lens is Hybrid leaning Accumulative: concrete actions occur, but the main movement is conceptual—the reweighting of “whispers vs shouts” culminating in “Proof isn’t in the speaking… it’s in the hearing.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after in terms of proof and generational continuity. The main limitation is that the on-page situation never seriously threatens to derail, so the final cadence feels assured more than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.9)
    The piece works on an accumulative/textural lens, building a ritual sequence (shutters → mirror → water response → lesson complete) to a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration where the darkness “shimmer[s] differently now.” Structure is coherent and single-scene; there’s a clear before/after in the night’s lesson being completed. That said, the decoupling from concrete stakes or consequences keeps the closure mostly conceptual; the cost of failure is never really felt. The repetition of phrases (“stillwater tension,” “half-spoken secret”) helps cadence but doesn’t introduce new structural turns.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: recruitment → orchestration → grotto culmination → reconfiguration of the town’s inner monologue is easy to follow and lands in a coherent closure beat. The story delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the town’s habitual anxiety is reweighted toward wonder through Elias’s quiet ritual. However, the cost of this change remains abstract and low-friction; Elias sacrifices recognition, but that refusal is never in doubt, so the before/after feels serenely inevitable rather than hard-won. Within its lyric mode the piece is structurally sound, but the lack of a pressured pivot keeps it short of elite-tier impact.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story holds a clean single-scene structure: call begins at moonrise → intensifies at low tide → visible island shimmer → Elara’s release of the line and step into the sea → transformed emergence and farewell. Causality is legible and coherent, and the closure is a decisive change with cost (abandoning her constructed life for the island). The Binding Treaties and Mako’s past are woven in without derailing the present line of action. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural with solid causal underpinnings, and the ending’s before/after is unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: Elias’s ritual, the turbines, and the hush build until the traveler arrives and accepts his offering, culminating in her unmeasured exhale. Orientation is solid and the single-scene window is well contained, with backstory woven in through clear cues. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: before, people measure sound and cannot feel; after, she exerts a small, costly act of unguarded feeling. Stakes stay modest and internal, but the arc from solitary performance to shared participation is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece runs as a single continuous scene with clear orientation (who/where/when established immediately) and an accumulative/textural drive: her incantation gradually activates the colonnade. The causal chain—waiting for the ban to lift, touching the quartz, paraphrasing forbidden verses, and then transforming—is coherent and clean. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change and conceptual repricing: she literally and conceptually becomes the cloud-shadow poet and reframes the “ban” as self-imposed, with a felt cost in the loss of her prior self. The structure is tight for this mode, though the outcome feels nearly foregone once she begins, with little sense of alternative paths.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean and causal under an accumulative/textural lens: discovery of the reed → plant-coded bargain → firing the furnace → the reed’s unexpected awakening of Marin’s voice → Elara’s repricing of what “awakening” means. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with emotional cost: she relinquishes the fantasy of a color cure in exchange for recognizing and embracing her own gift, while Marin pays by breaking his self-imposed silence. Stakes remain intimate but coherent throughout, with no causality breaks or unkept setups. The only limitation is the relatively low on-page resistance or complication once Marin decides to cooperate, which keeps escalation gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: she enters the lab on a prescribed route, notices the fractures via the lens, chooses to act against the manual, triggers the harmonic cascade, then reinterprets the entire pilgrimage and lab. Orientation is strong from the opening sentence (who/where/when are quickly legible), and the progression toward activation and citywide broadcast is smooth. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: the lab’s purpose and the meaning of “connection” are both reweighted on the page. The main limitation is that external resistance and concrete consequences are implied rather than dramatized, so the sense of cost at the end, while present, is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is coherent and accumulative: backstory anchors the present, the crane delivers the visitor, the observatory ritual builds to the star-alignment moment, and the night’s work culminates in the passing-on of coordinates. Causality is clean even in this lyric frame—he arrives because of her cranes, sees his brother’s stars because of her stencil practice, and leaves charged to repeat the pattern. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: grief is reframed as gateway, and Elara’s “calibration” is conceptually repriced in the final lines. The only limitation is that the on-page scene remains low-conflict, so the structural turn is more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: one contained scene in the loft with a clear before/after—Elias comes seeking prediction, Mara reframes the practice as forensic measurement of cultural failure. Causality is modest but coherent: her ongoing method leads to the realization about “past we refused to measure,” which shapes the conversation and the final stance about moving forward with proportion and interval. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: the story ends with Mara recommitting to mapping “geometry of human longing” in a world chastened by collapse. The primary limitation is that the cost of this realization remains largely abstract; nothing on-page forces a painful choice or visibly forecloses an option beyond continued, contemplative labor.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure is clean: arrival at archive → appearance of pagoda → pattern-avoidance to bypass guardians and open it → purification dance → revelation → departure with new burden. Causality holds under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, and the closure (her leaving with “the burden of memory” and a redefined stance toward chaos) is on-page and legible. Stakes escalate in a single continuous scene without soft resets or unexplained turns. The piece leans heavily on conceptual revelation rather than dramatized consequence, but at this length it still feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean and cumulative: anomaly → investigation → reinterpretation → experimental intervention → on-page transformation. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens; each discovery (“not a parasite but the metamorphosis of hope itself”) clearly motivates the next tactic. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the shadow’s role is conceptually repriced, and the before/after is legible with a cost in what had been lost and mourned. The only limitation is that the external stakes and constraints around failure remain abstract, so the sense of risk is more conceptual than dramatically tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene anchored in the aftermath of the con, with backstory efficiently spliced in. Causality is coherent—Marcus’s arrest → fractured integrity → on-page choice to reform and testify—and the closure is an on-page reconfiguration rather than a recap. The drive lens is largely situational/accumulative: steady pressure to take a stance rather than sharp plot reversals. The piece could benefit from one more palpable on-page complication or test of her resolve to sharpen the turn into the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal throughline is clear: surgeries → plant telepathy → tunnel discovery → meteor cavern → contact with sister and shattering hourglass, ending in a resonant reconfiguration. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal progression with heavy textural/thematic layering), and closure lands when the hourglass breaks and his stance toward “closure” conceptually flips. Some late reveals feel under-grounded—especially “the avalanche had been no accident” and the coffee rings becoming coordinates—which compress complex plot logic into summary rather than fully earned turns. Still, orientation is solid from the first paragraph and the before/after divide is legible with a conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: climb to the booth → psychometric immersion → conceptual discovery about the beam of light as storage → exit with a new mandate. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing with some cost (the burden of knowing every cinema is a bank of unspent feeling). Causality is soft but legible, with each metaphysical layer arising from the last without obvious cheats. The main limitation is the lack of a concrete obstacle or reversal; the “investigation” proceeds with very little friction or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single ritualized night under the aurora, framed by Elara’s long prior block, builds to a focused climax where her choice to rest allows restoration. Orientation is strong and early (who/where/when are all legible within the first paragraph), and the accumulative drive (each star mapped, tension rising) coheres. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change: creativity returns, marked concretely by “clay under her nails and marble dust in her hair.” The main weakness is that obstacles remain largely ceremonial rather than oppositional, so progression feels fated rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure is clean: approach to the archive, invocation with the clock and charm, opening via wave functions, and entry into a new stasis. Causality is coherent under the textural lens—his carrying/voicing/placing the clock leads to the dune’s response and the archive’s unfolding—with no orientation debt. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Kael shifts from escort of cargo to keeper of possibility, with the visible price of distributing himself “like pollen on wind.” The before/after line is legible and charged even in this quiet, lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine is clear: sixth sense causes involuntary translocation, which positions Kael to witness the unraveling, confront the stranger, then seek and repair the nexus with the gear. The two-translocation structure is legible, and closure lands via decisive change (gear insertion, network reknitting) plus a conceptual repricing of “miracles.” However, the middle confrontation is low-friction—the stranger’s resistance remains mostly rhetorical—so the sense of cost and narrowing options is modest. The resolution feels slightly easy, with little on-page struggle required to reach the nexus or to convince/oppose the antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clean: leash breaks → Mara’s panic → ferry guides offer passage → covenant via star stamp → traversal of the ridgeway → discovery of Atlas and reconfiguration of the leash’s meaning. The structure is a single continuous journey with one clear tightening, and closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing as Mara chooses to return without re-leashing Atlas. Stakes and situation remain legible throughout; the surreal geography is consistent enough not to harm orientation. Cost is visible in the final renunciation of her old safety structure, making the before/after divide clear even if the external plot is quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly causal: discovery of the bolt → social test in the refectory → deeper investigation and sheet music → reframed decision about silence. The drive lens reads as Situational/Accumulative: pressure comes from the fortress’s rules and accumulated evidence rather than overt plot twists, and the closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise in his choice to wait. Closure lands with visible conceptual cost—he forecloses immediate rebellion and speech in favor of patience—and the before/after of his attitude toward silence is legible. A slightly sharper external consequence (e.g., the real threat of punishment) would deepen the felt cost of his final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causality is clean: eons of preparation → pretender follows riddles → confrontation → rune reveals truth → temple and pause in time end. The closure is strong and legible, with a clear before/after: the false king is unmasked, the library’s suspended time concludes, and the titan’s watch ends. The “cosmic configuration” and arrival of the pretender are a touch convenient, but within the mythic frame they feel earned rather than arbitrary. No significant orientation or lens ambiguity issues; the single-scene structure is tight.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-tense work at the station, interwoven memory, then a realization that reconfigures what both the reef and the atlas page mean. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens: assembling the drives and juxtaposing logs with shipping data plausibly triggers the conceptual turn about paths disappearing via social forgetting. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing plus a small but decisive act (mailing the page), with a clear before/after in her understanding of her role. Stakes remain primarily intellectual and emotional, with no major structural surprises, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear drive from approach → alignment → activation → realization. Causality is coherent under an accumulative/textural lens: dawn and humming stones intensify toward a ritual climax, leading to a conceptual reweighting of the “lull.” Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—her understanding of the pause and her role shifts—though cost is more conceptual than dramatized. No orientation debt; stakes and temporal window are legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: plants lead her to the vent → kite script yields the thermal sequence → calibrated immersion unseals the embryo. The piece lands a clear Decisive Change with the amber splitting and the environment beginning to transform, and orientation is solid from the first paragraph. Cost is present but light, more conceptual (breaking sacrilege, opening an uncertain future) than concretely dramatized. Structure is tight for a single-scene piece, but a sharper sense of risk in the moment of unsealing would elevate the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: present-tense tree work → somatic trigger → interior walk through trauma and coping → closing micro-decision to face the photograph and continue tending. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he can now look at his sister’s face without flinching while still acknowledging irreparable loss, and this visibly shapes his ongoing choice to remain and plant. Causality is psychological rather than event-driven but coherent; each reflection is anchored in a present cue (wind frequency, photo, lighthouse journal). There are no orientation issues or dangling setups, though the core stakes are entirely internal, which keeps the escalation subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is clear: Mara arrives fragmented, discovers the tarot and threads, learns the method, descends, and reconfigures the lighthouse’s reality via the lamp. Causality holds under a primarily accumulative/textural lens: each discovery organically leads to the next, and the closure (becoming a “cartographer of broken things”) is legible and costs her the old, safer role of surface portraitist. The “walls closing in” and the emerging trapdoor provide a clean, if symbolic, tightening that ushers her downward. Stakes remain mostly internal and metaphysical, but they cohere, and the final stabilization of reality plus her altered vocation satisfy the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative structure: observation → experiment with ink → entry into the fractal field → dissolution into time, with each move legible and causally linked. Closure is strong as a Conceptual Repricing: his disappearance redefines the rules of crisis-time and his own relationship to existence, with the cost (loss of corporeal life) clearly on the page. The throughline—prove his theory about localized temporal fields—is maintained without digression. The tendency to explain the mechanism of time dilation near the end edges toward essay rather than dramatized turn, slightly dulling the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is strong: discovery of the letter → moral crisis → reactivation of dormant networks → upload → alarms, with a clear before/after in her role and in the world. Closure lands via a decisive change and charged poise as she waits for the regime, with the cost (neural erasure, certain punishment) clearly implied on the page. Structure is straightforward single-scene escalation without soft resets or confusion. It stops short of exceptional because the revolution’s consequences remain somewhat generic and the outcome is narratively assured rather than tested or problematized.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens: one continuous scene, pressure from the outside world, and an ending that reconfigures meaning via the wreckage-into-witness motif. Causality is simple but coherent (tower fell → desert claimed skyways → sandbags drifted down → she repurposes them), and the dome shudder/impact functions as the single tightening beat. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing hybrid: her continued gardening is framed as a deliberate stance that redefines the tools of war. The cost—choosing fragile, localized peace in a brutal world—is conceptual rather than dramatized, but it is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: enter garden → navigate via silence → reach echo pool → perform ritual → emerge with transformed spike. Causality is coherent and closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he succeeds but the garden dies and the sky is rewritten, making a clear before/after. Stakes and rules (garden responds to intention, hour when patterns break) are consistent, though the exact jeopardy if he failed is more implied than dramatized. The single-scene window and one main tightening (stars’ chaos crescendoing as he performs the null-song) work well at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is tight and legible: call → investigation through the night → logical contradiction → moral recognition → decision to publish → descent toward the presses, all under a clear causal lens. Closure lands as a decisive change with on-page cost: she chooses to ruin her own fortune, and the future is explicitly “uncharted” in light of that stance. The proof-by-contradiction beat gives a satisfying hinge where knowledge shifts and options reconfigure. The only constraint keeping this below top tier is that external obstacles are minimal; nothing pushes back against her decision besides her internal calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: cabinet → letters/guilt spike → quantum disturbance/meteor hush → amber tether → temporal breach → contact with younger self. Closure lands clearly as a decisive change with cost: the original timeline of twenty years’ regret is foreclosed in favor of a newly chosen staying. Some of the tech/time-travel mechanics are purposefully hand-wavy, but within the speculative frame they feel coherent rather than convenient, and setup elements (cabinet, amber, firmware, meteor hush) all pay off in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: disordered acoustics → tile discovery → mandala diagnosis → pattern interjection → emergent hush and conceptual reframe. Causality within the magical logic is coherent, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the grotto’s noise reorganized into “patterned silence” with a reweighted understanding of communication). The main limitation is cost: the “unlearning” clock stays abstract, and the solution feels achieved without any significant sacrifice or irreversible loss beyond the tile itself. Still, the before/after of the grotto’s state is legible and satisfying on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean accumulative/textural structure: single scene, single POV, gradually intensifying sensory and temporal overlays culminating in the act of renaming. Causality is simple but coherent—Kael’s philosophy and retrocognition lead to reading the mosaic, which leads to the new name; closure lands as a conceptual repricing (“For what falls here shall be held, not healed”). The cost—refusing sanitization, choosing to leave the wound open—is legible but understated, more implied than dramatized against concrete opposition. Orientation is strong from the outset; no penalties there.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is tight: one continuous scene with a clear causal line—Mara’s intrusion, Julian’s choice to intervene via song and coin, the alignment of timelines, and her decision to live. The fractured timeline concept is integrated into the mechanics of his intervention (multiple selves raising the coin, echoes layering into a chord) rather than being a decorative flourish. Closure is strong: Mara leaves the box cutter and exits, Julian’s timeline quiets into “a single satisfied resonance,” and the coin’s final placement charges the future. The cost is legible for both characters, and there are no causality gaps or orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal throughline—static shock → recall crisis → Maya devising and executing her method → completion of the recall—is clear, with one continuous scene that tightens logically. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she finishes the search, the geode’s resonance stops, and she re-prices the premise of pill-based connection. Stakes around preventing neurological damage and honoring real connection are coherent and paid off in the final reflection. The main limitation is that on-page resistance or failure beats are minimal, so escalation reads smooth rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean and linear: cave descent, fossil discovery, heat-mapping, song, then ascent to the starlit shaft with a charged final image. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the emotional data and color fields build toward the gold-flare convergence, which functions as a resonant reconfiguration—Kael’s work coheres into something for the sleepers above. Causality is intact (find fossil → anchor mapping → climactic convergence), but there’s only a soft tightening of pressure; nothing truly narrows Kael’s options or demands a hard choice. Closure is present and legible, just somewhat frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: prophecy of collapse → need to unscramble it → building the button mandala → shattering the jar → reconfigured reality and role. Causality holds, and the closure is a decisive change plus conceptual repricing (prophecy becomes possibility; sand falls upward). The cost is implied (risking all stored memories, reconfiguring how time itself functions) but never bites on the page—she succeeds without visible loss or hard trade-off. Still, the drive lens is coherent, and the final image clearly reweights everything that came before.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal line (burned spy → snow codes → meeting Marcus → surrendering the chip → founding a new code-site) is clear and the scene holds together as one continuous, legible unit. Closure lands: Elena decisively changes her stance from running and guarding the last secret to relinquishing it in service of repair. Still, large off-page stakes (three dead agents, “organization broken”) never receive an on-page complication or concrete test, so the meeting resolves too smoothly for the danger invoked. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay, and that hybrid holds without breaking, but the cost remains more conceptual than dramatically pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: waiting under constraint, reading the storm, registering subtle shifts, then acting when conditions change. Causality is clean—the cessation of the gutters’ ticking and other sensory cues lead to the decision to cross—and orientation (who/where/when) is firm from early on. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: his boarding the craft with “absolute, crystalline permission” marks a before/after in stance, though the cost is more implied than acutely felt because no concrete passenger or specific risk is dramatized. The drive lens (accumulative lyric pressure) holds consistently through to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a clean single-scene accumulative build: arrival → investigation with the glass → conceptual realization → quiet renunciation and departure. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each image or realization deepens the central question rather than advancing a problem-solution arc. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: resistance as devotion and change as illusion, crystallized by leaving the lantern as beacon. The cost is mostly conceptual (accepting non-intervention and a redefined understanding of time), which is subtle but on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece follows a clean causal spine: petal falls → departure from garden → rowing → lighthouse calibration → maintaining the beam through the night. Structure is linear and well-contained, with a clear inciting cue (last petal) and a resonant reconfiguration at the end as Mara’s role shifts from private gardener to public guardian. Closure is solid Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she has crossed the threshold and chosen an ongoing, costly vigilance. Stakes remain intimate and symbolic rather than materially tested, which keeps the piece from feeling fully maximized at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: one continuous ritual sequence from terrace to stone circle to inner revaluation, with each step causally linked (stone hum → amplified reflection → realization → reidentification as librarian). Closure lands as a clear conceptual reconfiguration: she ceases to frame herself as the last remnant and instead as “the first librarian of a new solitude,” with the cost of relinquishing her old identity on the page. The accumulative, lyric drive lens holds consistently, and the ending reweights earlier details like the sundial and cloud-tides. The stakes remain internal and there are no genuine reversals, which keeps the arc more meditative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean and legible under an accumulative/textural lens: storm → discovery of nest → art-building → Mara’s return → aftermath, with a clear resonant reconfiguration at the end. Causality is mostly sound (the storm dislodges the nest, which catalyzes her new tactic), and the closure image of scattered twigs and returning thrushes reweights the opening. Mara’s reappearance by rumor is a bit convenient but acceptable in this lyric mode. The piece maintains a single throughline and lands a clear, felt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: cosmic broadcasts → town’s discord → Elena’s discovery and plan → timed subsonic counter-broadcast → entities’ retreat and partial communal recovery. The ticking clocks (17 minutes to alignment, 90 seconds to hold the signal) give solid structural spine, and escalation is clear as she risks overloading the equipment under direct psychic attention. Closure is strong: the entities lose their anchor, the mob disperses, and we end in a new, costly “after” with a fractured but salvageable community. The only thing keeping this from the very top band is that the resolution unfolds a bit smoothly, with no genuine complication once the counter-signal is engaged.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: winter hunger → need for key → descent into mutinous catacombs → use of organ resonance window → transfixing the gears and retrieving the key. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly, and the drive lens is predominantly causal with some lyric texture. Closure lands decisively when she halts the mechanism and the walls relent, with a clear before/after in both physical danger and village prospects. The main structural limitation is how smoothly everything resolves once she acts—no real reversal or complication once the pattern is understood.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clear: quarry → ribbon → months of off-page research → on-site sketching → realization about the rival’s jacket → emotional and investigative reconfiguration. Structure is cleanly single-scene with backstory elegantly folded in, and the global drive (causal, with an internal reweighting at the end) holds throughout. Closure lands via a decisive interpretive turn about the ribbon and a resonant shift in Elara’s stance toward the case and herself. The cost—emotional exposure and the shattering of an accepted narrative—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal arc is clean: decode journals → recognize predictive power → confront official record → institutional acknowledgment. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Mara’s exile is redefined and partially reversed in the archive, with a clear before/after in how her legacy is understood. Stakes remain almost entirely intellectual/reputational, with minimal resistance to Elara’s challenge; the meteorologist’s quick acceptance slightly flattens the climax. Structure is otherwise tight and legible within a single-scene frame.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: hitchhiker vanishes → scaffold flutters reveal a path → glass shows alternate topography → music transforms space and his stance. Causality is more emotional/metaphysical than literal, but the pattern is taught early and holds to closure, with the flake and scaffolding returning as functional devices, not just symbols. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he moves from reciting collapse to composing ascent, with clear before/after stakes. A slightly clearer sense of what would have happened if he’d refused to follow/play might sharpen the structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative/lyric structure is coherent: present-tense wandering in the train interwoven with startup and father backstory, culminating in a conceptual and practical shift (deciding to leave with “new eyes”). Causality is internal rather than event-driven but consistent—each reflection grows from an on-page cue (rusted lions, money, markers). Closure lands cleanly as a small but decisive change of trajectory with conceptual repricing of his history.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure—single night in the observatory braided with memory—builds coherently toward a conceptual reconfiguration of what the “temple” is. Causality is soft but legible: studying the variable stars → recognizing the inscription pattern → reinterpreting her brother’s “failure” → deciding how to use the translation. Closure lands clearly with the archive placement and redefined mission, though the decoding process leans on exposition rather than dramatized difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: failed illusion → Elara’s approach → the vortex’s resistance → her tactical shift to stillness → deployment of the seed → revelation and release. The single-scene structure is tight and easy to follow, and the closure (reclassification of the lake from cursed to imprisoned plus the vortex’s collapse) lands clearly on the page. The realization that she must “unbend it with absolute stillness” feels thematically apt but comes a bit quickly, with limited on-page struggle or failed attempts before insight. Nonetheless, the drive lens remains clearly causal throughout and the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: clipping → glade → Kael’s arrival → root release → moving to the node → reinterpreting the covenant → beginning the new weaving. Orientation (who/where/when) is solid early, and the piece maintains one scene with a clear before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they shift from stuck in a broken-timeline present to active shapers of a renewed covenant, with a clear time limit (“until full dark”). The main weakness is that the risk of failure and its consequences remain abstract, so the felt narrative cost at the end is slightly muted.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: the prophetic card returns, prompting Elias to the catacomb orchard, to the heart-tree, and to his barter that ends in his subsumption. This works under a mostly causal lens with strong accumulative texture, and the Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing closure (he cannot trade destinies, only share/accept) lands with clear cost. Orientation is solid from the first lines; the rules of the place are implied consistently through action. The main limitation is the relative lack of on-page friction or complication en route to the inevitable barter, so the mid-section feels more like vivid approach than rising structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: one primary present-time scene in the trailer with interleaved backstory that always hooks back to the current decision about the cloth. Causality is clear—public failure → exile to quarry job → high-stakes appraisal for the kid—and each memory reframes his current paralysis rather than stalling it. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: he redefines his role from verifier to witness and chooses a specific course of action (calling the scrap genuine) with legible implications. The escalation is modest but appropriate for the length, leaning more on accumulative pressure than big plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: arrival → placement/activation of the seed → warning → acceptance → dissolution, all causally linked. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with a strong accumulative/textural flavor, but the causal chain is never in doubt and closure is solid. The cost (his death/transition) is legible and directly tied to the established rules (“those who seek…must complete it themselves”). Escalation is more contemplative than suspenseful, but the before/after of his existence and understanding is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with clear phases—anticipation of migration, collection, smelting, and aftermath—under an accumulative/textural lens. Causality is coherent (tides and moon govern when identities appear; the librarian must act despite weakness), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where wandering is transformed into preserved wonder. The cost is conceptual and visible: migration yields to integration, with the price of giving up pure restlessness. There are no major orientation or lens issues, but escalation is more contemplative than sharply turning.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: arrival → exploration → discovery of pearl and shell → reading confessions → internal revaluation → deletion choice → ritual crowning and radiance. Causality is strong under an accumulative/textural lens, with each object deepening pressure and narrowing Elara’s options until she must choose between reporting and preserving. Closure lands with a clear decisive change and resonant reconfiguration as she erases the bunker from records and takes on the role of “keeper of postponed radiance.” The emotional and ethical cost of that choice is legible, though external consequences remain implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: a single scene in the station with well-anchored flashback to the accident and medication history, all causally linked. The discovery of the coordinates functions as a decisive pivot that reorients her from avoidance to intention. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise in her commitment to visit the canal, with on-page cost implied by prior dread and guilt. It’s not structurally daring, but it is tight, legible, and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: arrival → exploration → understanding of the watch/cipher → documentation → acceptance via the second letter. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end (she becomes the new archivist and co-creator of silence). Causality is soft but legible, and orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, with no major temporal or spatial confusion. The main weakness is that the six-hour/fate frame rarely tightens tactics on the page, so the clock feels more decorative than structuring.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    The structure is tight: we move causally from present inspection → plant panic → coffee-vision of the Ministry → mycorrhizal solution → opening the case → melting the violin. Closure is a decisive change with clear cost: the physical artifact is sacrificed in favor of distributed memory through trees, and that before/after line is unmistakable. The reflective backstory beats (Goya forgery, winter emergence of the coffee ability) are anchored in immediate triggers and directly inform her present tactics. The drive lens (hybrid causal/accumulative) is held consistently and the final image pays off earlier motifs without loose threads.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: we move from setup (grotto, role, chip) through the live act of soul-capture to a quiet, resonant filing-away that clearly closes the unit. Causality within the invented logic holds, and the “threshold of stillness” provides a conceptual ticking clock. That said, escalation is mostly conceptual rather than situational—the procedure never seriously falters or risks failure, so the climax feels inevitable rather than hard-won. The closure (the chip pulsing with the aurora and then being archived) lands as a solid Resonant Reconfiguration, but with modest on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: present action (climb, contemplation, descent, planting) framed by succinct backstory about the theft and failed immortality bid. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—his observation of the pin and environment leads to a conceptual turn, which in turn prompts the decisive act of burial. Closure is strong: the sapling’s eruption and the grotto’s shuddering make the completion of the stalled cycle legible with cost (letting go of his last physical tie to his daughter). The stakes are internal/cosmic rather than situational, but they resolve clearly without structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene arc: dawn after the last client, wind chimes cue a task, mirror leads him to the cloak, unhooking and letting it go reconfigure his stance toward his work. Causality is clear under an accumulative/situational lens: each symbolic action (listening, climbing, unhooking, releasing) tightens the internal decision rather than feeling random. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—he commits to offering ambiguity instead of fabricated absolution—with on-page cost in exposure to doubt. The external stakes remain modest and mostly implied, which limits the overall structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clear, with the ritual of stone and ripples providing a strong spine and coherent internal logic. Causality within this lyric frame is consistent: meditation → stone-casting → ripple-reading → realization about his true role and the nature of regression. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: he reinterprets his life’s work and regression as a deliberate methodology, with the impending disappearance by dawn as a real cost. There are no orientation issues; the experimental elements are taught early and pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative/lyric drive: contemplation of the arrowhead and birds leads to a reconfiguration of his understanding of movement and role. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear very early, and the progression from stone-skimming past to stillness present to final crystallized state reads coherent. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he ceases to be a skimmer and fully becomes a landmark/arrowhead for others, with a visible conceptual cost (self-erasure into geologic time). The structure is simple but precise, with no major causality or pattern breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal throughline is clean: monitoring → noticing the irregular keystone → rejecting algorithmic corrections → mist walking → embracing the stone and abandoning the system, with a clear before/after. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing hybrid: he forecloses return to the automated order and is refigured as a mythic guardian of the old magic at visible cost. Orientation is excellent and the shard-like coda about later travelers coheres under the same drive lens. The main limitation is that on-page resistance to his defection is light, so the structural turn reads more solemn than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative, single-thread structure is clear: pier → wreck → library → tuning fork → realization, with backstory cleanly woven to reframe present action. Causality is intact under an accumulative/textural lens—his job and heirloom key tag lead him to the Concordia at the one night when vows become visible. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: his work and inheritance are reinterpreted with a cost (the willingness to “drown in the dark” for this knowledge). There’s no major reversal, but the single deepening turn at the ledger/tuning fork sequence is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece follows a clean causal chain: prophecy → decoding static → using the coins → tuning the receiver → triggering expansion. The closure is strong and legible: the observatory “unfolds” and her decision retrocausally creates the Big Bang, a clear before/after with conceptual cost if she had failed. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative lyric texture), held consistently through to the end. If anything, the solution arrives without a significant late complication; the risk is declared more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: rumors → observatory → recordings → understanding the astronomers’ fate → atlas/light ritual → crystallization → redefined function, all in one coherent scene with backstory anchored in physical discoveries. The drive is largely accumulative/textural, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration as he repurposes the scythe and accepts a new, painful vocation. Causality is intact and legible, and the price of his new stance (ongoing grief, renunciation of old function) is clear on the page. The only constraint for higher scores is that escalation feels meditative rather than sharply hinged on a decisive, risky turn.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation and drive are crystal-clear early: who she is, where she is, and what she wants are all anchored in the first paragraph. The causal chain is tight—drought → broken bell → counting drops → calibrated spell → struck bell → seep of returning water—and the noon drop-count goal provides a simple but effective structural spine. Closure lands cleanly as a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: the world’s state is altered (water begins to return) and Elara’s path is reconfigured into an “endless, earnest vigil” with cost. Escalation is somewhat linear and smooth; the piece could support an additional on-page complication to deepen the midsection.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: drought exposes the town, which enables Elias’s discovery of the photographs and label, which in turn pushes him to repurpose his role toward archival justice. Structure is tight and linear within a single evening; backstory is anchored to present stimuli and meaningfully tilts his stance. Closure is solid via a conceptual and practical pivot (he leaves determined to build an archive), though the external stakes remain mostly implied rather than tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: arrival at the veil → entry into the orchard → offering + invocation → transformation, all under the “hour before the final transformation” frame. Causality is coherent in a lyric, magical-logic way, and closure lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing of what the philosopher’s stone is. The cost—abandoning pure rationalism for an integrated stance—is present but mostly conceptual and emotionally smooth, so the climax lacks a sharper sense of risk or alternative path. Still, the before/after is legible and satisfying, with no orientation or lens problems.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scene is cleanly structured: countdown, adjustment, freefall, catch, and release into rest, with strong because/therefore links (rogue thermal → revise angle → chute blooms safely). Closure lands on-page with a clear before/after: Kael’s life and their trust move from precarious to preserved, an Earned Stasis. Cost is mostly experiential tension and focus rather than any irreversible change in circumstance or relationship. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with some accumulative texture, and it holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean: jar arrives, internal custody battle, philosophical and emotional reframe, then literal and psychic integration, landing in a clear before/after. The drive lens reads as chiefly accumulative/textural with causal underpinnings, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Maya’s synthesis with the clone and the dojo stabilizing. Causality holds and each beat flows logically from the last. Cost is legible in her fear and tears as history settles into a new permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece follows a mostly linear, accumulative structure: seed arrival → planting and scheming → weeks-long development → charged readiness at the end, with a clear before/after in Maya’s design philosophy. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she has built the seven chambers and committed to this new mode of experience, with tomorrow’s guests as implied test. Causality is generally intact, but the middle drifts into conceptual repetition rather than concrete turns, so escalation feels intellectual more than situational. The time jumps (three weeks later, autumn’s first gale) are legible and don’t harm orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    The accumulative structure is clean: Elias’s repeated pulling of the cord gradually transforms silence into sound that reaches his family and culminates in laughter returning. Causality is clear and intentional within the story’s metaphysics: maceration → tuneless lullabies → domestic responses → feedback of laughter → his dissolution. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a sharp plot twist, but the before/after (crushing silence vs. laughter-infused haunting) is legible with cost. No significant orientation or lens-clarity issues surface.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: pendant appears → dilemma of return vs. remaining → interiorization → redefinition of “home” and “waiting,” ending in earned stasis/CR. Causality is soft but legible under a textural/situational lens, and the closure beat—choosing to internalize the call rather than answer—lands with a clear before/after. Stakes are entirely internal, so the sense of cost is more philosophical than visceral, which slightly blunts impact at elite-publication level. Still, there are no real orientation or lens-clarity issues and the arc feels complete for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: a series of iterative attempts leads to a precise realization (“penny dropped”) and a successful transformation that reconfigures Marcus’s options and self-concept. The single-scene structure is tight, with failure–adjustment–epiphany–new result forming a clear arc, and the ending offers both Decisive Change (the crozier’s transformation) and Conceptual Repricing (of power, faith, and destiny). Cost is present but somewhat abstract—mainly the total destruction of the relic and his relinquishing of its prior meaning—rather than dramatized as a difficult, contested choice at the climax. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a lyric overlay and holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal arc is clean: problem (hush blocks signal) → strategic inversion of protocol → collapse into silence → emergent “song” → conceptual discovery, with no orientation issues. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing of “silence” and of the towers’ apparent failure, and it’s legible and satisfying. The cost, however, is mostly implied (risk of death, career-long obsession) rather than dramatized—her success comes without visible setback or hard trade-off in the climax. Structurally, it feels fully coherent but not yet punishing enough to be elite.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: ferry vanishes → grotto/time fracture revealed → Elias learns to use hourglass/radio → he reunites timelines → return to harbor with altered status. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: he’s still a deckhand but now a conscious guardian of fractures, and the hourglass’s dust concretizes that change. The structure is linear and coherent despite the surreal premise, with no orientation debt and a clear dominant drive. The main weakness is that obstacles resolve relatively smoothly, so tension within the middle sequence could be more sharply staged.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure is clean: she weaves, complexity and resonance build, and the final eruption/union with the gallery provides a clear before/after with conceptual and personal cost. Causality is stable within the surreal logic (“rational enchantment demanded release”), and the closure—the gallery spilling into the city as she becomes it—lands as a strong resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: a starving benthic city needs routes, Mara waits for predicted alignment, confirms it via the anchor link, and orders an expedition, giving solid closure in a single scene. Orientation is excellent from the outset (who/where/when and what changed five years ago are quickly clear). The closure functions as Charged Poise rather than decisive resolution, but the before/after (trapped vs having a viable vector) is legible with conceptual cost. Escalation is largely intellectual and unfolds smoothly, though the story avoids any concrete setback or last-minute complication that might heighten structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: mist and twilight → threshold opens → hearing aid pulses → discovery of Thomas → rescue, with no major gaps or contrivances. The story delivers a solid closure beat when Elena removes the hearing aid and leads Thomas upstairs, clearly marking a before/after in stakes and knowledge. The single-scene structure is coherent, and the late reveal that the “trap” was for rescue rather than justice retrofits earlier beats without feeling like a cheat. A more tangible obstacle or complication in the basement would deepen the sense of cost and prevent the rescue from feeling this logistically smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece follows a clean causal line: the ninety-minute tidal window forces her return, the gold fleck enables pursuit, and the descent leads inexorably to contact and letting the researchers go. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Mara emerges changed, having facilitated their migration and accepted the permanent “crashing hush” as her cost. Some world rules (phase transitions, quantum echoes) are explained more than dramatized, but they remain internally coherent and don’t undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: after the radio static clears, we move through a single, continuous attempt to defragment the ghost, culminating in integration and a new stance toward her existence. Causality is tight for an accumulative/lyric design: ink → spectrometer → mainframe receptor → reconstituting ghost → revelation → integration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she redefines what it means for her to “exist” and forecloses the path of living only as an error survivor. A touch more on-page resistance or risk during the procedure could have intensified the cost, but the arc is still coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: cursed diamond → need to act before the last elder dies → use birds to decode the canyon → redirect curse via the tunnel of echoes. The piece follows a single, coherent arc with one main tightening, when she learns the curse can be redirected into the canyon instead of consuming the last speakers. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual cost: the curse is re-housed and the language survives only as resonance in bone. The pressure progression is more told than dramatized (e.g., “she was running out of time”) but still structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece follows a clean causal chain under a primarily causal/accumulative lens: phone crackles → confession → arrowhead activates → garden erupts → metamorphosis → cavern seals. Orientation is solid from the outset (who/where/what she wants), and the closure beat—her full acceptance of cryptid status with the arrowhead fused in her chest and the phone as her channel—is a clear Decisive Change with cost (loss of the surface life). The structure is essentially a single ritual scene that escalates smoothly, though it stops short of a more complex pattern of turns or reversals that would push it into the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clear and tight: she hesitates, chooses to play in a new way, transmits the rhythm, destabilizes statues, and triggers the orchard’s physical upheaval, culminating in a decisive reconfiguration of the world’s rules. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with a clean before/after and an evident cost in upheaval and risk. The main limitation is how smoothly success arrives; resistance never truly threatens to derail her attempt, so structural pressure feels slightly under-exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: Marek exploits the lone mail-drop window, uses the storm bottle to blind drones, and slips letters through, with a clear before/after in the drones’ control. Structure is tight and linear, with the woman-and-son letter providing a well-placed focal turn that personalizes the mission. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—borders briefly breached by “paper and ink,” with the arcade holding that secret. The main limitation is that success comes with little on-page resistance; the plan works as advertised, so the felt cost of this decisive moment is conceptually strong but narratively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: search → discovery of impossible corridor → greenhouse → halo fragment → song/awakening → resolved intention to rebuild. Causality is intact and legible, with the train’s wrong corridor leading directly to the key object and transformation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: his stance toward silence and his future work both shift, with a clear before/after. Stakes and cost could be slightly sharper (what he risks by touching/singing is implicit more than dramatized), which keeps this just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece reads as a single, continuous scene with a clean accumulative structure: approach → crossing into the pocket → reawakening → return. Causality within the conceit is coherent (her understanding of hyperbolic geometry enables passage), and the closure—realizing where stories live and completing her duty—lands as a resonant reconfiguration. The cost at closure is more conceptual than felt, hinging on her ongoing solitude and odd-hours duty rather than a concrete sacrifice. Stakes stay small and inward, so the arc is elegant but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal within an accumulative/lyric frame: ache → preparation → ascent → dawn → painting → capture → descent, with on-page closure as the dream is anchored in the watercolor. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure intensifies via repeated motifs (whispers, light, liminality) rather than reversals, and that pattern holds through the end. The emotional cost (risk of losing the dream forever, and the effortful ritual to reclaim it) is legible, and the before/after is clear. What holds it below higher bands is the relative inevitability of success; there’s little sense that failure is a live option once the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative, ritual-like structure is coherent: arrival → approach to singularity → tactic (disorienting fear) → release of the idea → quiet aftermath. Causality is soft but present (“to open what was locked, she must first disorient the fear,” then the dance works), and orientation is clean from the first sentence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the nexus subtly changes, and the freed idea alters the cosmos’ possibilities, though the on-page cost remains conceptual rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: long-term study → understanding the ring’s pattern and rules → intentional, informed entry with the compass → breaking the taking/keeping habit and returning Lila’s memories. The piece maintains a single continuous scene with well-integrated backstory that consistently tilts the present. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost (thirty years lost and the ring’s destruction as portal), with no major logic gaps or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is clean: arrival with a dangerous shard; assessment via tea-leaf geometry; a long middle of incremental mentorship; and a precise, consequential shattering that restores the child and alters Elara. Causality holds tightly—her readings of resilience justify the delay, and the hammer is introduced early as a real option that she withholds until conditions are met. Closure is a decisive change: the exile ends and Elara abandons her habitual retreat, with the cost and before/after state legible in the final walk out of the library. The drive lens reads as Situational with some accumulative texture: ongoing pressure around readiness under a clear rule-set rather than complicated plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean causal arc: encroaching grayness → ritual with the heirloom seed → confrontation with forgetfulness → planting the charged seed → world reconfigured. Closure lands solidly with the rainbow tree and the restoration of color to children’s dreams, and the cost is legible in Elian’s depletion. However, the path from problem to solution is relatively smooth, with no genuine risk of failure or structural surprise once the ritual begins. The drive reads as mainly accumulative/textural with causal beats, and while it coheres well, the escalation could narrow options more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative structure is clean: working through knots/spirits over hours steadily builds toward her becoming the repository of silence. Causality is tight under the textural lens—unraveling knots releases ghosts, whose silence then settles into her mask, leading directly to the closing reconfiguration. Orientation (who/where/what she’s doing) is immediate and stable, and the closure—her realization that she “had become the net now”—lands on-page with a tangible, ongoing price. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the sequence of spirits is structurally even, with few surprising micro-turns in how the process complicates or alters her options.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal chain is clean and satisfying: suspicious tear → archival research → film comparison → excavation → discovery → reflective choice about how to record it. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing when she leaves the map torn and embraces the value of emptiness and secrecy. That said, the plot offers few surprises or complications once the pattern is established; each step succeeds on the first try with little resistance, so the structural arc feels elegant but somewhat low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: descend into wreck, locate and decode the snow globe, receive the transmission, ascend with a changed understanding. Causality is sound and easy to follow under an accumulative/textural lens, with each step (finding the globe, tuning it, hearing the message) flowing logically. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing of “release” and “salvage,” and the cost—recognizing the necessity of letting go—is legible if quiet. Stakes remain mostly intellectual and existential rather than situationally urgent, which keeps the arc from feeling fully high-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.7)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene arc: arrive with artifact → activate plate → duet and transformation → farewell and map, with each step causally linked. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent, and closure is a clear resonant reconfiguration as the ghost blooms into the physical world and Elara’s “final message” is completed. Cost is present but modest: the farewell, the grinding of fossilized petals, and Elara’s departure from this charged courtyard. All needed anchors (who/where/what’s at stake) are legible early, so orientation and lens remain solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: one continuous elevator ride used as a frame to find, decode, and read the diary, culminating in a conceptual shift at the observatory deck. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: the fractured light enables the cipher, the reading reframes the captain, and that in turn reframes Elara’s own ascent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn, with a clear before/after in how she conceives survival above the clouds. Stakes are modest and almost entirely internal, but the throughline never breaks or meanders.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: a single drifting-night scene framed by the snapped cable and eventual rescue, with the meteorological work and knotting practice steadily accumulating toward closure. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the ending delivers a resonant reconfiguration as she conceptually reprices “void” and “tether.” Causality is simple but coherent (cable snap → drift → memorialization → rescue → logbook insight), and the rescue doesn’t undercut the internal arc. A slight sense of middle sameness keeps it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation is clean very early: who Elara is, where the Great Oak Library is, and that demolition is imminent. The structure is a tight single-scene countdown from preparation to execution, with causality intact (coin → pigments → mural → departure → demolition). The closure works as an earned stasis/charged poise: she cannot stop the causal event, but her completed mural and inner “carried sky” reconfigure what loss means. Escalation is mostly temporal and textural rather than plot-twisty, but it coheres and lands with a concrete before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure—from phrasebook to hopscotch runes to murmuration patterns to final chart—holds together cleanly and culminates in a clear closure beat when she sets a new course for the Aurora Archives. Causality is generally sound, with each step reasonably “because/therefore” linked, and orientation (who/where/when) is established early. The closure is more of a conceptual and directional shift than a hard choice with on-page cost, so the before/after is legible but not deeply pressurized. The ease and inevitability of success soften the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: climb → prophecy → hall of mirrors → vial uncapped → mechanism reassembled → village time restored. Closure lands clearly with the Decisive Change of the clock restarting and the Resonant Reconfiguration of Elara’s self-conception. However, the path from discovery to success is very smooth, with no real structural setback or complication once she finds the hall. The cost of success—physical, emotional, or ethical—remains mostly implied rather than dramatized at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: ghost messages → Mara’s investigation → council persuasion → midnight ritual → nebula and farewell, giving legible before/after stakes around survival. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the colony now has partial protection and Mara conceptually reprices haunting as enduring care, with Thomas’s departure as cost. The piece, however, glosses over any serious obstacles or near-failures during the implementation, so escalation feels more assumed than tested. Still, the structure fits the length and the ending’s cost—fragility of the shield, Thomas’s final fading—registers.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: we move from final preparations, to activation of the puppet resonator and lullaby, to the universe’s sleep and Elara’s dissolution, with no orientation debt. The global drive is clear—prepare and trigger a gentle end—and closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration where extinction is reweighted as an act of love. Causality is soft but intact: adjusting gears → placing the head → singing → beam/lullaby spreading → gears stopping and hush blanketing the cosmos. The cost is legible on the page: everything ends, and Elara knowingly offers herself and her work to ensure that ending’s character.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causality is clean: inheritance → blueprint discovery → need to place seven nuts before frost → travelers appear → birds attack → vibration plate and pruning hook resolve the confrontation. The time limit and frost hazard frame a single continuous scene with clear stakes, and the mechanical birds plus curse logic stay consistent. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: she saves the travelers at real risk and then recommits to dismantling the trail and continuing her unwanted duty. The cost is present but could be intensified by a sharper sense of what refusing or failing would personally change for her beyond generalized guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is a single, continuous scene whose accumulative observations (foam, chrysalis, river braids) build toward a clear resonant reconfiguration of grief. Causality is modest but coherent: coming to the ravine leads to specific sensory encounters that prompt reinterpretation and a concrete future plan (the new polymer). Closure is on the page: she leaves with a new stance and an intention that clearly marks a before/after. What keeps this from a higher band is the relatively low narrative pressure—events unfold smoothly rather than through any sharp structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: quantifying absence → incising the air → opening the doorway → crossing and renouncing parole, culminating in a clear conceptual repricing of her existence. Causality is consistent within the lyric frame (her measurements enable the incision; the parole flickers in direct response to her transgression). The closure has an unmistakable before/after—she abandons the cart and her conditional freedom to become the origin space—with a visible conceptual cost. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout, with no orientation debt or lens confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clear and coherent: rain → tidal pool map → excavation → descent → subsumption → emergence, with a legible before/after transformation. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural with a causal spine, and closure lands on-page when she becomes the pavilion’s enzyme and exits changed. That said, the process from discovering the entrance to resolving the world’s remorse is almost frictionless, with no complicating turn once she commits. The cost of her choice is implied more than dramatized, slightly softening the sense of decisive, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative ritual structure is clean: preparation → placement of the weight → song and transmitted vibrations → reanimation of the grain elevators → covenant-sealing clang. Causality is legible and consistent with the story’s magical-technical logic, and closure (the elevators locking in solidarity) is decisively on the page. However, the path from intention to outcome is very smooth; there’s no real sense that failure is possible once the ritual begins, which softens the felt cost at the close. Still, the single-scene arc is coherent and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece operates on an accumulative/textural lens: one continuous ritual scene that thickens in intensity until a conceptual shift at the end. Orientation is solid—who/where/when are clear—and the sequence (arrive with mirror → interface → adjust shards/angle → descend changed) is legible. Closure is present as a Conceptual Repricing of “abandonment” and a quiet before/after: she descends as something new. Still, causality and cost are soft; many beats restate transformation rather than staging discrete turns that narrow options or sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: inversion → entry → puzzle/guardians → revelation → exit, with clear because/therefore linkages (gravity inversion → threshold opens → vigilance awakens → combinations revealed). Orientation is solid from the opening sentence, and the rules of the inversion and grotto mostly hold together. Closure lands in a modest but coherent way: Elara secures the combinations and a seed, reconfiguring her future options (Charged Poise). The main limitation is that the retrieval proceeds almost too smoothly, with little sense that the goal might truly be lost or costlier than anticipated.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: anchored early in a single scene with one throughline—attempting to break the Great Hush via the alder—and the steps from observation to bowing to success are causally coherent. The drive lens reads as primarily accumulative/textural, with the slow build of preparation paying off when vibration finally travels through the insulator and roots. Closure lands via a clear before/after (no sound vs. first note in centuries) with a modest but real conceptual cost: the world’s rules begin to change. Escalation is gentle rather than gripping, so while closure works, the narrative never feels truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is clean: a single scene at the nexus with a clear drive—solve Mireya’s puzzle and reengage the Eclipse Covenant before the phase shift. Causality under an accumulative/textural lens holds: allowing the magnetic field to guide his moves leads to the stone’s transformation and his conceptual repricing of the covenant. Closure is on-page and legible, with a before/after in how he understands loss, beauty, and silence; the only constraint is that the temporal “deadline” never quite tightens into felt danger.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clear and accumulative: preparation → tuning attempt → successful opening → conceptual reframing at the end. Under a textural/accumulative lens, the build from external stillness to internal “frequency of forgiveness” lands as closure, with a legible before/after in Elio’s understanding. Causality is simple but intact; each move grows out of the last. The cost at closure is more implied than dramatized, which keeps the structural impact below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is clean and legible: a causal, single-POV progression from omen (turning of the tide’s thought) to mapping, descent, planting, and reflective ascent. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds through sensory density and ritual timing rather than overt reversals, culminating in a clear closure where her understanding of decay and endurance reconfigures the premise. Causality is intact (the doodles lead to the hollow; the tide’s turning dictates timing), with no orientation problems. The main limitation is relatively soft on-page cost and a low-key narrative arc, which keeps the piece shy of more decisive structural power.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: inversion window → ascent to arches → navigation to convergence → artifact discovery → data capture → urgent escape before gravity returns. The hour-long inversion and chronometer give the story a strong spine and maintain orientation and urgency. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (resilience as memorial continuity) tied to concrete action (recording the frequency and departing). The main limitation is that the cost of success remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as a hard trade-off or near-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal progression—entering the zone, surveying, following evidence inward to the clearing, and reaching a forensic realization—is clean, legible, and contained to one continuous scene. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: she “has it now,” reconfiguring the disaster as a precise geometry she can model for future prevention, with Chen’s death as the price. Stakes remain mostly intellectual and retrospective, which keeps escalation modest but coherent. There are no orientation or causality breaks, and the structure fits the length well.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: train-up/backstory folded into a single continuous ritual scene, with the sculptor’s blow serving as an external trigger that completes the causal circuit. The drive is largely accumulative-textural, but causal links (sculptor’s strike → bell-striking → global broadcast → Council reaction) are legible and satisfying. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing: awe becomes a measurable, encoded force, with the world’s before/after clearly implied. The only limiting factor is that the Council’s threat and the world’s stakes remain off-page abstractions rather than directly dramatized pressure in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: single POV, one primary ritual scene with an embedded flashback-vision, and a decisive healing of the breach at the end. Causality is strong under a causal lens—past hesitation → boundary shatters → years of penance → present correction with the same tool and site. Closure is clear and earned as she “plays the correction” and the range’s state changes from wounded to whole, with her role reconfigured from failed guardian to restorative artisan. The main limitation is that present-tense jeopardy is abstract: the world feels already broken rather than on the verge of renewed catastrophe.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: vanishing stars → halo fragment → Elara’s project → need for a cartographer’s certainty → orchestrated disorientation → transposed empathy → theorem attained at the cost of his selfhood. The piece reads as a mostly continuous scene with lyrical compression, and the closure is a clear decisive change plus conceptual repricing (knowledge gained, person lost, stars gone). Stakes remain somewhat cerebral, but the drowning metaphor and his disintegration render the cost legible enough for this length. No major orientation or lens-clarity issues interfere with the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is a clear single scene with an accumulative drive: pendant → archivist → first sprout → blooming ridgeway → resolved stance. Causality is legible and consistent: pendant vibration and Elias’s choice to linger lead to germination, which then scales as he continues to extend encounters. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—Elias redefines “delivery” and his role—with a coherent before/after. The main limitation is that the delivery to the Observatory never faces any real test, so external stakes remain almost purely nominal.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: arrive, set up experiment, perform it, witness result, and exit with a reconfigured understanding, all in one continuous scene. Causality is intact and legible (wind hush → experiment → frost reaction → emotional release → internal shift), and the closure functions as a conceptual repricing of reality. Stakes remain modest—no serious risk of failure or backlash—but within an accumulative/lyric lens, the single tightening (when the frost sublimates and scent/memory emerge) lands. Nothing crucial is left structurally unkept.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clear: discovery of the puzzle edges → decision to attempt the message → repeated failed weavings escalating to blood and tears → realization she must unravel herself → the tapestry’s activation and her dissolution. The piece runs on an accumulative/lyric lens with a coherent before/after: she exists apart from the weave, then becomes its final thread, a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. There are no major causality breaks, though some beats (e.g., how exactly the jigsaw mechanics work) are gestured at rather than concretely dramatized. The closure moment is legible and emotionally paid for, even as cosmological specifics stay mythic.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: silk as barter → descent through the mines → ritual at the seed vault → planetary and personal reconfiguration above ground. Orientation is strong from the outset (who she is, what the planet is, why the harvest failed), and the mine shaft sequence provides a coherent throughline. Closure lands: the seeds awaken, the arches hum back to life, and Elara emerges changed, with the cost framed as her willingness to leave safety and endure physical/psychic risk. The main weakness is that the operation proceeds with almost no genuine reversal or complication; success feels somewhat assured once the silk glows.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: shard → world-weaving → fragment-gathering → revelation of the sabotaged launch → Elara’s decision to accept rather than undo. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she forecloses the path of historical redirection, with a visible conceptual cost, and reorients her practice. The causal logic of how she pieces together the truth across worlds is sketched rather than detailed, but the pattern is legible and holds. The primary weakness is that the mentor’s world-changing act and its consequences are heavily summarized instead of partly dramatized, which flattens the inciting crime’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: one continuous night in the lighthouse, with present action steadily enriched by backstory about the vanished keeper and the stone-letter code. Causality is intact—her history with the cairn correspondence leads directly to her decision to preserve silence and “bottle” safety instead of restarting the chain. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ghost lifting the jar at dawn reframes her act as an ongoing, altered connection with emotional cost. Stakes remain quiet and interior, which slightly limits the sense of structural urgency despite the elegance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    The piece runs as a single, accumulative ritual: Kael ascends, prepares the wick, builds imprisoned light, then releases it at the threshold of dawn; causality and sequence are clean. Closure lands when the ancient shadows texture the dawn, a Decisive Change that also reconfigures the world’s relationship to memory with a legible conceptual cost (the world could have been bleached into amnesia). The structure is more ceremonial than contested, so escalation comes from density and imminence (sun “threatened to bleach the world”) rather than reversals. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the pattern set early is honored through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is a clean accumulative lyric: repeated acts of watching and tracking light build toward a conceptual repricing when she understands porosity and reframes the donor heart as a lens. Because/therefore linkages are subtle but present (she returns daily, maps light, today’s prismed shadow finally triggers the “explosive” realization and the choice to release the wing). Closure lands clearly as a resonant reconfiguration: her relationship to height, the heart, and “story gravity” has visibly changed, with the cost being the relinquishing of her fear-armor and the wing. It’s exquisitely shaped for a quiet, one-scene piece, though the pressure remains intellectual rather than narratively urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: routine maintenance → dream-mapping → realization at the “pin” moment → stormlit observatory act, all flowing cleanly. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: sorrow’s purpose and maintenance’s meaning are reweighted, and this is enacted via pouring the vials on the roots. Causality is soft but adequate for the lyric mode; nothing feels like a late rule-change deus ex machina. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, but the before/after is clear and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: Elara gathers memories, activates the mica window, weaves dawn, the community joins, and dawn breaks—a clear before/after with a decisive change. Causality holds under a textural/ritual lens; each step feels like a natural intensification of the previous one. The main weakness is the lack of genuine uncertainty or friction—nothing threatens to derail the ritual once it starts, so the outcome feels somewhat assured. Closure nonetheless lands solidly with the return of cyclical time and her selves coalescing.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: present-tense waiting, backstory of the mistaken invitation, inciting disturbance with the woman at the wall, and a quiet but decisive resolution. Causality is coherent under a primarily causal/accumulative lens: his history with the “mistake” directly informs his choice to replicate it for her. Closure lands as an earned stasis/conceptual repricing—he redefines “error” and commits to a new, stable way of helping—but the pressure curve remains relatively gentle, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is clean: initial loss → secret cultivation → ritualized reveal → reconfigured neighborhood stance. Closure is strong as a conceptual repricing: absolution shifts from a lost bakery to an ongoing, communal practice anchored in the garden and bread. Causality is soft but coherent—Mara’s choices lead to the communal meal and to the neighborhood’s changed behavior. The drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout, though the lack of a sharper turn underplays the sense of a single decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: setup of her work and world, intensification as the Fading accelerates, and a closure beat where the last vow dies and her understanding shifts. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—each step (engaging the resonator, measuring decay, increasing sampling rate) narrows options toward inevitable loss. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the blank slide and full ledger reweight preservation as an act of love rather than salvation, with the cost being irrevocable loss. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored early and never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine is clean: Mara enters with a goal, adapts tactics to paranoia and added muscle, captures the damning audio, and exits before the truce ends. The single-scene structure with a ticking clock suits the length and delivers a clear Charged Poise closure (she emerges with evidence and limited time to use it). Cost is implied more than dramatized—no near-miss or concrete consequence lands on the page—but the before/after is legible. Orientation (who/where/when) is strong from the outset, with no lens confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clear: arrival on the bluff → convergence of weather-bearers → forest election crescendo → Elara’s reconfiguration as emergent compass. Causality within this lyric frame holds: the election’s timing, the convergence, and the ring’s awakening all align to produce the closing realization. Closure is a valid conceptual repricing—her role and the meaning of “compass” are reweighted with some sense of cost, though that cost remains abstract (no concrete lost path or foreclosed option is dramatized). Overall structure is clean and publishable, but the narrative stops just short of a sharper before/after hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean and legible: tourists leave → child’s question lingers → she revisits the hidden safe → discovers the watermark instructions → repairs the lock → reveals the tunnel → chooses to go through. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual and life-cost implications. A minor plausibility wobble exists around the already “snapped” shackle being “repaired,” and the repair-success feels a bit convenient, but it doesn’t break structure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: map fragments → discovery of vault → journey → confrontation with Marcus → unlocking letters → decision to transcribe, all under a coherent quest lens. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: lost conversations are not gone but preserved, and truth gains a sanctuary with her new task. The main weakness is that obstacles (Marcus’s lie, the “guarded” quadrant) resolve quickly and safely, keeping tension moderate. Nonetheless, the piece feels structurally whole with a clear before/after in the city’s relationship to its history.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation → release of the mechanism → full symphony of bells → charged final image, with no orientation issues. Causality is coherent and linear, and the closure unit—a resonant reconfiguration where the world’s truth and awe are briefly restored—is legible. That said, the pressure line is gentle; nothing in the sequence strongly suggests what meaningful failure would look like, so the climax feels assured rather than precarious. The conceptual cost of being the last caretaker of wonder is implied but not sharply dramatized at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal spine is clean: magnetic shift → failing systems/roses mutating → decision to use the controlled burn protocol → walk through fire → seed-bank preservation and internal repricing of memory. Closure lands as a clear before/after in both the farm’s state and Kael-9’s relationship to its fears. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a strong accumulative lyric overlay, and that pattern holds to the end. Some midsection beats reiterate “miniaturizing chaos” without adding new tactical complication, slightly softening structural tautness.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: locket discovery → neighborhood stories → urgency from demolition → mailbox opening and letter → communal reconfiguration. The piece maintains single-POV focus and a coherent temporal and spatial frame, with a clear before/after marked by the letter’s revelation and the foreman’s pause. The closure beat lands on the page with felt cost in Mr. Alvarez’s decades of deferred grief and the community’s shared exhale, even if the solution arrives a bit conveniently (the key finally works just as demolition looms). Overall structure is robust and immediately publishable, if not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: decipher entries via dance and dice → approach vault → final sequence opens it, yielding the library of confessions. Causality is solid and legible under an accumulative/textural lens; each movement deepens context (prisoners, protein journals) and leads toward the vault. Closure is decisive and on-page—the vault opens, the truth is now accessible—though the resistance from the world/regime remains off-stage. The main limitation is that obstacles are conceptual rather than situational, so the path feels smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: whale beaches → fissure appears → she explores → coffee divination → excavation → recovery of the box and flowers → conceptual reframe of deletion as migration. Structure is linear and legible with no orientation debt, and the closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with clear emotional cost and altered future stance (“nothing about her lantern lighting would ever feel routine again”). The main weakness is a relative lack of concrete obstacles or complications once she commits to the descent, so tension escalates more through revelation than challenge. Still, the story delivers a solid, coherent arc with a decisive before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: single scene, single POV, with a clear beginning (preparation), middle (mapping silence and releasing the wing), and end (containment at dawn). Causality is intact under an accumulative/textural lens: each move (mapping, then using the wing, then exhaling the hush) logically tightens the situation toward containment. Closure is on the page—the prophecy is sealed, hush seeded—though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt. The piece never loses orientation, but the resolution feels a bit too assured, with minimal sense of risk near the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: rooftop encounter → lessons → deepened ritual → autumn meteor closure, all cohering under the drive to understand the building. The revelation that Elias died in 1987 and the use of the seal as translator escalate the conceptual stakes toward the final reconfiguration where Maya joins the building’s grammar. Causality is more thematic than plotty, but there is a clear before/after: she shifts from outsider-listener to integrated “word” in the structure. The cost—subsuming herself into this haunted syntax—is implicit yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clean: one continuous scene, a clear objective (archive the memory), a ticking clock (the last star/dawn), and a causal chain from setup through completion of the binding. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration of her stance and the garden’s function. The only weakness is that the memory’s resistance is more told than staged as discrete complicating beats, so the mid-scene turn feels a bit smoothed over rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean, single-POV, single-location accumulation: preparing the forgery, sealing it, hiding it, and emotionally releasing it. Causal links are coherent (discovering the seal → realizing its closing function → using it to finalize the forgery), and the dominant drive—to finish and release the treaty—carries to the last line. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she has crossed from burdened conspirator to someone who has relinquished ownership of the act, at real emotional cost. Stakes are largely off-stage (the broader war), but the scene still feels complete at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with interleaved backstory leading to a present-tense confrontation, revelation, and decision. Causality is coherent—shell → nexus → Archivists → ritual activation → revelation—and the closure unit (her reorientation toward the Echoed Ones and her role) lands with a clear before/after. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized through concrete loss, but it is legible. A slightly expository middle (the Archivists’ purpose) flattens tension without breaking the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece follows a clean single-scene causal arc: accumulated research → ghost’s warning → interpretive breakthrough articulated → commitment to expose the truth. Orientation is strong from the first sentence (who, where, what she does) and the drive lens reads as primarily causal with an accumulative texture. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wreck’s meaning is recast from tragedy/greed to sacrifice/redemption, and Elara’s decision to write forecloses the option of leaving the official lie intact. Stakes are conceptual rather than kinetic, and there’s no large reversal, but the structural progression is coherent and satisfying for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece operates cleanly as an accumulative/textural single-scene: each beat (rain’s aftermath, net mending, firefly synchronization, the unnoticed tear) layers toward the final conceptual repricing that appreciation is repair. Orientation is strong from the outset: who Kaelen is, where she is, and the temporal window (“during firefly season,” post-rain) are all clear. The closure is on-page and legible—she ties off the last knot with a new, crystallized understanding of her role. Structural risk is minimal, but what it attempts, it executes with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: observation of the anomaly → discovery and reconstruction of letters → revelation of the stillpoint → recognition of imminent failure → repair via resonator → expansion of the safe zone and Mara’s departure. Orientation is excellent from the first lines, and the drive lens stays causal through closure. The confrontation with the settlers is a bit undercooked as a structural beat—it spikes and resolves quickly via explanation rather than sustained dramatic friction. Closure lands clearly with a decisive change (stillpoint extended, Mara leaving) and a legible cost (they must maintain it without her, she surrenders sanctuary).

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    The structure is clean: long-term listening → new coordinates → precise storm/solstice alignment → ritual → altered dawn. Causality holds and the drive reads as mostly accumulative/textural with a causal spine, culminating in a coherent closure where the world’s rules are reweighted by cobalt rain and forked prophecy. The cost and before/after boundary are legible but somewhat conceptual and off-stage (the prophet and world remain abstract), keeping it slightly shy of exceptional. No orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: years of sound-hoarding → discovery of the music box → recomposed “lullaby” → decision to seek his daughter, with the final act of leaving the loft as a decisive change. The piece stays within one coherent frame (dawn in the loft, then descent to the highway) with backstory tightly tethered to present triggers. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: he moves from archivist to herald with a concrete plan and a clear cost. The main structural limitation is that external obstacles never arise, so escalation is almost entirely interior.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: repair work → accidental signal → hunters arrive → flight to lighthouse → activation of hidden mechanism → sonic absolution, with no serious logic gaps. Orientation (who/where/when) is strong within the first lines, and the single continuous scene respects time and space. Closure lands clearly as a Decisive Change with cost: the hunters are unmade, the boundary holds, and Mara is physically and emotionally drained but still bound to future equinox duties. The one soft spot is the somewhat convenient “finally understood” realization in the lantern room, which leans on blueprint backstory rather than entirely on present-scene struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: years of preparation → lunar/magnetic alignment → brief opening → disciplined crossing → escape and reconfigured future. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the single-scene structure with embedded backstory is easy to track. Closure is solid as a quiet but decisive change: they’ve crossed, the viaduct is gone, and the world’s options are different with a clear conceptual and practical cost. The lack of a substantial mid-scene complication or turn keeps the structure from feeling fully tested under strain, which limits upper-band scores.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal spine is clear: drought → exposed body/lantern → recognition of Elias → discovery of reports → decision to weaponize observation against the authority. The piece maintains a single scene with reflection woven in, and closure arrives as an earned conceptual/ethical turn rather than a physical reversal. The institution’s negligence is revealed somewhat summarily via the satchel, but it still reads as a motivated discovery rather than a contrivance. The drive lens remains causal through to her decision about the report, with a clean before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal throughline is clean: Elias seeks a “second opinion,” the repairman’s examination reveals the inscription, which reconfigures Marcus’s case and Elias’s future actions. The story maintains a single scene with just enough backstory to clarify stakes, and the revelation is legible and motivated. Closure is solidly a conceptual repricing plus a decisive commitment (to clear Marcus’s name), with a felt cost in terms of institutional friction and personal burden. The ease and speed of the discovery risk feeling slightly convenient, keeping this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: the algorithm → kaleidoscope decoding → new text output → final alignment → bell ringing forms a coherent escalation to a Conceptual Repricing closure (sound as consciousness/longing resolved). Time spread over “centuries” is handled economically and anchored to present action without disorienting. The causal chain is clear enough within this surreal frame, and the final act (snapping the arrow tip in place) credibly triggers the convulsion and bell. The cost remains mostly conceptual (the perfection of an unheard bell) rather than dramatized through constrained options, which keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.7)
    The causal chain is clean—numbers appear → she follows the trail → confronts AI → broadcasts coordinates → rescue—but much of it is told in summary rather than lived through scenes. The pivotal twist—that “deleted” consciousnesses are actually preserved astronauts in suspended animation beneath a social network—asks for more groundwork to feel fully coherent. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing (nothing is truly deleted) married to a solved mystery, but the rescue and exposure unfold very quickly once the evidence is assembled, softening cost. Still, a legible before/after reconfiguration is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: dilemma → exploration of mirrors and fragment → realization that the choice architecture itself can be rebuilt → concrete reconfiguration that saves both stakes. Closure is a Decisive Change plus a conceptual reweighting, with the crystal whole and the Council accepting a third path. The structure is essentially one continuous scene, well-contained, with no orientation or rule-logic breaks. The only soft spot is the relative ease of the resolution—very little on-page resistance or risk once the method is discovered, which tempers the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is a tight single scene with a clean causal spine: she comes to die, volunteers to trawl wreckage, seeks the “sound” of endings, encounters the shoe, and reconfigures her stance toward her own appointment. The accumulative/textural drive is consistent, with each image (ice, volunteers, parasol, shoe) thickening pressure rather than wandering. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: she can now hold her ending loosely, and both options (keeping or skipping the appointment) are charged with new meaning and cost. Orientation and timeline are clear and stable without distracting ellipsis or rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: pavilion → letter → memory → vineyard parallels → reconfigured stance, with a clear before/after in her relationship to waiting. Closure lands as an earned stasis/Conceptual Repricing—she is no longer waiting, and the love story’s meaning has been reweighted at visible emotional cost. The arc is intentionally quiet and mostly internal, which works, though it keeps the pressure curve from feeling truly taut.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative, ritual structure is coherent: pressure arises from the diminishing echo and the desert’s attempt to reclaim it, and the sequence of moves (arrival → approach → ritual → storage → departure) is clean. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the wisdom is transferred to the parapet and pavilion, and her role shifts from keeper to conduit with a clear before/after. Causality holds under the textural lens—each intensification (clearing revealed, desert contracting) naturally leads to the next action. Cost is present but subtle: the story could lean a bit harder into what she relinquishes or risks in letting the earth, not humans, become the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: seasons, vines, and growing archives build toward the equinox spiral and her eventual departure, which functions as a resonant reconfiguration with clear before/after. Causality is simple but intact—she comes, works, the town brings photos, collective perception shifts, then she leaves—and the global drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds throughout. The closure image of the empty map case and sacred ground lands with conceptual cost (she relinquishes her curated “masterpiece” to the town’s ongoing life). For very top scores, the central drive could use one sharper on-page complication or threatened failure rather than an unbroken progression.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative, lyric structure is coherent: present-tense observation → realization that growth is linguistic → decision to leave the crystal as testimony forms a clear before/after reconfiguration. Causality holds at a conceptual level (what she learns about the spores and the crystal’s function leads to her changed tactic for preserving language), and orientation in time/place/POV is never in doubt. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing rather than a decisive event, but the cost and stakes remain mostly abstract, limiting the punch at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is a clean, single-arc loop: awakening from the dream → racing to locate and record the sound → the forgetting cresting and wiping his success → the reset into eternal recurrence. Causality is legible under an accumulative/textural lens; each step follows from the constraint of precognitive forgetting and the tactics he’s devised (driftwood arrows, chalk). Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: he has succeeded and instantly lost the very thing he sought, with the driftwood and fog now reconfigured as a prison of his own design. The only slight limitation is that the inevitability of the loop mutes surprise; the arc is strong but not structurally astonishing.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal spine is clear: tremors → malfunctioning clock → recognition of unrecorded light → decision to rebuild optics → recall of the leaf sound → stabilization and transcendence, with a clean before/after in the observatory’s state and Elara’s existence. The piece operates under an accumulative/lyric lens, but the central moves still read as motivated, and the closure (Elara gone, camera and leaf left behind) carries felt cost and a strong Conceptual Repricing of time and falling. The metaphysical “escape velocity” transition is handwavy in physics terms yet consistent with the fabulist rules the story has taught, so it doesn’t break causality in context. Structure is tight and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural structure that tightens around a single continuous scene, from diagnosis clock (“three hours, perhaps four”) through ritual to death. Causality is clean: Elena’s interventions lead to the hymn, the scent, Maya’s shift, Hale’s final lucidity, and a charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: grief and fracture are reweighted as something to be held rather than erased, with Hale’s death as the decisive hinge. No major orientation or lens issues arise; the drive is coherent and the cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: catastrophe → six months of study → acquisition/use of the key → activation of the orrery → ritual loop-walking → contact with the sealed awakenings and insight about their purpose. The drive lens reads primarily as causal with a strong conceptual-repricing closure: the spoons’ role shifts from cataclysmic to preservational, and Elara’s mission reframes from rescue to restoration. The scene is continuous, orientation is strong from the opening, and the ending offers a clear “before/after” in knowledge and options, though the process unfolds with very little resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal spine is clean: the effigy discovery breaks Elena’s skepticism, bringing her to the garden to repair the changeling and then recover the Miller girl, with the tooth linking beats. Structure is linear and contained to one charged night, with a clear closure where the “door” in her certainty opens and both girls are tended. Cost is present in her relinquishing the comfort of disbelief and the fact that the girls won’t remember, even though she will. Escalation is modest but coherent, and there are no orientation or lens-clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: polishing → arranging → awakening of the pearl, with backstory of the fall interleaved via present-tense sensory cues. Causality is coherent: her long practice and precise placement of shards produce the non-destructive light, fulfilling the elders’ conceptual rule-set. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: her relationship to power and guilt is reweighted in the final image of “borrowed light” and weightless glass. Escalation is more tonal than event-driven, but the single tightening toward placing the final shard suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: one continuous scene, steadily building from observation, to ritual, to the decision to leave the pendant behind. Causality is clear under this lens—past viral shame leads to the chosen seclusion and ultimately to a reframed relationship with the confession and the sister’s relic. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the pendant’s role shifts from personal adornment to placed marker, and she exits carrying a new interior stance. The only constraint is that escalation is more tonal than situational, leaving the piece powerful but not structurally breathtaking.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: seashell arrival → decision not to end neatly → journey to nexus → ceremony → reconfiguration of her role. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she abandons “career ending” in favor of eternal witness, with the nexus as new frame. However, escalation feels smooth rather than pressured; nothing seriously contests her plan, so the “before/after” is more thematic than dramatically forced. Causality is intact, but the sense of paid price at closure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: preparation → invocation → transformation, all in one continuous scene, with a legible build toward the precisely timed alignment of the harvest moon and celestial mechanics. Causality is clear under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens: because she reconstructed the ritual and performs it at the exact alignment, therefore the land responds and the breach heals. Closure lands on-page as a decisive change (the vine exploding into abundance, the village awakening to remembered rituals) with a clear before/after and conceptual reconfiguration of the villagers’ relationship to the land. The cost is implied more at a communal/time scale (three decades of silence, the risk of forgetting) than dramatized as a sharpened personal sacrifice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation of the mandala, placement of the plate, and the sealing lead to the ignition and map in a clear ritual progression. Causality within the magical logic is tight—the flash-paper remnants and safekept starlight pay off exactly when she seals the plate, and the “world exhaling” is a legible closure beat. The drive lens is primarily Accumulative/Textural, and under that lens the final reconfiguration (the plate now a compass inward) lands with conceptual cost. What keeps this from a higher score is the near absence of complication or setback; the process unfolds as intended, so structural pressure is more ceremonial than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous situation with time sketched through “nine days” of observation, leading causally to repair and reactivation of the timer. The dominant stake—restoring the Echo Garden’s function—is coherent and paid off when the mechanism ticks and the cavern “exhales.” Closure is a clear Decisive Change with conceptual reweighting (time harvested, wonder stored) and no orientation problems. Escalation is gentle and primarily intellectual rather than dramatically tightening, which keeps this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative/textural structure is coherent: annual ritual → activation of tools → gathering and calcifying → cataloguing → quiet closure at dawn, with a clear before/after (“paralysis of boundless recursion” vs. another year’s sorrows contained). Causality is simple but functional: because she’s trapped in recursion, she must calcify burdens; because she orients properly and works through the night, the weights materialize and can be stored. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—an earned, quiet completion of a cycle with a felt conceptual cost—rather than a decisive change. There are no orientation issues; the piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece uses an accumulative/textural structure framed by the kettle’s boil, maintaining clear orientation and a single continuous scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara recommits to the ritual of carving, with grief reconceived as “furniture for the soul,” a stance that has visible emotional cost. Causality is quiet but coherent—each physical action (carving, pausing for tea, returning to the chisel) deepens the central drive. The only thing keeping it from a 9+ is that escalation remains subtle rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: arrival at the stalled lagoon → presentation of the scavenged stories → refusal of that “currency” → demand for personal regret → identity-transfer at the carousel. Causality holds under a textural/situational lens, and the closure beat (Mara becoming translucent as the ghost solidifies, carousel restarting) gives a legible before/after with cost. The world’s temporal weirdness is coherent enough and pays off in the “chronologically confused but finally whole” ending. A slightly sharper moment of decision—more hesitation or potential refusal—could heighten the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: survey → discovery of the sextant → decision to reroute systems → overnight work → proof-of-concept at dawn → impending colonist arrival. Closure is solid and legible as a decisive change: the terminal’s function is redefined, and her conceptual frame for hope crystallizes. The piece runs under a causal lens with a light accumulative texture, and there are no orientation issues. However, the middle lacks a concrete complication or reversal in her process, so escalation feels smooth rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece uses a clean single-scene structure—arrival, ritual placement, departure—with a coherent accumulative/textural drive that culminates in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is simple but intact: she has come for this purpose, performs the act, and leaves altered; each step logically follows the last. Closure is on-page and legible, with the metronome’s recontextualization and her lighter departure marking the before/after at real emotional cost. There are no orientation or lens ambiguities that undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is coherent: sundial → hidden engraving → reinterpreted coordinates → walk to cottage → journals → reweighted life path. The piece maintains a clean present-time line with reflection woven in, and the closure (her new stance on legend-seeking) lands on the page with conceptual and emotional cost. The journey to the cottage is slightly compressed and frictionless, softening the sense of on-page test. Still, the overall structure and closure are solidly publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous scene with a clear problem (recovering a nearly lost storm-calming technique), a focused process (decoding the rope), and a closure beat (realizing the secret lives in the negative space and carrying it away as a “seed”). Causality is gentle but intact: fog thickens as work deepens; fulgurite hums, then flares; understanding emerges from accumulated attention. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive event, but the before/after—Elias without and then with the technique, and the resulting obligation—is legible. Stakes remain largely conceptual and unopposed, which keeps the structural arc from feeling fully high-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is clean: we move from his stranded state, through the summoning of Malvine’s presence and the intense writing act, to the dissolution of the projection and a resolved inward stance. Causality is coherent under a textural lens—wind threatens the projection, urgency spikes the writing, and the finished page precipitates the final acceptance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: tying the thread, reframing absence, and deciding to travel inland all make the before/after legible with emotional cost. The piece remains a quiet, largely internal arc, but it does not feel static or arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is cleanly causal and accumulative: find egg → build apparatus → attempt revival → hatching and reconfiguration of the world’s meaning. Closure lands clearly with the chick’s emergence and the dawn / water shift, which reweights the entire mechanical backstory with a felt cost. Escalation is more emotional and atmospheric than obstacle-driven, but the piece never loses orientation or the throughline of the experiment. The ease of success (no real threat of failure or external interference) modestly lowers the sense of structural rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is a clean single-scene ritual framed by entry into the lagoon and emergence, with backstory folded in as pressure rather than digression. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the repeated motifs (fire, sand, scars, kelp, coin, clouds) deepen rather than flatten, and the final emergence with the graft “taken hold” provides a clear resonant reconfiguration. Causality is simple but intact: she comes to the lagoon to attempt the graft and does it; no unearned turns or rule violations. Closure lands with on-page cost in the form of ordeal, time, and the risk of desperate, unsanctioned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is clean: a single continuous evening with a clear clock (the paused geese) and a causal chain from discovery to plaza to opening the box. The closure beat—constellations aligning, the box opening, the city remembering—is explicit and legible as a decisive change with conceptual cost. The breadcrumb sequence provides a mild middle development, but obstacles are minimal and everything works on the first attempt, which slightly flattens tension. Still, under a largely causal-with-lyric-accretion lens, the arc is coherent and fully resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: transit → troubled sonar echoes → discovery of the nebular wound → reinterpretation of the gear → insertion into the “machinery older than atoms” → Elara’s dispersal. Causality holds cleanly under the textural/accumulative lens, and the closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing in which the generational role is redefined and the universe’s “rules” for illumination are reconsidered. The cost is legible in her becoming part of the pattern, which forecloses a future as an individual carrier. There are no orientation issues despite the lyric register, and setup/payoff chains around the gear and past sentinels are well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece reads as accumulative/textural: pressure builds through repeated ritual (poems, carving, migration) toward a conceptual turn where grief is refigured from monument to mesh. Orientation is clean early—who, where, when, and the supernatural premise are all legible—and the backstory is efficiently woven in through the dinner-custom frame. Closure lands on page with cost: the mentorship ends with the migration, the ribbon is made literally shorter, and Elias chooses to work on alone with altered understanding. The main limitation is that structural turns are gentle; the story leans on realization more than on concrete reversals that narrow his options.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: one continuous night ascent, a focused adjustment scene, and a quiet descent that lands in an earned stasis/resonant reconfiguration. Causality holds (past error → decades of calculation → tonight’s unique tidal distortion → precise correction), and closure is legible with cost in the form of a life spent compensating for one mistake. The time dilation conceit neatly justifies intense reflection during the pendulum’s pause, though it slightly strains plausibility at the edge of “frozen-time monologue.” Overall, the drive reads as primarily accumulative/textural with enough causal spine to satisfy.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: cemetery frame → ascent to silo → decoding → reinterpreted return to work, all under a single POV and temporal window. Causality is firm (inheritance → tapestry → code → revelation about the cemetery), and the closure delivers a clear reconfiguration of Mara’s role and the graveyard’s purpose. Stakes remain conceptual rather than dramatically tested, which keeps the plot from feeling fully pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive: contemplation → commitment to write → completion of the seven prophecies → lake’s crack as conceptual repricing. Causality is clean—her decades of modeling lead naturally to writing now under a generational constraint—and closure lands with the completed text and environmental echo. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and there’s only one major structural turn (she begins to write), but for a lyric piece the before/after is legible. Cost is implied (foreclosing thousands of alternate futures) rather than dramatized, which keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is a clean accumulative build: famine → radio fragments → encoded scores → dust-stories → citywide transformation. Causality within the lyric mode is legible and consistent, with no orientation issues and a clear throughline from pirate broadcast to cultural healing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: narrative now circulates through dust, breath, and music rather than books, with Elias’s ongoing labor as the stabilizing axis. The cost—that this miracle is painstaking, solitary, and never entirely complete—is present but subtly handled, keeping this just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative, single-scene structure is clear: chair rocking → ritual with ash and mask → stillness and realization → placing the mask on the chair. Causality is more emotional than event-driven but coherent, and the closure beat—recognizing that crystallization forecloses return—reads as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. Orientation in time/place and the ritual’s sequence is legible throughout. The piece leans heavily on texture over concrete turns, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean: one continuous scene with clear orientation (post-plague sunken city, sewer refuge) and tight causal chain (digging → discovery → agonizing → decision → renewed work). The closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he commits to an underground, precision-based resistance rather than surfacing to debate. Costs are conceptual and social rather than immediately dramatized, but they’re legible in his refusal to join the healing mythology and his choice to remain submerged. The drive lens reads as primarily causal with a strong conceptual overlay, and it holds consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: a single scene that moves from set-up and exposition of the rosette’s meaning to demonstration, then to the students’ participation and a resonant final image. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure coheres around whether these particular children of enemies can enact the old harmony. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when they look at one another as musicians instead of enemies, with a clear before/after. Still, the arc feels more like a confirmation of what Elias already believes than a turning point with tangible jeopardy; the possibility of failure stays mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: preparation → internal pruning → planting → explosive growth → charged final image, with a clear before/after in both Mara’s mind and the world. Causality holds under a mostly causal, slightly lyric-accumulative lens (her pruning enables the seed, the eclipse powers the transformation, which enables future rebellion). Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: she becomes a bridge and the fruit exists to challenge the regime, with implied cost. The main limitation is that external consequences and resistance are deferred off-page, so the climax feels more like a powerful prologue to conflict than a full test of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The structure is clean: staircase ascent → encounter with engineer → revelation → symbolic closure with box and matchbox is easy to follow. Causality generally holds—the blackout leads to the engineer’s presence, the bee and matchbox lead to the reveal, and the reveal redefines the tower’s function. The closure is a conceptual repricing of the tower and blackout with some cost implied (defiance of the Corporation, the fragility of this preserved moment). However, the plot pressure is relatively gentle and the price of truth remains mostly abstract, so the decisive change feels more intellectual than viscerally costly.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: observation → pattern recognition → discovery of the “shard of hush” → consecrating act → reconfigured understanding. Orientation is excellent from the opening line, and the bay, cottages, and method of investigation are all quickly and coherently grounded. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: houses shift from “haunted” to listening entities, and Maya’s role shifts from observer to participant. The cost is subtle—more conceptual than dramatic—which slightly limits the impact at a prestigious-fiction level.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is clear and coherent: Corvin moves from aftermath of revelation → doubt and reconsideration of purpose → decision to use the fissure → enactment and immediate repercussion in the garden. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the garden’s consciousness shifts from binary certainty to “polyculture of maybe,” with the fissure redefined as necessary. Causality holds under an accumulative/textural lens—each beat compounds pressure and knowledge rather than flipping on reversals. The cost is legible in the final earned stasis: Corvin commits to an endless, uncertain awakening instead of any neat salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a clear accumulative/textural arc: endless climbing → pause at the amber landing → mathematical assault on the staircase’s logic → rupture and exit. Causality is clean under the chosen rules (her proof plus the asymmetry of the chipped die destabilize the system) and the closure is an on-page decisive change with conceptual cost. The dominant stake—escape vs. endless, self-willed imprisonment—is legible and resolved. One could argue the “observer effect” insight arrives somewhat quickly, but it does not break plausibility or clarity of structure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The accumulative/textural structure is clean: we move from intention to successive visions to a greenhouse filled with glyphs culminating in a reweighted understanding of “lost” languages. Causality is internally consistent—the moon, brush, and insomnia all work together—and the pattern is taught early and followed. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: Maya’s work becomes “proof” that kindness leaves permanent atmospheric scars, and the dawn/smog contrast seals the before/after. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized (her hollowing insomnia and vigil), but it is present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative structure is coherent: grotto context → museum decay → bread-code revelation → assembly of elders → all-night documentation, with a clear before/after in communal silence vs. thawed storytelling. The closure unit is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s new understanding that their practices are navigational archives and that her documentation may guide future refugees. Causality is mostly tight, though the leap from noticing initials to precise map coordinates is somewhat convenient and handled briskly. The drive lens remains textural rather than strongly causal, but the final image and cost (flood/oblivion vs. preserved record) land.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: low tide reveals the stone → mechanism is mounted → lighthouse reverses → time unwinds → fate is erased → she steps into the beam and vanishes. Closure is strong and legible, with a decisive change in both reality and her existential status, plus a conceptually reweighted world (“Weep no more,” lighthouse resumes). However, escalation is almost entirely linear without substantive complication, resistance, or a moment where the plan nearly fails. The piece runs on a single, elegant idea rather than on developed structural tension, keeping it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clean: near-death → lingering luminance → funhouse as dream-logic crucible → advisor’s diagnosis and rule of fear → confession → use of the clasp to resolve the curse. The drive lens reads as Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative symbolism), and closure lands as a decisive change with visible cost (self-indictment, surrender of curse and inherited object’s power). Some elements are slightly expository or convenient—the advisor and dream dictionary explain a lot of rules in tidy aphorisms, and her prior drowning is told rather than integrated into present tactics—but they don’t break coherence. The scene holds together as one continuous, escalating confrontation with a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: storm approaches, she plays, resonance manifests, storm is dubbed and conceptually refigured from enemy to collaborator. Causality is soft but coherent within a lyric frame—her actions “therefore” reframe the storm without any jarring rule changes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the world is reweighted as perpetual music, with the next storm set up in the final lines. The main weakness is that the cost of failure/success remains mostly implied, so the before/after doesn’t bite as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: study of shells → discovery of the whistle’s function → arranged shells + tones → sky crack → turtles move → her culminating choice. The piece delivers a clear closure: the city begins crossing “into the crack between worlds” as a direct result of her actions, with a conceptual cost (loss of prior reality) on the page. Structure is efficient for the length, with backstory about the expedition and gate integrated into forward motion. The only limit is that the cost to the wider populace remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in specific frictions or objections.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clean causal arc: long-awaited natural cue → decoding of evidence → ethical weighing → decision about publication and memorialization. Closure is solid via her chosen strategy for revealing the truth and physically walking away with the letter, making the before/after legible. The reflective backstory is well-anchored in concrete present details (rosebush, station, letter) and doesn’t blur the scene’s temporal frame. Escalation is modest rather than gripping, but structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is clean: drawbridge rise → descent/work underwater → resurfacing at dawn with a renewed vow, all under a stable accumulative/textural lens. Causality is straightforward—each action naturally follows from the last—and the reflective passages are well anchored in concrete present stimuli. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration when her ongoing project is reweighted by the architect/fiancée revelation and her decision to keep returning, with a conceptual cost around impermanence. Stakes and turns, however, remain modest; there’s little sense that her options or future are materially narrowed beyond continued, self-imposed labor.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: suspicious stamp → alternative hypothesis → physical scrutiny of impressions → search for master registry → discovery of emergency protocol → decision to recatalog. The story delivers solid closure via a conceptual repricing of “forgery” versus “fragmented truth,” with a clear before/after in his mandate. However, obstacles are soft: nothing seriously threatens his investigation or forces a hard trade-off beyond time and professional pride. Still, as a quiet investigative piece under a causal lens, the structure is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: shadow-detachment → preparation in the garden → gem-folding sequence → release of cranes → dispersal. Causality is coherent within the lyric frame, and the closure—her realization that she has been the shadow and her transformation into light—lands as a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost. The drive lens is primarily accumulative/textural, and it holds: each fold deepens the central pressure of grief-transformation until the final release. The only limitation is a relative smoothness of path—no serious on-page complication once the premise is established—keeping it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is clear: surge → AI downtime → calculations → coordinates → decision to descend, all under a live clock. Orientation is strong from the outset and the single-scene structure holds without confusion. Closure lands as a charged poise: she departs with new knowledge and a concrete plan, with the cost (risk and irrevocable commitment) legible. The beat path is fairly linear and frictionless, with no real complication or reversal beyond the time constraint, which keeps it short of top-tier structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The structure is cleanly causal under an accumulative/textural lens: arrival → orientation/alignment → physical activation → signal reception → internal reconfiguration. Orientation is excellent from the first sentences (who/where/when are immediately clear), and the single-scene arc is coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the “missing pieces” resolve inside him via the decoded signal, with a clear before/after in his sense of belonging. The main limitation is that structural tension is low; there is little sense that failure or a different outcome is meaningfully possible.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    The accumulative structure is clean: terrace → reflection on past crime → search among carvings → discovery of the final piece → resolve to confront the daughter, with each step deepening pressure rather than meandering. Causality is tight under a lyric lens: his prior forgery created the absence, the father’s driftwood practice creates the present task, and the completed lineage reconfigures his options. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: he cannot undo the past, but he can bear witness and carry these objects into the future at visible emotional cost. The only restraint is that the “tomorrow” action remains prospective rather than partly dramatized, keeping this just shy of fully decisive change on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: a single, continuous negotiation scene with clear orientation and a coherent accumulative drive that culminates in the unlocking and symbolic gifting. Causality is straightforward—her prior preparation and ritualized signal produce a smooth, if low-drama, exchange—and closure lands in a charged poise as she remains to “count the heartbeats until the next phase.” The cost is conceptual and cyclical rather than dramatic, but the before/after is legible: another life released, another layer of history carried. The piece flirts with being almost too frictionless, yet the ritual solemnity and implied history of failed talks keep it from feeling inert.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a clean causal spine: past catastrophe → distrust of stars → adoption of utility poles → this pilgrimage to the cove to lay down the compass. Structure is essentially one continuous scene with embedded backstory that remains anchored to concrete present cues (the poles, surf, compass). Closure is an Earned Stasis/RR: he renounces the celestial ideal and commits to a humbler navigation, with a clear before/after. Escalation is quiet and mostly internal, but the arrival at the cove and setting down of the compass provide enough structural cadence to satisfy at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is clean: procedure → object/map → descent through the labyrinth → transformation at the lake → re-emergence with a new mission, all under a coherent causal spine. The closure—Mara’s on-page emotional and cognitive change at the lake, plus the reconfigured newspaper clippings—is both decisive and legible in cost. Some of the labyrinth’s moral tests are summarized rather than dramatized, which blunts the sense of discrete turns under pressure. Still, the drive lens (largely causal with accumulative texture) holds throughout and there are no major orientation or logic breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure is clean: arrival in the orchard, ritual preparation, metamorphosis, contact, and a new stasis as the bridge. Causality holds under a mostly accumulative lens—each step (fortune → orchard → spices → conjuring → transformation) narrows Elara’s options and leads to the closure. The cost of remaining as a permanent fixture in the grove is explicitly stated, giving a clear before/after. There are no orientation issues or unkept setups, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a mechanical twist.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: cards lead her to the nexus → ritual with saucer and cloth → unfastening clasp → repricing the quest from retrieval to acceptance. Causality within the lyric mode holds—each step is motivated by the previous image or instruction (the Nine of Shadows, the family custom, the old texts). Closure lands clearly as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis: she descends not with time reclaimed but with forgiveness as a new, costly prize. There are no orientation or lens-clarity issues; if anything, the arc is almost too tidy in thematic alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: move to vault → activate photographs/tears → reach apex via emotional gravity → stitch open the locked dimension → pass through. Causality is coherent at a mythic/philosophical register (shadow acceptance enables perception of the seam; photos and crystal are tools; stitching physically reconfigures the barrier), and the story sustains a single scene in continuous time. Closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing: humanity’s extinction is reweighted as shadow to be integrated and released, with the cost that the last human leaves the material world and the ship remains “empty but for starlight.” There’s little on-page resistance or uncertainty in the middle, but the overall arc remains legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative structure—jar by jar, realization by realization—builds cleanly toward a resonant closure where Elias accepts burial by ash as the price of long-term fertility. Causality is lucid enough: his history of orchestrated coincidences leads to this detour, the Codex of Ash prophecy, and his acceptance that he is the final ingredient. The closure image (ash rain, lightning bugs ascending, fields to come) carries clear conceptual cost, though the story leans more on explanation of prophecy than dramatized turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Structure is clean: blackout → retrieval of tools → geometrical positioning → completion of sundial → poised revolution forms a coherent causal chain. Orientation (who/where/when) is established quickly and never lost, and the ending provides a clear Charged Poise closure with the “quiet click of understanding.” However, the path from start to finish is almost entirely unimpeded; there are no real complications or reversals to tighten options, so the arc can feel preordained rather than pressured. Cost at closure is mostly conceptual, not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: preparation → final alignment → transformation, with backstory interleaved in ways that clarify rather than confuse. Causality is solid within the speculative frame (no friction → need eel-slime + stone-field → awakening of star dust → self-sacrifice), and the closure beat is decisive and costly. The promise and curse are both paid off on the page, and the later travelers’ discovery provides a satisfying epilogue reconfiguration. The only limit is that pressure ramps conceptually more than through concrete dilemmas or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure is cleanly accumulative: observatory vigil → discovery of envelope → recognition of father’s vigil → decision to write and pass the vigil on. Causality holds under a textural lens and the final act of sealing her own manuscript and replacing it where she found the first creates a clear before/after. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the “paused” vigil restarts, and she leaves with a different relationship to silence and speech. The only thing keeping this from the very top tier is that external consequences remain abstract; the on-page cost is primarily conceptual rather than felt as immediate danger.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: waiting for sun → duel begins → pressure near sundial → use of needle card → decoding coordinates → truce and shared goal. Closure is solidly on the page, with a clear before/after in their relationship and in the status of the sundial from curiosity to map. The drive lens is predominantly causal, with each beat justified and no obvious teleports or rule breaks. Stakes remain conceptually rich but practically modest, so while the structure is tight, the sense of cost could be heightened.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal spine is clean: Elias arrives with the tin because of the resistance’s plan; he and Marcus coordinate under cover of book-sorting; the guard shift provides a window to transfer the seeds and move the crates. The story holds a mostly Causal/Accumulative hybrid lens and lands a clear closure unit (Charged Poise/RR) in the final image of resistance blooming despite the imminent molt and possible destruction. The cost—fragility of their project and Elias’s unstable identity—is legible but largely conceptual, with no concrete obstacle or reversal beyond the implied threats. Structure is solid but conservative: escalation is more a gentle tightening than a sharp turn, which slightly lowers impact for elite-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: failing compasses and approaching storm → need for refuge → decoding Maya’s film via projector/piano synchronization → using the modified piano to pull the station into a stable atmospheric pocket. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/RR: she stabilizes the station and herself, paying the cost of three years’ grief to reach a new equilibrium. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when are legible), and the world’s rules are internally consistent. The main weakness is that the solution, once the Morse coordinates are discovered, unfolds smoothly without a serious late complication or setback, so the climax feels slightly under-pressured for the stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent: assignment → dream-coordinates → planting → dream-awakening → root integration → monsoon arrival. Structure is linear and clear, with a legible closure unit in the awakened tree and the decision to use its fruit. The time pressure of the monsoon is set up and partially paid off, but the storm arrives after the central task is already essentially successful, blunting cost at the climax. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration (preservation as evolution) with mostly conceptual rather than dramatic price.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is clean: workshop → discovery of lace → decoding → following the compass → cliff epiphany → return and reconfiguration, all under a single emotional drive. Causality is intact even in lyric mode—her choices to stop avoiding the compass and to apply the lace’s instructions advance the piece logically. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she re-prices silence, sorrow, and “cerulean regret” with a felt cost and new stance. The only limit is that external stakes remain very low-key, so the turns are more conceptual than situational.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.7)
    The accumulative structure builds well, but the closure relies on a summary time-jump rather than a scenic beat to prove the "conceptual repricing." The final state is explained rather than dramatized through a specific, high-pressure action in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line, but the plot hinges on significant conveniences: frost patterns perfectly matching a ledger's coordinates and journals surviving decades to explicitly explain the father's motives. This "explain-everything" ending provides closure but lacks a felt cost paid on the page, reducing the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.3)
    The story follows an Accumulative lens but lacks a closure mechanism with visible cost; the healing acts as a "soft reset" where the ritual works perfectly on the first try. The narrative arc is linear success—she plays, she sees, she heals—missing the friction or failure required to earn the "Resonant Reconfiguration" at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative operates on a cohesive dream logic where the "impossible space" functions as a valid mechanism for the genre, leading to a strong Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure is distinct and earned: Marian’s transition from undertaker to librarian carries a palpable conceptual cost (the abandonment of the surface world) that lands with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative logic falters at the climax: ringing a loud bell in a sealed, sanctioned valley to summon a mass gathering ignores the established danger of the siege (patrols, enforcement). The resolution relies on a convenience that dissolves the external threat to allow for a speech, undermining the story's causal ground.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear enactment structure: arrive, see, realize, heal. While the closure (healing the bridge) is legible, it lacks narrative cost; the protagonist’s collapse feels like a physical performance rather than a consequence of a difficult choice. The "monk in Lhasa" backstory is a convenient device that lowers the causal difficulty of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path to transcendence without a strong causal turn driven by the protagonist's resistance or ingenuity. While the closure—merging with the maze—is legible, it relies on a "symmetric satisfaction" logic where the protagonist simply accepts the anomaly's effects, resulting in a static dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    The inciting incident works, but the central puzzle (seed-pod fletching visually matching a DNA sequence which maps to piano keys) strains verisimilitude significantly. The climax relies on a "soft reset" of the threat, where the opposition dissolves without a logical mechanism beyond the protagonist's presence.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative structure is solid, utilizing a Hybrid Accumulative/Causal lens where the collection of "absences" logically builds to the forging of the device. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara accepts the sound of her regret—lands with genuine conceptual weight. Orientation is grounded quickly despite the surreal elements, and the sequence of events flows causally from her expertise and method.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot relies on a "master key" device (the flower code) that predicts and neutralizes obstacles before they manifest, stripping the narrative of causal friction. The linear progression from arrival to theft to exit lacks a decisive turning point or a moment where the plan faces a credible threat.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and effectively structures the single scene from mundane preparation to significant departure. The closure (placing the bookmark in the sphere) acts as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, though the progression feels somewhat linear and inevitable rather than driven by surprising causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.3)
    Credibility suffers from significant mechanical contrivances: the seashell functioning as an audio player in a realistic setting breaks genre logic, and the "tear-lens" decryption method strains physical plausibility. The resolution relies on a convenient environmental trap rather than a dynamic tactical exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building density toward a valid Conceptual Repricing closure where the map transfers to her body. Causality holds within the lyric logic, though the progression is somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    The structure is legible, with a clear inciting incident (violin) and closure (melting/return to work). However, the narrative arc leans on "telling" the realization via exposition ("The Second Chance Program was... a temporal engine") rather than dramatizing the discovery through causal action. The "loops" are described as a state of being rather than a problem to be solved.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The plot moves cleanly from discovery to confrontation, but the logic of the lens "transforming" chaotic scratches into a dated map is physically tenuous; magnification alone shouldn't reveal invisible dates. The causality between stealing "fundraising records" and wanting to understand the building sale is also slightly murky—stealing financial records feels distinct from the eavesdropping motive.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual path that flows smoothly to a legible Conceptual Repricing; however, the lack of a sharp causal turn or unexpected obstacle makes the progression feel inevitable and low-energy.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a clear linear cause-and-effect path to a legible resolution (Conceptual Repricing). However, the closure lacks the required "visible or felt cost" to reach higher bands; the experiment works perfectly on the first try, offering validation without trade-off. The structure is functional and coherent, but the absence of complication or price flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot is linear and lacks causal friction; the protagonist encounters no obstacles, understanding the ghost's code instantly and succeeding on the first attempt. While the closure (water receding) is physically legible, the friction-free progression makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving seamlessly from the fever breaking to the discovery of the illustration. The closure is excellent: taping the anomaly to the center of the log is a Decisive Change that undeniably reconfigures her stance and accepts the cost of complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, deepening from the confession to the physical proof. The ending functions as a strong Conceptual Repricing, reweighting the "swallowed truth" into physical tonnage. The coincidence of the specific radio caller providing the clue at the exact right moment is the only slight strain on causality.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative follows a linear "tour" structure without causal linkage or escalating pressure; events simply happen sequentially. The ending lacks a requisite Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration, offering a low-stakes loop where the protagonist leaves exactly as she arrived without paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (Milo speaking) is a clear Decisive Change, but the causality feels convenient, relying on the "calculated" magic of the eclipse. The connection between the set-up (locket) and the resolution is thematic rather than strictly causal. Orientation is generally solid, though the pacing drags slightly in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on unearned epiphanies ("understood immediately") where connection is asserted rather than dramatized. The leap from a tapestry fragment to a world-restoring formula breaks causality, functioning as a "magical object solves plot" device. Closure feels imposed by the narrator’s declaration of "deliverance" rather than emerging organically from the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative relies heavily on expository summary to explain the premise rather than dramatizing the mechanics of the "flow." The closure—Elias deciding to leave—feels like a soft reset, disconnected from any escalating pressure or decisive on-page inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal chain is clear, but the resolution relies on "explaining the magic" (naming the rhetorical devices) rather than purely dramatizing the effect. The closure is tidy and intellectual, lacking the visceral consequence or "felt cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative structure, moving from observation to epiphany, but the resolution borders on a "soft reset" where the core problem ("chronological homesickness") simply lifts with the dawn. The "exhaustion" stake established in the opening is dropped rather than complicating the closure, reducing the sense of causality and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear progression relying on a sudden epiphany rather than a causal turn forced by pressure. While the procedural generation provides a functional structure for the scene, the resolution—a realization of self-unity—feels inevitable and declarative rather than earned through a difficult, high-stakes choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving efficiently from the inciting invitation to the climactic realization. The causality is functional, though the resolution—a swift, complete emotional breakthrough triggered by the mechanism—feels slightly convenient and linear for the weight of the subject.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.5)
    The narrative arc is tight and causal, moving seamlessly from the pressure of surveillance to the discovery of the pigeon and the final commitment. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the choice to open the window and mix inks physically manifests her acceptance of danger, reweighting the initial stakes with palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative suffers from a disorienting tense shift ("transformation completes now" vs. "began") that disrupts the timeline. Causality relies on a convenient backstory justification—the wife's implausible molecular calculation—rather than the protagonist's agency, functioning as a deus ex machina that resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a coherent Textural/Accumulative drive lens, resolving in a Charged Poise that rejects the binary choice. The rope moving "of its own accord" is a slight causality patch that weakens agency, but the final image of the "question" effectively reconfigures the story's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative structure, building density from the fire to the violin to the shipwrecks' response. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, the lack of obstacles or setbacks makes the progression feel like a procession rather than a plot. The "cost" of the transformation is abstract, lacking a concrete price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magic fix" resolution where the setting spontaneously upgrades the product, removing the need for a hard trade-off or incurred cost. While the scene has a clear beginning and end, the climax is observed rather than earned, lacking the requisite causality for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative timeline is incoherent; the story claims a friendship "kindled by that envelope" taught Elias lessons weeks ago, yet depicts him handing over that very envelope in the present scene. This creates a causal loop where the effect (friendship/lesson) precedes the cause (returning the photo). The closure is a low-stakes administrative action (initiating a grant) that lacks a decisive turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story violates the scope default by relying on broad summary ("For seventeen cycles," "Each night") instead of a continuous scene or shards. The narrative arc reads like a synopsis of a longer work, lacking the immediate causal traction of a specific scene window.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed with a flawless causal chain: the mechanic of "borrowing time" directly accelerates the threat (waking the giant), creating a perfect structural feedback loop. Closure is decisive and earned, with the cost (the spent pendant and the near-miss escape) clearly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative is static: the protagonist looks, sees, and understands, with no causal complications or escalation. Closure is achieved through a costless epiphany ("equations solve themselves") rather than a decisive change or paid price, failing the requirement for a felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    The structure follows a clear accumulative logic (retrieving, processing, distributing) within a coherent timeframe. Orientation is solid. The ending counts as Earned Stasis, but the "cost" is somewhat abstract (continued invisibility) rather than an acute price paid during the scene to achieve the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from observation to realization to decision, fitting the short scope well. The closure—deciding to reconstruct the nursery with open trellises—is a Decisive Change that logically follows the epiphany. However, the stakes of risking endangered species are resolved a bit too easily by the sudden philosophical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative follows a strong Causal lens: desire leads to the journey, the exchange creates a cost, and the result is a distinct change in stance. The closure (sketching the scene) validates the internal shift, effectively reconfiguring the protagonist's relationship to her insomnia.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving efficiently from the inciting incident (pilgrim's arrival) to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara accepting uncertainty). The closure lands with a valid conceptual cost (the loss of her predictive certainty), though the causality is somewhat soft, relying on mystical alignment rather than protagonist pressure to resolve the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with a clear shift in the object's meaning. However, the inciting encounter relies on the convenience of the specific widow appearing at the exact moment Kael finds the valve, which simplifies the causal chain and lowers the feeling of earned inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal path from the discovery of the cracks to the boarding of the train, satisfying the closure requirement with a Decisive Change. The progression is steady, though the inciting incident ("appeared only last Tuesday") relies on convenient timing rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative suffers from a severe logic break in the timeline: Mara maps a renovation overnight, yet by morning has "new meditation niches" ready for visitors, an impossible construction feat that shatters plausibility. The magic tile functions as a Deus Ex Machina, resolving the central conflict instantly. The closure relies on this unexplained logistical leap, undermining the story's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    The arc is structurally sound with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the amulet is paid as a cost. The causality holds under the lens, though the climax relies heavily on abstract visual description rather than specific, grounded hurdles.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.3)
    A significant spatial and logical disconnect occurs at the climax: the protagonist breaches a "server room" to add drops to an "afternoon tea," conflating a digital infrastructure target with a food service location without explanation. This causality break confuses the physical action of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative holds a clear Accumulative lens, using the lamp's hum effectively to pace the scene. Closure works as a Resonant Reconfiguration of the silence, though the inciting "dip" in the hum feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative operates as a static vignette rather than a causal story; there is no inciting incident in the present timeline to disrupt the status quo. Closure relies on a summarized realization ("understanding finally") that feels like a restatement of the premise rather than an earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows an Accumulative lens, building texture through the cello performance to trigger an epiphany, which functions as a valid Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the causality is dream-like and convenient; the solution to the mystery appears simply because she plays the instrument, not because of a hard-won realization or tactical choice. The ending offers closure, but it feels unearned by the preceding low-pressure events.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a valid Charged Poise closure, but the progression lacks causal density; the plan succeeds instantly (the juggler understands immediately) without complicating setbacks. The orientation and drive are legible, but the low resistance flattens the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative follows a coherent Situation/Accumulative drive, using the countdown to dawn effectively to build pressure. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical site is lost but the data is archived—lands with earned cost (the physical ordeal and the melancholy of loss). Causality is tight.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain with a defined objective and ticking clock. The closure lands a Resonant Reconfiguration, though the resolution feels slightly mechanical in its efficiency, lacking a complication that forces a shift in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-stakes procedural path (read sign, walk, confirm, upload) with convenient dream logic driving the "condensation as map" mechanic. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing of the map, but the lack of complications or setbacks makes the causality feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path without a significant reversal or moment of doubt; the "dissonance" offers potential pressure, but it is resolved immediately by merely "increasing her pace." The closure is a foregone conclusion, lacking a Decisive Change with visible cost or sacrifice to earn the restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with a clear inciting incident and a defined ticking clock via the oxygen gauge. The closure is strong, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist is irrevocably changed by the memories. The score is limited by the "vision" beat, which functions as an exposition dump to resolve the central puzzle, reducing the causal satisfaction of the discovery phase.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tight and the closure—an escape into myth—lands with earned conceptual weight. The "narrative physics" logic is established early and pays off at the climax. A minor gap exists regarding the "stone-dead" warden and confessors; their demise is stated as a fait accompli to satisfy the timeline constraint rather than dramatized, but the momentum carries the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    The inciting incident triggers the climax through convenient telepathy—Julian immediately knows Eira's specific purpose ("repay a debt") without earning that knowledge. This "Helpful Narrator" shortcut dissolves causal tension, turning the resolution into a procedural checklist rather than a narrative discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative structure is summary-heavy ("Night after night"), compressing the timeline and distancing the reader from the pivotal moments. The closure relies on a magical ritual resolution ("canyon shuddered... with relief") that feels convenient rather than earned through causal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative arc with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure, where the sundial connects the living and dead. However, the progression lacks causal friction; the protagonist finds exactly what she needs through "wandering" without meaningful setback, making the resolution feel convenient and inevitable rather than earned by specific tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.1)
    The plot relies on the convenient existence of the chalk matrix, which functions as a "magic key" rather than an earned discovery derived from causality. The closure is a clean "mission accomplished" transaction that lacks the required felt cost, resulting in a symmetric satisfaction that deflates tension.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving cleanly from observation to detection to decisive intervention. The closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "error" in the embroidery recontextualizes the entire scene as an act of counter-espionage. The logic of the "adjacent possibilities" holds firm, making the climax feel inevitable rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a solid Resonant Reconfiguration; Elara does not change the past but heals her relationship to it. However, the narrative lacks structural friction; the obstacles (spirits) capitulate immediately upon seeing the shard, making the middle section feel procedural rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural path, successfully using the cast notes to build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration closure ("not stains but seeds"). While the structure is sound for a lyric vignette, the lack of immediate scene-level causality or active obstacles makes the progression feel static. The closure lands clearly as a shift in perspective, though the cost remains largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (waking up changed) is legible, but the "daydream" frame softens causality, allowing the plot to advance via dream-logic convenience rather than earned progression. The lack of setbacks makes the sequence feel more like a ritual enactment than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic to a legitimate closure (leaving the coin). Orientation is strong. However, the progression is linear and low-pressure; the "realization" comes somewhat easily, without significant obstacles or causal density to earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean and causal, moving efficiently from setup to the raid and the protagonist's sacrifice. Closure is strong and valid: a Decisive Change (capture) is accepted to preserve the resistance, with the cost clearly paid on the page. The orientation and pacing support the short format well, though the transition to the raid is slightly abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative spans centuries in summary mode rather than grounding in a specific scene with urgent pressure. The ending shifts abruptly to a "centuries later" coda with human divers, breaking the established POV and frame to deliver an epilogue. This structure dissipates tension, relying on a timeline jump to force resolution rather than on-page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is clean and complete, effectively using the "broken tool" to resolve the immediate pressure of entropy. The closure—a resonant reconfiguration where light is bought at the cost of the object—lands with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path where a magical mechanism conveniently solves a complex relational conflict. The lack of complications or potential failure during the ritual robs the climax of tension; the resolution feels inevitable and unearned because the magic does the heavy lifting for the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story relies on a massive block of expository backstory (~30% of the text) to explain the satchel and the code, which stalls the present-moment momentum. While the closure—refusing the upgrade to maintain the beeswax seals—is a valid Decisive Change/Earned Stasis, the narrative drive is diluted because the pivotal discovery happens off-page three days prior. The drive lens struggles to hold tension during the long reflective middle.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative structure is solid, with a clear orientation and a decisive closure unit (releasing the bird, descending the stairs) that carries visible cost. The logic of the "dust mote" navigation method is fantastical but consistent within the established lens.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic: observation of the table aligns with the logbook, leading to a realization and a decisive physical exit. The closure acts as a Conceptual Repricing, transforming the maze from a puzzle to a sanctuary, though the "intuition" beat feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a clear arc, but the resolution relies on poetic logic (a specific biological breath signal activating ancient tech) that feels convenient rather than causally earned. While the closure is legible (the ghost fades, the mission succeeds), the "softly ingenious" protocol acts as a deus ex machina to solve the pressure crisis without a significant trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is linear and anecdotal, lacking a complication that tests the protagonist's method. Closure relies on a "soft reset" epiphany where the problem is simply reinterpreted as a benefit without tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative follows a linear path of perfect execution without the necessary causal complications, risk, or felt cost required for a resonant closure. It reads as a procedural vignette where the outcome is guaranteed from the start, lacking a decisive change or reconfigured stance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.3)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the ritual, and the closure (a decisive transformation) lands with legible cost (loss of human form). However, the narrative drive is low-voltage; the "alarms" arrive too late to create causal urgency, leaving the pacing somewhat flat.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is static, functioning as a vignette of contemplation rather than a causal sequence of events. The closure (Conceptual Repricing) lands without visible cost or a foreclosed option; the protagonist arrives, thinks, and leaves without a decisive shift in tactics or tangible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elias's trauma. However, the resolution relies on a "magic speech" that cures deep psychological distress too easily, and the coincidence of their meeting is convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative follows a linear trajectory of competence without causal friction or setbacks; the mechanism of resolution (arranging shells to fix time) is asserted through dream logic rather than demonstrated causality. The ending provides a "symmetric satisfaction" where the problem is solved by simply completing the task, lacking a felt price or structural twist.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.5)
    The structure is a linear "tour" of discoveries (enter, find diary, find negative, leave) rather than a causal chain of events. Closure is a soft realization ("to discover what walls dream about") that feels conceptually light and lacks the pressure of a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The situational arc is solid, with clear orientation and a coherent ritualistic structure. The closure lands as a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, altering the world (mirrors holding possibilities) while returning the protagonist to stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and achieves closure through a "Conceptual Repricing" (shifting from treaty to garden), fitting the 600-800 word scope. However, the logic that a portable garden compels peace through "biological necessity" is poetic rather than structural, making the resolution feel softer and less inevitable than the "unyielding logic" the text claims.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is tight and the causality of the manufactured drought enabling the discovery is excellent. The closure is resonant, creating a "cathedral" of silence that reconfigures the crime into a completed transaction, though the rain's arrival is slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    The single-scene arc is tightly structured around the "three minutes" constraint, creating effective narrative tension. Closure lands with a valid Decisive Change as she unlocks the memories, though the resolution mechanism ("untangling threads") relies on abstract magical logic rather than a gritty, causal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    The closure (burning the puppets) is a decisive, costly act, but the causal path leading there relies on a coincidental encounter with a blind storyteller who happens to narrate the dome's exact thematic history. This convenience resolves the conflict rather than complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative structure is executed well, building toward a resonant closure that feels earned. The final decision to dismantle the tower (Resonant Reconfiguration) effectively dramatizes the acceptance of impermanence, satisfying the drive lens with a clear physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear, linear Accumulative arc: preparation, process, and revelation. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where sound becomes light—is logically earned by the established magic system. However, the narrative lacks a distinct turning point where failure is a genuine risk; the progression is smooth and procedural, missing a moment of doubt or cost to heighten the resolution's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the melting seal and the physical departure mark a clear change in status. The dream sequence functions as a valid mechanism for epiphany given the established "scientific" context. The narrative arc is clean, moving from stasis to decision via a precise catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight, effectively utilizing the "between regimes" timeframe to justify the unguarded library and the protagonist's bold action. Closure is decisive and earned, linking the mechanical act (touching the tile) to the thematic realization (spending his soul) with clear causality.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear Causal path (threat arrives, tool acts, threat leaves), but the resolution is too frictionless to create satisfying closure. The protagonist faces no setbacks or failures that require a change in tactics, resulting in a "clean sweep" ending that lacks a felt cost or decisive change in the protagonist's state.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural arc with clear cause and effect, leading to a legible "Earned Stasis" closure where the dream is captured. However, the progression lacks a significant reversal or unforeseen complication, making the success feel somewhat inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative arc that resolves into a strong Conceptual Repricing: "mending" is redefined from restoration to stabilization. The closure is excellent, anchored by the physical ritual of leaving the ribbon and knife, which enacts the internal change with visible cost (letting go of the relic). The causality is tight, with the initial discovery of the ribbon organically driving the shift in tactic and philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    The circular structure perfectly mirrors the loop concept, with the bathroom scene functioning as a clear pivot point for the realization. The closure lands a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts her role in the process, providing a legible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a strong Conceptual Repricing closure; the choice to preserve lessons rather than save the traveler's timeline carries a heavy, legible cost. The causal chain works within the established dream-logic, and the ending recontextualizes the mission effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative operates on dream logic where "desire" dictates physics, which weakens the causal chain of the climax. The transition from the ship to the garden relies on convenient magical manifestation (weaving threads from air) rather than a hard-won narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the narrative arc is complete, the resolution offers "symmetric satisfaction"—a perfect fix where war turns to peace with no residual price or complication. The "fix-it" structure lacks a feeling of risk, making the closure feel mechanical rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from the acoustic diagnosis to the resolution, and the closure lands effectively with a tangible change in the world. However, the progression is strictly linear, lacking a significant reversal or a moment where the plan fails, which reduces narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative relies on the convenient alignment of the "Thornwheel" occurring immediately after the prism's discovery, reducing urgency. While the closure is legible, the "destiny" framing bypasses causal struggle, offering a key-in-lock resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative lens, building pressure through the storm to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara merges with the archive. The closure is distinct and transformative, effectively re-pricing her role from recorder to recorded, though the causal link relies heavily on lyrical logic rather than hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc with strong orientation and a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (the siege mentality dissolving). The resolution relies on a somewhat convenient interaction between the tool and the mosaic, but the logic holds within the established story rules.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands effectively as Charged Poise through the physical transfer of the cicada, creating a legible reconfiguration of the relationship despite the soft pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clean ascent-descent structure with a functional ticking clock (gravity inversion) that enforces pacing. Closure is achieved through a "Resonant Reconfiguration" (returning with the silence), though the resolution feels slightly safe, lacking a twist or deeper unexpected cost beyond the premise's inherent risk.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of competence with no deviation or obstacle; the resolution (healing) arrives via "magical" adjustment without a visible price or risk of failure. Closure functions as a soft reset of the passenger's grief rather than an earned reconfiguration with felt cost. The orientation is clear, but the lack of causality driven by resistance flattens the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear quest chain with smooth transitions but lacks causal friction; success is granted through methodical action rather than struggle. Closure relies on an "explain-everything" summary ("She understood now why...") that resolves the mystery intellectually without an emotional or visceral price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scene follows a clear causal logic (arrival, transmission, departure), but the progression is ritualistic and lacks tension. The closure lands a "Resonant Reconfiguration," but the ease with which the protagonist abandons his stasis makes the narrative arc feel flat and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a dream-logic coherence (Situational lens) that holds together, but the progression relies on external prompts (the texts) to drive the protagonist's actions. The time-loop closure provides a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the causal link between "volunteering" and the alchemical transformation feels unearned by the preceding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magic bullet" resolution where a single procedural action (turning a crank) solves a generational conflict without complication, reversal, or sacrifice. The causality between writing down coordinates and the immediate fall of a dynasty ("by dawn... ash") is asserted rather than demonstrated, lacking a visible mechanism of change or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual execution with inevitable success, lacking causal surprises or obstacles that force adaptation. While the closure (dissolution into possibility) is legible, the lack of narrative friction makes the trajectory feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the archive from a place of trauma to one of hidden mercy—is resonant and earned. However, the inciting logic relies on questionable physics: a distinct "clearing" in dust from a visitor who hasn't been there in "years" would likely have been covered by new dust, straining plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the mechanism of the "puddle map" strains causality; without established AR tech, light transforming reflections into specific coordinates reads as magical convenience in a sci-fi setting. Closure is a clean Decisive Change, though the "escape" feels somewhat frictionless given the stated proximity of the searchlights.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative arc is solid, following a clear Causal/Situational line from threat manifestation to resolution. Closure is an effective Earned Stasis, with the prophecy dissolved and the vigil established. A minor timeline ambiguity exists regarding the "twenty years" absence versus the title "morning fog saxophonist," which implies a routine role, but it doesn't break the logic.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    The closure is strong, offering a decisive transformation with clear cost. However, the plot relies on a significant causality break: Elias intuitively "understands" the monuments are receivers without prior setup or deduction, a convenience that resolves the central puzzle too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean and functional, moving from established competence to a challenge that breaks that competence, forcing a new approach. The closure acts as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the singing chronometer vindicates the journey and solidifies the internal change. The pacing is effective, though the transition from the greenhouse to the cavern feels slightly rushed in terms of spatial orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a legible Decisive Change (Kael’s return) and a clear Cause/Effect chain. The closure lands well, though the transition from the ritual to success is smooth enough that the "cost" feels more philosophical (acceptance of scars) than a tangible price paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong situational drive with a clear ritual structure; causality is linear and logical within the fable's rules. Closure is solid, with the crocodile tooth undergoing a Resonant Reconfiguration from tool to vessel, grounded in the cost of blood and pain.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative arc, successfully navigating a surreal logic to a legible Conceptual Repricing ending. However, the progression is linear and lacks significant causal turns; the stakes remain theoretical until the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a linear procedural structure (observe, diagnose, cure) without significant complications or causal turns. While the closure (Mara's restoration to memory) is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, the path there is frictionless; the "eternal instant" suspends external pressure, removing urgency. The causality is functional but lacks the tightening of options required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clean, linear path that efficiently links the diagnosis to the resolution. However, the climax relies on a convenient magical fix ("crack sealed itself") rather than a costly trade-off, making the closure feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal chain from the frost reading to the final rupture, creating a cohesive single-scene arc. Orientation is established quickly, and the "Decisive Change" closure lands effectively with the breaking of the static world. The procedural nature of the magic system provides a solid structural backbone, though the outcome feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    The closure (staying behind to tend the past) is strong and carries visible cost. However, the climax—where a scientific dispute is resolved not by evidence but by the "weight of Kaelen's sorrow"—is a causality break that dissolves the established obstacle (Voss) too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear ritual enactment where the solution (sing, wind, use chip) works exactly as planned without a causal twist or adaptation. While the closure is decisive, the lack of a "dark night of the soul" or a complication that forces a new tactic limits the structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is clean and linear, following an Accumulative lens where sensory discovery drives the momentum. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where she accepts witness over explanation—is well-earned, though the reliance on a sudden supernatural ability to solve the navigation problem slightly softens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.3)
    The plot relies on a "magic" object to bridge the gap between problem (storm/stagnation) and resolution, delivering complex knowledge ("navigational mathematics") via inexplicable intuition. While the closure (a conceptual shift in her art) is legible, it lacks earned causality because the slide solves the intellectual difficulty for her. The GPS failure sets a scene but does not drive a specific navigational choice.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative relies on summary and montage ("Winter arrived early," "returned daily") rather than a dramatized scene with immediate pressure. The resolution pivots on a secondary character explaining the central mystery, rendering the protagonist somewhat passive in the story's turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and the conceptual closure (archiving as confrontation) lands clearly, but the climax relies heavily on summary ("Elias worked feverishly," "parley began") rather than moment-to-moment dramatization. The causality of the "semaphore" unlocking the "trap" operates on symbolic logic that feels convenient rather than mechanically earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is complete with a decisive change, but the climax relies on a contradiction: the story argues for "effort over magic," yet the town and its people are instantaneously manifested by shattering a bottle, which reads as magical. The transition from "memory" to "actual living fishermen" is a causal leap that muddies the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a coherent "Accumulative/Textural" arc, moving smoothly from discovery to comprehension and finally to a transformative closure. The "falling upward" imagery creates a Resonant Reconfiguration that pays off the setup of the orchard's isolation, though the logic linking the memory to the immersion is driven more by dream-logic than strict causality. The ending effectively integrates the character into the setting, offering a clear before-and-after state with the physical cost of his humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural arc, moving from the inciting incident (egg hatching) to a "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure where the atrium is restored. While the ritual logic is sound, the "depression she had never noticed before" relies on convenience, and the progression is linear without unexpected complications.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a Decisive Change (switching the siren), meeting the closure requirement. However, the tension is low; the "zero hour" arrives and the solution works instantly without complication or palpable risk. The causal chain is logical but lacks the tightening pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows an accumulative structure but lacks a sharp, causal turning point; the progression from observation to realization feels inevitable and smooth. While the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is legible, the lack of prior resistance or complication makes the resolution feel structurally slight.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from the arrival of the ghosts to the acceptance of the covenant. The closure lands effectively as a Conceptual Repricing, where his silence is recontextualized as a necessary vessel. The pacing fits the contemplative stakes, though the transition mechanisms are slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a valid Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara accepts her role. However, the epiphany feels somewhat convenient, resolving the conflict through immediate philosophical acceptance rather than a dramatized struggle with the cost of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear fix-it arc with no complications or failed attempts; the solution (feather + ribbon) works instantly. Closure is achieved through a "soft reset" where the broken object functions better than new, negating any felt cost or genuine trade-off regarding the damage.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies on a summary/chronicle structure spanning six months rather than a dramatized scene with immediate pressure, creating distance and violating the short-story preference for a specific "now." The narrative tells of the remodeling process in broad strokes rather than showing the pivotal moments of resistance or breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative structure is a linear validation loop where a hypothesis is proposed and immediately confirmed without reversal. While the scene is coherent, the lack of causal complication or cost results in a static closure that feels like a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path (Accumulative lens) without a decisive turn, complication, or felt cost. While the closure is legible as a thematic completion, the lack of obstacles results in a flat trajectory that relies entirely on atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands effectively with a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's grief, satisfying the Accumulative drive lens. However, the causal link between the riddle ("Night falls...") and the specific location of the leaf is weak; the discovery feels more like the result of endurance than solving the clue.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from paralysis to observation to escape, fulfilling the prompt's requirements for closure. However, the mechanism of the exit—pinning a physical object to a paper sketch to open a hatch—leans heavily on symbolic logic rather than the established physical constraints of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, fable-like structure that resolves too easily; the inciting incident (guardian encounters) leads immediately to a solution (the chess game) without complication. Closure is achieved through a magical "fix-all" ritual rather than causal action derived from character agency or sacrifice. The logic operates on dream-metaphor rather than grounded causality, making the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative moves linearly toward closure, but the causality relies on dream logic (walking patterns spelling words) and coincidence (the penumbra passing exactly when the reading finishes). While the closure image is resonant, the "sunlight ex machina" resolves the atmospheric tension without protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    The arc is clear and the closure—shifting from substitution to seeding—creates a legible decisive change. However, the resolution relies heavily on the stone explicitly explaining the theme to the protagonist ("The stone spoke of... the deliberate cultivation of belonging"), which diminishes the agency of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves legible closure with the unfreezing of the village, but the resolution hinges on a convenient magical object that explains the protagonist's innocence. This acts as a soft *deus ex machina*, resolving the central mystery and emotional arc without requiring a distinct, costly choice from the protagonist at the turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causality is tightly constructed; the mechanism of the echoes is established early and pays off beautifully in the climax. The closure is a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration where the world's rules are rewritten at a high personal cost. The narrative drive holds the Causal lens perfectly from the inciting pressure to the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is solid, utilizing a clear ticking clock (the acid sea) to drive the pacing of the repair ritual. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the physical workshop is lost for the preserved narrative—lands effectively with felt cost. However, the mechanics of the "memory-tank" and how narration physically repairs marble rely heavily on "magical" convenience rather than established causal rules, softening the logic.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    The closure is excellent, offering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist releases the memory rather than capturing it. However, the inciting complication strains credibility: that a man who has "mapped these tunnels for forty years" would accidentally stumble into a massive, unknown cathedral of stone via a simple wrong turn is a convenient contrivance that weakens the causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.2)
    The resolution relies on unestablished magical realism ("jasmine oils... vaporized... transforming the captain's panic"), solving a life-or-death crisis instantly with a "magic feather" device. The lack of complication or cost during the pivotal moment drains the narrative of genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is solid, moving cleanly from the prompt (midnight calls) to execution (building) to resonance (activation). The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the station's purpose from external signal to internal solace. The pacing is controlled, though the inciting instructions function more as backstory setup than active, in-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.7)
    The story achieves closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration (creating the shield), and the cost (the painful shout) is legible. However, the resolution feels slightly convenient; the "rumored cure" works instantly and perfectly upon execution, functioning somewhat like a magic spell without enough causal friction or potential for failure to heighten the structural tension.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from discovery to investigation to reconfiguration. The causal link between "observing gaps" and the resulting vision is cemented by the magical realism of the premise, avoiding a logic break. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the physical mirroring of the gesture earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative structure is solid, utilizing the rising water to create causal pressure that forces a definitive closure choice. The ending lands a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, though the magical mechanism resolves smoothly without significant complication.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative relies on passive resolution where the "mystery unraveled itself" via a shared breath and the sight of fireflies, rather than through active deduction or sacrifice. The ending acts as a "magic fix" where Elara simply commands the sky to heal, resolving the high stakes without a proportional, on-page cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot follows a linear path to a guaranteed success, lacking a decisive turn or visible cost. Closure is achieved through symmetric satisfaction—the goal is stated and then met without deviation—which reduces the narrative to a description of a procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative loop structure perfectly mirrors the protagonist’s condition, creating a strong resonant reconfiguration at the closure where the spiral is accepted rather than fought. The transition from the cabin to the surreal flight and back is handled with a dream-logic causality that fits the "lucid dream chronicler" premise. The ending lands with a legible conceptual cost—the acceptance of the grave and the inability to fix the timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative is a static vignette with no causal progression or meaningful cost; the ending ("understanding everything") is a "Soft Reset" that claims resolution without earning it. The closure feels unearned because the stakes never escalate beyond reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the inciting stress to the resolution. The climax relies on a slightly convenient magical interaction (tears etching crystal because of "saline"), but the closure—integrating the shed stories into the tea ceremony—lands with thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure is tight, utilizing a clear causal chain (the ritual) to drive toward a resonant closure. The ending successfully employs "Conceptual Repricing" with the "seeds" metaphor, acknowledging the cost of the orchard's destruction while reframing it. The causality of the "half-true" accusation pays off perfectly in the "imperfect miracle" resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    The structure follows a linear accumulation to a conceptual merger, but the causality is low-friction dream logic where events happen because the theme requires them. The ending relies on a convenient metaphysical unification that resolves the premise without an earned, distinct turning point on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    The countdown structure perfectly executes an Accumulative/Textural lens, building steady pressure toward a legible Conceptual Repricing of the station's purpose. Closure lands effectively with the physical cost of leaving the inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.8)
    A significant causal break occurs when the alarms remain silent simply because Eli "belongs," defying the established security premise for convenience. The resolution relies on this magical logic and a sudden, unearned epiphany rather than a decisive change driven by pressure. There is no felt cost to Maya’s decision to abandon her duty.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    The accumulative structure coheres, effectively stacking memory and atmosphere to reach a Conceptual Repricing closure. The narrative drive is somewhat static, relying on reflection rather than causal actions to propel the character toward the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, effectively building a portrait of Mara’s work through a montage of calls. The transition to "Tonight" attempts to anchor the narrative in a specific scene, but the structure remains episodic, feeling more like a list of examples than a causal arc. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis that reconfirms the loop, which fits the premise, but the lack of a decisive shift in the status quo limits the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative follows a clear ritualistic structure that aligns perfectly with an Accumulative lens. Orientation is immediate, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the locket's value—lands with conceptual weight. The "physics" explanation provides a slightly expository bump, but causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative structure, but the climax acts as a soft reset rather than a decisive change with cost; the reversal relies on an external agent (the child) solving the protagonist's internal conflict instantly. The transition from transactional reciprocity to genuine connection is told through summary rather than dramatized through a difficult choice. The ending provides emotional relief but lacks the "felt cost" required for higher-band literary closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative arc is strictly linear with no meaningful complications; the protagonist moves from A to B without friction. Closure arrives as a "soft reset" where the problem is solved perfectly ("internal cartography complete") without a visible cost or trade-off, reducing the impact of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative follows a linear path where the solution (the pen) works immediately without meaningful complication or resistance from the anomaly. The closure relies on a "magic tool" mechanic that resolves the central problem too conveniently, lacking a felt cost beyond the tool's destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulation-based structure that lacks a distinct turning point or obstacle; Elias sets out to play, plays, and succeeds without complication. The closure acts as a symmetric satisfaction where the world simply agrees with the protagonist's effort, lacking a felt cost or a moment where failure was a genuine possibility. The drive lens is weak because the "accumulation" meets no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative structure relies on a summary montage of art installations across multiple cities rather than a grounded scene with causal momentum. This list-like progression ("First, she sketched... The second creation... In the Portland...") dissolves tension and distances the reader from the immediate stakes of the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative follows a clean, causal arc driven by the "hush" constraint, leading to a climax that lands with genuine cost. The closure is a strong example of Earned Stasis: the protagonist fails to alter reality permanently but successfully reenacts his ritual, accepting the "cold" comfort of the entanglement.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.7)
    The story functions as a polished vignette of competence rather than a narrative with a decisive turn or felt cost. While the closure (the successful handoff and affirmation of the "whisper" method) is legible, the conflict is resolved too easily by established routines, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or a price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative is a linear description of a ritual without causal turns or structural tension. While the sequence is legible, it lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the ending returns to stasis without an earned cost. The result is a vignette that observes rather than dramatizes a shift in value or state.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative relies heavily on summary and montage ("For three weeks...") rather than a continuous scene, diluting immediate causal pressure. While the final tableau functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration, the lack of resistance makes the outcome feel inevitable and the cost low.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative path that fulfills the opening premise without causal complications or surprise. While the closure is legible, it arrives as a scheduled event (the tide) rather than a result of the protagonist overcoming obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The structure holds well under a Situational lens; the traveler's arrival provides clear pressure for Elias's ritual. Closure lands with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (exhaling without measure) that pays off the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the narrative arc is legible, the causal logic wobbles significantly when the external obstacle (the ban) is revealed to be internal without prior setup, making the seven-year wait illogical. The climax relies on "magic words" acting immediately upon the environment with minimal complication, reducing the sense of earned narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative drive is coherent and the closure is distinct, but the central negotiation lacks friction; Marin accepts the trade immediately, resolving the plot's central obstacle without testing the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, but the resolution relies on a convenient explanation where the system explicitly approves her rule-breaking as part of the design. This retrospective permission dissolves the tension of the climax, making the closure feel engineered rather than earned through consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a coherent "healing ritual" structure with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and the projection scene offers a pleasant visual closure. However, the arc is linear and lacks a significant causal turn or cost; the resolution is a soft affirmation of the protagonist's established role rather than a transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative structure is essentially a tableau, serving as a vessel for philosophical exposition rather than a causal sequence of events. While the closure lands as a clear "Conceptual Repricing" (moving from recovery to forward proportion), the lack of resistance or dramatic complication makes the resolution feel inevitable and low-stakes. The inciting incident leads immediately to a monologue, bypassing potential conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a legible inciting incident and resolution. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (perfection as poison), though the obstacle of the "automata" is bypassed too easily to generate high Causal tension. The mechanism of the climax—dancing to purify files—works within the established logic but feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line, but the resolution relies on a convenient, low-cost technical fix (editing the footage) that feels magical rather than earned. The closure is tidy and explicitly explained, lacking a visceral or "felt" cost to the protagonist beyond working through the night.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative structure is coherent, functioning as a coda to the inciting event (the arrest) rather than a scene with active resistance. While the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of her stance—is legible, the "aftermath" mode lacks present-tense causal pressure, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than forged by the scene's specific frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative logic, moving from the tower to the cavern with increasing density, and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) effectively recontextualizes his grief. However, the plot relies on convenient surrealism—specifically the coffee rings spelling out coordinates—to bridge the gap between the room and the tunnel. This mechanical contrivance weakens the causal chain, even within a magical realist frame.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative is a linear procedural: entry, touch, vision, exit. While the Conceptual Repricing (love stored in the light/medium rather than matter) provides a form of closure, it lacks narrative resistance or causality; the "film strip snapped taut" is a solitary beat of physical pushback in a story that otherwise yields immediately to the protagonist's will.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative arc is complete and legible, but the resolution relies on a convenient epiphany ("understood that the final step required stillness") rather than earned causal logic. There is no visible cost to the success; the protagonist performs a ritual and receives the reward without setback or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is legible and creates a clear Decisive Change as Kael transitions from freight guard to sentinel. The structure is linear and low-friction, operating as a "lock-and-key" sequence where the protagonist arrives, applies the solution (the clock/charm), and succeeds without a reversal or causal complication.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative establishes a compelling navigation mechanic, but the climax suffers from a continuity gap and weak resolution with the antagonist. Kael offers the gear to the stranger, but then immediately leaves to the nexus where he uses the same gear to fix the tree; it is unclear if the stranger accepted the gear, was defeated, or merely ignored. The conflict with the "pruner" is bypassed rather than resolved, leaving a causal hole in the story's center.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative relies on a magical "soft reset" to resolve the conflict; the star stamp on the sternum magically settles the fear ("pulsed once... settled into steady warmth") rather than Mara earning that stability. The ferry guides remove the obstacle of the search, reducing the causal density of the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causality is strong; the discovery of the bolt logically provokes the confrontation with the elders, which in turn drives the investigation of the staircase. Closure lands as a distinct Conceptual Repricing: the protagonist accepts the external silence while internally recontextualizing it as patience rather than imprisonment. The "loose stone" discovery in the second beat feels slightly fortuitous but is anchored by the earlier bolt.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal arc is sturdy and the closure—the dissolution of the library and the unmasking—lands with a clear sense of finality. While the narrative lacks a significant reversal or complication to generate tension, the structural progression from the waiting to the execution of the trap is mechanically sound.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive arc of Conceptual Repricing, moving from data analysis to a recontextualization of loss. The closure—releasing the atlas page—is a legible decisive action that validates the internal epiphany. The causality is internal but logical, though the "delayed revelation" feels slightly convenient in its timing.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear path of intent-to-execution without a significant reversal or complication. While the orientation is clear, the closure arrives without a felt cost or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt, reading more as a procedural ritual than a dramatic plot.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies on a significant causal convenience: finding an abandoned kite that happens to contain the exact thermal sequence needed, written by plants. This chain of coincidences, combined with the telepathy providing the solution immediately, weakens the sense of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The structure is solid, effectively using an accumulative lens to navigate the trauma trigger. The closure (looking at the photo, planning the planting) offers a genuine Resonant Reconfiguration with the "weight" of memory accepted as an anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.2)
    The resolution relies on a *deus ex machina*: the "threads" appear conveniently to solve the crushing walls, and Mara intuitively knows how to manipulate them without prior setup. This breaks causality, as the protagonist acquires a new, reality-altering power exactly when the plot requires it.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a linear Situational logic that successfully reaches closure, but the trajectory is flat, lacking a "turn" or obstacle to test the protagonist's intent. The climax relies on an expository block ("Time slows in crisis because...") to resolve the central mystery, which deflates narrative tension. The closure is legible as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the path there feels frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (whistleblower awaiting arrest) is a valid Decisive Change with clear cost. However, the sudden availability of "dormant networks" and the swift transition from hesitation to action undercut the earned difficulty of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.1)
    The piece functions as a static vignette rather than a narrative with causal drive; while the "Earned Stasis" closure is valid, the lack of an inciting incident that forces a deviation from routine creates a flat trajectory. The tower falling is ambient background rather than a pressure point that constrains options or forces a new tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear linear quest structure (enter, harvest, exit) with a distinct climax and legible closure. The conceptual repricing at the end—godhood solidified into a mortal object—works well, though the timing of the "patterns breaking" feels slightly convenient rather than causally driven by the protagonist's prior actions.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is tight, moving cleanly from the allegation to the mathematical verification and the final decision. The use of "proof by contradiction" as a plot device provides a satisfying, logical pivot point, and the closure (Decisive Change) is unambiguous and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    The loop structure is tightly executed, and the closure (a Decisive Change rewriting history) is impactful. While the "grandfather paradox" of erasing her own future is unaddressed, the narrative logic holds within the scene's emotional frame.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative follows a linear diagnosis-cure structure but lacks causal friction; the solution (drawing an ear) operates on dream logic without established rules or mechanical resistance. The "unlearning" provides vague atmospheric stakes but does not constrain the protagonist's options. Closure is achieved through a "magic wand" moment where the environment simply complies, lacking a felt cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure ("Cradle") effectively reconfigures the setting's meaning, fulfilling the resonant reconfiguration requirement cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is complete with legible closure (Mara chooses life), but the resolution relies on a low-cost magical intervention that solves the central problem instantly. The causality is functional, yet the lack of complications or setbacks makes the plot progression feel linear and predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative structure, but the central causal mechanism (a geode resonating with neurotransmitters) strains credibility within the sci-fi frame, reading as magical convenience. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the "cost" is abstract and the resolution feels slightly too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation structure where the protagonist succeeds without setbacks; the discovery of the fossil feels convenient. Closure is achieved through task completion (finishing the map) rather than a decisive change or paid cost, limiting the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on a "magic feather" resolution where the jar and buttons effortlessly solve the central problem. The closure dissolves the threat (cliffs collapsing) into "raw possibility" without forcing a difficult trade-off or sacrifice, resulting in low causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.5)
    The scene has a clear beginning, middle, and end, but the logic of the "fix"—rebuilding a spy network via transient codes in snow—strains credibility. Closure is present (Resonant Reconfiguration) but feels disconnected from the low resistance encountered in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story functions as a coherent vignette with clear orientation, but the linear structure (wait, sense, act) lacks a decisive turning point with visible cost. The narrative drive is purely environmental, resolving without a complication or trade-off that would deepen the causality beyond a simple sequence of events.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is functional but linear: arrival, observation, realization, departure. The climax relies on the lantern glass acting as a magical reveal device rather than an earned insight derived from action or struggle. While the closure (Conceptual Repricing) is legible, the "sun patterns" mechanism feels convenient, lacking established rules that would make the navigation satisfyingly causal.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is legible, but the resolution relies on implausible mechanics: a measuring tool (bitting gauge) functioning as a gear component and reflected moonlight serving as a functional lighthouse beam. These contrivances weaken the causal chain despite the clear inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a clear beginning, middle, and end that adheres to a Situational drive lens. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands effectively, though the causal link between the ritual and the specific realization about the atmosphere feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative structure relies heavily on summary and montage ("seven days," "three seasons") rather than dramatized scenes, violating the scope default for short fiction. The ending creates a "happy ever after" stasis without a distinct closure event that carries felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causality is strong, with a clear ticking clock (17 minutes) and a logical progression of beats. The setup of the "tricksters" and the specific counter-measure pays off cleanly at the climax. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) is distinct—the immediate threat ends, but the community remains "fractured," earning the cost of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is excellent, with a clear plan (using the organ vigil) executed under pressure. Orientation is immediate and solid. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change with the retrieval of the key and the stabilization of the walls, earned by the specific mechanical intervention established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.2)
    The resolution creates a severe causality break: identifying a "microscopic weave" matching a specific jacket lining via a charcoal sketch in a misty quarry is physically impossible. This "magic art" solution shatters the procedural logic and relies on an unearned epiphany to force closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and the closure (vindication) is causally linked to the discovery, fitting a Causal lens. However, the pacing is rushed during the decoding phase ("dizzying clarity"), and the "coded stanzas" solution feels convenient, reducing the investigative weight. The climax relies on immediate acceptance by the authority figure, which softens the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative arc is legible and the surreal logic holds together under a textural/lyric lens. However, the progression relies heavily on convenient magical realism—the environment conspiring to show the path via "scaffold wrap flutters"—which lowers the sense of earned narrative drive. Closure is distinct and resonant, though it leans on the dissolving prop to signify change.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative structure is solid, effectively using the accumulation of bills to build toward the decision to leave (Decisive Change). The closure lands with the felt cost of abandoning his sanctuary, though the heavy reliance on backstory reflection occasionally stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central realization ("Each pulse of light corresponded to a syllable") is an asserted leap rather than a derived discovery, breaking causal logic. The ending relies on a thematic summary ("we survive not by escaping...") rather than dramatized closure, explaining the resolution instead of letting the reader experience the cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a solid causal chain with a clear objective and a legible tactical shift (force to stillness) that resolves the central problem. The closure is distinct (lake calmed, truth freed), though the post-climax explanation of the illusionist's mechanics feels like a retroactive information dump rather than a dramatic realization inherent to the action.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Causal line from the arrival of the clipping to the release of the roots. Closure is legible as a "Charged Poise" entering the new timeline. However, the resolution—simply pressing hands together—feels mechanically convenient and lacks a complex turning point or unforeseen complication.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a strong inciting incident (the returning card) and a definitive closure (the binding). The logic of the trade is established and subverted meaningfully, with a high, legible cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is clean and tight, with a decisive closure (the choice to authenticate for mercy rather than truth) that reconfigures the protagonist's stance. The inciting incident and climax are clearly defined, and the ending lands with a "Resonant Reconfiguration" that feels earned and final.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure is excellent, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist pays a physical price (dissolution) to achieve understanding. The causal mechanism of spores arranging themselves into legible cuneiform warning sentences feels convenient and slightly breaks the sophisticated tone established by the seed's microscopic etching.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic (wait, catch, smelt, shelve) that effectively teaches the story's rules. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—permanence is redefined not as death but as concentrated wonder—anchored by the final image of the humming record. While the structure is sound, the lack of causal obstacles or uncertainty in the middle reduces the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a linear structure with a clear closure action (deleting the file), but the climax relies on a magical activation of "latent radiance" to resolve the emotional theme of isolation. The transition from technical inspection to mystical ritual operates on dream logic that feels unearned by the established causal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative structure is cohesive, and the closure offers a valid Decisive Change in stance. However, the plot pivots on a credibility-straining coincidence: finding graffiti with exact coordinates to her sister’s accident site in a random station restroom. This "Deus Ex Graffiti" resolves the central directional conflict too conveniently for a realistic literary drama, undermining the earned nature of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, procedural path where the protagonist observes, understands, and succeeds without a decisive turning point or complication. The closure—a successful documentation followed by the letter's arrival—feels inevitable rather than earned, lacking a "Decisive Change" or "Resonant Reconfiguration" that carries a visible price for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative drive is strong, moving from prophecy to decision to irrevocable action with clear causality. The closure is a definitive Resonant Reconfiguration, though the leap from seeing a hole in coffee stains to singing a specific frequency relies on a rapid expansion of the magic system at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative is a vignette describing a successful ritual rather than a story with a causal arc; it lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The ending provides stasis without the "earned" quality derived from overcoming resistance or paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a clear Decisive Change (planting the pin) and Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the immediate magical result (sapling unfurling instantly) lowers the felt cost of the sacrifice, making the closure feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean Conceptual Repricing arc where the protagonist redefines the nature of his service. Closure is definitive and lands with the "felt cost" of his own vulnerability replacing his professional armor. The "cost" is tangible in the "toxic" weight of the cloak and the exposure required to release it.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative arc is tightly constructed, using the single scene to build accumulative pressure toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The realization that regression is a methodology rather than a curse lands with genuine weight, supported by the physical action of the stone throw.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative operates successfully as a lyric shard, utilizing a clear Accumulative lens to reach a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands well, reconfiguring the meaning of stasis into travel, though the progression relies heavily on assertion. The "Orientation Test" is strained by the abstract timeframe, but the thematic coherence sustains the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves valid closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elias merges with the spire. The pacing suffers in the final third, shifting abruptly from immediate scene to summarized epilogue ("In the years that followed"), which dilutes the visceral cost of his sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative traces a clear, linear path to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias recontextualizes his life's work. The physics of the "air pocket" require significant suspension of disbelief, but the internal logic holds under a fable lens; the implied cost—a willingness to stay/drown—provides necessary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story executes its "reverse causality" logic with confidence, maintaining internal consistency within the surreal ruleset. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change (the Big Bang), satisfyingly earned through the established mechanics of the coins and static. The narrative arc is linear but compelling, successfully translating abstract physics into a legible procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands effectively as a Conceptual Repricing (scythe as pen), recontextualizing the protagonist’s existence. The narrative relies heavily on the found recordings to explain the plot mechanics ("some fears could only be defeated..."), which reduces the sense of discovery and earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent Causal/Process lens, effectively treating magic as an engineering problem with clear steps. The closure is excellent, utilizing Earned Stasis to reframe the solution not as a quick fix, but as an endless, costly vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear arc with a resonant closure that reconfigures the protagonist's purpose. However, the central plot device—unprotected glossy photographs surviving thirty years of submersion intact—creates a severe physics logic break that undermines the realistic grounding of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, ritualistic progression with no resistance; the protagonist moves from intent to success without complication or risk. The closure fails the "felt cost" requirement, as the text explicitly frames the outcome as "not loss but integration," resulting in a "perfect" ending that lacks narrative weight or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and linear, with clear orientation and causality. However, the resolution relies on a calculation that works perfectly ("mathematics made flesh"), resulting in a neat ending that lacks the required "felt or conceptual cost" for a higher band; the stakes are resolved without lasting price.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (integration and stabilization) lands with a clear conceptual shift. However, the turning point relies on an epiphany ("Maya realized") rather than a pressure-forced tactic, weakening the causal chain. The inciting incident and resolution are legible, but the middle is largely expository debate.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative fails the short story scope, operating as a linear synopsis of several months rather than a focused scene or mosaic; the lack of a distinct closure unit and the reliance on "and then" sequencing eliminates narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent, linear arc with a distinct closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration) where the protagonist accepts dissolution to heal his family. The surreal logic holds together well within the "leaf blower" premise. However, the progression feels somewhat inevitable—a ritual performed without significant oscillation or unexpected obstacles beyond the initial state of grief.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative follows a clear arc from inciting incident (finding the pendant) to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure (choosing the garden). The drive lens is accumulative/internal, successfully shifting the protagonist's state. The "song was wrong" beat provides necessary friction to justify the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.2)
    A severe causality break undermines the central action: Marcus turns the unique crozier to "ash" in the first attempt, yet somehow has the object intact for a second attempt and a final success. This impossible reset without explanation breaks the narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the causal chain is coherent, the ending offers "symmetric satisfaction" where the theory is perfectly proven without a legible cost (Decisive Change or Conceptual Repricing). The "impossible" task proceeds linearly without a dramatized moment of doubt or failure that threatens the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution path with no meaningful complications; the "magic radio" fix is convenient and lacks earned causality. The resolution feels unearned because the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or failures before succeeding, relying on technobabble (Fibonacci spirals) to bypass narrative friction.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative drive lens holds effectively, building pressure through the architectural weaving to a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure is strong, with the protagonist's dissolution acting as a legible cost that effectively reconfigures the story’s reality.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent causal arc from the problem of starvation to the solution of navigation and the decision to launch. The resolution feels somewhat frictionless—the geometry aligns on the first described attempt—which limits the sense of earned difficulty or cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative pivots effectively from a ghost story to a rescue mission, delivering a strong closure where the photo acts as a bridge. However, the logistical plausibility of a man surviving undetected for forty years in a public museum basement strains the causal logic, requiring a heavy suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative structure is robust, utilizing the ninety-minute tidal window to create effective situational pressure that leads to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure is legible and earned, though the transition from physical danger to metaphysical safety feels slightly frictionless in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story relies on a fragile dream logic where frozen ink patterns and refracted moonlight can mechanically debug digital code. While this functions metaphorically, the causal link between the physical action and the digital result is tenuous, straining suspension of disbelief even for a slipstream piece. Closure is achieved, but the mechanism is more symbolic than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent under a hybrid causal-textural lens, and the closure offers a strong Resonant Reconfiguration of the curse into song. However, the pivotal turn—using bird flight patterns to translate texture into sound—relies heavily on dream logic that feels slightly convenient, resolving the central lock without a clearly dramatized struggle against the mechanism itself.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is solid, moving from static waiting to a decisive transformation triggered by the phone call. However, the final paragraph drifts into an epilogue ("In the world above, they would speak...") that explains the aftermath rather than letting the closure beat land with immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear causal arc with strong on-page closure (Conceptual Repricing) where the antagonist is transformed rather than just destroyed. However, the resolution is swift and lacks a "try-fail" cycle, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned through narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is clear and functional, moving from setup to a decisive action (using the bottle) and a validated result (delivery). The closure is legible as Earned Stasis, though the reliance on a gadget introduced immediately before use slightly weakens the causal weight of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path: search, find, epiphany. The causal link between the "wrong turn" and the discovery relies on dream logic rather than character action, and the closure—while resonant—lacks a visible or felt cost, reading more as a gift than an earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative arc is strictly linear with low tension; the hyperbolic geometry "obeys" Elena instantly, dissolving obstacles rather than creating them. While closure is achieved, the absence of a "felt cost" or significant trade-off makes the resolution feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path where the declared "dangerous alchemy" executes without complication or on-page cost. Closure provides a clean success that resolves the want (filling the hollow space) but lacks the requisite "visible or felt cost" or trade-off to give the victory narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear fable logic where the obstacle dissolves via a ritual action (spinning) rather than a causal turning point with cost. The resolution feels soft; the "singularity of dread" yields to the protagonist's intuition without a tangible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain where the protagonist's preparation meets a specific temporal window. The solution (compass + alignment) is logically satisfying within the established folk-horror rules. Closure is decisive and resonant, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once the decision is made, lacking a final complication to test the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure is distinct and tracks causally from the opening, but the middle section relies on a three-week summary montage that dissipates the scene's immediate tension. This compression skips the struggle required to earn the resolution, reducing the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is coherent and causal, moving from threat to resolution through a defined ritual. However, the closure is a standard "success" outcome with low cost ("exhausted but content"), lacking the decisive trade-off or sacrifice needed to elevate the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an impeccable Accumulative drive lens, building pressure through the rhythmic unweaving of knots and the intensifying starlight. The closure is a quintessential Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's state is fundamentally altered to resolve the tension. The causality of the transfer—unweaving the net to weave the silence into herself—is logic-tight and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative relies on significant convenience; locating specific 1920s/50s film reels in a "rain-scoured" vault (where moisture would destroy cellulose) strains credibility. Additionally, a solo excavation of a "sealed" lintel under "centuries of turf" with "minimal equipment" in a single morning ignores physical reality. Closure lands well conceptually, but the procedural path is too frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from search to discovery to release, with a legible closure unit (renunciation of the object). The "physics of grief" logic holds within the story's magical realist frame, and the causality of the solution—though symbolic—is executed with internal consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear "problem-solution" arc with soft causality; the climax relies on a magical interaction between the plate and the obelisk that feels convenient rather than earned. Closure is tidy and lacks a felt cost or meaningful reconfiguration of the protagonist's status—she simply completes the task and moves on.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    The elevator ascent creates a strong rhythmic structure that paces the exposition and deepening effectively. While the puzzle resolution (sunlight refracting perfectly to unlock the cipher) relies on convenient environmental coincidence, Elara’s active manipulation of the goggles earns the moment, and the closure lands a solid Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative summarizes the physical climax (the rescue) rather than dramatizing it, relying on external coincidence to resolve the life-or-death stakes. While the internal realization counts as Conceptual Repricing, it feels unearned because the protagonist simply drifts until the plot saves her.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is clear, and the closure—a conceptual repricing where the destroyed library is preserved internally—lands effectively with felt cost. The logic of the coin encoding pigment ratios is a slightly convenient contrivance, but the deadline pressure holds the structure together well.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on the heavy coincidence of the starlings mirroring the board at the exact moment Elara examines it, functioning as magical assistance rather than earned causality. The closure is a simple additive victory (finding the map) with no felt or conceptual cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path where convenience (finding prophecy scraps in a corner) drives progression rather than causality. Closure is achieved through "symmetric satisfaction"—the problem is simply fixed—without a felt cost or reconfiguration of the status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain, but the resolution relies on convenient supernatural instructions that bypass the need for human ingenuity or sacrifice. The leap from reading star charts to manually building a planetary shield is logically tenuous, lowering the sense of earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the Accumulative lens holds, building linearly to a resonant closure that recontextualizes the end of the world. However, the progression lacks causal complications or obstacles; the outcome is never in doubt, limiting the sense of earned narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain is solid, linking the blueprint discovery to the trap execution and final rescue. The vibration plate, introduced as a prepared defense, feels slightly convenient ("installed last spring") but functions within the established logic to enable the "touchless" method. Closure is resonant, with an Earned Stasis that acknowledges the cost of her continued vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear path to a realization, but the closure relies on a "soft reset" where an epiphany dissolves the central conflict without a visible price paid on the page. The causality is symbolic rather than active; the protagonist observes the river and simply decides the problem is solved.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative arc is precise, moving from a static situation (the lull) to a decisive action (incising the air) and a resonant closure (stepping through). The logic of the magic system—finding origins by measuring absence—is internally consistent and structurally sound. The ending qualifies as a strong Decisive Change with the clear cost of abandoning her trade and physical form.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is legible and the "Resonant Reconfiguration" closure (cleaning the world's remorse) lands clearly. However, the framing of the "unspoken dream" creates a slight orientation haze regarding the reality of the stakes—it reads more like a procedural of magic realism than a story with urgent causality.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative reads as a high-level summary or synopsis rather than a dramatized scene, moving linearly from plan to perfect execution without causality-driven turns. The lack of obstacles results in a "and then" progression where success is inevitable, lacking the required closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent internal logic, but the climax relies on a "magic key" resolution (aligning the mirror to exactly thirty-three degrees) that feels convenient rather than earned. The stated "profound transformation" is asserted through summary rather than dramatized through causal steps with visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot follows a linear trajectory of arrival, execution, and departure without a decisive turning point or reversal. The closure represents a successful retrieval but lacks the "felt cost" or sacrifice required for higher bands, reading more as a procedural vignette than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and linear, but the resolution arrives without a significant trade-off or complicating cost. The ending provides symmetric satisfaction—she seeks sound and achieves it—missing the "felt cost" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    The closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, with the breaking stone and the restarted game signaling a shift in worldview. The solution to the puzzle (the curved knight move) is logically consistent with the established fantasy physics, though the connection between the "curved" path and "difficult beauty" relies slightly on abstract assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a clear linear structure, but the causality is soft; the diary opens because Elio finds the right frequency, a process that lacks significant obstacles or failure states. The closure works conceptually but lacks a tangible price paid by the protagonist beyond the stated "surrender" of frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative is a linear procedural with minimal friction; the environment and materials cooperate perfectly, removing causal pressure. Closure is a soft "mission accomplished" beat without a decisive change or paid cost on the page, feeling more like a checklist completion than a narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.2)
    The resolution relies on a "magic feather" device where touching the stone instantly grants total knowledge and miraculously repairs the ship's hull. This Deus Ex Machina removes all return-journey tension and fails the closure requirement for a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal drive links the survey to the reconstruction of the crash; the ending provides a valid Conceptual Repricing where the tragedy is reconfigured into "geometric certainty." The logic of the investigation holds firmly under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative arc is linear and lacks causal friction; the resolution arrives via a "magic button" event where ringing bells instantly solves a global societal problem. The ending is a "Soft Reset" that dissolves the conflict without requiring a difficult trade-off or tactic change from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative follows a linear "repair" arc where the protagonist fixes the problem without facing active resistance or paying a concrete cost in the moment. The resolution feels like a soft reset, lacking the friction or trade-off required for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative structure is tight and effective, moving logically from the inciting arrival to a decisive, high-cost closure. The causality holds firm within the story's surreal logic; the disorientation tactic leads directly to the theft and the final transposition. The ending delivers a clear Decisive Change (theorem gained, cartographer lost) and a Conceptual Repricing of the victim into a font, providing excellent structural satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative follows a clear, cohesive line from inciting incident to a resonant closure. The ending successfully reconfigures the "routine" into "legend," creating a valid Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the lack of significant obstacles or a tangible "felt cost" (beyond the abstract loss of efficiency) keeps the structure in the competent rather than exceptional range.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path (arrive, perform, succeed) with no decisive turn or deviation. Closure is achieved through the completion of a task rather than a change in stance or a paid cost, reading more like a vignette than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure functions well to build pressure, and the closure lands with a clear Decisive Change and paid cost (transparency). However, the causality relies heavily on asserted dream logic—the link between puzzle edges and time travel is poetic rather than causal, creating a "because I said so" progression.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a linear "process" plot (descent, task, success) under a Causal lens, but the central premise of a "barter" is undercut because Elara pays no personal price; she uses found silk and her existing skills. The closure is a "fix-it" resolution where the "cost" ("willingness to remake oneself") is abstract and asserted rather than felt. Causality is intact, but the lack of a true trade-off limits the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from discovery to choice, but the resolution dissolves into long-term summary ("work took years") that distances the reader from the immediate cost. The origin of the shard is convenient ("without origin"), weakening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative structure is excellent, using the lighthouse task to frame a profound internal shift. Closure is achieved through a decisive, resonant action (sealing the jar) that reconfigures the relationship dynamics from seeking clarity to preserving mystery, landing with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative is a linear sequence of tasks (polish, sing, steer) without causal complication or meaningful obstacles. While closure is achieved through the beam's release, the lack of resistance or a decisive change with visible cost renders the plot a static vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative arc is coherent with a valid Conceptual Repricing closure where the protagonist shifts from invader to translator. The pacing is deliberate, though the inciting pressure is entirely internal, making the turn dependent on the sun's movement rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative suffers a significant causal break at the pivot: the sound of a dropping pin triggering the realization that "sorrow is fertilizer" is a non-sequitur without logical grounding. Closure is achieved, but it reads as "symmetric satisfaction"—everything resolves neatly (hands heal, trees hum) without a visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear accumulation of power without meaningful setbacks or complications. The arrival of the community at the climax functions as a convenient accelerator rather than a response to failure or a complication that demands a new tactic. The ending is a "Resonant Reconfiguration" (restoration of dawn), but the lack of resistance makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.1)
    The plot hinges on a massive coincidence—the stranger arriving with the exact same "mistake" invitation pattern at the exact moment Elias is reflecting on his own. The closure (hiding while leaving the door open) is a "win-win" solution that exacts no real cost from the protagonist, as he maintains his preferred isolation while still feeling virtuous. The lack of a difficult trade-off flattens the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story relies heavily on iterative summary for the first two-thirds, compressing three months of action into exposition rather than dramatized scenes. The "uncloaking" climax arrives via seasonal shift ("frost first silvered") rather than causal pressure or character urgency. The heavy backstory/summary load (approx. 65% of text) flattens the narrative arc, leaving the final scene to carry too much weight with too little setup.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story executes a flawless Conceptual Repricing (CR) at closure. The shift from preserving data to the "solemn act of witness" reconfigures the loss into a form of love, satisfying the narrative drive with a profound realization. The acceleration of the Fading provides coherent pressure that forces this stance crystallization without relying on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.3)
    The causal chain is functional, with the phonograph fob serving as a solid pivot for the climax. However, the narrative summarizes the struggle ("navigates through false starts") rather than dramatizing the tactical escalation, reducing tension. The inciting incident and closure are legible, but the middle section lacks distinct, pressure-filled beats.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a coherent situational arc (waiting for the vote), and the closure provides a clear Resonant Reconfiguration of Elara's purpose. However, the resolution relies entirely on the off-screen decision of the forests and the expository validation of the Thunder-bearer, resulting in a low-cost ending where the protagonist is a passenger to destiny. The "election" mechanism provides tension but resolves without Elara's direct influence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.0)
    The central obstacle is resolved by a Deus Ex Machina: the specific light spectrum revealing the watermark at the exact moment Elara looks. While the closure (entering the tunnel) is decisive, the causal chain leading to it relies on environmental coincidence rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative follows a linear video-game logic where items found in backstory (zinc plates) conveniently function as keys for unrelated locks (the map, the vault door). The causal chain relies on these convenient fits rather than character ingenuity or pressure. Closure is achieved, but the progression feels like a checklist of quest stages rather than a driven narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear linear path to a successful accumulation of effects, but the closure feels like "symmetric satisfaction" where the goal is achieved exactly as planned without a distinct cost. The outcome is inevitable once the brake is released, lacking a decisive turning point that alters the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative arc is complete with a clear inciting incident and a decisive closing action (the burn and burial). However, the causal logic linking magnetic flux to biological mutations and then to a fire solution operates on dream logic rather than established world physics, weakening the sense of inevitable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative relies on significant convenience and "fable logic" that breaks causality. Mr. Alvarez possessing the key to a box that allegedly "refused all keys" creates a major plot hole; if he had the key for decades, his delay is unexplained by the text. The connection between the locket and the mailbox is asserted ("connected immediately") rather than earned through investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a coherent Accumulative lens, moving linearly from entry to entry without distinct causal complications. While the closure (opening the vault) lands, it feels like a procedural inevitability rather than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative achieves closure through a Resonant Reconfiguration (finding the preserved memory), and the fabulist logic is consistent. However, the reliance on "intuition" and "rules older than physics" to bypass investigative obstacles weakens the causal density of the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative follows a linear problem-solution structure (mapping silence to defeat prophecy) with a clear "Earned Stasis" closure where the threat is neutralized. However, the progression is somewhat mechanical, lacking a sharp reversal or moment of doubt where the outcome is genuinely at risk. The orientation is excellent, anchoring the reader immediately in the scene and the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative spans months via montage ("ritual began the following Tuesday," "fourth meteor shower"), violating the immediate scope required for effective short fiction. This summary mode dissolves tension and distances the reader from the pivotal causal moments of her learning process.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    The single-scene structure is solid, with clear causal linkage between the memory's resistance and the protagonist's realization. Closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts the burden of connection. The orientation and timeline (twilight to dawn) are anchored effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear, linear path to a legible closure where the forgery is sealed and hidden, fitting an accumulative structure. However, the plot lacks a distinct turning point or obstacle; the progression is procedural, and the ending resolves a situation that faced no active resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a clear causal line to a Conceptual Repricing closure ("seeds" not "prisoners"), but the climax relies heavily on an "explain-everything" exposition dump by the Archivists. The revelation is delivered rather than earned through struggle, though the final choice is distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative flow is logical, but the pivotal deduction—connecting the snow globe to a stowaway child—relies on a convenient intuitive leap rather than earned evidence. Closure is achieved, but the investigative "Sherlock scan" feels rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows an accumulative lens, but the closure—finishing a chore—lacks a decisive shift in stakes or perspective. The ending feels like a natural stopping point rather than a resonant reconfiguration that implies a cost or new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.2)
    The plot hinges on a significant causality break: paper letters surviving in a compost bin for years (a "pre-liquidation" era) to be legible for reassembly strains physical credibility. The resolution is a "push-button" fix where the machine works instantly, resolving the crisis without a felt cost or meaningful complication.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative arc is tight and purposeful, moving from the inciting signal to the geometric preparation and final projection of shadows. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "variant allegiance" is physically manifested in the world's weather, with the cost of Elian's confirmed and "perfect" loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is sound, with a clear inciting incident (finding the box) leading to a Decisive Change (leaving the loft). The closure works well, with the abandonment of the sanctuary serving as a tangible cost for the new direction. The "magic" resolves the emotional blockage a bit too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.7)
    The resolution relies on a convenient backstory patch (a hidden slot discovered six months ago) rather than an earned tactical shift or resourcefulness in the moment. The closure is a "net win" with only physiological aftermath ("shaking") as the cost; the protagonist had the solution all along, diminishing the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative follows a linear execution of a plan that works perfectly, lacking a Decisive Change born of immediate struggle or failure. The closure is a "promise kept" (they escape) but lacks a visible cost or complication within the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    The closure—choosing to write the report with her own conclusions—is a valid Decisive Change that lands with cost (severing the mentor's legacy). However, the plot pivots on a convenient discovery (the "waterproof satchel" containing the damning reports), which bypasses the need for the protagonist to deduce the crime solely through the forensic evidence available in the tunnel.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    The climax hinges on a convenient coincidence—sunlight striking a microscopic inscription at the exact moment of inspection—which weakens the causal chain. The repairman points to the flaw before the light hits, creating a confused sequence where the "method" (light) feels decorative rather than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear accumulative logic, building pressure through the "yearning" to a resonant closure. The "Tuesday" framing effectively grounds the cosmic scale, and the bell’s retroactive ringing offers a satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration that justifies the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.0)
    Causality feels convenient, particularly the leap from the physical patch image to coordinates hidden in music tracks ("Then the numbers began appearing"). The closure relies on a summary explanation of the rescue rather than a dramatized scene, reducing the impact of the inciting mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative relies on a "magic fix" resolution that bypasses the stated trade-off (lives vs. biosphere) via a third option, triggering the "symmetric satisfaction" anti-pattern where everyone wins without sacrifice. While the "reconstituted choice" attempts a Conceptual Repricing, it lacks the required legible cost—social, physical, or emotional—to make the victory earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration; the discovery of the shoe crystalizes the protagonist's shift in perspective with clear conceptual cost (the loss of certainty). The narrative arc is coherent under the Accumulative lens, moving smoothly from seeking to understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece achieves a clear conceptual repricing, moving from waiting to acceptance, but the turn is driven by a convenient memory rather than immediate pressure. The causality is internal and soft, with the "realization dump" resolving the tension too neatly without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a coherent, linear procedural arc that results in a legible completion of the consecration. However, the progression is predictable and lacks a decisive reconfiguration of the character's status; the closure reads as simple task completion without significant cost or twist.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative relies on a summary montage spanning months, violating the short story scope of a dramatized scene or shard sequence. The ending is a completed task rather than a closure unit with felt cost; the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through specific causal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story functions effectively as an accumulative vignette, building texture toward a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (placing the crystal). However, the narrative lacks a decisive tightening of options or causal friction; the progression is linear and reflective rather than driven by urgent narrative turns.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative loop functions as a sophisticated "Earned Stasis," where the physical evidence of progress (the worn chalk) contrasts devastatingly with the mental reset. The causal chain is tight; the precognitive forgetting acts as a coherent mechanism that drives every beat from waking to the inevitable erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative operates on a dream logic where sound stabilizes physical structures; while this fits the surreal tone, the bridge between the tectonic threat and the audio solution strains causality even within a lyric frame. The closure—transcendence and a left-behind artifact—lands effectively as a Conceptual Repricing, though the materialization of the previously "decayed" leaf creates a slight continuity bump.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative follows a linear, "healer" archetype structure where the professional intervenes and resolves the tension without a significant complication or reversal. The pivot relies heavily on a coincidence (the arrival of the storm/scent exactly at the moment of crisis) rather than causal logic derived from the characters' choices. Closure is achieved, but it feels engineered by the atmospheric conditions rather than earned through narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clear, linking the surreal inciting incident to the specific mechanical resolution in the observatory. The closure lands effectively as a Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the perspective on the catastrophe from tragedy to preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain from the effigy discovery to the healing and rescue, with a strong Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The transition from the garden to finding the real girl relies on a slightly convenient magical mechanic ("the tooth knows"), but the structural unity remains solid.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is coherent and creates a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the final image recontextualizes her power. Orientation is solid, and the causal link between the polishing and the light is clear, though the progression is linear and lacks significant structural complications or setbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative arc is coherent and well-paced, following a clear Accumulative trajectory toward a decisive moment of release. The closure—leaving the amber pendant as a "seed crystal"—is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration that pays a tangible cost (the heirloom) to earn internal peace, satisfying the rubric’s closure requirement effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, built around a central ritual that leads to a clear moment of Earned Stasis. The transition from author to witness provides a solid logic for the closure, though the cameo flashbacks rely on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative follows a linear, low-friction path where the ritual succeeds exactly as planned without complication. The closure offers "symmetric satisfaction"—a perfect fix with no felt cost or twist—rendering the resolution flat.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows a clear linear ritual (preparation, execution, result) with a coherent Accumulative drive. While the logic is sound, the lack of friction or near-failure makes the outcome feel inevitable. The closure lands a Conceptual Repricing ("compass point that points inward"), but the ease of execution dampens the dramatic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative is a linear procedural—diagnosis, plan, execution, success—devoid of complications or setbacks. The closure is a "mission accomplished" moment that lacks the required felt or conceptual cost to give the ending weight.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative follows a procedural loop (start, process, finish) without a decisive change or reweighting of stakes; the accumulation creates atmosphere but lacks a distinct turning point or cost paid on the page. The closure is a return to stasis rather than a reconfiguration of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    The pacing aligns well with the boiling kettle, creating a functional frame for the reflection. However, the closure is a "soft reset" (finishing tomorrow) rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost; the ending relies on a summary of wisdom rather than a dramatic shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is crisp: the ghost’s refusal of the initial offering forces a higher-stakes trade, leading to a decisive reconfiguration of the protagonist’s state. The closure lands with a surreal but legible logic, satisfying the "chronologically confused" premise without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear procedural path (survey, fix, succeed) without a decisive turning point where failure is a genuine risk. The closure is a "victory lap" that lacks the required legible cost; the transformation is achieved through summary rather than a dramatic pivot that forces a tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scene is structurally sound, following a clear trajectory from entry to a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the burden is released. However, the narrative lacks causal friction; the protagonist moves from point A to B without encountering significant resistance or needing to alter tactics, making the progression feel inevitable and linear.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing, but the causal chain relies on convenience and "dream logic." The mechanic of the sundial pointing to a date that functions as longitudinal coordinates is physically implausible without established magic, and the travel to the cottage is summarized via a teleport-like transition ("By the silence of morning radio").

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear linear arc with legible closure (he secures the technique), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds. However, the plot lacks causal resistance; the progression is smooth and ritualistic, resembling a fetch quest where success is granted rather than wrested from opposition. The ending lands cleanly but feels low-stakes due to the ease of acquisition.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.7)
    The accumulative structure effectively uses the thread ritual to navigate the passage of time and anchor the ending. However, the closure relies on an explicit realization ("He understood now...") that explains the change rather than letting the final image carry the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (hatching) provides a clear state change, but the pacing is halted by the mechanical repetition of transitional phrases ("Through the discovery of"). The structure feels formulaic, creating a "fill-in-the-blanks" rhythm that hampers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.5)
    The plot relies on a significant causality break where a "medically unsanctioned" kelp graft fuses to burn scar tissue in twenty minutes via "stubborn hope." This shifts the genre from grounded drama to convenience-based magic realism without setup, resolving the central physical problem too easily. The closure lacks a felt cost, as the procedure succeeds perfectly on the first try.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative follows a linear trajectory where the resolution is achieved through passive waiting ("sidereal patience") rather than active agency or sacrifice, leading to a "symmetric satisfaction" ending. The closure restores the status quo without the required "felt cost" or decisive change that alters the character's standing.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative structure, building density through the transit until the gear is placed. The closure works well as a Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara’s dispersal and the garden’s ignition fundamentally alter the status quo. The "generational trap" concept successfully grounds the ending, though the solution (compassion over force) feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and circular, moving clearly from the setup to a resonant closure image (the web of ribbons). However, the causality is soft; the plot advances through spectral instruction rather than the protagonist's active problem-solving or failure. The spatial logic of graves existing inside the greenhouse creates mild orientation debt that is never fully resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands clearly as order is restored. However, the linear progression—climb, wait, adjust, descend—lacks causal tightening or a "micro turn" where the outcome is genuinely in doubt. The scientific logic of tides affecting a pendulum by two full seconds strains credibility in a realistic mode, though it functions within the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative relies on a Deus Ex Machina where the decoding method simply "reveals itself" tonight without causal trigger or prior effort. While the structural loop (garden to silo to garden) is coherent, the central turn lacks agency; the solution is granted rather than achieved. The closure is a conceptual shift, but because the protagonist pays no price for the discovery, the resolution feels flat.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The structure is a linear process of preparation and execution without a decisive turn or felt cost; Elara sets out to write and simply succeeds. The closure is a "soft reset" of task completion rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration, offering symmetric satisfaction rather than narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative relies on a summary coda ("Years later") to deliver closure, bypassing the immediate scenic resolution of the conflict. While the accumulative logic holds, the ending resolves the "story famine" through reported success rather than a decisive on-page moment with visible, felt cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative structure is tight and effective, using the rocking chair as a physical timer that binds the scene's pacing. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration; the final image of the mask on the stopped chair clearly signals the end of the ritual and a shift in his understanding of safety.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative traces a clean arc from the discovery of the cog to a decisive internal stance, maintaining tight causality under a Situational lens. The closure—trusting mathematics to outlast the rising tide—acts as a potent Resonant Reconfiguration that validates the protagonist's worldview with visible isolation cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative arc is linear and lacks significant friction; the transition from deep-seated enmity to "impossible consonance" is smoothed over with summary and metaphor. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through dramatized struggle or tactical maneuvering on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a coherent causal path under a textural lens, moving from internal pruning to external growth. However, the climax relies on a sudden leap from biological neuroscience to high-fantasy botany ("vines spiraled upward with impossible speed") that feels unearned by the established reality. The causality hinges on a "magical" connection between synaptic plasticity and soil chemistry that is asserted rather than built.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scene moves efficiently to closure, but the riddle-matchbox is a contrived device found conveniently to enable a thematic lecture. The causality is linear and lacks the complication or deepening required for a higher score; the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative is a linear progression of discovery with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure (the house wakes), but the "shard of hush" functions as a convenient MacGuffin found without struggle. The causality is soft; the protagonist faces no setbacks or complications that force a change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, moving from static pressure to a Resonant Reconfiguration (the garden "breathing" and "spiraling"). The resolution is conceptually satisfying, though the linear execution—Corvin plans, understands, and acts without unexpected external friction—feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative arc is clean, moving from the trap to the epiphany to the rupture with clear causality under a Situational/Accumulative lens. The closure is a decisive Resonant Reconfiguration, where the "texture of the missed opportunity" becomes the exit. The transition from math to physical rupture relies on surreal logic but is established early enough to work.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative follows a linear, accumulative structure that lacks a distinct turning point or tightening of stakes. While the closure (dawn arriving) completes the pattern, it feels like a natural cessation rather than a resolution earned through narrative pressure or causal progression.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative arc is legible, moving from isolation to epiphany to action, with a clear closure unit (Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise). However, the central plot mechanic—bread initials forming "precise map coordinates"—strains credibility even within a fable context, relying on a convenient pattern recognition that resolves the puzzle instantly. The closure lands well, effectively reweighting the "thaw" as both threat and liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc, but the mechanism relies on a convenient coincidence—the famine stone perfectly matching a toy yoyo—which strains credibility even within magical realism. The closure is a legible Decisive Change, though the logic of the solution feels more dream-like than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative arc is clean, utilizing a Resonant Reconfiguration where the confession recontextualizes the haunting. However, the resolution relies heavily on the "dream logic" instruction manual established early on, making the climax feel slightly procedural—she reads the rule, follows it, and the magical object absorbs the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative follows a coherent ritual arc to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, but the lack of causal friction or potential failure makes the outcome feel predetermined. The closure lands a conceptual shift (enemy to collaborator) effectively, though the absence of palpable risk flattens the dramatic curve.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The causal chain is excellent: observation leads to hypothesis, which leads to a decisive action that fundamentally alters the world (Decisive Change). The closure is profound and earned, with the mechanism of the turtles' movement providing a satisfying, concrete pay-off to the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    The inciting incident—a specific rosebush petal falling exactly as predicted in a diary—strains credibility, reading as contrived melodrama or accidental magic realism in a grounded setting. While the closure lands on a decision, the plot moves via convenient timing rather than organic pressure until the editor's late text.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.7)
    The accumulative structure works, but spatial and physical logic falters (wading with an open dipping inkwell in the ocean strains credibility; "surfaces" at the end contradicts the earlier "wading"). Closure is legible but relies on a convenient thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative pivots on a convenient discovery—the exact authentication manual preserved in a vacuum-sealed case—rather than active deduction under pressure. This coincidental resolution deflates the investigative tension and simplifies the "alternative hypothesis" into an easy answer.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (ascension) is legible, but the progression is linear and lacks causal obstacles. The final twist regarding the shadow feels conceptually imposed rather than causally earned through the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative arc is tight, with a clear goal and ticking clock that drives momentum effectively. However, the interface between the geode and the navigation console relies on "magic rock" logic that strains the otherwise grounded hard sci-fi setting.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative follows a linear "fetch quest" logic: arrive, fix machine, receive reward. The closure is a "symmetric satisfaction" where the want (belonging) is met exactly as desired without an unexpected cost or twist. The cause-and-effect is mechanical, relying on asserted pseudo-science rather than narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is clean and tightly structured, moving causally from the physical search to a resonant reconfiguration of purpose. The closure—choosing to bear witness rather than seek impossible redemption—is earned by the on-page discovery and lands with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative arc is tight and cohesive, successfully executing a "Resonant Reconfiguration" where the exchange ritual reorders the status quo. The pacing is deliberate, and the closure lands with the specific, material cost of the drawer pull being passed on, anchoring the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arc is coherent, with a clear situational drive lens moving from the launch to the cove. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elias accepts his limitations. The pacing is steady, though the reliance on backstory reflection slows the early momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.4)
    Causality is functional but relies on a &quot;magic feather&quot; resolution where the lake installs empathy like software. The closure lands via a deus ex machina (holographic text) rather than organic consequence. Orientation is clear, but the mechanism of change is external to the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story features a strong Causal arc with a legible Decisive Change at the end: Elara transforms into a bridge, paying the price of eternal stasis. The causality is tight, moving from the fortune's promise to the ritual and finally to the consequence. The closure is earned and satisfying, with a clear before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative follows a clear Accumulative logic, building pressure through the ritual until a Conceptual Repricing recontextualizes the "lost" time. Closure is distinct and costly; she descends with the weight of forgiveness rather than the magic she sought. The causality of the ritual—using the saucer and blood to unlock memory—is consistent and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative structure is coherent and concludes with a clear Decisive Change (departure through the rift). However, the specific mechanic facilitating his ascent (gravity responding to emotion) feels convenient and introduced solely to enable the climax, lacking prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative follows a linear procession without causal complications or structural turns; the "detour" is a retrospective backstory element rather than an active plot driver. Closure functions as Earned Stasis, but the outcome feels predetermined by prophecy rather than forged by the character's actions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative arc is clear and the "Charged Poise" closure—where the revolution becomes geometrically inevitable—is effective. However, the plot lacks a tightening beat or meaningful obstacle; the protagonist encounters no resistance, making the outcome feel predetermined rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is structurally sound with a clear Causal drive toward the alignment; closure is a distinct Resonant Reconfiguration (becoming the pattern) with legible cost, though the "topological harness" mechanism relies on asserted abstract logic that slightly distances the reader from the physical problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    The vigil structure frames the narrative effectively, and the discovery provides a clear pivot point. However, the conceptual repricing—linking the bus timetable to a "map of waiting"—relies heavily on metaphorical convenience rather than strict causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain using "puzzle logic" to resolve the scene. However, the reliance on the physical duel to "create space" for the solution feels slightly contrived, and the closure—while legible—lacks a significant felt cost or sacrifice to validate the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative follows a clear causal arc from arrival to exchange, successfully using the rising moon as a pacing mechanism. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the acceptance of inevitable forgetting reweights the value of the immediate action, though the external plot beats are somewhat standard.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain is coherent, utilizing a clear setup and payoff to drive the station’s escape. The resolution, however, leans on a "preparedness" beat—the piano modifications made six months ago—which lowers the immediate tension by solving the crisis through backstory rather than a high-stakes, in-the-moment tactical improvisation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative arc is coherent and the closure (successful harvest/preservation) lands with conceptual weight. However, the pacing of the climax relies on convenient magical acceleration—the tree grows from seed to fruiting maturity in mere hours—which deflates the time-pressure of the approaching monsoon.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative relies on dream-logic where objects (lace, compass) provide convenient solutions to internal conflict without creating causal friction. The "instructions" in the lace act as a Deus Ex Machina, bypassing the hard work of processing grief, which makes the closure—while thematically coherent—feel inevitable rather than earned through narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds throughout: because the studio burns, therefore she flees; because frost reveals wagon ruts, therefore she finds the cave; because she reads the journals, therefore the ledger re-prices from shame to love. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (canyon rim, frost, truck). The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: “map of devotion written in carbon and ash” reweights every prior beat, with the cost felt in her slowed, eastward drive—no rush to rebuild. One micro-turn (ledger = sacrifice, not crime) tightens stakes decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the white-gold major chord reconfigures silence from prison to instrument with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each fork-strike deepens the thermal pattern until the final cadence. No teleporting props or orientation drift; winterglass, forks, and heat-map are anchored by word 80. Persistent constraint (permanent deafness) shapes every tactic and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story lands a Conceptual Repricing closure: the library folds into a permanent address for the dead, reweighting the premise from “burial fails” to “stillness can be architected even beneath crushing dark.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density intensifies as books snap shut and souls settle into chairs, the final silence ringing with cost. One causality micro-gap: the note “They are calling from beneath” is unanchored (sender, mechanism), but the payoff reframes the signals as navigational beacons, so the ellipsis serves rather than breaks the pattern. Orientation is taught early by the tide’s physics-defying retreat; impossible space is accepted by mid-point and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell’s first audible peal reweights the entire distribution scheme from clandestine to communal, cost paid by Maya’s surrender of invisibility. Causal chain holds—anonymous runs → bell as compass → child’s discovery → public declaration—without off-stage shortcuts. Orientation is anchored by word 95; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (wisteria, respiring stone, inverted sky) tightens the stake until the tear’s dispersal reweights the premise—grief becomes pollen. Closure is a Charged Poise: two figures fused in cloud-projection, cost paid by Maya’s dissolution of identity. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 5; no debt. Causality holds: because she breathes with the bridge, the crystal melts, therefore the love releases.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of fading/recursion taught in paragraph 1 (“palimpsest of temporal residue”) and tightened through each botanical snapshot until the final image reweights the stake—Elias becomes the palimpsest. Closure is a Charged Poise: his atoms distributed along the plane with conceptual cost (“eternal, branching logic”). No causality break; the hyperbolic expansion is signaled early and paid in the disintegration beat. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“ivy-choked railing”).

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is an Earned Stasis: she descends, chain left above, paying with permanent exile to keep the vault alive. Causal lens holds: because she decodes the arrow-dial, the vault opens; because she stays chained, the scavenger yields. Orientation anchors—who, where, when—land by line 3. No teleporting props; the arrow’s hollow shaft and piano cipher are set up and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each recorded absence thickens pattern until the cold forge imprints silence into hardware, reweighting meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara slots the aid, hears her own exhalation as cost, orchard and wrecks vibrating in sympathy; options foreclosed, cost felt. Orientation anchors (greenhouse dome, shipwreck ring, aurora) arrive by line 5; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (sunset brass, moonbeam jar, flower codes) tightens the same stake—capturing a frozen breath of time—until the final cathedral-of-shadows image reweights the premise with Charged Poise; cost is legible in the open-ended wait, the silver light now paired with stolen canvas, destiny still unpaid.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bookmark sealed inside the finest sphere crystallizes both signature and surrender, re-weighting the premise under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The thawing observatory anchors who/where/when within the first 120 words; transitions are smooth (single continuous scene). Causality is lyrical rather than plot-driven—ice melt → tea boil → glass breath—each beat thickens the atmospheric pattern rather than narrows external options, legitimate under the chosen lens. Cost is legible in the final image: she leaves the shelters behind, “carrying nothing but the weight of what she had released.”

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because the tremors reveal code, therefore coordinates are sent, therefore sirens arrive. Orientation crisp within 50 words; single-scene default met. Closure is Decisive Change with felt cost—father clinging, Kai walking away, autonomy stolen back. Persistent constraint: the inherited trembling body remains, shaping future life.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the booklet empties, the night is internalized, the map now lives in her body—cost is the loss of external record and the self-subsumption into silence. The accumulative/textural lens holds: each catalogued hush layers density until the final star’s extinction reweights the whole frame. No orientation debt; pattern taught by 25% and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural pattern is taught by sentence three (“crystalline tiles that had not thawed in seventeen years”) and holds through the final frost drip upward. Orientation is secured within 50 words; the violin’s reappearance tightens each loop, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the bow turns to frost—conceptual cost legible in the inverted melt.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lens transferred, the ticket retained, complicity acknowledged, no daylight yet. The rain-soaked forecourt crystallizes options—tomorrow’s reckoning is unspoken but unavoidable—and the cost is legible in the crack imagery and shared breath. Causal chain holds: because Mara decodes the doodles → confronts Julian → offers lens → mutual pact. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the maze’s simultaneous blooming/withering reweights the premise that narrative, not probability, sustains life. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each marble placed thickens pattern until the final exhale. Causality is internally coherent, no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the hologram’s timestamps-from-the-future reweight the rule-set of time itself, with felt cost in Kael’s vindicated smile. Causal lens holds: each beat (“because he was mocked, therefore he risks the lever”) tightens options. Orientation is clean by line 6. One minor scaffold: “mechanically warm embrace” returns twice without new charge, but it never touches the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the water’s six-inch recession is an undeniable physical reconfiguration that costs Elara her archival relic and future certainty, crystallizing the before/after under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds: because she obeys every liquid hieroglyph, therefore the hydraulic ghost recedes. Orientation is anchored by word 60 ("Queen's Theater's decay") and the spatial map remains coherent. One tightening suffices; the rising density of water-borne instructions escalates stakes without causal zig-zags.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: taping the impossible flower in the core log reweights the entire prediction paradigm and her complicity; cost is the foreclosed option of continued peripheral self-exoneration. Accumulative lens holds from first isobaric hallucination to final anemometer swing; each textual shard layers density until the pattern break crystallizes. Orientation is nailed in first 120 words (who, mountain station, predawn after fever). No causal break; the smudge is irreversible and charges all prior readings.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story lands a resonant Charged Poise: the beaded wheel’s sixteen colors reweight Elias’s confession, making the moral cost legible without supernatural release. Causality is sound—each radio clue maps to a physical find, culminating in the valve wheel that fuses industrial and intimate. The Orientation Test is passed by ~100 words. Closure cost is unmistakable: “she understood the exact tonnage” reconfigures her prior architectural thrill into burden. One minor slip: the climax is observation, not action, so the Decisive Change is intellectual; still, the final image holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the flattened swan-map reweights the library’s decay as generative, felt cost legible in “seed of silence” she carries. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of folding/unfolding threads micro-shifts rather than causal reversals. Orientation wavers: “untold seasons” delays temporal anchoring past 120 words, but disorientation pays off in the river-twilight stasis, so penalty waived. Single transition (library→river) is legible, no prop drift.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens: eclipse window → safety → whistle → "Again" because/therefore chain is intact. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—the boy’s reclaimed voice and her tear-blurred relief. Setting anchors within 50 words; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint: her need to stay softly adaptive keeps her from celebrating loudly, visible in the final steady strum.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final sentence crystallizes the option to speak, reweighting the axis-shift premise with conceptual cost—“translating walls into words, dragons into deliverance.” Accumulative lens holds; the tapestry and diaries pattern-break the quiet into historical pressure. The single causal tightening—tapestry decoded as axial map—suffices for 700-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the beam sweeping over microdots reconfigures Elias from pawn to unwitting architect, with the conceptual cost that he leaves the only home he never knew he controlled. Causality holds under the Accumulative lens: each fortune-cookie dispatch is a grain that tips the espionage hourglass. The Orientation Test is waived—deliberate disorientation (who receives which cookie) pays off when the stranger recognizes the pattern. One minor loop: “directing flow” is stated three times across two paragraphs without new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal linkage is airtight: each pedal layer + rhetorical question incrementally counters the entity until the palindromic loop locks the anchor. Closure is a crisp CR—palette turns dust, silence rewoven—leaving undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is immediate; no teleportation of rules. One tightening beat suffices; no mid-paragraph head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (cold glass, ice timbre, nautilus warmth) tightens the same stake—hearing the unheard—until the dawn shatters the mirror and reconfigures time as spiral, not line. Closure is a Charged Poise: the raised hands crystallize that he now lives inside every moment simultaneously, with the visible cost of forever forfeiting linear identity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise: the viaduct fades as tattoos pulse, showing earned fusion of selves. However, causality is lyric-associative; the tablet’s procedural rule is asserted, not tested in a beat where a wrong step almost kills her. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of collapsing ghosts—so the single tightening is the dusting of the tablet; this lands, yet feels neat rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the backward groove reweights her premise—silence is not absence but palpable architecture—paid for by the microscopic cut of the broken needle against her fingertip. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each spiral of the record increases tactile density until the emotional dam breaks. Orientation is taught early via limestone wall and cavern acoustics; no penalty applied. One tightening is sufficient for the word count; no off-stage cheats or convenience plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single continuous scene; causality clean: pigeon → coordinates → mentor-alive → dual-ledger invitation. Closure is Charged Poise: she writes while rain equalizes both worlds, cost legible in the open window. No orientation drift; lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early through rhythmic image-stacking; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias arrives at “present in the radiance of what remains,” foreclosing avoidance with felt cost (empty vial, open lungs). The vial’s reappearance is kept from reader only until the ultraviolet beat, a purposeful elision paid off by tactic change. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. One scaffold loop (“crystal shadows” x3) but none in the final third; closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sideways step reconfigures the binary rescue/loss rule-set while the frayed rope across his lap makes the cost tactile. Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first moonrise to final poly-tense verse; temporal folds intensify by accretion rather than causal reversals. Orientation is anchored by grotto mouth/heat/third-moon within 120 words; no debt applied.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chronic hush is conceptually repriced from absence to "full of potential," with the bowl’s retained heat as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence shift (flames → sympathetic hulls → transformed silence) reweights the stake without causal reversals. Orientation is taught by line 3; no teleporting props or amnesia; the final image crystallizes options under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the counterfeit becomes real via grotto resonance, reweighting Kael’s premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—static surge → petal activation → genuine tears—though “ancient resin supplies missing authenticity” is slightly convenient. Orientation is clear by 120 words; one shard, no teleport. Accumulation lens dominates; the final image crystallizes options with felt cost, satisfying quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain—misdelivered photo → friendship with Clara → foundation idea—lands cleanly as a Conceptual Repricing: Elias’s ledger now measures gratitude, not tonnage. Orientation is swift (harbor, symphony night, glass-domed library), the single transition up the spiral stair is seamless, and the closure beat (“five percent he once reserved for his most ruthless contingency deals”) carries legible social cost, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the reed bridge crystallizes the shift from isolation to kinship under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the silver hand-touch makes cost legible. Orientation is swift (who/where by 50 words), causality holds across moon-phase tag hunts, and no beat resets without price. One micro-turn—finding the mute artist—deepens rather than breaks pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical layer heightens the central theft until the snap-back crystallizes meaning. Orientation is swift—gondola, canal, tower, 40-minute clock—all taught by line 8. Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the cage dissolves, the echo launches, the canals drain; the cost is legible in “three minutes early, the debt called due with interest.” One causality wobble: the “words she had learned from mayflies” arrive as unmotivated key, not foreshadowed tool.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each drip, chip, and refracted gleam layers density until the final drop cleaves a new tributary, reweighting the stake from “find her” to “live with not-knowing.” Closure is Charged Poise: the cavern dark returns identical but the reader feels the reconfigured equation—love as gravity—via the velvet pouch beat. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“subterranean grove”), well under 120; no penalty. Causality intact: every image of mineral memory accrues to the last fissure. Cost legible in the hush that “had shifted,” satisfying 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each fragment caches adds density and re-weights the stake of communal memory. Closure is a Charged Poise crystallized in the final sentence—“finally visible through the artifacts”—with conceptual cost (she remains unseen but leaves undeniable evidence). One transition (dawn arrives) is legible; no orientation debt. Persistent constraint—the need to stay hidden—shapes every tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the linden leaf pressed to wet cedar by wind reweights her entire epistemic framework with undeniable conceptual cost; the greenhouse cathedral must fall. Causal linkage holds throughout—“because she clenched control, therefore she missed truth”—and the storm season persists as future constraint. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the amber leaves her possession, the journals enter, and her insomnia is re-priced from curse to vigil—an earned conceptual reframe signaled in the last two sentences. Causality is causal-lite but sound: because she cannot sleep she seeks preserved witness; the exchange therefore gives her a new artifact to witness with; consequently she sketches. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (who, where, when), no penalty. One transition (isle to sinkhole) is legible via rain-trail syntax. No lens ambiguity; the inferred lens is Causal, held to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise (“true clairvoyance lay…present”) reweights premise with conceptual cost; causality holds under accumulative lens—each harmonic shift tightens uncertainty until the final image crystallizes options. No teleport, no soft reset; the one transition (dawn→cave interior) is legible and pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the widow’s upright stance reweights the valve from failure to connection, cost legible in her cracked voice. Causality under Accumulative lens holds—each artifact layers psychic residue until communal meaning crystallizes. One minor loop: “compile fragments into meaning” is mantra-repeated without tightening variation. Orientation is clean within 120 words; harbor, rain, and post-exile timeframe are anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern recognition and image density reweight stakes until the phantom train materializes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the glowing ticket redefines her archive of silences—yet the cost is more mystic than felt; no concrete consequence (loss of return, bodily price) is legible on the page. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, but causality between hairline cracks → sealed Track 7 → infinite archive remains associative, not because/therefore. A single tightening occurs (punch bites, ticket glows), satisfying the “one meaningful deepening” rule, but the absence of a visible或个人 price caps the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tile discovery at the parapet is a clean causal pivot that reweights every prior dismissal; the ensuing visions tighten options—she can no longer remain a passive recorder. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she chooses to stay and rebuild, forfeiting her old identity, with the tile mounted overhead as a persistent constraint. The lens is causal throughout; no orientation debt; cost is legible in her trembling hands and the overnight labour that “consumed her”.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the shattered amulet dust reweights farewell from terminus to translation, visible in the final line. Causal chain is thin—storm peaks therefore reality rips therefore insight—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: crystalline refractions, folding corridors, and hushed thunder build a cadence that crystallizes into the reconfigured goodbye. Orientation is taught early via prismatic escondite and seventeen-billion-sunset anchor; no penalty applied. Persistent constraint (amulet destroyed) charges the ending, satisfying 9+ cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: every beat obeys because/therefore logic from ink pot to 2:17 AM breach. Closure is a Charged Poise—Maya poised with the loaded needle, options re-weighted, cost legible in her sacrificed innocence. One transition (prep-room → server-room) is clean; orientation anchored by word 60. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens declared by the humming lamp chart and gilding repetitions; closure lands as Charged Poise: “all times simultaneously” reweights earlier fabrications with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchored by line 3; no ambiguity. Single shard, one tightening when the lamp stutters, forcing faster yet still restrained application—visible price on page. Meets 9+ quick test: persistent constraint (void pressing) shapes tactics and final image without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “to discover the texture of memories was to become the texture itself” reweights stakes with undeniable conceptual cost—identity = palimpsest. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each overheard fragment layers density until the negative-space self is legible. Orientation is taught late but pays off in closure image, satisfying waiver. No causal amnesia; the bureaucratic death error remains a persistent constraint that shapes the method of collection.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shell cracks to reveal a liquid-light map, reweighting the riddle from answer-seeking to perpetual asking. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of reprise (shell, cello, fog) intensifies until meaning crystallizes with felt cost: she relinquishes the observatory and her former identity. One scaffold loop—“reimagined their shared history differently”—recurs without new pressure, dulling final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a crisp Resonant Reconfiguration: the graffiti network is already spreading as corporate boats arrive, a charged poise that reweights the premise—privatize the rafts, not the carnival. Causal chain holds: because she刻 the stone-chip glyph, the juggler activates, teen photographs, community widens the loop; cost is the perpetual tightrope of translation she must now walk. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; lens (Causal) is stable. One micro-slip: “they would privatize the rafts, perhaps” momentarily softens certainty, nudging down from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the captured dawn-image and oxidizing plaque make the loss irrevocable; cost is legible in the final “love letter written in oxidation.” Accumulative lens holds—density of light, shadow, and chemical bloom reweights the stake. Orientation anchored by line 3; no teleporting props; one meaningful tightening as sunlight triggers the shutter.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: crashed drone → need repair → water-reading → vector fixed → ship saved → guilt anchor lifted. Each beat tightens options; the ticking Vespertine horn supplies lived clock. Closure image of dual anchors rising carries clear moral cost under causal lens. No teleporting props or causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: satellite confirmation reweights every map and the lake’s “worrying tranquility” becomes possibility—cost is the unrecoverable solitude Marlow accepts. Causal chain (condensation pattern → coordinates → transmission) holds; orientation anchor (who/where/when) is present by line 4. No slips touch the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the arch sings, new growth begins, and the cost is the solitary decades already spent—legible in the concentrated vibration. Causality is lyrical but coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each footstep adds density until the pattern breaks into regeneration. The story teaches its rule early and never breaks it; the final image reweights all prior walking without explanatory filler.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the temple opens only after she pays with her last breath—cost is visible in the silver stream. Causal chain (vial → memory → surrender → passage) holds without teleport. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) hits by word 80. No meaningful escalation cap breach; one tightening is sufficient under 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Elias drifts into starless dark, the lighthouse exhaling its flicker, reconfiguring him from prisoner to myth with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—each lyrical repetition of “before they find the bodies” tightens cadence until the hush arrives. Causality is dream-logic but internally consistent: narrative weight, not physics, lets him hover. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“lighthouse prison…number seventeen”), waiving any penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bead’s burial reconfigures both land and ghost with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—betrayal → orchard → bead → Julian’s act → dissolution of curse—under a lyrical Accumulative lens. One minor orientation waiver: “three centuries” is stated before we’re anchored in present time, but the final image retroactively justifies the temporal sweep.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: nightly stitching sessions layer density until the bridge-image materializes as Charged Poise. Anchors (who/where/when) are lyrically delayed but the canyon’s red walls and tide-clock teach the pattern before 120 words, so orientation waiver applies. Closure lands when the plate is nailed to the well-wall, reconfiguring the labyrinth from wound to web; the cost is the literal blood drunk by the ink and Maren’s permanent exile from waking law. One causality wobble: the moment the canyon “shuddered with relief” edges toward anthropomorphic convenience, blurring the boundary between metaphor and event.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds from first sensory image to final charged poise: each artifact adds density until the rebuilt sundial re-weights exile/return as lived time. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—shadow touching root shows cost of severed generations without exposition. Causality remains interior yet legible: because she wanders the grid, she finds each gnomon shard; because she rebuilds, the shadow reconnects lineages. Orientation is taught by word 70 (“valley’s air”), well inside 120-word waiver.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the chalk-key vanishes underfoot, reweighting the premise that only physical traces guarantee secrecy. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of visible-vs-hidden builds density until the erasure itself becomes the resonant image. Orientation anchored by line 4; no teleporting props. One transition—arcade to promenade—legible under taught shard rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a clean Charged Poise: the captain’s recognition reconfigures both Mira’s perceived foolishness and the empire’s survival odds under an Accumulative lens; the cost is legible in her continued solitude beside the flame, the price of foresight silently assumed.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: she occupies the frozen instant, speaks the unsent words, and the letters dissolve into dream-condensation—cost is the shard left at Mara’s feet and the irreversible fact that Mara still dies. Causal lattice holds: shard → corridor → vision → utterance → dissolve, each step a because/therefore under moonlight. Orientation is taught by deliberate disorientation early and pays off in the folding-time image; no teleporting props or retroactive rules.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Mara’s placement of the coral under moonlight crystallizes her promise that “notes are seeds,” reconfiguring the child’s body from archive to garden. Causality holds—every beat flows from her decrypting impulse to the final grafted ritual. The 120-word orientation gate is met (translator, Solomon Islands field-hospital atrium, twilight after anesthesia). Cost is legible in her self-indictment that the lexicon now lives “in her own marrow,” foreclosing innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each layer of light-painted memory tightens the stake of “can joy re-ignite?” until the fog-gallery reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—she pockets the daydream-negative with visible cost (the grove dissolves, waking world awaits). Causality is interior but coherent: because the trees show fresco → because fresco pulses → therefore she paints light → therefore film blooms → therefore she smiles, now light-sensitive again. Orientation anchored by word 52 (“ruined orchard district”), no penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sonic layer adds density until the blank wall becomes a canvas of reflected sound, reweighting perception. Orientation is swift—within 60 words we have who, where, and the garden’s acoustic rule-set. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coin’s abandonment crystallizes the shift from knowing to listening, with felt cost (“her work just beginning”). One minor scaffold: the phrase “methodically playful” is repeated without new inflection, dulling the final beat a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: garden codes → greenhouse convergence → warp → capture, each step tightening surveillance risk. Closure is a crisp Earned Stasis: Elias’s unbroken mind vs. physical loss, cost legible in the heel-crush and luna-moth coordinate. One orienting hiccup—city tax premise is clear by ~130 words, just past guardrail, but delay serves the reveal, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens taught by the second sentence and held: each lullaby layer adds floral density that reweights the stake from solitary endurance to ecosystemic peace. Orientation is anchored by ~100 words (iridescent wall, gargantuan shell, three-centenary insomnia). Closure lands as Charged Poise—flower-barricaded entrance, no bones, jasmine rising—reconfiguring meaning with undeniable conceptual cost: the singer has become the architecture she seeded. Persistent constraint (fused skeleton, tidal heartbeat) shapes every tactic and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: because the tube is cracked, therefore light blooms; because light blooms, therefore names survive a little longer. The single meaningful tightening occurs when the caretaker realizes the imperfection is the necessary lens; this reweights the stake from slow loss to momentary salvage. Closure is a Charged Poise: the dimming orchids still “hold the charge of remembrance,” crystallizing both victory and inevitable erosion. Cost is legible in the tube’s disintegration and the “quietly fatal” regret she cups in her chest.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each extinct language tablet adds a because-link toward the air-written vows; the ink well’s transmutation is the visible cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the bridge of light suspended between them—reconfiguring options with felt cost (dawn dissolution clause). No orientation debt; archive geography is legible by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds: found letters → decoded ethic → sabotage upgrade → compassionate flood. Closure is an Earned Stasis: he forfeits promotion and safety to honor the dead, cost legible in “falsified efficiency reports.” Orientation locked by 120 words; lens stays Causal through final image.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the bird’s ascent reweights identity, trust, and the stakes of survival under an Accumulative lens. Causality holds: dust-mote mapping → flight knowledge → Orion sent. Cost is legible in the final image (“waiting,” “true name ready on her lips”). One transition (attic → shop below) is coherent; orientation anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she becomes threshold, corn rows await, cost is conceptual but legible. Accumulative lens holds—pattern of refracted light, wood grain, weather codes tightens into final image. Orientation taught late (terrace rules) but payoff at exit waives penalty; still, one beat of true tightening inside the scene would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of bioluminescence, breath, and star-alignment layers until the synchronized exhale catalyzes the generator, a resonant reconfiguration that reweights isolation into shared vigil. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3 and remain stable. One minor causality gap: the facility’s need for “biological signal” is revealed only when seals groan, not set up, but the final image pays the cost as the ghost dissolves and Elara ascends alone.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seed-glass-memory tightens once into “necessary silences” realization. Closure is Charged Poise with conceptual cost. Orientation clear by word 60; no causal reversal, only deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the woman’s unknown redirection reframes every prior calculation, cost paid in Kael’s erasure. Causal chain (bishop → music → jasmine → prism → detour) stays tight; only the Orientation Test waiver is earned because delayed anchoring serves the reveal. No lens ambiguity; pattern taught early, held to last line.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each moonstone scraping and inscription beat adds density until the final Resonant Reconfiguration—her body becomes the tide. Orientation is anchored by word 50 (garden, stars, nightly ritual). Closure carries undeniable conceptual cost: she forfeits mortal identity for cosmic archiving, foreclosing return. Minor scaffold: three “spontaneously anchored” repetitions dull the final image slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the prism’s spectral fracture reweights twenty years of mundane glass-work with undeniable cost—he forfeits certainty for prismatic asking. Accumulative lens holds: tide pool rings → standing waves → spectral light pattern taught early and paid off. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 4. Persistent constraint (trembling hands) shapes final return to workshop.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: marble passed, new syntax forged, Maya lighter yet scarred—cost is visible in the emptied box and dawn chill. Causal chain holds: because she failed Thomas, she can now meet Elias; because she relives the failure, Elias re-enters service. One reflective block (≈20 %) is anchored to present granite ledge and alters stance by handing over the relic. Orientation is clear by line 15; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gauge’s settled needle reweights hope from wish to equation; cost is the exhaustion she sits with. Causality holds under Accumulative lens—patterns accrete until timelines synchronize.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shard layers sensory memory until the final image reweights “what walls dream.” Transitions are legible and closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (she now carries the past). However, causality between diary clue → cellar → negative is too smooth—no resistance tightens the middle—keeping it short of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrors return to “mundane honesty,” the heartbeat departs, wet footprints evaporate—an undeniable reconfiguration of possibility with conceptual cost (he vanishes, gifts remain). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical repetition deepens the stake until the final bell snaps the pattern. Orientation is clear by line 4 (who, where, when). One minor slack: the clockmaker’s stirring is reported, not shown, but the beat still reads because the fading pulse is felt on the page. Persistent constraint—the stolen hour—shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the portable garden’s biological necessity reconfigures future options with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain holds—celestial window → ritual soil → intertwined roots → mutual survival—each beat tightening the noose of shared dependence. The Orientation Test is met by line 5. Persistent constraint (clipboard passed seasonally) shapes tactics beyond the page. Felt price is legible in Elara’s arthritic kneel and the general’s trembling seal.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is Charged Poise: egg buried, drought ending, crime to be washed away—cost legible in “hollow peace of completion.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of mirrored surfaces (lake, salt, sky) tightens until final rain-dark Rorschach reweights meaning. Causality intact: drought → exposure → burial → submergence. No orientation debt; geography anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism opens, infinite mirror-selves appear, and Lys’s stance crystallizes—she now bears the dissident past inside an Empire that erases memory. Causality holds: chastity → temporal-key → untangle → gate opens; each because/therefore link is on-page. Accumulated-light image reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation, transitions, and lens remain coherent; only the faintest causal leap (how virginity maps to 4-D lockpick) keeps it from 9+ perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ashes beside the cracked dome reconfigure meaning—stories are no longer tools to inscribe on others but air one must breathe. Causal chain intact: argument → stick surrendered → fire → silence; each step forecloses retreat. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated images (dome, stick, tape) tighten until the final cadence releases pressure. Cost is conceptual and felt: Marcus forfeits manipulative mastery and sits “uncommonly serene,” a stance whose price the image makes undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dismantling of the first tower crystallizes “build, signal, release” under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pattern holds from first blushing stillness to final absorbed story; cost is the oxygen she surrenders and the history she lets disintegrate—felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the aurora-charged rope reconfigures into a lantern that projects the swallowed names onto ice—an undeniable Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (the dead re-cast in light, not sound). Causality holds: each braid-shift is motivated by the card’s hole-pattern, so the final illumination is the direct therefore of every gentle tug. The price is visible—“the bronze cradle still warm”—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) tightens texture into meaning without contradiction. One of the rare pieces where lyric escalation actually pays off in a single, legible re-pricing.</question>
    
    <question>3</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sanctum is not backdrop but apparatus: the packed-ice workbench forces slow-motion handling, the translucent ceiling harvests aurora, the rope’s centuries-old braids literally become fiber-optics. These constraints shape tactics—gentle pressure, braid-angles, aurora-watch—so the setting earns its keep in the final image. Micro-setting (wax smudges, bronze dust) is handled like tools, not décor. Spatial choreography remains flawless across the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the melted seal and the decision never to return land with conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern of decay completes itself. Causality is interior and hallucinatory, yet every image is seeded early (ivy, seal, dream-etched wall) and re-weighted at the end. The single transition from waking preparation to dream-walk to post-storm exit is legible; orientation holds without anchors because disorientation is the taught pattern that pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: accidental inventory → geometric discovery → schematic mapping → vocal activation → covenant seal. Orientation lands by line 5; palace/ziggurat anchors hold. Closure is a Decisive Change: the palace shudders, stars realign, Elior smiles—irreversible, paid with blood and lifetime frugality. One hairline lapse: “precession of the equinoxes” stated as prior measurement but never shown; luckily it’s not the activating data-point.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens: each beat flows because/therefore—pin prick → memory trigger → resentment unlock → entity dissolution—tightening options until the sanctuary brightens. Orientation is swift: who (Elias), where (inter-reality sanctuary), when (mid-shift) all inside 70 words. Cost is legible in the final line: “the broken music that had, at last, completed its song”—a Conceptual Repricing that reframes three decades of fracture into closure. Minor waver: the entity’s surrender is slightly telegraphed rather than shocked into being, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: frost-into-glass breathing pattern tightens until the cracked sextant seals the dream. Orientation is immediate; causality is rhythmic, not event-based, so the single meaningful deepening at the final exhale lands as Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost—boundary erasure between maker and made—is felt in the closing image of “smoke made solid” pulsing with shared breath.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cathedral breathes as ruin-garden, ribbon re-tied around grafting knife, seasonal contract unwritten—cost is the irreversibility of change accepted. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each sensory layer (sap, dust, rust, quartz-rainbow) tightens the stakes until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is intact: because she abandoned the site, the orchard grew; because it grew, she returns; because she prunes and releases, she can leave without fixing. No orientation debt; spatial track across tower and nave stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    The piece lands a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard reveals itself as process, not place, and the shell’s blankness is re-weighted as the knowledge she already embodies—cost is felt in the eternal loop she accepts; causality holds under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: the mountain rewrites its own rules as Elara trades the diary’s floral cipher for the chrononaut’s release; the staircase descent crystallizes before/after with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout—each semantic gap she fills reweights what “library” means—and the ending image locks the reconfiguration on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship dissolving into pages crystallizes Maya’s new merged stance with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds—each image thickens the mythic pattern until the final reweighting. Orientation is taught by sentence 3, waiving any penalty. A hairline slip: “trapped freedom” is named rather than dramatized in the final line, barely muting the cost glow.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each braid-undoing tightens the timeline merge; wax seal paid off as the keystone that fuses histories. Closure is a crisp Decisive Change—treaty now exists, wars erased—priced by Elara’s altered archival mandate (“archives forever changed”). Orientation clean by 120 words: midnight bell, tower room, impossible door. One micro-gap: how the rope’s “temporal coordinates” translate into diplomatic text is asserted, not dramatized, but does not rupture causality.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: silence blooms outward, energy beings recoil, Mara passes into earned stasis with tactile cost—“maps now useless,” body fixed beside the stone. Causality holds: each frequency adjustment because/therefore alters the ice meter until the null-song crystallizes. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. The price is visible in the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the beacon’s gold threads stitch a new possibility across the wasteland, turning monument-of-loss into signal-of-return. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—star alignment, cracked prism, and Elara’s gift converge in one charged image whose cost is the release of generations of stored silence. The piece teaches its pattern early (coincidence as syntax) and lands a single tightening cadence at the Thornwheel moment. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“glass humming pavilion stood alone on the crater's rim”), so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elara’s realization that identity is fluid as weather crystallizes in the image of rain-writing on skin, paying the cost of private selfhood. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shadow measurement and raindrop adds density until the final cadence shift reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint—the solidifying fog—shapes every tactical move and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sky stays empty yet the courtyard glitters with note-shards that children will whistle, undeniable social cost and reconfiguration of siege mentality. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chant-circle and color pulse layers density until the mosaic’s secret is transmitted through vibration rather than causal blow-by-blow. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no teleporting props; beat sequence spirals inward without retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the jade cicada passed hand-to-hand crystallizes the new terms—pause, not rupture—with undeniable relational cost. Causal chain holds: because she chronicles transitions, because he accepts the tangential path, the gift-exchange forecloses immediate resolution while tightening future stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 30; no debt applied. Lens is Causal; every beat is linked by “because/therefore” pressure culminating in the final image where the object’s warmth literalizes the price of waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each silence-collecting step adds density until the gilded hush fills the doll and the inversion hour snaps. Closure is a Charged Poise: the hatch closes, gravity re-asserts, the held silence becomes ballast—“a second heart” pressed to her ribs—reconfiguring both bunker life and future sky-theft. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no debt. The inversion rule stays consistent; no late cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single scene, Accumulative/Textural lens: atmospheric layering tightens until quiet crystallizes. Setup crystal-clear by 120 words; closure offers Charged Poise—silence now comfort, not threat—felt in passenger exhale. Cost is ethereal rather than concrete, slightly softening the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the stairway dissolves, archive restoration becomes the new “crown,” and the empty throne is re-weighted as wisdom symbol. Causal chain—flake pulse → mural → orchard → ascent → repository unlock—holds without teleporting information. One soft ellipsis: how exactly the flake “resonates” with the final step is asserted, not shown, but the gap is narrow and doesn’t break because the mural/orchard mechanics are pre-taught. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4 and reinforced by sunrise countdown.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    The closure is a clean Charged Poise: the threshold dissolves, Mira leaves, Elias remains, and the cost is the perpetual stillness of the swaying ring. Causality holds under a Hybrid lens—burning bridges → smoke trail → encroachment → scar-circuit → letting-go. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (“house fire that refused to consume itself”). No teleporting props; every beat advances either knowledge or option space. The ending image reweights the premise without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the diamond crystallizes every broken promise with undeniable conceptual weight—she pays with her trauma turned artifact. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: the mushroom glow thickens, the texts layer, the bolt heats, the diamond refracts—each repetition reweights the stake until the final image reconfigures survival itself. Causality is lyric, not linear, but the pattern is taught by line 5 (“glitchy text messages…seventeen days”) and never breaks. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the dynasty collapses through unveiled truth, a Conceptual Repricing with social cost signaled by “by dawn, the Aureate name would be ash.” Causality is lyric-accumulative; each crank-turn deepens textual density until airborne letters crystallize. The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is taught by word 60; no penalty. One minor elasticity: the gramophone’s acoustic physics is introduced as fait accompli rather than earned constraint, but it does not break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the still-point dissolution into “everything” carries undeniable conceptual cost—his isolated selfhood is foreclosed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each unsnapping intensifies density until the greenhouse unfolds, reweighting the stake without causal reversals. The Orientation Test is waived—early disorientation (“endless night,” “glass panes dripping measurable starlight”) pays off in the final liquid-light door. One minor loop—“mercury fruit vibrating between liquid and solid states without thermal transition” repeats the prior mercury image—keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the file room changes from mausoleum to “secret library,” reweighting Maya’s stance with undeniable conceptual cost—she now shoulders guardianship of strangers’ mercies. Causal chain holds: dust anomaly → open file → find button → trace pattern → compile index; each because/therefore tightens options under the Causal lens. Cost is legible in the final beat: “She carried the sergeant’s button…as a method,” a permanent debt she chooses. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line three.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causal chain is clean: silence → puddle coordinates → key → switchboard → city-wide data burst → disappearance. Orientation is swift and spatially tracked; the single transition from street to tunnel to lagoon is legible. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost: the Ministry’s narrative monopoly is publicly cracked, Elias’s path is foreclosed by sealed locks, and the brass key is now his only passport. No teleporting props or explanatory dumps; the one ellipsis—how the algae hologram uplinks to modern devices—is forgivable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each droplet threat layers density until the final suspended bead. Closure lands as Charged Poise—absolute silence refracted through prism—cost crystallized in “startling quiet” and tomorrow’s endless vigil. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a decisive conceptual repricing: the arbor’s ash is recast as chrysalis and Elias becomes the seed himself, scattering ordered past into wild future. Causality is lyric-accumulative (lens inferred): moon-dust → prod → reversed leaves → Elias transfigured; each step intensifies texture rather than narrows options, but the final image reweights everything with undeniable cost. Orientation is clear by line 7; no penalties apply. One minor causality soft spot: the lore’s “Transfiguration” is named rather than dramatized before the prod, but the payoff is strong enough to keep the unit intact.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the compass clicks into the chronometer, time restarts, and the price—twenty years of reputational ash—becomes audible in a single note. Causal chain holds: each breadcrumb (log, sextant, cellar scratch) was deliberately placed, so the final retrieve rewrites history. Orientation is clean by line 90; no teleporting props or convenient amnesia. Only the faintest causal fuzz: we never learn who actually scattered the breadcrumbs, but the mystery does not undercut the decisive reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure delivers a Conceptual Repricing: the “molten gold” scars reweight damage as integral strength, fulfilling kintsugi logic with visible cost. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—rain, steam, and chemical glow tighten atmosphere until the coin’s levitation crystallizes meaning. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara moves from calculation to spoken True Name, narrowing possibility without breaking physical law. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no causal or set-up debts surface.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the gorge flips from prison to launching pad via the laughter-catalyzed ascent, and the warming tooth gives a tangible trace of cost. Causal chain (discord → spectral hearing → confession → laughter → release) holds without gaps; orientation is anchored by word 30 and the lens stays accumulative/ritual. Persistent constraint—Elara’s bleeding fingers—shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: forgiveness = ∫pain÷willingness-to-stay-intact, proved on-page when the strap falls and the equation hovers as ultraviolet light. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory pulse reweights the stake until mercy is legible as voltage she now generates herself.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the collective memory now carries Mara, and Elara’s swaying bridge body registers the price of translation. Causal chain holds—lens → reveal → name → loosen → bridge sway—within a single continuous scene. The Orientation Test is satisfied by word 60; no lens ambiguity at end. Accumulation cap not triggered; one residual beat of scaffold repetition (−0.2) keeps it from 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a CR: installing the mainspring reweights the elevator as a metaphysical clock, undeniable on-page. Causal lens holds—every dust spiral and crack leads to this single reconfiguration. Cost is the transfer of the ghost’s vigilance into the machine, felt in the final “singing cables.” No orientation debt; spatial choreography inside the ticket office is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the single crack that remembers sand, the storm of possibility, the page-turning rustle—all land on the page with undeniable conceptual cost (“perfection had finally yielded”). Causality is clean: frost-pattern → bottled whisper → topology print → rupture; no teleporting props or retro-fixes. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (western spire, glass orchard, cloud-sea) and the speculative rules stay consistent. One minor tightening beat suffices under Accumulative/Textural lens; the final image reweights the entire frozen world.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shard rewrites the asteroid from fortress to sanctuary and Kaelen from fighter to elegist, with sorrow as visible price. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each storm cycle and mirrored refusal layers density until the final mirror-covering crystallizes meaning. Causality is internal but coherent: shard → new reading → public stance → private ritual. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) settle within first 100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a lucid Resonant Reconfiguration: the chip’s dissolution reweights the covenant, dawn is re-attached, and the cost—loss of his compass—is felt in the final line. causality holds: because Elias’s song stays true, the stone ignites; therefore midnight recoils. No teleporting props; the hollow box, chip, and comb are contiguous throughout. Orientation is anchored by sentence 3 and never drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a luminous Charged Poise: Elara chooses witness over explanation, carrying the hush upward at undisclosed future cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensuous layer deepens the central stake until the final image reweights it. Orientation is swift and spatial logic remains coherent through descent. The only causal gap: how psychometry instantly confirms the chamber is the sought “place where explanations fail”—the compass vision points, but Elara’s leap of identification is elided.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lantern slide reweights her art from assembly to conversation with the dead, with visible cost—she abandons satellite certainty. Accumulative lens holds: each slide projection thickens pattern until storm-forced yielding becomes inevitable. One causal micro-turn—cedar beam fit while ghosts flicker—tightens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the last brushstroke reweights every prior “dark = retreat” assumption to “dark = pre-dawn vigil.” Causal linkage holds—because the sexton reveals the east-facing flower, Lyra over-paints—cost is the burial of her earlier grief-reading. Accumulative lens is taught early (postcards → glass → mural layers) and pays off in the final pigment pulse. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) hits by line 4; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure delivers a resonant reconfiguration: the diary’s cipher is unlocked not by intellect but by embodied surrogacy and beach-semaphore, exposing graves and renaming archival work as corporeal sacrifice. Causal chain holds: diary-touch → retrocognitive trap → debris-arrangement → parley → truth surfacing. Orientation is anchored within 120 words (zeppelin deck, quartz dunes, 1963 bleed). Lens is Causal; every beat tightens Elias’s options until he pays with self-dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal spine holds: discovery of sealed bottle → memory compression → inward collapse → material rebirth by understood physics; each beat forecloses the prior option and lands a decisive conceptual change with visible cost—the amber dissolves, magic stays dead. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the world-rule. One minor slack: the “soundless” shatter could use earlier acoustic cueing to tighten causality to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each discarded wax coil layers emotional sediment until the pattern break—ingesting a map of unchosen futures—reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise: the orchard rotates around his heartbeat, converting private archive into vegetal prophecy; the cost (he is now living antenna, no retreat) is legible in the final image. Causality is lyric rather than linear, but every beat still forecloses the old archival stance. Minor loop: “after the foghorn falls silent” is used twice as opener; the echo feels slightly scaffold rather than inevitable cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the up-flowing fountain re-prices the covenant with undeniable conceptual cost—she is now perpetual entropy-debt servant. Causal chain (cap → vortex → staircase → stay) holds without teleport; orientation clear by line 4 and lens (Accumulative/Textural) taught by fractal breath pattern, held to last image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: microclimate tracking → distrust of sirens → bell restoration → zero-hour switch; closure delivers decisive change with felt cost—the sanctuary’s warning voice is permanently redefined. One scaffold phrase (“after the glue dries”) recycles three times but never blurs the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of amber–dying light–dawn reweights the premise from abandonment to vocation. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 35 words; the one soft transition (30-year service) is folded into the present beat via the brass telescope. Closure is a Charged Poise: the lantern glass set aglow on the console crystallizes the cost—he forfeits the safety of neglect for the vulnerability of witness. The final sentence reprises “elegant fall,” making the reconfiguration legible and undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of ghostly pauses + sensory clues tighten meaning until Elias’s stance crystallizes. Orientation anchored by line 4; transitions clean. Closure is Charged Poise: open box refracting dawn light reweights the premise—he is bound to witness, not restore. Cost is felt in the indefinite future of caretaking silence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    The mosaic of shards (garage-sale ads → emerald silo → urn dissolve) is taught by 25 % and lands a Conceptual Repricing: time is not measured but accumulated. Orientation wavers early—who/where/when arrive after 120 words—but the disorientation is later paid off by the green-tinted eternity image, so the Orientation Test is waived. Closure carries unmistakable cost: the urn dissolves into her, erasing her borrowed-time identity and archiving her in an eternal present. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds; one tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each collected fragment layers until the kite rupture forces a pattern-break; the closing image of the lopsided kite reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost, satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pillars’ first bioluminescent chord images an undeniable conceptual cost—his death purchases an ongoing embassy. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each copper-wrapped branch thickens cross-kingdom density until twilight song. Orientation clean by line 4; no因果 breaks. Only the diary discovery at ≈25% edges toward convenient, but it is seeded by “loose stone” cue and repaid through root-system decoding, so deduction is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: patterned images (amber, bronze, rain) tighten until the final sentence reweights “homecoming” from geographic to cognitive. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “understanding would require them to remain luminous skeptics forever” crystallizes options and stakes with undeniable cost. No causality breaks; spatial/temporal anchors clear by line 10; orientation waiver applies because late disorientation is taught and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bridge drifts between dead reef and nascent garden, cost legible in “root by root, word by word,” reconfiguring hope under persistent chemical scarcity. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (calcified wheels, avian liturgy, cracked bedrock) deepens the stake of topsoil versus tide—yet the causality of the pods’ uptake is elided; we are asked to trust the submerged concord rather than seeing one pod rupture or fail, so the decisive change is conceptual, not witnessed. Orientation is taught early and waived; transitions within the single scene are fluid.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens: each salvage-scent layer tightens the stake of “translate absence into presence.” The cylinder→riddle→leaf chain is a single, coherent escalation; the wax disk’s final vibration reconfigures meaning with unmistakable cost. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no因果 breaks. Closure is a Charged Poise: night/dawn riddle answered, distance collapsed, song still spinning.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a crisp Charged Poise: the hatch reveals a new timeframe, the compass marks the coordinates, step is taken—cost paid in centuries of subjective isolation. The accumulative lens holds: star-smears tighten into a vector after beats of layered detail. No orientation debt; who/where/when are legible by 120 words. One causal micro-turn—the unmoving “fixed point” reframes her curse as cartographic gift—escalates and deepens the stake once, sufficient for 600–800 word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is unmistakable: the wrong sky fractures to blue, guardian dissolves, sundial ticks forward—Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure mounts through loaded object exchanges until the cadence shifts, not through because/therefore chains. Orientation lands by ~100 words with spire, violet glaciers, pocket lid. A single causal micro-gap: how starlight vial “unbroken promise” physically re-tunes constellations is elided, but the pattern holds. Persistent price (guardian freed, Kael alone) is legible on the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a textbook Conceptual Repricing: the three-minute shaft of pure sunlight makes the pawns’ absence legible to the crowd, reweighting the city’s narrative rule-set forever. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each spelled step and drifting penumbra thickens the texture until the pattern ruptures into undeniable light. Causality holds: because she walks LIBER/REMEMBER, because she cuts the cords, the ledger’s voice reaches the square and the eclipse briefly lifts. Cost is concrete—her lifelong protective penumbra of performed ambiguity burns off in public view.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Decisive Change under Accumulative/Textural lens: the act of seeding glyphs re-weights the entire mountain from graveyard to living syntax, with visible cost—the mercury body rings, shelves realign, thunder becomes promise. Causality is thematic rather than purely linear: nightly substitution fails → stone discovered → translation → seeding, each beat increasing pattern density until the spiral contracts. Orientation is taught early via the junction of staircases and the nightly ritual; no debt applied.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of thread/labyrinth matching intensifies density until the mirror reweights the premise. Orientation anchored by word 50; no debt. Closure—Earned Stasis with Charged Poise—lands on-page as thunder resumes and he decides to stay, carrying the empty labyrinth; cost is the irreversibility of time’s restart and his self-exclusion from court. No causal breaks; coincidence (mirror reveal) complicates rather than saves.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Kael’s sacrifice liquefies the Overseers’ monolith, turning “single truth” into proliferating possibility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each refracted echo thickens atmospheric stakes until the ritual loses anchorage. Causality is internal/lyric rather than event-based, but the before/after is unmistakable and the cost is on the page: “Kael felt their voice fading, becoming part of the bone itself.”

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue’s golden cracks crystallize meaning while the workshop sinks—cost is the platform and the spent charm, felt on-page. Causal chain holds: each pockmark touch releases gold → narrative completion → awakening. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within 120 words via acid sea, listing gears, memory-tank. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of crater-touching deepens stakes until final image reweights all prior damage as precious.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: leaving the painted shell in the sunbeam gifts its colors to the stone, reweighting loss into generative release. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of memory, object, and setting builds until the final image crystallizes “permanent impermanence.” Causality is interior but coherent: because he takes the wrong turn he finds the hidden chamber, therefore he can fulfill the promise. One minor orientation wobble: the chamber’s “impossible” sunbeam and flowers skirt physical rules without pre-cue, but the effect serves the lyrical closure so the Orientation Test is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of scent, light, and hush accumulates until the beam’s cadence shift reweights stakes. Closure is Charged Poise: the jasmine-scented sweep reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost—whisper replaces shout forever. Cost is legible in Elias’s “violence of his own quiet.” Orientation anchors (who/where/when) hit by line 3; no debt. One continuous scene; tightening lands at the lamp-room beat.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the station becomes an inward lighthouse, foreclosing external rescue under Accumulative/Textural lens. Each salvage step (censer locked, wire soldered, bronze thrumming) tightens the pattern; the final throb reweights earlier static into acknowledged grief. Causality holds without soft resets; the only marginal slip is the slightly late reveal that the midnight voice is no longer needed, but the prior circuitry work justifies her autonomy.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: find eye → must hide → ritual → silence achieved. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost—she can now lie by omission, witnessed by the unshared smile. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. One tight lens throughout. The textbook incantation is a motivated leap; still earns 8.6 because the price is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a textbook Resonant Reconfiguration: the raised hand crystallizes a Charged Poise that reweights thirty years of solitude into communal lineage, cost felt in the flower’s burning palm. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pattern of salt, mist, and negative space tightens until the absences themselves become the decisive image. No orientation drift; who/where/when anchored by word 40. Cause is clean: because she inherits the memory, therefore she accepts the watch. Persistent constraint—the beacon must always be manned—shapes final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Arthur steps into archivist of might-have-beens, brass chip locking with audible click—cost is the flood sealing the exit behind him. Causal chain holds: rain → ants → chip → door → choice, each because/therefore link legible. Orientation anchored by word 80; no lens ambiguity at end. Only keeps it from 9+: the creek-rise deadline is declared rather than shown tightening minute-by-minute on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the bleeding sky is re-sewn, crownless Elara claims a new vocation, cost is the permanent forfeiture of throne and former identity. Accumulative/textural lens holds—each image layer (bone throne, violet air, starlit pool) intensifies dread until the firefly counter-pattern re-weaves it; orientation anchored by word 80; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the shell now contains “Presence-Dense,” re-weighting every prior absence with undeniable cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ember, palette, pocket-suns) tightens until the whispered secret detonates the new element. Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“ember nexus”), well under the 120-word ceiling. No causality breaks; the shell’s rotation is the single decisive physical act that seals the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias lands on the porch having traded chronological certainty for narrative detachment, the cost legible in the “gentleness of a snowflake” touchdown that concedes fragility. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spiral of memory increases density until jealousy detonates into flight, a pattern taught early and paid off in the final image. One transition (cabin → air → cabin) is legible; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the screw’s journey from birthing clamp to clock innard reweights Mara’s vocation under the Accumulative/Textural lens—each water drop now carries “monument to transition.” Causality is lyric rather than event-driven; the pattern of occluded views taught in paragraph one pays off in the final fog-lift. Cost is felt in the vanished sense that can never be reclaimed, visible in her breath cycling condensation on the glass. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored by line four.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: held breath → quill ritual → scar-shed → manuscript → storm resumes. Each beat changes her physical options and the platform’s safety. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tea ceremony is now charged with the text of her survival, cost paid in permanent skin and imminent weather. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: an Earned-Stasis apology whose cost is the shattered bottle and the chainsaw roar that ends both orchard and haunting. Causal lens holds—every theremin tweak escalates because she needs the spirit solid enough to forgive—and the 660-word window fits Track A single-scene default. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear by line 3; no penalty applied. One minor slack: the “imperfect miracle” rule isn’t foreshadowed as something that can fail, so the reader can’t pre-feel the risk, but the final image still reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (blank page = spiral unification) and carries cosmic cost, satisfying RR/CR form. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: repeated spiral walks + definition dust accrete meaning until final reconfiguration. However, causality between circuits is weak—“with each circuit she read another entry” tells rather than shows tightening; no new option is foreclosed visibly on the page. Orientation is clear by sentence four, satisfying the 120-word test, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the horizon station’s purpose flips from calibrating sunset to witnessing the “razor edge of now,” cost paid by relinquishing the key. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each backward number adds density until silence pools, pattern breaks at “zero,” and meaning reweights. Orientation clean within 120 words: shepherd, granite platform, post-whistle moment. No causality breaks; hydraulic metaphors accumulate rather than solve.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the laser pointer placed button-out against the glass crystallizes the new rule—permeability as sight, not passage—charged with the emotional cost of relinquished control. Causal linkage holds: Eli’s arrival (because) forces Maya’s spatial gift to pivot from defense to recognition; her release (therefore) rewrites their relation and her vocation. The mushroom glow is not mere backdrop but the material premise that teaches the final image. No orientation debt; who-where-when anchors by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each subway shard and library beat thickens the pattern—randomness vs. calculation—until the mica-fractured flame reweights the stake. Orientation is clean within 120 words; transitions are legible. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “carrying contradictions like a lantern” makes the conceptual cost undeniable. One hairline slip: “theoretically rebellious” is stated before it is dramatized, a micro-delay in causality that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mosaic of wrong-number vignettes creates an accumulative pattern that lands in a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s loneliness exhaled but never attached. Closure is legible, yet because each call resolves by identical severance, the tightening is felt only as conceptual, not as a lost option for Mara herself; the cost is off-loaded onto unseen callers.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: grief-density steepens atmosphere until blooms respond, yielding a Charged Poise ending (“carrying the past gently… into whatever context came next”) with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift; twilight, jetty, archivist task clear by 50 words. Central weakness: no micro-turn that materially threatens failure; the “one crushed flower” rule is named but never tested, so the covenant’s regeneration feels pre-assured rather than earned. Closure lands as resonance, not decisive change, capping the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the rule of reciprocity flips when the child demands no payment, crystallizing Elias’s Earned Stasis—he remains guardian of the station but now inside the network, no longer outside it. Causal chain holds: rumor → confessions → inversion → cost (he receives the mercy he dispenses). Orientation is anchored by word 80 (“Platform 7,” “rusted water fountain”). No lens ambiguity; the final image reweights the premise with undeniable social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stillpoint silence reweights her future maps with undeniable conceptual cost (“all her future charts would bear the watermark”). Causal chain holds: ring dowsing → tone trail → stillpoint silence → self-mapping; each step narrows options. Orientation is taught early via tactile cues, satisfying the waiver. One minor causality wobble: the constellations “resuming” is off-page and could have been foreshadowed to sharpen the clock.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal lens holds: wrong seeds → recursive ships → pen-editing → release. Closure is Charged Poise: pen turns to dust, anomaly hums forgiveness, cost is the irreplaceable tool and the living memory of having bent time. Orientation is taught late (120+ words) but disorientation serves the payoff, so waiver applies. One causality hairline: “colony ships transmitted their gratitude” is off-stage; gratitude is not causal resolution, though the image still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a crystallized Charged Poise: the empty camera now “holds all the songs,” reweighting absence into presence with conceptual cost—he forfeits human remembrance. Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout; each empty shutter-click thickens the pattern until the final sign-language symphony reconfigures the stake. No causal gaps; even the unheard whispers are causally anchored via breath-fog and palm-vibration cues. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“weathered pier”) and remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the healed-yet-scarred portrait reweights every prior fire into invitation, cost legible in “tears cutting through soot.” Causal chain holds: burnings → silence → art → covenant revived. Mosaic structure (library ashes across three cities) is taught by the 25 % mark and spirals inward cleanly; transitions are dated by location, keeping orientation intact.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden figure dissolves, reweighting the stake—resurrection is impossible yet contact is real. Causal chain holds: drumming locates harmonic → climbs tower → summons apparition → failed permanence. Ventilation exhale as ticking clock is taught early and breaks the spell cleanly. Cost is visible in stinging palms and slumped surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the whispers outlast the dying loudspeaker, crystallizing the story’s rule-set with conceptual cost. Accumulated pattern—maps, coin, footfall code—tightens into the final image under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Spatial and temporal anchors are clear by line 6; no orientation debt. One minor causality gap: why the storm “amplifies everything except shouts” is asserted, not sourced, but the lyric frame lets it stand.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the guardian leaves the shutters in a star-map configuration, crystallizing stillwater tension with conceptual cost—future travellers may navigate by a pattern the guardian can no longer adjust. Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: each shutter tilt and mirror flash thickens texture until the darkness “learns” illumination, reweighting the stake without causal plot turns. Accumulation is coherent; pattern is taught early; cost is legible in the final relinquishing gesture. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear within 70 words; no ambiguity caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the Italian-Game constellation re-weights the town’s emotional field and Elias’s own solitude is sealed by the abandoned queen—cost is visible and felt. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each window placement adds density until the pattern breaks open a collective hesitation. Orientation is swift (cobalt library by line 3); no lens ambiguity. One minor scaffold: “humble rebellion…extend the game indefinitely” repeats the stakes sentence twice in closing paragraph, but it does not touch the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: tide-images, treaty after-image, and bone-warmth layer until the island’s spectral fold reweights meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara surfaces sovereign, scrimshaw fused, dock life foreclosed; cost is the literal inability to return (she watches the island vanish). Orientation clear by line 4; no因果 breaks. One micro-loop: “grace that belied her station” echoes later “grace that had always been…” without new pressure, −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the woman’s unmeasured exhale reweights the hush and the bird becomes breathable grief, cost legible in the splintered wood against her palm. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of theatrical elevation tightening to quiet release. Orientation is swift; turbine shadows mark time from line 1. No causal break; one shard, single POV, default scope met.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each paraphrased phrase thickens the quartz song and her dissolving form. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 120 words; cobalt atrium and frozen lake are immediately legible. Closure is a Charged Poise: she becomes the cloud-shadow poem itself—image reweights stakes with undeniable cost. No causality break; pattern taught early (paraphrase, dissolve, hush) pays off in final scatter-image.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: plant-dialogue pattern intensifies, reed insertion tightens stakes, and the reed’s song reweights meaning with felt cost—Marin’s voice returns, Elara forfeits her quest for color. Closure is a Charged Poise: both artists stand in reconfigured silence, options forever altered. No orientation debt; spatial anchors arrive within 90 words.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the Laboratory awakens, sound flows, her unauthorized path is validated—Conceptual Repricing with communal cost legible in “reaching every home.” Causal chain holds: lens reveals cracks → strike → harmonic cascade → system rewrite. Orientation is swift (who/where/when in first 60 words). Only minor quibble: the municipal algorithm’s goal is stated late, not tested, so the stakes tighten more by poetic accrual than by visible civic obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative lens holds: each origami left at gates, each stencil projected on the dome, adds density until the youth’s recognition reweights grief into cartography. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara folding a new crane while dawn stains the glass—where the cost is the endless repetition of her own wound as map for others; the price is legible in her stained fingertips that never stop moving.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of “one patient centimeter at a time” reweights the premise with undeniable methodological cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (ink map, skylight rhythm) tightens until the last line—though orientation is complete by word 60, satisfying the short window.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: she staggers out carrying “the weight of what she had learned,” path turned into a “scribble of defiance,” option-set permanently reconfigured.  Causal chain holds—random motion → pagoda opens → data burns clean → she exits unpatterned—each because/therefore step intact.  Orientation clear by 90 words; no teleporting props.  Minor wobble: “seventeen years” backstory delivered in block but it tilts present stance (why she risks bones), so passes BRR test.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the shadow’s re-binding to preservation reweights the entire premise—hope is no longer static innocence but the capacity of loss itself to carry light; cost is the decades of dream-drain that cannot be undone, only re-looped. Causal linkage holds: because Elara maps the stone’s descent, therefore she intuits the shadow’s identity; because she risks re-editing, the looped footage offers the shadow a mirror, whereupon it lifts the stone. The 120-word orientation anchor is met at word 32 (“blooming library above clouds”). Lens (Hybrid leaning Accumulative) is taught by the iterative footage comparisons and holds without ambiguity at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as earned stasis: she will testify and keep working—path foreclosed with persistent social/legal risk. Accumulative lens holds: each shed layer (gloves, apron, pendant) tightens the pattern until the chameleon’s calm green verifies the reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored within 120 w; no causal or spatial breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias abandons the quest for endings and accepts the displaced miracle as an open scar. The hourglass’s shattering and frost-binding image carries undeniable conceptual cost under the Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within 120 words; the single POV holds. No causality breaks; every beat (coffee-ring reading, tunnel descent, meteor cavern) tightens pattern rather than option, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensual detail and repeated “hushed thunder” cadence tighten until the beam of light itself is reweighted as the archive. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s notebook entry crystallizes options (she can now “release deposits”) at visible cost: she exits alone, carrying knowledge she cannot yet spend. Set-up anchors within 60 words; no orientation debt. Causality is interior and lyrical, appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each meteor adds density until the final cadence shift (“silver snow” descent) reweights the stake with felt cost. Closure is a Charged Poise—creativity returned, body marked—legible under the lens. One transition (walk → arch) is clean; orientation anchors by line 5. No causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: midnight’s spread crystallizes the dune and opens the archive, reweighting the premise from loss to preserved potential; cost is visible in Kael’s surrender of corporeal continuance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (lichen pulse, fractured lullaby) thickens until the final image reconfigures meaning. One causality gap: the archive’s exact gate-condition is announced late, slightly weakening setup tension, but the payoff is internally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: inserting the gear re-starts the heart-gear and re-weights the sixth-sense from storm to compass. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shard adds density until the final image crystallizes. Orientation is waived because disorientation is taught early and pays off in the acoustic-map epiphany. One minor scaffold: “probable miracle” is repeated without incremental charge, dulling the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early: silence layers like snow, each discovery thickens ideological weight. Orientation is swift; place, POV, covenant anchored well before 120 words. Closure is a Charged Poise—bolt re-sealed, silence chosen anew—cost felt in “frostbitten hope.” One minor causality slip: elders’ fear-pity reaction summarized rather than embodied, but it doesn’t breach the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each etched fragment coalesces into the rune that reweights reality; closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—the temple dissolves into myth, time resumes, and the titan’s humility is crowned by absence. Cost is legible when the crown clatters, too heavy for a head that never sought it.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of tidal tapping + data gaps tightens toward the insight that navigational memory, not coral death, erased the routes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—atlas page sent, tide indifferent—cost felt in the relinquished witness. One minor scaffold: two successive “periodically eternal” phrases could compress, but beats advance without causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira’s catalytic pulse reweights the rebellion’s future without declarative summation; cost is felt in her exposed stance "awkwardly tall among the ancient stones." Causal chain is lyric but traceable—star alignment → spoken trigger → pulse → new possibility. Orientation anchors within 120 words; no prop or knowledge teleporting. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of ruin/ancient persistence tightens until the cadence shift at dawn. Accumulation cap does not apply; closure untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the splitting amber and unfurling tendrils reconfigure “tradition” from stasis to adaptive pact, cost paid by the literal fracture of the pendant and the irreversible release. Accumulative lens holds: each sensory layer (steam, mineral gardens, kite script) deepens density until the final image crystallizes option shift. Causality remains intact—telepathic plant data stream motivates every move; no coincidences resolve the conflict. Orientation anchored by word 60 with “steaming terraces” and timeline “fifteen years after” keeps geography and chronology legible.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the folded photo returns as open, reweighting survival from armor to deliberate witness; cost is the fresh vulnerability etched in “breath came deep and even.” Accumulative lens holds—each sensory layer (wind frequency, copper taste, soil grit) tightens the stake until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation anchored by word 60; no prop or motif teleports. Single beat of deepening suffices for 750-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (“because” she can’t paint faces she flees; “therefore” she untangles threads; “because” threads ignite she gains a new lamp) tightens options until the descent reconfigures her stance. The trapdoor appearance is the single soft coincidence, but it complicates rather than resolves. Closure lands with conceptual cost: she accepts perpetual wall-closing and carries the ache as lantern. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: eclipse→ink→fractal→dissolution tightens through density, not causal plot.  Anchors clear by line 3; orientation test waived because spatial vagueness (where in desert?) pays off in dissolution.  Closure = Charged Poise: tracker gone, drone left holding memory—undeniable conceptual cost.  One scaffold (“the wind howls…”) repeats near end but does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: discovery → moral crisis → upload → alarm → held breath. Closure is a Charged Poise: “seeds” reweights the frozen archive, undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation achieved by word 88; no disorientation taught, but early anchoring suffices for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each returned object (ballast, pistol, blade) re-weights meaning until the final image of “tranquil blaze” crystallizes Earned Stasis with visible cost—the pistol unused, the dome cracking, her father’s calculus sheathed forever; no causal leaps, no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the goddess echo is captured yet the sky is “blank as a fresh page,” a felt conceptual cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strictly because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early (garden responds to intention) and holds to the final transliteration. No orientation debt; who/where/when are anchored within 120 words. One meaningful tightening—“the patterns were breaking themselves”—reweights stakes satisfactorily.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal lens holds: fake comet orbit → contradiction discovered → correction drafted → inheritance willfully sacrificed. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 30; no orientation debt. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the wax-sealed correction letter reweights the Vane empire’s entire rule-set with undeniable social cost. The only micro-slips are a slight over-reliance on abstract summary in the paragraph that lists “increasingly elaborate denials,” but this does not touch the decisive final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: letters → temporal breach → amber anchor → shoulder-touch collapses regret. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—time folds, the younger self turns, guilt is repriced—yet the cost is conceptual (timeline rewrites) rather than a tangible loss shown on the page, keeping it just shy of 9-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens held throughout: each sensory accretion (chalk dust, tile heat, sand spiral) reweights the stake until the silence crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise: the tile crumbles, the grotto exhales, and Mara’s breathing synchronizes with the new pattern—cost is the irretrievable dust of both tile and mandala. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 3. No causal gaps; every escalation is a density shift rather than a plot twist, fitting the lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the act of fitting the chip renames the plaza and reweights the entire moral calculus under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; causality is interior but legible. Persistent constraint—the retrocyclic visions—shapes the final quiet act.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layered aria-echoes intensify density until the coin catch reweights both fates.  Orientation is swift—the Rialto back wall, night, maze within ~60 words.  Closure is a Charged Poise: Mara exits toward possible futures, Julian folds into cinnamon–velvet stasis, coin abandoned as persistent price.  No loops, no causal breaks; the splintered-time device is taught early and paid off visually.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each pill-finding beat layers density until the spirals revealed in the long-exposure reweight the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the cooling geode + light-paintings crystallize "connection without pills" with undeniable conceptual cost. One transition (studio → building sweep) is legible; no orientation debt. Causality stays intact: because she trusts body-resonance, therefore she finds the spiral pattern, therefore she can finish the recall.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden flare records accumulated feeling, Kael’s stance crystallizes as archive-voice, and the cost is the solitary burden forever borne. Causality is lyric-accumulative, not reversal-driven; each heat-map layer deepens density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift (who/where/when by line 3). One lens ambiguity: the fossil’s “heartbeat” is poetic license not signaled as either metaphor or real tech—doesn’t rupture closure but keeps the piece just shy of 8+ purity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: upward-falling sand and reshaped cliffs reweight the prophecy with undeniable cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is anchored by word 50; the button-catalogue pattern is taught early and pays off when the jar shatters, reconfiguring meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the arrow pressed into snow reconfigures both network and soul with visible forfeiture of her last secret. Causal chain (trail codes → recognition → mutual surrender → new codes) holds under a single continuous scene. Orientation anchor beats the 120-word mark cleanly; no lens ambiguity. Cost is unmistakable in the empty hands / mended soul paradox, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush after gutter-tick cessation crystallizes permission to cross, reweighting all prior waiting into one resonant moment of agency. Cost is felt in decades of layered vows and the storm-won silence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout; each sensory beat adds density until the final image simplifies to “absolute, crystalline permission.” No causality or orientation breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early via overlapping timelines and holds to the final Charged Poise: the lantern glass left behind reweights every prior image. Orientation locks by line 5; the single deepening at the hive stand tightens stakes without forced reversals. Closure cost is legible in the glass abandoned and the path foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse beam’s first sweep re-weights the bitting gauge from keepsake to public instrument, crystallizing her shift from private grief to guardianship. Causal chain is clean—petal drop → row → climb → calibration → beam—each beat foreclosing retreat. The 20-year backstory fragment is anchored to the present tactile cue of cold metal and immediately tilts her decision to climb. No orientation drift; spatial logic holds from fire escape to breakwater ladder.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hovering sundial and pulse-shift from hum to heartbeat reconfigure Mira’s isolation into chosen solitude with undeniable conceptual cost (she foregoes the hope of physical return). Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout: imagistic density (cloud-ocean, coral shelves, coherent light) tightens until the final cadence reweights the stake. Causality is internal but coherent—each reflective paragraph is anchored to a present tactile cue and alters her next move. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no teleporting props or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the nest-sculpture becomes a public heart, foreclosing ghostwriting solitude forever; cost is felt in the scattering of twigs and the lovers’ now-shared署名空白.
    Causal chain holds: storm → found nest → recognition → art → return → speech; no off-stage shortcuts.
    Orientation is crystal by line 30; only mild lens wobble mid-story when the drive briefly veers from causal to lyrical accumulation before re-anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: because she maps the pulsar peak, therefore she rigs the sub-20 Hz counter-signal; because she overdrives the transmitter, the town wakes. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost—sparks, rattling coffee cups, building nearly in two places at once. Orientation is crisp within 50 words; only nitpick is the 17-minute ticking clock is named once and never tracked, softening urgency. Cost is undeniable in the final image of her slumped against the scorched console.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal chain is clean: organ tremor → walls freeze → she strikes → gears lock → key freed; the 12-hertz countdown supplies concrete, dwindling optionality, and the closure beat (“she had pierced the heart of the mutiny…”) explicitly reweights the premise with conceptual cost—liberation through exactitude, not force.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the ribbon’s weave reweights the case and Elara’s empathy revives—visible cost is the emotional thaw on the last line. Causal chain holds: ribbon analysis → sketch → recognition of witness; no off-stage cheats. Orientation is swift (quarry rim, damp notebook, dawn). One micro-turn suffices for this length; lens stays Accumulative/Textural and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive’s silence breaks under Mara's recovered coordinates, irreversibly rewriting history. Causal chain holds—decoded stanzas → live reading → transmitted correction—each step because/therefore. Copper nail anchors physical evidence; exile is reversed conceptually, geography denied. Cost is legible in Elara’s fungal trek and professional risk; lens stays causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each flutter, pixel, and note thickens density toward the Charged Poise finale where the flake dissolves and silence becomes bridge. Orientation anchored by scenic pullout <120 w; no causal turns required under this lens. Closure—fiddle raised, silence foreclosed—carries felt cost in the bleeding fingers and dissolved flake. Persistent constraint: the scaffold remains as literal footing for future bridges.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the realization that “circling back meant coming home with new eyes” re-weights every prior extraction—father’s highway, VC rounds, circus train—into a single spiral pattern. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of currency images and lion/rust motifs tightens until the final image crystallizes options without causal sleight-of-hand. Persistent constraint—the inherited need to extract value—shapes every tactic; cost is unmistakable in the act of leaving the sanctuary at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: “we survive… by sharing them” reweights the premise with social cost. The accumulative lens (pattern of grief → star pulse → inscription) holds; one tightening beat at the telegram gesture suffices. Orientation anchored by word 90; no causality breaks; meets mosaic shard count but transitions remain fluid under the lyric drive.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the lake’s spin reverses, orchard settles, and Elara’s stance shifts from warlike serenity to “simple peace” with the ash of the spent seed as felt price. Causal chain (mirror-trick failure → vortex → stillness) holds under the Accumulative lens; each widening circle is a beat that reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the clipping’s dissolution crystallizes options—dream-paths now negotiable—while time-pressure (“until full dark”) keeps cost legible. Causal chain holds: clipping→blood→glade→scar-circuit→node entry. One minor causality fuzz: how Kael instantly intuits “covenant isn’t broken” isn’t foreshadowed, but the line reweights stakes rather than breaks them.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: roots fuse him into the orchard, reweighting grief from erasure to stewardship; cost is the lifetime immobility implied in “became part.” Causal chain holds—card return → descent → offer → binding—each because/therefore legible under dying amber half-light. One soft spot: the barter rule (swap destinies) is announced by texts, not dramatized beforehand, but the tree’s acceptance on-page pays the debt. Orientation is anchored by line 3, well under 120-word cap.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Marcus affirms the fake, irreversibly foreclosing his hard-won credibility; cost is legible in the boy’s exhale and Marcus’s own recognition of lifelong echo. Causal lens holds—because he failed publicly, because the cloth revives unbearable memory, therefore he chooses mercy, narrowing future options. Orientation clear by 80 words; no teleporting props. One minor loop: “failure had come last Tuesday” repeats essence of prior sentence; doesn’t touch climax.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a crystalline Conceptual Repricing: Elias becomes the word, dissolving with visible aurora-cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds—each magnetic, textual, and biological layer thickens until the seed-pattern rewrites the gardener. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no debt. Causality is internal but coherent: because he translates, therefore he can finally read the grammar of dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: crystalline records hum while the librarian freezes, tide lapping—a legible after-state with conceptual cost (wonder fixed, wandering ended). Accumulative lens holds: pattern of tidal/moon returns tightens to final image. Orientation is taught early by concrete tidal rhythm; no penalty. One causal leap—how gear-grind persuades identities—is elided, but the lyric contract accepts it.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the delete-key refusal and pearl-crowning reconfigure her official duty into subversive custodianship with lasting professional risk; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, the spatial/temporal anchors are clear by word 100, and the final image multiplies her silhouette with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the taped accordion holds, the rain keeps falling, and the decision to visit the coordinates tomorrow is crystallized with undeniable emotional cost—“raw solace—uncomfortable, unmedicated, true.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each catalogued decay item and graffiti line thickens the sediment of guilt until the chord reweights it. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. The Fremont Cut reveal is motivated ellipsis that tightens, not ruptures, the forward current.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early (“silence propagated through its corridors”) and held to the last line, where the mist’s acceptance of her documentation reweights the rules. Orientation is clean: who (veiled dreamer), where (threshold of glowing library), when (six-hour window between letters) all appear before 120 words. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s silence is now hers to shape, and the cost is the backward-draining life she must now live as the new archivist.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: each image (ice, coffee, roots) layers density until the final cadence when the violin dissolves and meaning re-weights. The decisive change—the instrument’s physical loss but mnemonic survival—lands with visible cost: her “particular sorrow of mulberry stain” is the lingering price. Pattern taught early (coffee prophecy) pays off in closure without causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the piece teaches its lyric pattern early (aurora = soul-residue) and holds it to the final image where the emerald pulse syncs with the lights—Charged Poise achieved. Orientation is swift: who (Elara), where (floating grotto), when (night of a new arrival) all land inside 50 words. The closure beat (“the dancer was gone… but the pattern remained”) reweights the premise with conceptual cost: immortality of pattern, not person. Minor causality gap: no on-page obstacle or alternative path is ever risked, so the tightening is atmospheric rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared by twilight wine-press cadence; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—burial of pin spawns silver sapling, reweighting sorrow into nurture. Causality is thematic, not literal, yet the final image makes the cycle’s cost undeniable. Orientation anchored by word 60; single-scene default met. No meaningful tightening mid-piece; escalation is slow density, but one deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure: Elias unhooks the cloak—Decisive Change with felt cost (toxic stain transferred, lens of work permanently altered). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chime cadence and mirror resonance reweight the premise from absolution-sale to ambiguity-sale. Hook-to-mist image sequence is one continuous scene, <800 words, single POV; orientation clear within 60 words. No causal break; persistent constraint (hollow shard’s hum) shapes final tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each synesthetic image layers density until the final Charged Poise reweights the premise—he vanishes, but the questions stay, magnetized. Pattern taught in first 120 words; orientation never wavers. Closure line “waiting for the right hands to throw the right stones” crystallizes options and cost without exposition. No causal breaks, no soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: stillness becomes navigation, pulse finds rest, cost is the eternal burial itself. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of echo, dust, and bone layers reweights meaning rather than causal chain. Orientation is taught late but pays off—disorientation is the point—so Orientation Test waived. Pattern of birds→arrowhead→stillness is legible, though beat-to-beat linkage is more lyrical than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: Elias’s vanishing reconfigures the spire’s meaning from perfect machine to haunted relic, cost legible in the keystone’s snow-melt warmth and the rescuers’ blank registry. The accumulative/Textural lens holds: each mist-glow pulse and unstrapping tightens the pattern until the final image crystallizes options. Orientation is secured by word 80; no lens ambiguity. Only a fractional causality wobble: the gantry “dissolves into frost” is poetic but instant, slightly dulling the physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the tuning fork’s violet bloom reweights every prior lamp-tending act as covert preparation. The causal chain—key tag → air-pocket ballroom → chromatic resonance theorem → sky-lantern chord—tightens neatly; no off-stage leaps. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (harbor lamp, pier, dusk) so the waiver applies; disorientation is functional, paid off when lantern light becomes the spectral chord. Persistent constraint: the flooded chamber can never be shared; that irreversible isolation charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the universe unfolds because Elena’s adjustment propagates backward—cost is the permanent fossilization of her doubt. One causal jump (coins → distortion coefficient → phase lock) is legible under a Hybrid lens. Orientation is taught early by ambered deck and reversed grammar; no caps apply.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: naming the fears crystallizes them into new constellations, reweighting his eternal task. Causal chain holds—recordings → atlas → scattered light → named monuments → changed vocation. One transition (dusk→night) is legible. Cost is visible: atlas dissolves, intimacy remains untouchable. Could edge higher if the sacrificed astronomers’ dissolve had looped back to constrain his final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens declared by second paragraph and held: drip cadence → bell resonance → tide memory. The 1460-drop count pays off as the exact trigger for the first seep, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration with undeniable conceptual cost—she has exchanged infinite mornings for an unfinished ocean. No causality breaks; orientation anchored within 70 words.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    A solid Accumulative/Textural arc: drought-expose photos-label-archive. Each new artifact tightens the ethical pressure without external reversals. Closure lands cleanly—archive plan reweights meaning and carries civic cost. However, the causality hinge is internal reflection, not a tested on-page choice; visible price is deferred to future readers, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the lens of “mystery as legitimate variable” reweights her entire equation with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural pattern (starling murmuration → spiral geometry → flame release) is taught early and tightens once through density shift. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no penalty. Persistent constraint: the crystal’s non-melting logic shapes every tactic and is visibly re-weighted in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: static silence → visual contact → buckle tweak → canopy bloom → safe snap, each step tightening options. Orientation locks by line 5; the 17-minute clock supplies urgency and the closing image (warm metal) pays off the opening cold bite. Closure is decisive—trust preserved, risk paid—though the micro-fracture check is a hair under-motivated as the cause of the three-degree shift.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fused self steps to the rock’s edge, fear and aliveness co-present, history stabilizing—cost is the now-empty jar turning to dust and the irreversible return of feeling. Causal linkage holds: because she vivifies the duplicate, therefore she reclaims emotion and the dojo stabilizes. Orientation is taught by line 5 (“floating rock dojo… below her, the world fractured”), waiving any penalty. No lens ambiguity; the piece stays situational-accumulative to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bud’s putrid potential reframes her entire design philosophy with visible stakes (“only escape came through surrendering to the storm”). Causal chain is thin—seed arrival unexplained, no resistance after planting—yet the accumulative pattern of mirrored bloom/innovation holds. Orientation is swift; single transition (night → three weeks later) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the laughter that breaks the dam is not a miracle but the audible proof that grief has been ground into something nutritionally useful. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; each pull of the cord thickens the atmosphere until silence itself becomes a wet pulp that can be re-shaped. The cost is legible in the dissolution of Elias’s own spectral body—he gives up the last relic of his living self to become “indistinguishable from the air.” Orientation is taught early and paid off: the hourglass grain cues the tunnel, the tunnel cues the house, the house cues the laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pendant reprise → mist absorption → inward architecture builds density reweighting “home” from answer to question. Closure is clean Charged Poise: final curl refuses召唤, reconfigures guardian as “native of the in-between.” Orientation firm by paragraph 2; transitions are lyric cadence shifts, legible. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical; persistent constraint (ache as hospitality) is declared, not dramatized—just sub-9 barrier.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each failed approximation thickens the stake until the lattice bloom reconfigures both object and self. Closure is a Charged Poise—the crystallized crozier refracts possibility back onto Marcus—cost is legible in the irrevocable loss of the original relic and the dangerous weight of future he now must carry. Pattern taught early (iteration, heat, twilight) pays off in the final silent “penny drop,” no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: perigee → fragment warms → she inverts gain → hush sings → cosmic birth-death imprint captured. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost: the city’s abandoned rig becomes the only viable receiver once silence is accepted as signal. Orientation clear by 120 wds; lens stays Causal throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias accepts endless limbo as the price for saving the passengers, the empty hourglass now “filled with ordinary dust”—a legible conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: radio tuning → starlight bridges → passenger merger → clocks re-align. The grotto’s rules are taught early through sensory cues (“memories floated like sediment”) and never contradicted. One minor micro-turn suffices at this length; no orientation debt or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gallery unfolds into the city and Elara becomes its tissue—cost is conceptual but legible. Causality is accumulative/textural; each stitch deepens pattern rather than forcing because/therefore turns. The piece teaches its disorientation early and the payoff image holds. One paraphrase loop late (“the unsettling calm persisted…”) slightly dulls the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the chain link becomes a literal sighting key that authorizes departure, reweighting its symbolic harbor-anchor meaning to gateway-key with a felt conceptual cost—abandoning the submerged city. Causal chain holds: geometry prediction → convergence sighting → slate coordinates → launch order. Occasional expository lumps (“they had found intelligent life…”) pause momentum without altering options. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the photograph settles on the basement floor, simultaneously ending the archive and beginning Thomas’s life above-ground—undeniable cost for both siblings of the case. Causal chain holds: curiosity → pulse trace → basement discovery → assurance → ascent. One soft spot: “he keeps the files in the basement” arrives as disembodied whisper with no prior cue that Thomas is alive, a micro-coincidence that slightly dilutes the because/therefore lens. Still, the final image reweights every prior beat under the inferred causal lens without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Mara steps into phase transition, witnesses the researchers complete migration, and exits bearing the silence—undeniable conceptual and emotional cost. Causal chain holds: gold fleck reveals path → she enters → offers beacon → tide turns → she alone emerges. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within 50 words and stay legible. No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural pattern taught early (tidal rhythm, phase talk, refracted light) crystallizes in the final “crashing hush” image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each frozen-ink dendrite adds density until the lattice itself becomes the actuator of closure. The porcelain-ink-moonlight circuit is a taught pattern that pays off when the beam reorders the ghost—visible Decisive Change with material cost (blood on shard). Orientation is anchored by word 50; no causality breaks. Cost is legible: “she finally stopped counting at one hundred and twelve,” a conceptual repricing of her former compulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as charged poise: the diamond’s curse is redirected into the canyon, language converted to permanent texture-echo, storyteller left voiceless but successful. Causal chain (bird pattern → tonal key → sympathetic resonance → fracture → release) holds without gaps. Orientation anchored by word 40; no lens ambiguity. Cost is unmistakable—“her copper veins dimming in the twilight of the last word.”

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena’s human path is foreclosed when stone fuses to sternum and the cavern seals. Causal chain—arrowhead heats → garden blooms → body lightens → exit closes—carries visible cost under a Hybrid lens that ends in Accumulative cadence shift. Orientation is taught early via gravity-play; no teleporting props. One micro-turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard’s geometry dissolves, statues dream, bridge sings— undeniable reconfiguration with conceptual cost (she walks east carrying dust, path foreclosed). Causal chain holds: heartbeat-music → root-rupture → guardians stall. Orientation is clean by line 6; no lens ambiguity. One minor causality bump: the statues’ sudden hand-raising to catch blossoms is not prefigured, but reads as miracle earned by sonic infiltration.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: absence patterns tighten until the storm bottle ruptures them. Closure is Earned Stasis—Marek slips away having spent the storm and the promise, foreclosing any larger uprising. Orientation is swift: “cobalt arcade… twilight” locates us by word 6; no penalty. The drone wobble → letter drop → bottle dimming sequence is a legible causal chain under the chosen lens, with the bottle’s depletion as visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of hush → chime → mist → song layers density until the final cadence reweights silence as generative. Orientation anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. Closure is Charged Poise: fragment hums, light scatters like seeds—conceptual cost (he must now act). One shard/one scene, within length. No meaningful tightening beyond the single song-beat, but the cadence shift suffices for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece teaches its hyperbolic-fold pattern early and lands a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the scarf re-animates the dormant narrative and Elena re-emerges in “observed solitude,” a charged poise that reweights her earlier isolation into custodial duty. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each lyrical spiral adds density until the geometry literally delivers the story-entity. The only minor waver is that the grandmother’s voice ventriloquizes the library collective, blurring exact agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the dream is not possessed but re-homed, reweighting the rule-set—absence becomes presence without domestication. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stroke of light thickens the pattern until the final cadence shift (“luminous absence made manifest”) reconfigures meaning. Causality is intact: sunrise timing, palette chemistry, and whisper-pressure tighten options beat by beat. Cost is felt in the hush after the islands fall silent—Elara’s renunciation of possession forecloses future pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the nexus geometry reconfigures so roads now lead to “potentials,” a conceptual repricing paid for by the empty ribbon and the poet’s irrevocable absence. Causal chain holds—star-hint → disorienting spin → fear loses grip → idea freed—without lapse. Orientation is taught late (120-word line crossed) but the disorientation pays off by making shadows stumble, so waiver applies; still, the slight delay keeps it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the ring disgorges Lila and withers, a decisive reversal of the 1994 theft with a felt 30-year cost visible in Elena’s mud-caked knees and the rusted greenhouse. The causal spine holds: because Elena mapped the Spica/compass pattern, she could break the cycle; the “understanding its true pattern” rule is taught early and paid off. One minor stretch: the compass appears only in the final paragraph, satisfying the pattern but lacking prior tactile seeding. Still, the lens stays causal, the Virgo-broken-glass image reconfigures meaning, and the ending beat carries undeniable conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a pristine Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s dust and the stilled swing reweight every prior beat under the Accumulative lens. The tea-leaf geometry pattern is taught early, returns twice, and its final spiral justifies the non-shatter decision with on-page cost (Elara’s forward walk, the swing’s silence). Causality is clean: because the leaves show survival potential, therefore the exile is extended until the shadow chooses readiness. No orientation debt; transitions are legible within the single-scene default.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rainbow sapling roots across realms, reweighting wonder’s survival with conceptual cost (“guard the boundary where magic insists upon remaining real”). Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the lens holds. One soft spot: the gray lands’ encroachment is declared, not demonstrated, weakening the tightening midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared early and held: each unknotted spirit layers silence into Mira’s mask until she crystallizes as the vessel. Orientation is taught rather than explicit—prism sanctuary, obsidian table, starlight blades—but the pattern is coherent and pays off in the final stillness. Closure is a Charged Poise: the silence settles, options reconfigure, cost is felt. One minor slip: the “sharing of their secret” timeframe is announced but never visibly tightens decisions; it functions as ambient confession rather than causal clock.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as an Earned Stasis: the deliberate refusal to repair the tear reweights the entire quest, costing her the satisfaction of “completion” while honoring the chapel’s silence. Causal chain holds—cut fiber → marginalia → film comparison → subsidence → reopening → renunciation—each beat narrowing options under a Causal lens. Cost is legible in the final image of the torn map that stays “deliberately so,” a persistent constraint memorialized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Julian surfaces having chosen transfer, not salvage, and the cost—leaving the globe’s copper ghost below—is explicit. The causal spine (Earhart funding → Demeter dive → globe resonance → letting go) holds; the single 1939–present time-cut is legible, and orientation is anchored by 120 words via depth, rebreather, tilted shelves.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the ghost’s apology becomes physical graffiti that reweights the courtyard as living memory. Causal chain holds: plate→receptacle→dust→walls speak. Orientation is taught early (“misty courtyard above clouds”) and pays off in the final map. One minor causality tremor: the “map to other courtyards” appears without prior plant, but it functions as Charged Poise rather than deus ex machina. Cost is legible in the fading note and Elara’s departure into further exile.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each ascending floor layers sensory density until the fractured goggles/diary decode reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara stands between cloud and stratosphere wearing cracked goggles like a crown, cost legible as inherited vigilance. The diary’s light-lock is convenient (no prior hint of spectral cipher), but the pattern is taught early by the cracked lenses refracting sun, so causality holds. Orientation is swift; scaffold minimal, ending image reconfigures stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the void “remembers,” the twine-archive trails into nothing, and we feel conceptual cost (she chooses drift over return). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds from first cumulus catalog to final knot. No Orientation penalty: who/where/when clear by c. 80 words. One accumulation cap applies: reflective blocks edge ~22-25% but stay anchored to present stimuli; a single micro-cut would tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pigment stroke layers density until the dawn light reframes the mural as prophecy. Closure is Charged Poise—she carries “the sky within her,” a conceptual repricing that fuses tree, art, and self at the moment of erasure. Causality intact: coin grooves → pigment → sky mirror → renunciation. No orientation debt; “hollowed heart of the Great Oak Library” anchors by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the airship’s bones re-set, Elara whispers thanks, the map is now inside her—conceptual cost (solitude confirmed, path fixed). Causal chain holds: dog-ear → hopscotch cipher → murmuration validation → route locked. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens drift. A hair’s-breadth shy of 9 because the cost is felt but not painful.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: broken sky-clock → climb → find prophecy → uncap vial → gears re-activate; each “because” tightens options until the mirrors’ rotation physically enacts the Decisive Change. Orientation is anchored by line 3; the final image reweights the premise with visible cost—the empty vial and thawing library—so closure lands. Minor waver: the prophecy scraps function more as atmospheric key than as causal pivot, but they still gate access to the mirror hall.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the nebula blooms overhead, reweighting every prior loss into collective stewardship. Causal chain (chalk → moisture → ionized barrier) holds; the watering bell’s return in the final dust-message tightens the loop with felt cost. One soft spot: “she reexamined the settlement's original star charts during lunch” compresses a causally necessary beat into off-stage summary.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is declared by nested-pattern imagery and holds: each lyrical recurrence tightens the cadence toward hush. Closure lands as Charged Poise—silver stardust, gears stopping—reweighting existence itself with visible cost. Orientation is taught immediately: lone adjuster, hidden lighthouse, dusk. One causality hiccup: the pane-of-hush barrier is introduced late (≈50%) yet treated as if it constrained earlier beats, shaving 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands in a perfect Charged Poise: the glowing corridor freezes into a lethal spectacle while the travelers’ safety is secured, leaving Elara in resigned vigil. Causal chain—blueprint → nut geometry → frost activation → saved strangers—holds without gaps; the off-screen brother loss is retro-motivation, not resolution. Time anchor (“three hours”) and geography (“eastern cave mouth”) are fixed before word 120; no orientation debt. Cost is felt in the final image: she sits amid her own trap, already dreading tomorrow’s dismantle.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: river foam, monarch shell, and musical motifs layer until a single cadence shift (“I hear it now”) reweights grief into memory. Orientation is anchored by word 60; causal logic is loosened but coherent under lyric accumulation. Closure lands as Charged Poise with clear conceptual cost—she departs to synthesize a forgiving polymer—so the non-closure accumulation cap is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: pattern of measured absences builds to the doorway incision and a resonant reconfiguration—she abandons parole and cart. Closure carries conceptual cost (she dissolves into narrative silence), yet the causal jump from “quantifying absence” to literal slit in reality is lightly hand-waved, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative / textural lens holds: tidal-pool pattern → pavilion dig → consommé of acceptance. Orientation is swift, the single shard obeys scope, and closure lands with Conceptual Repricing—gloves abandoned, dunes re-bury the emptied repository. Cost is legible in the evaporated salt stains, though the causal link between “tasting” and “neutralising millennia of regret” is asserted rather than staged, a hairline slip at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.1)
    The closure is a clean Decisive Change: the final clang locks the elevators in permanent solidarity, cost paid in her exhaustion and the irreversible mechanical covenant. Causal linkage holds throughout—weight descent → harmonic transmission → elevator arms move → talks resume—under a tight Accumulative lens that lands with audible finality.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the broken mirror becomes a “crown of jagged possibilities” and Elena descends carrying the city’s unlived futures—cost is the loss of her prior self. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore; pattern is taught early (“synaptic plasticity could be forced”) and pays off in the final image. Orientation is clear by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Non-closure accumulation: one soft reset—no physical or relational price is shown on-page after the hippocampus “edit,” only metaphorical grandeur.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: gravity window → threshold crossing → pattern-lock → codes revealed → seed theft, each step because/therefore. Closure is a Charged Poise: she gains the codes but carries a live sentinel kernel, a reconfiguration with future cost that satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the sub-cello groan reweights the Hush, felt cost is the tear that falls on the crack she has just stroked. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each fracture read adds density until the porcelain node vibrates. Orientation is clean—grove, dawn, frost named by line 4. Hedgehog cue/uncurl logic holds and pays off in the last line’s temporal hinge. Causality is intact: because she listened to every wound, therefore the tree consents to speak.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens: pressure mounts through pattern breaks (magnetic vectors, color shift to violet, stone fracture) that reweight the stake from victory to redefinition of beauty. Closure is a Charged Poise: the eclipse totality freezes the board in a new configuration; the covenant is not restored but re-priced—the cost is the visible crack in the stone and the irreversible loss of the “win” paradigm. Causality remains internal and coherent; no external coincidences intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the clasp’s sigh reweights the entire metaphor system—peace is no longer absence but attuned resonance—at visible emotional cost (“tears of theatrical sincerity” and the blank page waiting to record forgiveness). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: every sensory layer (cordite, whale-bone table, hertz numbers) tightens toward the single cadence shift when 4.5 Hz clicks the lock. No orientation drift; who/where/when is anchored within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a CR: the corpse-flower paradox reweights her premise—mimicry of rebirth, not death—cost is conceptual but legible. Causal chain is thin: doodle-map leads → hollow → plant; no obstacle or false turn tightens options. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Lens stays Accumulative/Textural: pattern of scent, doodle, sway; final stillness reconfigures meaning. One tightening suffices, but escalation is more texture- than choice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the broken arrow tip’s harmonic is now stored in her console, making her the carrier of a memorial technology that re-weights every future terraforming mission. Causal lens holds: every beat (clamping to arch, tracking up-flowing water, touching the stone) is linked by therefore/because logic; the cost is the irreversible fusion of machine and memory that ends her detachment as neutral observer. No orientation drift; anchors (who, where, gravitational phase) are fixed in the first 90 words and paid off when the same waterflow reverses to lower her home.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the fog’s “predictable spirals” reweight the entire maze—Chen died because these containers angled exactly so. Causal chain holds from rupture → wind shear → ignition; the patch’s thermal escape is the final, legible fluke. Orientation is clean within 120 words; no teleporting props. Cost is felt in the whisper she now hears—foresight bought with a man’s life.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    The causality chain holds: sculptor’s strike → bell resonance → global awe-data → Council defeat, each link visible. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: wonder is now “encoded in the electromagnetic field,” a legible conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by line 50; the south-cut to Carrara is an ellipsis, not a break. One minor slip: the amber sheet dissolving is mentioned after the fact, softening the final beat’s tactile immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the “true peace” is legibly different from the earlier suffocating hush because the canyon’s sigh is released through her paid-for stitch-work. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—each image layer reweights the stake until the final cadence shift. Cost is visible in the last line: the instrument is retired, keeper’s role foreclosed. No orientation debt; driftwood compass is taught by 120-word mark.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    The halo transposition delivers a decisive conceptual change: the cartographer’s structured grief liquefies into measurable emotion, the equation is completed, and the last star vanishes—undeniable CR with cost. Causal linkage holds: because Elara steals the journal page, therefore empathy floods and the theorem locks. No orientation debt; anchor (who/where) arrives by line 4. Persistent constraint—the halo’s glow—shapes every subsequent tactic and the final darkened image.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the ridgeway walk deepens through iterative pauses until the garden erupts, reconfiguring the routine into legend. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias walks on, jittery no more, the glowing garden persisting as conceptual cost. Causality is lyric rather than tight, but pattern holds and cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative lens is declared early and held: each sensory layer (quartz, frost, prism, mist) tightens the texture until the final sublimation reweights the stake. Closure is a clean Charged Poise—car window now “lighter,” her chest filled with weighted silence—cost is felt without exposition. No causal leaps; every image is set up and paid off inside the 760-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the completed border lifts, the bead departs, Maya becomes thread—an image that reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality holds: because she bleeds, the puzzle binds; because she unravels herself, the message flies. The loom’s rule is taught early and paid at the end; no late rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a crystal-clean Charged Poise: the arches hum anew, shoots pierce ash, and Elara stands emptied yet reconfigured—cost made legible in the vanished silk and her empty hands. Causal chain (silk→vault→forge-hammer→root-resonance) holds without teleportation; the mine route is pre-mapped and recalled. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) is secure by line 4. Lens stays situational-accumulative throughout and reweights stakes in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each parallel fragment layers sensory grief until the pattern breaks into earned stasis; the green shard’s dissolution into her palm is the resonant reconfiguration that forecloses reversal, with the weight of silence legible as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of stones, glass, ghosts, and silence thickens until the jar-cairn crystallizes a Charged Poise—safety purchased by permanent muteness. Anchors (who/where/when) settle by line 5; the flicker-out lamp is the taught disorientation that later pays off in the phosphorescent dawn image. Closure lands with unmistakable conceptual cost: she chooses to guard the silence itself, foreclosing speech for good. No因果 breaks; every repetition tightens the same stake.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a crisp CR: the textured dawn costs Kael the imprisoned darkness he carried—conceptual price is legible in “rustle of turning pages.” Accumulative pattern (laughter → hymn → wind) holds from first to last sentence; disorientation is deliberate and pays off in the final reconfiguration. Transition between climbing and dawn-release is one taught camera swipe, inside word-count. One hinge: the causal link “because shadows were pooled, dawn gains texture” is asserted more than demonstrated, keeping this just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: releasing the wing crystallizes her new stance of porousness, reweighting the premise with undeniable cost—she forfeits the compass that kept her separate from the stories. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sunrise patterns and color-shifts tighten toward the final flash. Orientation is clear by line 8; the single shard rotates gracefully. Only nit: “quietly explosive truth” is named, not dramatized in-scene, slightly blunting causality at the pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: pouring measured sorrow as fertiliser reweights the entire archive system and her job. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of dream-images and sorrow-vials tighten until moon-lit bark “hums.” Causality is present but lyrically elliptical; cost is felt in the act of surrendering the sealed grief, foreclosing her former neutral custodianship.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each lyrical layer thickens until the mica window spins sonic threads into visible dawn. Orientation is swift—greenhouse, endless night, 700-year dusk—taught by the first 80 words. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the constructed sunrise breaks, the realm shudders, and the price—Elara’s dispersal reversed—is felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a clean Charged Poise: the invitation’s relocation reweights the premise (error becomes doorway) and Elias’s solitude is now elective, not imposed. Causal chain holds—because he once received a mis-addressed letter he now repeats the error—though the moment the woman reads is summarized, not shown, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of “noticing → planting → sharing” tightens through sensory callbacks (anise scent reappears in pudding). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—first harvest eaten with horn spoons—where the lost bakery is conceptually repriced as communal vigilance. Cost is unmistakable: relic bread consumed, garden now exposed to city wind. One transition (three-month ellipsis) is cleanly handled; no orientation debt. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: blank slide mirrored in ledger numbers reweights her ministry from salvation to witness with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: escalating density of vanishing frequencies → final cadence shift. Orientation taught by “frost-rimed balustrade” @~40 words, anchors hold. Minor ripple: “the Fading was accelerating” is declarative tell just before climax; could have been shown through a last frequency that collapses mid-sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is the crystalline click of the hidden cylinder finishing its etch; that mechanical snap reweights the night—Mara can now prosecute the lieutenant, her tactical arc complete. The inferred lens is Situational: each repositioning under the pier compresses her stance until the final image (fob heavy with evidence) charges the silence with irrevocable cost. Causality holds: every false-start feint is a therefore that buys angle and cover; no off-stage shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the forest vote approves, her doubt becomes functional compass, cost felt in irrevocable role shift. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of taste/weather imagery tightens to final auroral charge. Orientation is taught early via sensory triangulation, satisfying 120-word anchor; no ambiguity at end. One minor strain: “transition” logic is spoken, not dramatized, but does not rupture causality.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: she forsakes the elevator for the singing tunnel, foreclosing escape with felt cost. Causal lens holds: each beat (child’s question → watermark discovery → lock repair → tunnel) tightens options via because/therefore linkage. No orientation debt; spatial anchors land by line 40. Persistent constraint—broken lock left open—charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the vault’s truth lets the leaves unfurl and reweights the city’s future. Causal linkage holds—map ➜ plates ➜ vault—each step narrowing options. A single lens (Accumulative/Textural) dominates and persists through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bells’ resonance refracted through the iceberg reweights the world’s gray silence with undeniable wonder; cost is felt in Elara’s spent breath and the irreversible completion of the sculpture. Accumulative lens holds throughout—each bell’s tone layers density until the final spectrum suspends time. No orientation debt; spatial and causal anchors are clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the controlled burn converts annihilation into manageable heat, sealing fear-box in frost while ashes cool. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each repetition of “miniaturize…containing chaos” tightens cadence until the final reconfiguration. Cost is legible in twelve sacrificed rows and the cracked dome. One micro-turn—the decision to burn rather than shield—is cleanly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the courtyard’s communal exhale reweights the stake with undeniable social cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds, but the locket’s arrival is pure chance and the Orientation Test is waived since the disorienting swirl of voices pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each dance layer adds density until “The Major Lift” re-weights the archive from prison to library. Pattern is taught by the second paragraph and closure crystallizes in the vault’s sigh—undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; space/time are anchored in the first 50 words. One tighten: dice roll → choreography → vault opens; no causal reversals needed under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the whale’s death gifts her the meadow flowers, rewriting absence into migration. Causal chain—whale song → fissure → coffee divination → salt vault → recovery—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, each beat adding density rather than because/therefore turns. Orientation is clear by word 60; gravity oddity is taught early and paid off in the “gravity-neutral hollow.” Persistent constraint: the chamber’s logic now shadows her nightly rounds, cost felt in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silence she maps becomes a palpable weight tucked into her sleeve, reconfiguring future threat into contained stillness with conceptual cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of hush increases until it crystallizes; causality is implied via lyrical accretion rather than because/therefore linkage, coherent under this lens. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s name set in mortar rewrites the building’s grammar and her place in it, cost paid by permanent ontological complicity. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each meteor shower and seal impression layers density until the final copper press reweights the stake. Orientation is clean by 120 words; causality remains coherent under “agreed-upon lies” logic. No meaningful artifact touches the final image; the bricks’ sigh is legible payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each crystalline note layers density until the garden itself becomes the archive, a resonant reconfiguration that isolates sorrow inside silver petals. Dawn’s arrival supplies the single cadence shift; cost is legible in the crumbling shell and the flowers’ permanent glow. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara walks toward light carrying new weight—felt, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she weeps while the wax-sealed lie rolls away, foreclosing her future with a felt, visible cost. Causal chain holds—obsidian key pressed into wax literally “closes” the wound she has spent the story opening. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: stalactite drip cadence tightens into the faster rhythm at the end, reweighting stakes without a causal twist. Setup anchors who/where by 80 words; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the Echoed Ones shift from victims to seeds, reweighting the premise with undeniable social cost. Causal lens holds: shell angle → voices → decision to revere rather than exploit. Progressive disclosure is the because-chain engine. Cost is legible in the final line—“echo became choice, not capture”—which forecloses the Archivists’ original use. Minor orientation waiver: starlight & nexus are taught by 120 words and serve the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine holds: because Elara decodes the dreams, she confronts the captain; because she names the child, the ghost yields; therefore she vows to write. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the melted globe reweighted from “wreckage” to “holy cradle”—with visible conceptual cost: the historical lie will be dismantled, exposing the town’s myth of greed. Orientation is clear by line 30; no lens ambiguity. The single shard structure (continuous shrine scene) fits 600–800 word default. A hairline slip: the final line “the glacier groaned” is a touch convenient, not earned by her choice, so the cost feels 90 % pure, not 100.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the whispering stones dry, fireflies dim, and Kaelen realizes appreciation itself is repair. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (net grids, moon paths, firefly pulses) tightens until the final whistle syncs them. Cost is legible—“she tied off the final knot with a satisfaction that needed no witness”—a staked claim that costs her the night’s light. Orientation anchored by 90 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal spine is clean: because she finds shredded letters, therefore she rebuilds them, therefore she discovers the stillpoint mechanism, therefore she can recalibrate the diamond. Each beat tightens her options until the final moment when “the wasteland held its breath.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the protective dome expands, but the price is the settlers’ dependency on science they barely grasp, and Mara’s exile into the next storm. No orientation or lens drift; the sf logic stays internally rigorous.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the cobalt-tinted rain re-prices the prophet’s dawn with ancient shadows, cost legible in Elian’s “complete and therefore perfect” loneliness. Accumulative lens holds—storm density → glass charge → shadow seeding—no causality breaks. Orientation is swift (stormlit observatory by line 2), transitions clean, one deepening beat. Persistent constraint: the glass geometry must be exact or the shadows fail—this shapes the final aerial array.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the jarred past is re-mixed, re-recorded, and physically carried toward the daughter—an irreversible stance shift with felt cost (the loft left feral, the poet abandoning his sanctuary). Causal chain holds: discovery of music box → triggers jar release → creates new artifact → propels departure. Orientation is taught by line 3 (“rotting ladder… coast guard station”) and anchors hold. No lens ambiguity; the ending reweights the premise under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal chain holds without slack: accidental broadcast → hunters track harmonic signature → cannot outrun → must sing calibrated forgiveness → shadows liquefy into sunset. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt toll—her shaking body and glowing key lock in the price—under a stable Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: moon-aligned iron, rain memory, and七年 patience converge into a six-minute spectral bridge. Closure is a Charged Poise: the viaduct dissolves, the sanctuary recedes, and the map becomes history—cost legible in the act of walking away. Causality is not事件-to-事件 but pattern-to-pattern; the final image reweights the premise that freedom is seized only by those who wait. No orientation debt; basalt, ice, and midnight are anchored by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: drought rain → body revealed → Elias dead → Maya discovers cover-up → she claims verdict. Closure is a decisive conceptual reprice: the lantern’s weight becomes her ethical authority, cost legible in the pulse-like reverberation. One tight shard, no orientation debt. Minor slack: transit-authority villainy is reported, not dramatized, but the satchel reports are physically handled, keeping causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands clean: the serial-number reveal is a conceptual repricing that flips the moral ledger and costs Elias his complacency. Causal chain holds—storm light → inscription → decision to expose—though the repairman functions more as oracle than agent. One transition (shop to future plan) is allowed and legible; orientation is anchored by word 60. No meaningful tightening after the reveal; pressure plateaus instead of spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the bell rings in unheard dimensions and Kip’s isolation becomes the very proof of success. The causal chain (algorithm → kaleidoscope → transliteration → snapped arrow → resonance) is tight; cost is the shattering of the decoder and the eternal unheard status. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern intensifies until meaning flips.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands: the crew is alive, the lie exposed, the archive’s rule-set repriced. Causal chain holds—patch photo → numeric map → server raid—though the beat where she “broadcast the truth through recurring numbers” is elided; we’re told it worked rather than watching tactical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: because she studies the mirrors, therefore she sees the third path; because she aligns them, the crystal reconstitutes and projects a solution that stops the ice. Closure is a Decisive Change—ice ceases groaning, nomads ascend—paid for by the crystal’s warmth in her palm and the shadows’ visible strain. Cost is legible in the final line: “the weighted breath… finally released,” a bodily price tied to the act. No teleporting props or unmotivated knowledge leaps; mirror mechanics are taught on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the protagonist’s stance toward her own ending is reweighted by the parasol’s warmth and the heard exhalation, with conceptual cost legible under the Accumulative lens; drive pattern holds, and the single transition from marina to interior shift is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens: pattern of autumnal stripping → amber light → burned edge → rootstock metaphor tightens once, landing in Charged Poise. Orientation is clean within 50 words; causality is interior but legible—each image accrues until the final hand-to-earth beat reweights the premise with felt cost (she forgoes reunion, accepts solitary fermentation). No teleporting props; the letter fragment tracks cleanly from pocket to palm to soil. Persistent constraint: the midnight bus will not return, and she chooses not to wait—cost is on-page in the closing gait.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of attention, density, and cadence tightens until the closing image reweights the stake. Closure = Charged Poise: the parapet accepts the burden, the clearing vanishes, pavilion gains harmonic—cost legible, path foreclosed. Orientation anchored by word 75; no causality breaks. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    The accumulative lens is declared early and holds: each donated photograph thickens the communal spiral, tightening emotional density until the equinox display reconfigures the town’s self-image. Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara walks away, map case empty, leaving the living pattern behind—cost is visible in the emptied case and harvested field.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crystal left atop the moss-coated dictionary reweights the premise—language is now biologic, preservation is surrender. Cost is conceptual (she relinquishes voice), but not viscerally felt; the lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds. Orientation is swift; no因果 breaks. One cap: the tightening beat (crystal placement) is single, not compounded. Clean, but emotional cost remains oblique, holding it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each spiral inward thickens the fog of memory-objects until the final chalk marks become unreadable, a clean Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are deliberately blurred but taught early via “junkyard prophet” and crystalline fog garden; the payoff at closure justifies the delay. Causality is present only as iterative erasure, yet the pattern is legible and reweights meaning: every prior arrow now points to a man who will forever redraw them. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—he loses the very map he must remake—so closure lands with felt price under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the camera captures a moonlit instant that contains eternity while the observatory transcends physical tremor—cost is the literal disappearance of Elara. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds: leaf-sound → clock sync → perceptual lift-off, each beat adding density rather than because/therefore chains. Orientation anchors (lunar dome, 40-year tenure, quake) land within 120 words. One faint wobble: the “escape velocity” metaphor is named late, not taught early, but pattern pays off at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the shard transferred from weapon to relic, father-daughter stance crystallized with undeniable cost. Causal chain is tight—Elena’s mundane hymn enables the lucid moment that permits the transfer. Accum/Textural lens holds: sensory density (ozone storm, IV clicks) reweights the stake without external plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the orrery’s reversal re-opens the fold, the custodian’s shadow returns, and Elara comprehends the rescue-as-seal. Causality is causal-chain: key → rewound planets → loop-walk → rupture, each step because/therefore. One minor scaffold—”she had discovered” summarizes method instead of dramatizing the breakthrough—but the ending image of noon persisting in a pocket reconfigures stakes with visible cost: eternal guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena steps through the “cleft” she once denied, now bearing the cost of permanent worldview fracture and the duty to guide both children. The hedge-maze constellation image crystallizes options without tidy explanation. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory layer (iron, lilac, yew, tooth) reweights the stake until the dawn-gold thorns lock the new constellation in place.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative lens holds: each polished shard adds reflective density until the pearl forms a charged poise that reweights exile into stewardship. The spiral placement sequence is the causal spine; memories are cued by tactile glass, keeping reflection anchored. Closure image—the cooling pearl—carries undeniable conceptual cost: she forever forsakes ignition. Orientation is taught by mist and drip within 120 words; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the third sentence and held to the last line: pattern of thaw-drip-pool-absorb reconfigures meaning rather than plot. Closure is a Charged Poise—the pendant’s shift from jewelry to “marker in a private cartography” reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost. No orientation debt; anchor (who/where/when) is clear by line 4. Causality remains intact because the accrual of moss, water, and silence is the causality.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.4)
    Closure achieves a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara steps into witness—but the causal chain is loose: the shell’s glow is unmotivated and the ceremony has no tangible price. “Moving against the current” is thematic echo, not a because/therefore driver; stakes never tighten, only widen. Orientation holds, yet the lens is Accumulative/Textural and the text misses the single pattern-break that would make the final image feel costly. Without a foreclosed path, the ending is beautiful but not inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—wisteria canopy, humming chronometer, mint-and-magic scent layering—and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the vine’s explosive fruiting reweights the village’s relationship to land under honey-colored light. Causality is lyric rather than mechanical, but the final image carries undeniable conceptual cost—the people wake crying with memories they never learned, proving the breach healed. Orientation is swift (who/where/when inside 60 words), transitions are seamless, and the one meaningful tightening—the moon locking into place—clicks audibly in the sternum. No plot amnesia or soft resets; the land’s exhale after thirty years of silence is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the plate now pulses with “internal topography,” foreclosing any need to leave the crater. Causality holds—because she waited, sealed starlight into her own rhythm, the map awakens. Cost is legible in the final sentence: “the compass point that points inward,” accepting perpetual exile. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern intensifies until the final image reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal linkage holds: quake → loss of echo → frozen timer → reflection mapping → reverse-engineered gear cut → voice restored. Orientation is clean by line 8; lens stays causal; closure lands with audible, conceptual cost (cavern’s exhale + Elias’s smile). One meaningful tightening: the violet-oblique beam reveals the decisive escapement crack.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: she extinguishes the lamp, holding the rosary of weights while dawn erases starlight, a reconfiguration that makes her eternal servitude legible. The cost is atmospheric, not personal; because the story never risks her losing the role or fracturing under it, the beat feels aesthetic rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative lens: each stroke of the chisel thickens the pattern “here / gone / transformed.” The kettle’s rising whistle and the sliding rain droplets act like metronomic beats that tighten until the half-finished handle becomes the resonant reconfiguration—an Earned Stasis where grief is not solved but housed. Causality is interior and lyric yet legible: because the wood drank sawdust and roars, therefore it can now hold boiling water without burning. Cost is visible in the final image: unfinished handle + cooling tea = practical immortality paid for by permanent absence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a textbook Charged Poise: the instant Mara and ghost swap solidity, the timeline re-weights and the carousel restarts, undeniable conceptual cost on the page. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—spiral images, sound-fragments, and regret-crystals layer until the cadence shift at the mirror charges meaning. No orientation debt; who/where taught by line 3, pattern of elision taught early and paid off. Minor waver: “chronologically confused” is asserted more than demonstrated in causal beats, a hairline slip that keeps it from 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the terminal’s grammar of departure is permanently rewritten into sustenance, cost legible in the solitary dawn vigil. Accumulative lens holds—each salvage action layers density until the cadence shift of dripping hydroponic rails. Orientation is anchored by 120 words; no spatial drift. One causal hinge could be sharper: the carnival’s auxiliary pumps are mentioned only once, yet become the critical bypass—slight convenience tax.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: the textural repetitions of “glacial hush” and “crystal whispering” tighten into the final Charged Poise where brass meets quartz. Orientation anchors within 120 words; closure lands with conceptual cost—her emptied hands—though the causal chain is thin (no obstacle between gate and forecourt). Still, the rule-set is consistent and the final image reweights prior motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the sundial reweights all prior “failure” as deliberate training; cost is the years lost, made legible in the lock-keeper’s cottage dust. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each lie layers density until pattern flips meaning. Orientation anchored by word 60 (“rusted barge prow”), no penalty. One transition (barge→cottage) cleanly cued by walking the canal bank.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds: because Elias needs the storm-calming knot, he decodes → the glass flares → the weavers transfer → he reties. One meaningful tightening: the final knot’s “negative space” revelation forecloses the option of ever learning it again from a living master. Closure is Charged Poise: Elias walks away carrying an unshareable seed, the cost legible in “only when shared with the right apprentice.” No orientation drift; snow, fog, and dock stay spatially tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of weaving absence into presence tightens once when the projected Duchess flickers and he writes faster; closure lands as Charged Poise—bracelet pulse re-weights the empty garden. Thread prop and harbor clock are cleanly tracked; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in the final image: “pulse…proof that…connection endured” forecloses amnesia. Minor slip: single-sentence risk of abstract thesis (“geography of healing required…”) but immediately grounded in physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a vivid Resonant Reconfiguration: the chick’s raw note re-tunes the brass world, re-weighting extinction vs possibility with felt cost (Elian on knees, palace drips water not oil). Causal chain holds: egg discovery → assembly → circuit → hatch → acoustic resonance. Orientation anchors within first 120 words (who, where, when). One meaningful tightening only, sufficient under Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint lands: iron world remains, yet sound palette shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: kelp-and-coin ritual deepens pattern until closure reweights scars as “singing.”  The orientation anchor (who/where/when) is clear by 80 words, but the medical impossibility of kelp-to-skin graft is never flagged as surreal rule-shift; because the closure beat depends on that graft “taking,” the causality wobbles under literal reading.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story tightens via rising image-density (mica-breadcrumbs → dry pipes → constellation alignment) that reweights the stake from “curiosity” to “irrevocable return of memory.” Closure lands as Charged Poise: the memories visibly crystallize and the geese resume, reconfiguring the city’s future while Elara walks away lighter yet winter-bound. Cost is legible in the final line—“whispered possibility” now carries the weight of civic reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gear’s lantern–not–key re-prices every prior cycle of fire. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of petals, sonar echoes, gear rotations tighten until the cadence shifts to lullaby. The −0.3 bump is the slight causal gap between “she understood” and the physical act that seals the new pattern; the cost is legible but could be one beat sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias sees grief as connective mesh, reconfiguring his task from carving names to tracing links. Ribbon-as-measuring-tape motif is taught early and recurrent; causal chain (grandmother’s injunction → retrace grooves → tie ribbon) holds. Orientation clear within 120 words. However, escalation is textural, not causal: successive poem quotes accumulate mood but do not tighten stakes; no option is foreclosed or price exacted on Elias’s time, safety, or reputation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The因果 lens is lucid: because tide → tower flex → time slip → Elias adjusts. The rake-handle ledger pays off as the map that lets him calibrate the pendulum during the four-second pause; the moment the screw turns we see a decisive change with measurable cost—“the gears meshing with a sigh that sounded almost like relief.” No teleporting props or retro-patching; every object is introduced and reused inside the 800-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cemetery blueprint reweights every prior rose she planted, making her labor an acoustic instrument. Causal chain holds—tapestry selvage → coordinates → acoustic garden—without gaps. Orientation clock starts at word 5; no penalty. Cost is conceptual (she must keep gardening the grief-machine) but felt through the final “listen differently,” satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lake’s crack reframes the written paragraphs into living seeds, cost felt in the irreversible ink and the foregone alternative futures. Causal lens holds: each paragraph narrowed possibility until only sustainable adaptation remains. Orientation clean; spire/lake anchors given by line 12. Only hairline slip: “mathematically inevitable cycles” slightly abstracts the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: each Tuesday lyric layers density until the dust-paragraphs crystallize, a resonant reconfiguration that costs the pirate signal its life and Elias his anonymity. Causality is lyric rather than plot, but the pattern is taught early and the final image (“each breath a new chapter”) pays off with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/lyric lens holds: spiral of ash deliveries intensifies meaning rather than plot reversals. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—mask abandoned in stillness reweights all prior ash acts as both preservation and farewell; cost is legible in the stopped chair and bleeding cheek. Orientation taught by second sentence; no teleport props. One causal micro-turn: final handful converts gallery into reverse-photograph, crystallizing emotion. No meaningful escalation cap triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: discovery of cog → agonize → decision to excavate truth underground, each beat tightening options. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—he commits to a war of memory, papers left to flood, stakes sharpened. Orientation anchored by word 80 via salt-stiff sleeve and conduit taste; no penalty. One causal gap: councils’ power to confiscate/execute is asserted but not shown or foreshadowed in scene, a minor external stakes fuzz.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of deliberate absence taught early (“subtracting noise”) and tightened when each student damps a string. Closure is a Charged Poise—the braided silence reweights stakes without forced unity. Cost is legible in the refugee’s “humility rather than demand” and the miner’s daughter’s trembling omission. One causality hairline: we never see how the rosette’s geometry translates to playable technique, only that it “denotes the method.”

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse transformed into living trellis and Mara’s consciousness cleared, both legible before/after. The eclipse radiation and seed mechanics are taught early; causality stretches but stays consistent within lyric accordion compression. One transition—from interior purge to exterior planting—reads fluid. Cost is felt in the “quiet, cleared” mind and the impending political exposure at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: riddle → recovered bee → revelation of dreaming drones → sealed box preserves wonder. Each step is legible, with a final Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes blackout as birth. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, yet the city’s grinding tomorrow stays visible, satisfying closure under Causal lens. Only minor drag: the bee’s “harmonic resonance” moment borders convenient magic, not fully prepped.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the moment she sets the orris root against the house, the cottage’s interior glows “newly awakened and watching,” reweighting the premise from observation to mutual recognition with visible cost—she leaves the scene altered, fence posts already continuing their slow migration. The accumulative/textural lens holds: every displaced object is a beat that thickens pattern until the crystalline “shard of hush” catalyzes the reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a crisp Conceptual Repricing: shattering the ampoule through the hairline fissure rewrites the garden’s epistemic rule-set from binary obedience to “gradient, spectrum, mercy with edges.” Causal chain is intact: reveal caretaker suicide → doubt → ampoule → crack → root spiral; each beat narrows options until the final image of bioluminescent question-marks. Accumulated lyric density teaches its pattern early and lands undeniable cost—“the dome did not collapse; it breathed.” Drive lens (Hybrid sliding to Accumulative) holds cleanly through the charged poise ending.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece teaches its Accumulative/Textural lens early—steps, breath, dice, light—and lands a Conceptual Repricing: the asymmetrical die makes the perfect system spall open, delivering the exact texture she chased. Orientation is deliberately disorienting but pays off at closure when the brass grain becomes the exit, satisfying the waiver; no caps apply. Causality holds: because she folds infinity into its own observer-dependent proof, the staircase ejects her; the chipped imperfection is the persistent constraint that shapes the final tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the greenhouse walls now hold “thirty-seven words for kindness,” dawn competes with industrial orange, and Maya’s vigil ends with the city re-seen as breathing—not broken. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each glyph adds density until the atmosphere itself is repriced. Causality is interior but legible—because she stays awake, because she paints, the air is scarred with mercy. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artisanal detail layers density until the bread-map epiphany reweights the stake. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the emerald lens magnifying “black rivers devouring woven rivers” makes the cost of erasure undeniable. Orientation is secure within 120 words; the grotto, waterfall roar, and isolation clock are anchored early. One causality wobble: the beekeeper’s exit is declared retroactively rather than dramatized, softening the inciting squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a clear Decisive Change: the beam reverses, erasing her fatal chronology and leaving the rewritten stone. Causal chain—yoyo mechanics decoded → stone keyed → lens reversed → fate unwritten—holds without gaps. Cost is visible in her corporeal erasure and the inscription’s mutation; the lighthouse resumes without her, fate intact for the world.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a clean Decisive Change: confession strips the luminance, cracked mirror signals cost, Earned Stasis achieved. Dream-logic lens is taught early and held; paradoxical notes act as because/therefore triggers. Anchor who/where lands within 120 words with deliberate disorientation that pays off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each strike layers density until the sky itself becomes a scored surface. Closure is a Charged Poise—storm dubbed, orchard singing, prophet poised for next blue hour—cost legible in the dissipating resonance. Orientation (who/where/when) is anchored within 60 words; no causality breaks. Persistent constraint: the floating orchard’s survival depends on her continuous music, a price shaping every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing: the city moves, the lens shifts from cartography to participation, and the cost is the irreversible loss of outsider stance. Pattern language is taught early (Fibonacci whistle ↔ shell etchings) and pays off in the rupture beat. Orientation is anchored by word 85; no debt applied.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain holds: petal drop → obligation transfers → decision to publish while framing the mayor’s guilt as love. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station-to-memorial plan and the letter against her heart crystallize a new public story with felt civic cost. One causality micro-gap: the diary’s “final bloom” rule is stated but not sourced in any on-page botanic evidence, a hairline warp that keeps it just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the drawbridge lowering reconfigures city/isolation while her soaked body carries felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each submerged artifact thickens the pattern of absence until the ink-sealed note crystallizes it. Orientation is anchored by word 60; no causality breaks. One minor scaffold: “she will return tomorrow” is future-telling that slightly softens the final image’s permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    The text turns on one cogent discovery: micro-scoring on the stamp implies three authentic, not forged, deeds. Because this evidence is handled on-page, the alternative hypothesis tightens into certainty without the need for off-stage rescue. Closure is delivered via CR (Conceptual Repricing): ownership can survive flooding only as a splintered truth, a shift that carries conceptual weight and is sealed by the final stamp impression. Only minor slack: the blackout is stated to end yet Elias never reacts to regained power—no re-penalization, but a missed beat to reinforce cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira becomes the light she has released, a Charged Poise that reweights every prior fold. Causal chain holds—each gem-crane is earned by decades of polishing and the final dispersal is irreversible. The “descend while ascend” rule is taught early, paid off in the spiral staircase image of the ending. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain holds: surge → reboot window → perturbation hunt → valley vector → escape. Closure is a Charged Poise: she vanishes carrying the “weight of tomorrow,” a conceptual cost that reweights the premise (grief becomes map). Orientation clear by 60 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the observatory’s harmonic wash re-weights "belonging" from an external quest to an internal confirmation, cost paid in the suspended dusk and the irreversible slotting of the chip. Causality is accumulative/textural—each sensory layer intensifies the tonal field rather than forcing plot turns—yet the final image crystallizes options with undeniable pressure. Orientation is clean by line 5; no lens ambiguity. The pilgrim’s off-stage presence is an ellipsis that complicates rather than resolves, satisfying situational coincidence rules.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the watch hand punctuates a row of reclaimed truths, reweighting Elias’s crimes with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal lens holds throughout—each carving discovered tightens his obligation. Orientation is secure within 120 words. The sole slack is the off-page future meeting; consequences are legible but not yet paid, keeping the score below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scout freed, the brass passed forward, the moon withdrawing its witness—cost felt in the negotiator’s solitary heartbeat count. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each image (lantern pendulum, tide-ebb moon, cold brass) tightens the same stake—can history be unweighted? One transition (both parties retreat) is legible; orientation is clear by 80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: relinquishing the compass and accepting terrestrial limits reweights the entire journey. Causal chain holds—utility-pole navigation grows as star-trust collapses, final choice directly springs from that substitution. Cost is legible in the discarded talisman and the vow not to look up tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lake rewrites her synapses, foreclosing the blank-slate escape with visible cost (“tears falling…for the capacity to finally recognize”). Causal chain—baseball → coordinates → maze → dissolving key → lake rewrite—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 60 (hospital sheets). One micro-drag: the “three days” transit is summarized, but the final image reweights all prior material, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (sap-glow, spice-scent, sister’s voice) deepens the stake until the closing image crystallizes a permanent transformation; fortune-cookie cue anchors causality, and the orchard’s stasis becomes the exact price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the saucer fills with star-mirroring dew—Conceptual Repricing that reweights the entire quest from retrieval to sanctification. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the nine months return as sensory crystalline fragments, not exposition. The final image carries unmistakable cost: she descends carrying forgiveness “heavy as a stone,” foreclosing any future attempt to steal time back.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the stitched mirror releases humanity’s shadow at undeniable conceptual cost—Elias disappears, ship left empty. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: each photograph-dissolve tightens the cadence until grief becomes filament. Orientation triple-anchor (who/where/when) delivered by sentence two; disorientation waiver not needed. Persistent constraint: gravity that responds to emotional density shapes every physical tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the ash burial is an Earned Stasis with conceptual cost, reweighting “philanthropy” as self-sacrifice. Pattern is Accumulative/Textural; causal glue is light but coherent, taught early by the synchrony motif and held to the final light-poem.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: blackout → frozen gears → opportunity → coded sundial realignment → future misdirection. Closure lands as Decisive Change: the sundial’s shadow will soon point insurgents toward the armory, an irreversible tactical pivot. Cost is visible in the empty quill holder and Elara’s vanishing silhouette—she forfeits status and safety. Orientation is anchored by twilight, western parapets, and arrow slit before word 120; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure is a vivid CR: the herder’s consciousness scatters, permanently charging the stones with friction—cost undeniable. Causal chain holds: promise → decades of rock math → field activation → self-sacrifice. Orientation is sketchy until ~130 words (“Now he navigated…”), but the delay serves the later payoff, so no penalty. One minor telegraph: the sled-stopping “binding words” appear only at the instant they work, yet the beat still reads as earned ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: re-sealing the manuscript reverses the inheritance, turning silence into relay. Lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of developing/negative/positive charges meaning without causal reversal. Orientation anchors by word 80; no teleporting props. One meaningful deepening at the lightning reveal suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal lens holds: duel → shadow measurement → coordinate discovery → alliance re-forged, each beat because/therefore. The unfinished sundial as cipher is set up in paragraph four and paid off in the needle alignment; closure is the visible “single shared purpose” exiting the atrium. Orientation is secure inside 120 words; no teleporting props. Cost is present but generalized (“previous philosophical disagreement”), not dramatized on this page, blocking 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the image of seeds and microfilm under a clearing moon reweights the stake with undeniable conceptual cost. Causal chain is light—mostly declarative—but the accumulative pattern (books → garden → knowledge) holds. Orientation is clean by word 60. The ending’s resonance just exceeds the soft middle where stakes are restated more than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station locks into the sky-eye, the clock ticks three lost years, cost is undeniable. Causal chain holds—each piano note → magnetic pulse → micro-correction; film frame 144 → Morse → coordinate—every beat advances drift correction. Orientation is taught lyrically yet anchors (who, where, stakes) by sentence two; no disorientation debt. One hairline slip: the restart trigger of the clock is inferred rather than shown in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tree stands, storm breaks, and Elara records exact bioluminescence—an undeniable conceptual cost (“memories not yet lived”) that re-weights the entire premise. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory stratum (pollen, mineral veins, songs, rain) thickens until the final cadence crystallizes options. Orientation anchored by word 60; no lens ambiguity. Persistent constraint—the luminous doubt—shapes every tactic and survives the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each return of the compass/lace tightens the emotional pattern until the “forgiveness” knot reweights the stake; the final bonsai placement is a Charged Poise with felt cost.

Orientation is immediate (“beneath the ancient archway… merchant city of Vel Moris”), and the lens holds without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara becomes both receiver and sender, transformed but not rescued. The temple’s logic holds—instinct must be overridden—and cost is legible in her neural rewiring and enduring grief. Causal chain is tight: signal → memory → test → surrender → passage. The “gathered hush” evolves from atmosphere to active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elias rewrites the lighthouse’s mythos by escaping it, transforming “the boy who cried wolf’s son” into an untraceable rumor. The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through layered impossibilities and narrative weight—and the ending crystallizes this with undeniable cost: the warden’s dead bodies remain undiscovered because no one believes a wolf’s son could lie silently. Every beat tightens around the central paradox, and the copperlight-to-starless-dark cadence shift reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the greenhouse empties, stars appear, and Julian’s dual emotion crystallizes the before/after. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds density through recurring images (bead, veil, frost) that culminate in a decisive shift. Cost is legible: Eira’s dissolution, the orchard’s withering, Julian’s inherited guilt transformed. Every beat tightens around the central stake with no causal breaks or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building density through recurring motifs—sleepwalking paths, orchid solace, the shifting plate—until the final stitch triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the canyon breathes again, not through repair but reconfiguration. Cost is legible in Maren’s bleeding fingers and the irreversible merging of illustration with stone; the bridge becomes real only because she pays with arterial ink. The pattern is taught early (“overlapping sleepwalking paths”) and pays off precisely at closure, with no causality breaks or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the rebuilt sundial doesn’t tell civic time but measures “the duration between exile and return,” crystallizing a new temporal covenant. Cost is legible in the final image—Elara’s prayer grown from “this calcium, this patient architecture of bone and branch”—and the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: density builds through spiraling wandering, fragment collection, and root-bone symbiosis until the shadow aligns. The pattern is taught early (“skeletal architecture,” “roots snake between bones”) and pays off without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: surface mail’s subversive power is reweighted through Kael’s successful decoding, with cost legible in the ephemeral chalk grid and the arcade’s “shared obsolescence.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density builds via sensory layering (amber light, CRT glow, chalk dust), culminating in a cadence shift at dawn’s full break. Orientation is clear by line 3; every beat tightens pressure toward the drone’s arrival. The final image crystallizes stakes without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira’s stitched map crystallizes options, the captain grasps the truth, and the empire’s survival hinges on adjacent possibilities now made actionable—all with palpable cost (her isolation, the candle’s vigil). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies via stitch-flame-silence triangulation until the armory displacement breaks the conspiracy’s code. Orientation is immediate (“Mira worked her needle… observatory dome”), and the tightening—three days before frost—narrows stakes without coincidence. Cost is legible in the sealed thread and unbroken silence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara occupies the suspended instant, speaks unsent words, and dissolves letters into condensation—altering nothing in linear time but reconfiguring meaning and healing absence through witnessed presence. Cost is legible in her weeping, the shard’s sacrifice, and the spirits’ binding song. Orientation is anchored by line 3 (“cabin window,” “mangrove labyrinth”), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of image (letters, shard, condensation, moonlight) intensifies toward a cadence shift at the clearing. The gargoyle shard’s purpose and lunar healing are established early and paid off precisely at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered inscriptions on the cast, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—“the notes... are not stains but seeds.” Closure lands via Charged Poise: Mara’s vigil crystallizes communal trauma into ritual, with cost legible in her “lotus-hearted ache.” Orientation is immediate (“mist-clad atrium,” “Solomon Islands field hospital”), and the anesthetic timeframe tightens focus without disorientation. Every shard of text on the cast deepens the central stake: survival as encrypted testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara’s stance crystallizes under the lens of Accumulative/Textural drive—each light-stroke intensifies the fog-gallery until past joy materializes, proving she remains “sensitive.” Cost is legible in the “years of ash” and shuttered heart now reopened with vulnerability. The fresco fragment and knowledge network pay off cohesively; the daydream frame taught early resolves via sunbeam completing exposure. Orientation anchors instantly (“Mara woke… ruined orchard”), and causality flows through pattern accumulation, not forced turns.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through sensory layering until the final Charged Poise crystallizes Elena’s new stance. Closure is achieved via Conceptual Repricing: restoration is redefined as generative rather than corrective, with tangible cost—the abandonment of certainty, symbolized by leaving the nickel behind. The garden’s acoustic logic remains consistent, and the nested awakenings escalate coherently. The only minor flaw: the initial “question” remains too vague, slightly weakening the causality of the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a Causal lens: Elias’s planting leads to the gathering, which triggers the warp, which enables escape—but at the cost of his capture. Orientation is immediate and vivid. The closure is a Charged Poise: Elias stands alone, smiling, as the luna moth carries coordinates forward—cost is visible (his arrest) and conceptual (the system’s failure to tax his mind). Every beat tightens options until the decisive collapse of the distortion field.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the reef rewrites war’s legacy through organic treaty-blossoms, with visible cost—Elara’s bones fused to mother-of-pearl, her postcard dissolved. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds via recurring motifs (shell, song, petals) until the final image reweights everything. Cost is legible in “her pain... dissolved into nutrients,” and the human divers’ discovery confirms irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the caretaker endures, foreclosing hope of permanence but sustaining remembrance through sacrifice. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds via sensory motifs (cloud-mist, glass orchids, violet nostalgia) until the bamboo’s crack refracts song into light. Cost is legible in the crumbling tube and lingering regret. The pattern is taught early (“phonetic vibrations of names no longer spoken”) and pays off in the luminous echo that temporarily reverses entropy.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Charged Poise crystallizes when Julian steps into the heptagon, making reconciliation possible but not guaranteed. The extinct languages’ harmony reweights silence as communal failure, not personal flaw, with conceptual cost legible in the “coffin for meaning” imagery. Causal lens holds: every beat flows from Elara’s goal to unsnarl grief, narrowing options until only the symphony of truth remains. The live clock (“before dawn”) tightens pressure without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a masterful Earned Stasis: Elias chooses restraint over efficiency, preserving a centuries-old failsafe that sacrifices spectacle for survival. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through sensory density (sulfur breath, clinking chain, resin traces) until the final image reweights all prior detail. Cost is legible: he hides his work, forgoes recognition, and bears the “conspiracy of kindness” alone. Every beat tightens around the central tension between progress and mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s stance crystallizes in releasing the meteorite, foreclosing reinvention with visible emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—dust motes, rotting books, and pigeon wings accrue meaning until the final spiral reweights everything.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara becomes the threshold, stepping into the maze with weather codes as liturgical guide. The cost is conceptual—accepting perpetual distance between losing and finding—and legible in the final image of cornstalks as “invitations” to holy separation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spirals in grain, barometric notations, and prismatic refractions build density until alignment crystallizes meaning. No causality breaks; the logbook’s late reveal is earned by prior sensory groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, where pattern density (starlight, bioluminescence, breath) intensifies toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: belonging as resonance, not location. Anchors (who: Elara; where: underwater facility; when: pre-dawn) are clear by line 30. The closure—a Charged Poise where Elara ascends with internalized rhythm—is earned through synchronized action and carries conceptual cost: the phantom’s dissolution, the facility’s return to dormancy. Every beat accumulates toward this reweighting, with no causal breaks or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through recurring images (seeds, glass, missing pieces) until the final Conceptual Repricing: paths disappear so new ones may emerge. Closure lands via Charged Poise—Elara accepts incompleteness as generative, with cost felt in the “jagged absences” and “comfortable sadness.” The migrating bird’s final seed reframes memory as ongoing inquiry, not resolution. All beats cohere, and the iridescent cave’s temporal distortion justifies the reflective mode without sacrificing causality.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the woman’s altered route and Kael’s bow crystallize options reconfigured by orchestrated serendipity, with conceptual cost (his anonymity, her unknowing agency). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—the tidal arcade’s sensory density intensifies until the music box triggers a cascade of resonant reconfigurations. Anchors (who, where, when) are clear by line 3; the pattern of “calculated wilderness” is taught early and pays off in the final image. Cost is legible: Kael’s art requires erasure of his own hand, leaving only architecture and tide as witnesses.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with density escalating through sensory and symbolic layering until the climactic inscription reweights memory as cosmic law. Orientation is immediate (“twilight garden under stars”), and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis—is decisive: Kaelin becomes a living archive, foreclosing human return with visible cost (her body rewritten, alarms triggered). The final image crystallizes options: she is now part of the garden’s ecology, not its visitor. Every beat tightens around the central act of writing, with no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: Elias reweights his life’s labor through the prism of light and water, recognizing meaning in fracture and persistence.

    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marcus sits in silence, having burned his tools, with the dome’s hush now “breathable and honest”—a clear before/after marked by visible cost (destruction of scripts, loss of control). The causal chain is tight: argument → epiphany → descent → surrender → recognition → renunciation. The drive lens is Causal, held throughout: each beat follows because/therefore logic (e.g., he burns the stick *because* he realizes manipulation was the goal, not ethics). The meteor hush motif pays off in the final image, grounding disorientation early and resolving it thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s renunciation of preservation in favor of dignified witnessing crystallizes into a Charged Poise—the grotto emptied of butterflies but filled with absorbed memory.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens: pattern intensifies through resonance between pendant, aurora, shared story, and germination. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elias’s shift from delivery to germination crystallizes in the blooming ridgeway, with clear cost: he relinquishes courier efficiency for sacred slowness. The “fade” motif pays off orientationally and thematically; who/where/when are anchored by line 3. Cost is legible in the final image: “the most precious deliveries were those that took the longest to complete.”

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the car’s transformation from inert object to “reliquary” reweights the story’s metaphysical premise with undeniable cost—the sublimated frost carrying “lavender and regret” makes emotional residue tangible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with frost patterns, quartz hum, and prism light building density until the decisive release.
